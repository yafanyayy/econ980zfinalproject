Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning, I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is Fran Shammo.
Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.
I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.
This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, we reported a loss of $0.71 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include a non-cash pension and benefits charge of $5.6 billion on a pretax basis. This mark-to-market adjustment related to our current year asset return, discount rate and mortality assumption changes in our pension and postretirement plans. This adjustment is in accordance with the accounting policy we adopted a year ago, which requires us to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur and not through the effects of a longer period of time. 
Adjusting for $1.23 per share of nonoperational items, fourth quarter EPS was $0.52, bringing our full year 2011 adjusted EPS to $2.15. The comparable adjusted EPS in 2011 was 2010 was $2.08. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran."

Before we get into the details, let me start with a few summary comments. We finish the year very strong, creating value for our shareholders in 2011 by generating a total return of 18.2% through a combination of stock price appreciation of 12.1% and our dividend payments. Our stock price appreciation outpaced our peers, as well as the S&P, Dow Jones and Broader Indices. For the fifth consecutive year, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase, indicating their confidence in the sustainability of our business model, cash flows and our improving earnings profile into 2012 and beyond.
In 2011, we also made some smart investments for the future growth and improved profitability. While very disciplined in our approach to capital spending, we continue to invest in networks and new technologies, which will be the platform for accelerated growth. 
On the strategic front, we made some moves that will significantly improve our competitive position. These include the acquisitions of Terremark and CloudSwitch in the cloud computing space, several agreements to purchase additional spectrum, joint efforts around innovation with a number of partners including the cable companies and of course, our continued leadership in the rapid development of the 4G LTE ecosystem. 
We also renewed our focus on delivering solutions to customers and the markets we serve by better leveraging our capabilities across all parts of the business, wireless, FiOS, Strategic Services, the cloud, digital media and our global high-speed IP network. Our recently formed Global Enterprise solutions organization will strengthen our ability to provide fully integrated Customer Solutions. 
In addition to making these investments in our future, 2011 was a great year of solid execution. We posted record revenue growth in the fourth quarter, resulting in adjusted revenue growth of 6.2% for the full year, a significant acceleration from just below 2% growth in 2010. In addition to our strong revenue results, our sharp focus on capturing operating efficiencies helped us to mitigate a number of cost pressures, driving an increase to consolidated EBITDA of more than $950 million. 
We also had a strong year in terms of cash generation with $13.5 billion of free cash flow. 2011 was an impressive year on a number of fronts giving us tremendous confidence about our long-term growth prospects.
Now let's turn our attention to the fourth quarter, starting with a few highlights. As I just noted, we had a very strong revenue performance in fourth quarter. Our 7.7% year-over-year growth was easily our highest quarterly growth of the year, and in fact, the highest quarterly growth since the formation of [indiscernible] in 11 years ago. In wireless, we had our best quarter ever in terms of smartphone sales, 4G LTE device sales and customer upgrades, along with the most retail gross adds in the 3 years. We lead the industry in retail postpaid connections and our 1.2 million postpaid net adds this quarter demonstrate that we continue to gain market share. We are by far the market leader in 4G LTE, which is now available in 195 markets covering more than 200 million POPs with increasing customer awareness of its superior speeds, capabilities and new high-quality devices.
4G LTE is really taking hold. In addition to record device sales in the quarter, we are seeing a high-level activity at our innovation centers in Waltham and San Francisco. We currently offer about 20 4G LTE smartphone and data devices and at CES, we announced 2 more mobile hotspots now called Jetpacks. 3 smartphones, 2 for Motorola and one from LG and the Samsung Galaxy Tablet. Clearly, the Verizon 4G LTE network is becoming the destination of choice for consumer and enterprise customers, which is a strong indicator for us looking forward.
In Wireline, our revenue mix continues to improve, with FiOS representing 61% of our consumer revenue and enterprise Strategic Services making up 51% of our Global Enterprise revenue in the quarter. We effectively worked through the numerous challenges of the third quarter to restore Wireline segment profitability. Wireline EBITDA increased to $2.4 billion in the quarter, resulting in a 23.8% EBITDA margin, in line with where we ended the second quarter. Now that we are back on track, I am confident that we will see wireline margin expansion in 2012. 
Again, a strong finish to a solid year, making us very confident about our growth opportunities in 2012 and beyond.
Let's turn to Slide 5 next. Fourth quarter consolidated revenues grew 7.7% year-over-year, resulting in adjusted annual growth rate of 6.2%, solidly within our 2011 guidance range of 4% to 8%. Reported earnings for the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis were a net loss of $0.71 per share due to the significant non-cash charge associated with our pension and postretirement plans. The largest component of this actuarial true-up, which has to do with our discount rate assumption, which was 5.75% at the beginning of the year. At the end of the year, this rate was adjusted to an estimate of the yields of high-quality long-term bonds, which was determined to be 5%. 
Another part of this true-up relates to our return on pension assets. We assume an 8% ROA in the beginning of the year and we came in at 5% for the year. There were also adjustments required based on mortality assumption changes. Excluding non-operational items, we earned $0.52 per share in the quarter, bringing our full year 2011 adjusted EPS result to $2.15, up 3.4% from a comparable $2.08 per share in 2010. 
Coming out of the third quarter, we indicated that we were on track to meet our 2011 earnings guidance of 5% to 8% growth. Earlier this month, I indicated that a very strong December resulted in higher-than-expected wireless device sales, which sets up well for 2012 but resulted in us falling a little short of our full year EPS growth target by $0.02. I would also remind you that our $2.15 adjusted result included $0.05 of negative impact, primarily from the storms in the third quarter. So from my perspective, an adjusted EPS of $2.20 is a more logical starting point for you when considering our 2012 earnings growth potential.
Let's turn next to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 6. Our free cash flow in the fourth quarter and full year was once again a combination of strong cash generation and reduced levels of capital spending. Capital expenditures for the full year totaled $16.2 billion, representing a decrease of 1.3% from 2010. In addition to being lower than the prior year, the $16.2 billion was favorable to our guidance of $16.5 billion. 
Our capital efficiency have improved steadily and was below 15% for the year. With the heavy investments necessary to transform our business largely behind us, we would expect our CapEx to revenue ratio, which is already at a historical low to continue declining based on disciplined capital spending an improving revenue growth trends. 
In Wireless, capital spending in the fourth quarter was $1.8 billion, bringing the full year to $9 billion, an increase of 6.3%. The incremental spending in 2011 was a combination of 3G capacity requirements, driven by the Apple iPhone and the continued rapid expansion of our 4G LTE network. 
In 2012, we will continue to migrate traffic from our 3G EV-DO network to 4G LTE, thereby freeing up 3G capacity and improving our capital and operating efficiencies. 
In addition, we will continue to expand our 4G LTE network coverage, which is already the largest in the nation and our target is to have 4G LTE coverage similar to our 3G coverage by mid-2013.
In Wireline, capital spending was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $6.4 billion, a decline of more than $800 million or 12%. The decline in spending was driven by lower FiOS buildout cost, as well as efficiency gains from investing in newer technologies. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the year in a strong financial position. Total debt was $55.2 billion and net debt was $41.8 billion. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.2x. As a reminder, the previously announced $10 billion Verizon Wireless cash distribution will occur next week. 
Let's now move into our review of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7.
Our Wireless business had another impressive quarter of growth, particularly with regard to retail customer activity. Total revenue grew to $18.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Retail service revenue, which includes both postpaid and prepaid, grew 7.8% year-over-year, which is a 90-basis point improvement in growth over the third quarter. 
Total service revenue in the quarter grew 6.4% year-over-year, up from 6.1% growth in the third quarter. Within total service revenues, growth was impacted by year-over-year declines in roaming and wholesale revenue, which collectively amounted to roughly $140 million in the fourth quarter. 
Looking forward, we expect to see less impact on year-over-year growth rates from these factors as we move through 2012.
Total data revenue grew to $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 19.2% year-over-year. Data now represents 41.6% of total service revenue. Data revenue growth continues to be driven by web and email services, which increased to $4 billion in the quarter, up more than 44% year-over-year. Messaging revenue, which makes up about 30% of total data grew nearly 4% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. 
Let's take a closer look at our connections growth on Slide 8.
We ended the year with industry-leading total connections of 108.7 million, up 6.3% from 2010. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market with 87.4 million connections, driven by demand for our unmatched portfolio of 3G and 4G LTE handsets and Internet data devices. Retail net adds of 1.5 million in the quarter were the highest we've seen in 3 years. Within retail, 1.2 million were postpaid and 252,000 were prepaid. Within the postpaid net adds mix, 1 million were smartphones and 400,000 were Internet data devices. The remaining being the net change in basic phones. Of particular interest, more than 700,000 of these net adds were 4G LTE smartphones or data devices.
In retail prepaid, fourth quarter net add growth was equally distributed between tablets and phones. This quarter marks the first time in 2 years that prepaid phones, excluding tablets, had positive net adds. This is due to the success of our $50 monthly unlimited prepaid phone offer, which we put in place on a national basis in mid-September. 
Postpaid device sales, which include both gross adds and upgrades, were significantly higher this quarter, driven by the Apple iPhone 4S, as well as the increasing popularity of our 4G LTE smartphones and Internet data devices. Retail postpaid gross adds totaled 3.6 million in the quarter, an increase of 10% sequentially and 7.6% year-over-year. The percentage of postpaid customers upgrading this quarter moved up to 10%.
The continued demand for our wireless products is not only driving growth and connections and revenue, but also strengthening our industry-leading customer loyalty metrics. Our churn metrics this quarter were excellent once again, with retail postpaid churn of only 0.94%, an improvement of 7 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 and take a closer look at our smartphones and retail postpaid ARPU metrics.
As I said, we had a record quarter in terms of smartphone sales, increasing the penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 44%. A year ago, smartphone penetration was 28%. We have made very good progress in 2011. 70% of all retail postpaid phones sold this quarter were smartphones, a solid increase from 60% in each of the last 2 quarters. 
During the quarter, we activated 4.3 million Apple iPhones and sold 1.6 million 4G LTE smartphones. In addition, we sold roughly 700,000 4G LTE Internet data devices. As I said, sales of 4G LTE products are clearly gaining momentum. 
Shifting now to ARPU. Retail postpaid ARPU was $54.80 this quarter, up 2.5% year-over-year. Retail postpaid phone ARPU exceeds $56, up 4% on a year-over-year basis. Postpaid Internet devices have an ARPU of just under $49, which was down 11% from a year ago. This decline was mainly due to a strategic price change we made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We made this pricing move to expand the market, given our expectation that the superior capabilities of 4G LTE will generate more demand and increase data usage of these devices. We did expand the market in 2011 with approximately 3.8 million unit sales, which included mobile hotspots, USB modems and tablets. We now have about 7 million subscribers with these devices, representing about 8% of our retail postpaid base.
While the unit growth of these devices is deluding our overall retail postpaid-to-ARPU at this time, fourth quarter revenue growth from these devices was 10% on a year-over-year basis. In addition to making a positive contribution to top line growth, the greater efficiency of our 4G LTE network means that this data revenues is also generating higher margins and driving improved profitability. 
Let's conclude our Wireless segment review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 10.
2011 was another strong year of industry leadership in terms of margin performance and cash generation. With the introduction of the Apple iPhone and numerous 4G LTE smartphones during the year, we indicated last January that margins would fluctuate in certain quarters depending on new device rollout and sales. 
Looking back at our quarterly margin performance in 2011, [indiscernible] to be the case with strong sales in the first and fourth quarters pressuring EBITDA. As I mentioned, the sales volumes in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations but obviously, will create more opportunity for growth in 2012.
Our strong performance in terms of customer additions and market share gains, coupled with increased smartphone penetration, drove increases in retail service revenues and accelerating phone ARPU. In addition, our intense focus on cost efficiency is clearly helping to mitigate the cost of higher equipment subsidies. Our industry-leading customer retention has also helped the margin and performance, which is a testament to the quality and reliability of our network and to the overall customer experience. 
Verizon Wireless continues to be the industry leader. And was another year of impressive overall performance, we've built great momentum heading into the new year, expecting to sustain our strong growth in profitability. 
Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 11.
Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $10.1 billion, a decline of $150 million or 1.5% year-over-year, with the full year Wireline revenue totaled $40.7 billion, down 1.3%. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenue grew 1.3% year-over-year, driven by FiOS revenue growth of 18.2%. In Global Enterprise, fourth quarter revenue also grew 1.3% driven once again by Strategic Services, which increased 14.7% year-over-year. As I've said, Strategic Services, which include Terremark are growing portion of our revenue mix, representing 51% of total enterprise revenue in the fourth quarter.
From a profitability perspective, the fourth quarter Wireline EBITDA margin recovered nicely from the challenges of the third quarter, increasing 240 basis points sequentially to 23.8%. 
Let's take a closer look at our revenue performance starting with mass markets on Slide 12.
Fourth quarter revenue for mass markets increased 0.7% on a year-over-year basis. Consumer revenue, which represents the majority of this category, grew 1.3% in the quarter. Consumer ARPU steadily increased throughout the year and is now more than $96. I would also highlight that our residential connections trends continue to improve. We lost 183,000 retail residential connections in the fourth quarter, representing the 7.3% decline, compared with a loss of 303,000 or 9% in the fourth quarter of last year. 
In broadband, we added 201,000 FiOS Internet subscribers in the quarter, increasing our subscriber base to 4.8 million and penetration to 36%. By adding in our 3.9 million high-speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with a total of 8.7 million board brand connections, adding the net positive 98,000 broadband connections in the fourth quarter. 
In FiOS Video, we added 194,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.2 million and increasing our penetration to 32%. Within our FiOS subscriber base, about 3.5 million customers are triple play and FiOS ARPU increased in the fourth quarter to more than $148 per month. In terms of our deployment, we ended the year with 16.5 million premises past, adding just over 900,000 in 2011. We had 13.6 million homes open for sale for Internet and 13.3 million for video.
From my perspective, 2011 was a very good year for FiOS, both operationally and financially. For the full year, FiOS revenue grew 20% to $8.3 billion. Looking ahead, our focus will once again be to increase penetration, drive market and [indiscernible] share gains, realize more efficiency from a cost perspective and expand margins. 
Let's move next to our business markets, starting with Global Enterprise.
Strategic Services continued to drive the year-over-year improvement in Global Enterprise revenue. Led by very strong growth in advanced services such as managed network, call center, IP communications and our cloud offerings. In the fourth quarter, these services totaled $2 billion, up 14.7% year-over-year, representing just over half of Global Enterprise revenue. As we've seen for the last several quarters, the growth in Strategic Services outpaced the decline in core Enterprise Services. Terremark revenues were up about 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter and roughly 18% year-over-year.
Within our Global Enterprise solutions, we are focused on shifting our product mix to higher gross service offerings and we continue to gain traction here. In less strategic areas like core voice, data and hardware, we've continued to look for ways to improve overall margin profitability. One example is our deemphasis on sales of hardware or CEP, particularly dropship equipment that is not part of an overall enterprise solution bundle. 
During 2011, hardware sales were down roughly $340 million on an annual basis. In the fourth quarter alone, hardware revenue was down $147 million or 21.6% year-over-year. Looking at the services revenue component of Global Enterprises reveals a more positive growth trend. In the fourth quarter, Enterprise Services revenue grew 2.7% year-over-year, excluding Terremark, which was not part of our results a year ago. If Terremark was included, the rate of growth would've been higher but with not represent a true baseline.
In Global Wholesale, revenues in the fourth quarter declined 7.6% year-over-year due primarily to declines in voice where we continue to experience secular pressures and lower volumes, offset in part by increases in certain data services. Our deemphasis of certain nonprofitable International Voice routes created downward pressure on revenue, but did contribute to improve wholesale margins. 
Let's move to Slide 14 for our 2011 wrap up.
We had a strong finish to a very solid year in 2011, giving us a great momentum and confidence heading into the new year. Wireless, FiOS and enterprise Strategic Services all contributed to significant improvements and adjusted revenue growth where we move from just under 2% in 2010 to more than 6% in 2011. These revenue improvements and our focus on capturing operating efficiencies helped us to mitigate various cost pressures throughout the business, creating solid growth in earnings and strong free cash flow, supported by our disciplined approach to capital spending. 
On the strategic front, we made a number of investments that have improved our competitive position and differentiated us in the marketplace, setting the stage for future growth and improved property. I believe investors recognize our progress in 2011 as our stock price appreciation and competitive dividend generated a total return to shareholders of 18.2%.
We enter 2012 with great confidence in our ability to take advantage of the market opportunities we see in our key strategic growth areas. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, you will see a renewed focus on delivering solutions to all of our customers and the markets that we serve by better leveraging our capabilities across all parts of the business. Our Global Enterprise solutions organization is just one example, highlighting a more integrated approach in how we develop and deliver Customer Solutions, including a vertical industry focus into areas like education and healthcare as examples. 
Another example is the way in which we are managing our top multinational accounts in collaboration with Vodafone where this makes sense for both companies. In terms of our acquisition of AWS Spectrum from SpectrumCo, we are looking forward to closing the transaction at the review by the Department of Justice and approval by the FCC, which we anticipate by midyear. We are also making progress in our additional agreements with the cable companies subject to the DOJ's expected review. 
Just last week, Comcast and Verizon announced that we are offering each other's products and services in Seattle and Portland as our initial markets. We expect the launch in additional cities in the coming months.
We have great momentum in Wireless and we expect to build on that strength, driving further penetration of smartphones and furthering our leadership position in 4G LTE. In FiOS, we expect to drive higher penetration in existing markets and effectively capture pent-up demand in multidwelling units and new markets. And in the enterprise space, we are clearly gaining traction as the leading global provider in the information technology solution space. The integration of Terremark and the addition of CloudSwitch have significantly improved our competitive position, giving us a unique set of capabilities to combine solutions around the network, data center, security and cloud infrastructure. 
Another key focus area will be to continue to drive operating efficiencies across and throughout the entire business. With the formation of our operational excellence and process transformation organization, reporting directly to Lowell, we are devoting dedicated resources to examining all cost and processes including product rationalization, back office operations and system consolidation. The upshot of our ability to execute and capture these incremental revenue opportunities and operating efficiencies will be an increase in the cash flows of the business. 
As I said, the heavy investment cycle of the first 10 years of Verizon are largely behind us, and we have transformed ourselves into a company very well positioned in the growth markets of the future. We have the platforms, we have the people and we have the capabilities. We are poised to build on the strong foundation we have, accelerate the momentum we've achieved, further increase investment returns and create significant shareholder value in the years to come.
With that, I will turn the call back to John so we can get your questions."

And then turning to postpaid to ARPU, you had a big quarter in terms of smartphone and Internet devices. Based on what you're seeing now, how do you expect those sort of growth trends on the postpaid ARPU side to progress maybe in the first quarter and outlook for 2012, if possible?"

As of many of you visited this facility, you saw the innovation of the products and the services, which I believe are pioneer in the industry of developing these types of solutions that will increase our revenue from a machine-to-machine perspective and everything that is going to be driven over our LTE network, which we believe we are a market leader in. So if you take the Wireless asset and then the FiOS asset and you look back to what we said back in January of 2011 when Lowell and I first stood on the stage live, we stated that we had a year of execution in front of us and we have certain targets that we wanted to hit. And I think as coming out of this year, I would say that my position has not changed from where I stood on that stage. So growth opportunities for the future, I believe are there. As I said in my script remarks, I believe that the $2.15, as you look at it for 2012, should be a baseline of $2.20 as you project our growth out. But I would reiterate that my position from January has not changed as I sit here at the end of this year. Going on to postpaid ARPU growth, I think if you look at this, we continue to grow our ARPU growth. I think that from an overall perspective, if you break that down, we had our phone ARPU growth to an all-time high of 4%. Now if you look back, that was 3.3% in the second quarter. That went up to 3.7% in the third and now sitting at 4% overall. So you can see that, that smartphone penetration is accelerating that phone ARPU growth. As we've talked in the past, the Internet category has some dilution in it. So year-over-year, we're down 11% and this is reflected back when we changed our prices back in October perspective. So on an ARPU perspective of Internet devices, down 11% but overall revenue growth from that category as we said, we did this to expand the category. And again, this quarter, we were up 24% year-over-year and the amount of Internet devices we added and we continue to have our strongest quarter of the year. So we are executing on the expansion of that category. So year-over-year, the actual revenue is up 10%, even though that there is some dilution in the ARPU side. So I think, John, to answer your question, I'm extremely positive and I stay with what I've said coming out of the third quarter. We continue to see that we can accrete our ARPU into the future of 2012."

New York continues to be our highest growing market there. So FiOS is a critical component to the growth of the Wireline on a top line basis. The other strategy that we've talked about a little bit in the past is the strategy of migrating our copper plant over to the FiOS plant now that we have substantial environments FiOS were there is also copper. So what you're going to going to see this year is a very strategic initiatives that we go out and the lookout areas where there are chronic copper problems and we start to transform them onto our FiOS network. And the math would say if there is a chronic problem that we have to visit more than 2x a year, the actual financial benefit of us transforming that to FiOS pays for itself within that year. So we will strategically start to go in there. What that brings is that brings an enormous expense savings to us from just an overall operational plant perspective. That's one big component. The second is obviously, with the new organization of enterprise, we believe that we the acquisitions of Terremark and CloudSwitch, we continue to grow that top line. As I our said, Terremark had an outstanding quarter sequentially, up 10%. That came out of a September all-time high booking. That will continue into '12 because obviously, those bookings don't book on the same quarter [indiscernible] in this business. It takes 6 to 12 months to grow that revenue. So I think we're continuing to expand and our cloud services basis, which also helps top line revenue for Wireline. And then you get into the cost initiatives, which continue to really be a focus of the whole business unit. So from a foundational standpoint, what I would say is this is on a liter basis, you will see us increased Wireline margin. Where we have some setbacks even there obviously, in the first quarter, we have a lot of tax resets and so forth. So from that perspective, you may see us decline in the first quarter and it's a bit in the first quarter but from that point, we will accelerate and continue to overall improve the Wireline margin of the business. Now on the improvement side, I would tell you that we continue from a labor negotiation standpoint. We continue to negotiate at the table. Obviously, as I said before, we expect that we need to reconfigure the cost structure of our Wireline business. And that gets to the heart of the healthcare and the pension benefits of the Wireline representive employees. So our position has not changed and we will continue to negotiate in good faith with the union. And we'll report out with those negotiations are ended and where we end for that contractual period."

And then staying on wireless, you noted that there were some pressure another service revenues from wholesale roaming I think it was to customer. So can you give us a little bit more color around that and what's going to make that better in 2012?"

You talk about 1 product, I talk about a whole portfolio of products. So if you look at our LTE lineup and just to give you some numbers, we sold almost 15 million Android-based products and if you do the math for the quarter, it's about 10.8 million iPhone products. So they're both extremely significant to our portfolio. If you look at LTE, we're coming out of the year with almost 18 devices on our network and we will add 6 more in the first quarter of this year, leading us to 24. So I think that the way we look at it is our momentum coming out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter and obviously, the first quarter will be more of what we saw in the first 3 quarters because obviously, the fourth quarter is always a much higher volume quarter just because of seasonality. So I would think that, Simon, on this one, what I would say is this: Is we have a proven track record in Wireless that we both drive profitability and growth. And I would expect that in 2012, we will get back to and continue to improve on the Wireless margins. So if you look at what we did in the third quarter, going back, we had an iPhone in our portfolio. We had 3 quarters under our belt with a very real large lineup of 0G LTE devices and we produced the highest margin in Wireless in the history of the Wireless business at 47.8% margins. So I guess what I would say to you is that we will strive to continue to improve on the Wireless margins, not only on the top line growth perspective, but we also in the last 2 years trimmed out almost $3 billion of cost in our Wireless business. So again, I think the focus will be to improve and continue to grow, as well as improve on the profitability of the Wireless margins. On the wholesale side, there are 2 things happening. Obviously, I reported out that the third quarter that with the sale of the Alltel properties, we knew that AT&T would be moving off our network, which they did. And then in the reseller base, I think it's very important to note that the resellers that we have contracts with are mainly prepaid resellers. And as I've said in the past, as this has declined in the last couple of quarters, we have an issue with us, which is I will only enter into agreements that are win-win for both. And right now, the market is at a point where I'm not going to compete on the wholesale rates that are in the marketplace, although this is an extremely important channel for us and we continue to work with our highest resellers. We do have a shift mix in the reseller base. So we added 371,000 net reseller adds, but some of this is a mix change going into lower, what I would call, live source-type offerings and more universal service fund-type offerings, so they carry a lower ARPU than some of our historical prepaid voice resellers would. But overall the profitability of this is the very substantial. But I also think it's important to note that as we attack the prepaid market, we performed and launched our unleashed product, which coming out of the third quarter, I said and was very optimistic that this would be the first quarter that we showed positive net adds in that product space and we actually did. So from a net perspective, we had net adds in prepaid for the first time in at least in the past 2 years, so we are starting to get momentum in the prepaid market, both through the reseller channel but also through our unleashed channel. So I think that's what you can continue to see. So that's for the wholesale roaming side. So John, next question."

And I think you've seen that Verizon Wireless has managed this extremely efficiently by moving higher and Internet devices off of the 3G network on to our 4G network. And just one other note is in the fourth quarter, all of our Internet devices sold 100% of those adds were all on the 4G LTE network. So I think from a CapEx standpoint, what I would say it's I would not expect any change here from a disciplined capital spending coming out of the back end of 2011 going into '12. And as I said, we will continue to improve our overall CapEx to revenue ratio. So I wouldn't expect you to see anything differently than what we've executed on through 2011. As far as cash outlay, from a cash tax perspective, as you know, the bonus depreciation is Safe Harbor for 2012. So there really is no additional cash tax from the bonus depreciation and obviously, there's still a lot of things that we're looking at for 2012 from a bonus depreciation discussion down in Washington of the extension of that, possible overall corporate tax restructure. So we look at those things, but I will tell you, that even without that, we continue on a very complex organization of taxes for federal purposes, continue to strategize and continue to think of how we best utilize our structure to make sure that we have as minimal cash outlay as possible from a cash tax perspective. The only thing I will highlight from a cash differentiation for 2012 is the pension plan contribution, as I talk about. This will go from $400 million up to $1.26 million for '12, and those contributions will be made more or less smoothly for the year but the first and third quarter will be around $400 million and then evenly in the second and fourth quarters. So that really is the only change from what I would expect from a cash outlay. The only other thing I would say is that our profits continue to increase and we grow bottom line obviously, our cash taxes will increase with that."

We have now over $200 million POPs covered, which exceed exceeded what our original plans were to achieve 185 million POPs. And as I said, we initially told that we would have 3G and 4G coverage of about the same by the end of 2013 and we have now said by bead 2013 will have that covers fulfilled. So I think from just an overall leadership position and a market position, I think we're in great shape. From a pricing perspective, obviously, we did the fourth quarter promotion where we said we doubled your allowance coming to that we will have more enticement of people looking at the 4G product. And as you can see, we had our all-time high of 4G devices moved over 2.4 million devices in the quarter moved from that strategy. So I think overall pricing what I would say is this, I think you'll see more movement on device pricing than you will on overall service pricing. We'll have to see what the competitive marketplace [indiscernible] for this, but I think that from just an overall perspective, LTE will be a market leadership for us. And it's not only around just the retail market but we can't lose sight of the machine-to-machine market and obviously, I said I was picking up innovation labs, there is a lot of technology and innovation that's going to come out around automotive around healthcare, around energy conservation that really we'll leap bound anything that we see currently in the marketplace today.

They have $11.6 billion of debt, so they're actually in a surplus position of $700 million. For 2012, they have about $1.6 billion of maturities coming that will be paid down. And as I said, within the next week, we will have a $10 billion distribution tax both at the parents there. So that's the situation of the cash and debt on the Wireless side. From an enterprise perspective, I think that it's critical here, just overall, with this organizational structure that Lowell has set up with the enterprise solutions group. It is key for us because I said before, as we approached our enterprise customers, we still had a delineation between a wireless solution and the wireline solution. And now that the organizations come together with the product rationalization that I talked about, it's going to be critical for us to present one solution to our customer end-to-end. And that's really I think will elevate where we are today just from an overall Strategic Services position. But to get to your question, Mike, about exactly what are we sailing. Obviously, cloud services, the acquisition of Terremark, the addition of CloudSwitch, the opening of the Knapp Center in Amsterdam, the expansion of our São Paulo, Brazil data center, which quite honestly, the acquisition of Terremark Verizon really never played or had a position in Latin America, so this is a very high growth area for us. So I think one, absolutely around the cloud, but also the convergence of cloud and what that brings to from an overall enterprise mobility standpoint and the integration of that cloud and that mobility solution when you look at machine-to-machine and cloud and what that can bring to an enterprise customer in a vertical solution set. So I think you're going to see more and more around cloud, but machine-to-machine. Within obviously, around our IT and advanced communications offerings, but they're also is a differentiation as to what we sell here in North America versus what we sell outside of North America. And as I said before, outside on international again this quarter we grew our international enterprise base by an excess of 9%. So even with all the pressures you see around the world, we continue to grow. Now obviously, that's because of our low market share in those markets, but continued growth for us. And as we expand internationally, I think you'll see more international growth out of us, especially around the cloud services. And as I said, the collaboration of Vodafone where it makes. And so I think there's a couple of different facets there, but I have a very good outlook for enterprise revenue growth going into '12, even with the continued stabilization of the economy and we have not forecasted much growth there but stabilization would be a key. And if there is growth there, then I think we are even more optimistic on our enterprise growth."

But what I would say is that the pricing has not actually changed and if anything if you look at it, there was a price increase in 2011. And there will probably be more price increases in 2012 as we go here. But I think the differentiation we have here is we have a superior product in FiOS. It is taking hold in the marketplace. We are seeing, as I said, New York is our highest growing market. Just past year, we crossed the milestone in Virginia. We pass 40% penetration our video services. You can see we had a good quarter on broadband connection in FiOS, and I think if you look at the line loss that we said at 7.2%, you can see that, that strategy of the chronic, we started that in the fourth quarter of this year, a little bit, you can see that we are starting to convert copper voice customers on to FiOS so continue to grow and hold on to that decline in revenue stream of the legacy products. So I think overall, FiOS will continue to play a very important strategic role in the future of Wireline. We will compete vigorously with this, even with the agreements that we entered into with the cable companies. If you look at the innovation agreement, that innovation will come into FiOS. And being a superior product already, that innovation will add what we can bring into the consumer base from an overall perspective. So I think overall, I'm very up optimistic on our FiOS penetration for 2012."

As we continue to mature this, we have said that we are looking at family data plans, if you will and we continue to look at that and obviously, and the play there is to make sure that it's a win-win for the customer and a win-win for us from an accretion standpoint. So we continue to work that. But I think that it's important to note that we are premium priced product, but we will win in the marketplace just like we did with Unleashed even though that's priced $10 above the market. We now see that there are niches of people that want to be on the best network in the world. So I think that will continue to be our strategy, and we'll see here as 2012 goes. As far as Wireline goes on that, I think wholesale, we continue to see pressure on the wholesale side of the business just from a legacy voice, and as we transformed this business from a legacy voice business to a data business, continue with our fiber to the cell program, which we are building out for various wireless carriers, this continues to be very good business for us, but not quite enough to offset the voice loss. So I think we'll continue to see pressure in there going into 2012. As far as the other category, this is legacy MCI 108 traffic, call collect-type traffic, which will continue to decline, it's not something that's strategic for us just really move that as that cash cow at this point, and that will continue to decline. So overall, the focus here is on the consumer Wireline margin, the enterprise portfolio and then also the wholesale portfolio."

Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning, I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is Fran Shammo.
Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.
I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.
This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, we reported a loss of $0.71 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include a noncash pension and benefits charge of $5.6 billion on a pretax basis. This mark-to-market adjustment related to our current year asset returns, discount rate and mortality assumption changes in our pension and postretirement plans. This adjustment is in accordance with the accounting policy we adopted a year ago, which requires us to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur and not smooth the effects over a longer period of time. 
Adjusting for $1.23 per share of nonoperational items, fourth quarter EPS was $0.52, bringing our full year 2011 adjusted EPS to $2.15. The comparable adjusted EPS in 2010 was $2.08. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran."

Before we get into the details, let me start with a few summary comments. We finished the year very strong, creating value for our shareholders in 2011 by generating a total return of 18.2% through a combination of stock price appreciation of 12.1% and our dividend payments. Our stock price appreciation outpaced our peers, as well as the S&P, Dow Jones and broader indices. For the fifth consecutive year, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase, indicating their confidence in the sustainability of our business model, cash flows and our improving earnings profile into 2012 and beyond.
In 2011, we also made some smart investments for the future growth and improved profitability. While very disciplined in our approach to capital spending, we continue to invest in networks and new technologies, which will be the platform for accelerated growth. 
On the strategic front, we made some moves that will significantly improve our competitive position. These include the acquisitions of Terremark and CloudSwitch in the cloud computing space, several agreements to purchase additional spectrum, joint efforts around innovation with a number of partners including the cable companies and, of course, our continued leadership in the rapid development of the 4G LTE ecosystem. 
We also renewed our focus on delivering solutions to customers and the markets we serve by better leveraging our capabilities across all parts of the business, wireless, FiOS, Strategic Services, the cloud, digital media and our global high-speed IP network. Our recently formed Global Enterprise solutions organization will strengthen our ability to provide fully integrated customer solutions. 
In addition to making these investments in our future, 2011 was a great year of solid execution. We posted record revenue growth in the fourth quarter, resulting in adjusted revenue growth of 6.2% for the full year, a significant acceleration from just below 2% growth in 2010. In addition to our strong revenue results, our sharp focus on capturing operating efficiencies helped us to mitigate a number of cost pressures, driving an increase to consolidated EBITDA of more than $950 million. 
We also had a strong year in terms of cash generation with $13.5 billion in free cash flow. 2011 was an impressive year on a number of fronts, giving us tremendous confidence about our long-term growth prospects.
Now let's turn our attention to the fourth quarter, starting with a few highlights. 
As I just noted, we had a very strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter. Our 7.7% year-over-year growth was easily our highest quarterly growth of the year, and in fact, the highest quarterly growth since the formation of Verizon 11 years ago. In wireless, we had our best quarter ever in terms of smartphone sales, 4G LTE device sales and customer upgrades, along with the most retail gross adds in the 3 years. We lead the industry in retail postpaid connections and our 1.2 million postpaid net adds this quarter demonstrate that we continue to gain market share. We are by far the market leader in 4G LTE, which is now available in 195 markets covering more than 200 million POPs, with increasing customer awareness of its superior speeds, capabilities and new high-quality devices.
4G LTE is really taking hold. In addition to record device sales in the quarter, we are seeing a high-level activity at our innovation centers in Waltham and San Francisco. We currently offer about 20 4G LTE smartphone and data devices, and at CES, we announced 2 more mobile hotspots now called Jetpacks. Three smartphones: 2 for Motorola and one from LG and the Samsung Galaxy Tablet. Clearly, the Verizon 4G LTE network is becoming the destination of choice for consumer and enterprise customers, which is a strong indicator for us looking forward.
In Wireline, our revenue mix continues to improve, with FiOS representing 61% of our consumer revenue and enterprise Strategic Services making up 51% of our Global Enterprise revenue in the quarter. We effectively worked through the numerous challenges of the third quarter to restore Wireline segment profitability. Wireline EBITDA increased to $2.4 billion in the quarter, resulting in a 23.8% EBITDA margin, in line with where we ended the second quarter. Now that we are back on track, I am confident that we will see Wireline margin expansion in 2012. Again, a strong finish to a solid year, making us very confident about our growth opportunities in 2012 and beyond.
Let's turn to Slide 5 next. Fourth quarter consolidated revenues grew 7.7% year-over-year, resulting in adjusted annual growth of 6.2%, solidly within our 2011 guidance range of 4% to 8%. Reported earnings for the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis were a net loss of $0.71 per share due to the significant noncash charge associated with our pension and postretirement plans. The largest component of this actuarial true-up, has to do with our discount rate assumption, which was 5.75% at the beginning of the year. At the end of the year, this rate is adjusted to an estimate of the yields of high-quality long-term bonds, which was determined to be 5%. 
Another part of this true-up relates to our return on pension assets. We assumed an 8% ROA at the beginning of the year and we came in at 5% for the year. There were also adjustments required based on mortality assumption changes. Excluding non-operational items, we earned $0.52 per share in the quarter, bringing our full year 2011 adjusted EPS result to $2.15, up 3.4% from a comparable $2.08 per share in 2010. 
Coming out of the third quarter, we indicated that we were on track to meet our 2011 earnings guidance of 5% to 8% growth. Earlier this month, I indicated that a very strong December resulted in higher-than-expected wireless device sales, which sets up well for 2012 but resulted in us falling a little short of our full year EPS growth target by $0.02. I would also remind you that our $2.15 adjusted result included $0.05 of negative impact, primarily from the storms in the third quarter. So from my perspective, an adjusted EPS of $2.20 is a more logical starting point for you when considering our 2012 earnings growth potential.
Let's turn next to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 6. Our free cash flow in the fourth quarter and full year was once again a combination of strong cash generation and reduced levels of capital spending. Capital expenditures for the full year totaled $16.2 billion, representing a decrease of 1.3% from 2010. In addition to being lower than the prior year, the $16.2 billion was favorable to our guidance of $16.5 billion. 
Our capital efficiency has improved steadily and was below 15% for the year. With the heavy investment cycles necessary to transform our business largely behind us, we would expect our CapEx to revenue ratio, which is already at a historical low to continue declining based on disciplined capital spending and improving revenue growth trends. 
In Wireless, capital spending in the fourth quarter was $1.8 billion, bringing the full year to $9 billion, an increase of 6.3%. The incremental spending in 2011 was a combination of 3G capacity requirements, driven by the Apple iPhone and the continued rapid expansion of our 4G LTE network. 
In 2012, we will continue to migrate traffic from our 3G EV-DO network to 4G LTE, thereby freeing up 3G capacity and improving our capital and operating efficiencies. 
In addition, we will continue to expand our 4G LTE network coverage, which is already the largest in the nation and our target is to have 4G LTE coverage similar to our 3G coverage by mid-2013.
In Wireline, capital spending was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $6.4 billion, a decline of more than $800 million or 12%. The decline in spending was driven by lower FiOS build-out cost, as well as efficiency gains from investing in newer technologies. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the year in a strong financial position. Total debt was $55.2 billion and net debt was $41.8 billion. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.2x. As a reminder, the previously announced $10 billion Verizon Wireless cash distribution will occur next week. 
Let's now move into our review of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7.
Our Wireless business had another impressive quarter of growth, particularly with regard to retail customer activity. Total revenue grew to $18.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Retail service revenue, which includes both postpaid and prepaid, grew 7.8% year-over-year, which is a 90-basis point improvement in growth over the third quarter. 
Total service revenue in the quarter grew 6.4% year-over-year, up from 6.1% growth in the third quarter. Within total service revenues, growth was impacted by year-over-year declines in roaming and wholesale revenue, which collectively amounted to roughly $140 million in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we expect to see less impact on year-over-year growth rates from these factors as we move through 2012.
Total data revenue grew to $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 19.2% year-over-year. Data now represents 41.6% of total service revenue. Data revenue growth continued to be driven by web and email services, which increased to $4 billion in the quarter, up more than 34% year-over-year. Messaging revenue, which makes up about 30% of total data grew nearly 4% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. 
Let's take a closer look at our connections growth on Slide 8. We ended the year with industry-leading total connections of 108.7 million, up 6.3% from 2010. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market with 87.4 million connections, driven by demand for our unmatched portfolio of 3G and 4G LTE handsets and Internet data devices. Retail net adds of 1.5 million in the quarter were the highest we've seen in 3 years. Within retail, 1.2 million were postpaid and 252,000 were prepaid. Within the postpaid net add mix, 1 million were smartphones and 400,000 were Internet data devices. The remaining being the net change in basic phones. Of particular interest, more than 700,000 of these net adds were 4G LTE smartphones or data devices.
In retail prepaid, fourth quarter net add growth was equally distributed between tablets and phones. This quarter marks the first time in 2 years that prepaid phones, excluding tablets, had positive net adds. This is due to the success of our $50 monthly unlimited prepaid phone offer, which we put in place on a national basis in mid-September. 
Postpaid device sales, which include both gross adds and upgrades, were significantly higher this quarter, driven by the Apple iPhone 4S, as well as the increasing popularity of our 4G LTE smartphones and Internet data devices. Retail postpaid gross adds totaled 3.6 million in the quarter, an increase of 10% sequentially and 7.6% year-over-year. The percentage of postpaid customers upgrading this quarter moved up to 10%.
The continued demand for our wireless products is not only driving growth in connections and revenue, but also strengthening our industry-leading customer loyalty metrics. Our churn metrics this quarter were excellent once again, with retail postpaid churn of only 0.94%, an improvement of 7 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 and take a closer look at our smartphones and retail postpaid ARPU metrics.
As I said, we had a record quarter in terms of smartphone sales, increasing the penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 44%. A year ago, smartphone penetration was 28%. We have made very good progress in 2011. 70% of all retail postpaid phones sold this quarter were smartphones, a solid increase from 60% in each of the last 2 quarters. 
During the quarter, we activated 4.3 million Apple iPhones and sold 1.6 million 4G LTE smartphones. In addition, we sold roughly 700,000 4G LTE Internet data devices. As I said, sales of 4G LTE products are clearly gaining momentum. 
Shifting now to ARPU. Retail postpaid ARPU was $54.80 this quarter, up 2.5% year-over-year. Retail postpaid phone ARPU exceeds $56, up 4% on a year-over-year basis. Postpaid Internet devices have an ARPU of just under $49, which was down 11% from a year ago. This decline was mainly due to a strategic price change we made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We made this pricing move to expand the market, given our expectation that the superior capabilities of 4G LTE will generate more demand and increase data usage on these devices. We did expand the market in 2011 with approximately 3.8 million unit sales, which included mobile hotspots, USB modems and tablets. We now have about 7 million subscribers with these devices, representing about 8% of our retail postpaid base.
While the unit growth of these devices is diluting our overall retail postpaid to ARPU at this time, fourth quarter revenue growth from these devices was 10% on a year-over-year basis. In addition to making a positive contribution to top line growth, the greater efficiency of our 4G LTE network means that this data revenue is also generating higher margins and driving improved profitability. 
Let's conclude our Wireless segment review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 10.
2011 was another strong year of industry leadership in terms of margin performance and cash generation. With the introduction of the Apple iPhone and numerous 4G LTE smartphones during the year, we indicated last January that margins would fluctuate in certain quarters depending on new device rollout and sales. 
Looking back on our quarterly margin performance in 2011, shows this to be the case, with strong sales in the first and fourth quarters pressuring EBITDA. As I mentioned, the sales volumes in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations but, obviously, will create more opportunity for growth in 2012.
Our strong performance in terms of customer additions and market share gains, coupled with increased smartphone penetration, drove increases in retail service revenues and accelerating phone ARPU. In addition, our intense focus on cost efficiency is clearly helping to mitigate the cost of higher equipment subsidies. Our industry-leading customer retention has also helped the margin and performance, which is a testament to the quality and reliability of our network and to the overall customer experience. 
Verizon Wireless continues to be the industry leader. And with another year of impressive overall performance, we've built great momentum heading into a new year, expecting to sustain our strong growth and profitability. 
Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 11. Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $10.1 billion, a decline of $150 million or 1.5% year-over-year. With the full year Wireline revenue totaled $40.7 billion, down 1.3%. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenue grew 1.3% year-over-year, driven by FiOS revenue growth of 18.2%. In Global Enterprise, fourth quarter revenue also grew 1.3%, driven once again by Strategic Services, which increased 14.7% year-over-year. As I've said, Strategic Services, which include Terremark are growing portion of our revenue mix, representing 51% of total enterprise revenue in the fourth quarter.
From a profitability perspective, the fourth quarter Wireline EBITDA margin recovered nicely from the challenges of the third quarter, increasing 240 basis points sequentially to 23.8%. 
Let's take a closer look at our revenue performance, starting with mass markets on Slide 12.
Fourth quarter revenue for mass markets increased 0.7% on a year-over-year basis. Consumer revenue, which represents a majority of this category, grew 1.3% in the quarter. Consumer ARPU steadily increased throughout the year and is now more than $96. I would also highlight that our residential connections trends continue to improve. We lost 183,000 retail residential connections in the fourth quarter, representing the 7.3% decline, compared with the loss of 303,000 or 9% in the fourth quarter of last year. 
In broadband, we added 201,000 FiOS Internet subscribers in the quarter, increasing our subscriber base to 4.8 million and penetration to 36%. By adding in our 3.9 million high-speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with a total of 8.7 million broadband connections, adding the net positive 98,000 broadband connections in the fourth quarter. 
In FiOS Video, we added 194,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.2 million and increasing our penetration to 32%. Within our FiOS subscriber base, about 3.5 million customers are triple play and FiOS ARPU increased in the fourth quarter to more than $148 per month. In terms of our deployment, we ended the year with 16.5 million premises passed, adding just over 900,000 in 2011. We had 13.6 million homes open for sale for Internet and 13.3 million for video.
From my perspective, 2011 was a very good year for FiOS, both operationally and financially. For the full year, FiOS revenue grew 20% to $8.3 billion. Looking ahead, our focus will once again be to increase penetration, drive market and wallet share gains, realize more efficiency from a cost perspective and expand margins. 
Let's move next to our business markets, starting with Global Enterprise.
Strategic Services continued to drive the year-over-year improvement in Global Enterprise revenue. Led by very strong growth in advanced services such as managed network, call center, IP communications and our cloud offering. In the fourth quarter, these services totaled $2 billion, up 14.7% year-over-year, representing just over half of Global Enterprise revenue. As we've seen for the last several quarters, the growth in Strategic Services outpaced the decline in core Enterprise Services. Terremark revenues were up about 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter and roughly 18% year-over-year.
Within our Global Enterprise solutions, we are focused on shifting our product mix to higher gross service offerings and we continue to gain traction here. In less strategic areas like core voice, data and hardware, we've continued to look for ways to improve overall margin profitability. One example is our deemphasis on sales of hardware or CPE, particularly drop-ship equipment that is not part of an overall enterprise solutions bundle. 
During 2011, hardware sales were down roughly $340 million on an annual basis. In the fourth quarter alone, hardware revenue was down $147 million or 21.6% year-over-year. Looking at the services revenue component of Global Enterprises reveals a more positive growth trend. In the fourth quarter, Enterprise Services revenue grew 2.7% year-over-year, excluding Terremark, which was not part of our results a year ago. If Terremark was included, the rate of growth would've been higher but would not represent a true baseline.
In Global Wholesale, revenues in the fourth quarter declined 7.6% year-over-year due primarily to declines in voice, where we continue to experience secular pressures and lower volumes, offset in part by increases in certain data services. Our deemphasis of certain nonprofitable International Voice routes created downward pressure on revenue, but did contribute to improved wholesale margins. 
Let's move to Slide 14 for our 2011 wrap up.
We had a strong finish to a very solid year in 2011, giving us great momentum and confidence heading into the new year. Wireless, FiOS and Enterprise Strategic Services all contributed to significant improvements and adjusted revenue growth, where we move from just under 2% in 2010 to more than 6% in 2011. These revenue improvements and our focus on capturing operating efficiencies helped us to mitigate various cost pressures throughout the business, creating solid growth in earnings and strong free cash flow, supported by our disciplined approach to capital spending. 
On the strategic front, we made a number of investments that have improved our competitive position and differentiated us in the marketplace, setting the stage for future growth and improved profitability. I believe investors recognize our progress in 2011, as our stock price appreciation and competitive dividend generated a total return to shareholders of 18.2%.
We enter 2012 with great confidence in our ability to take advantage of the market opportunities we see in our key strategic growth areas. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, you will see a renewed focus on delivering solutions to all of our customers and the markets that we serve by better leveraging our capabilities across all parts of the business. Our Global Enterprise solutions organization is just one example, highlighting a more integrated approach in how we develop and deliver customer solutions, including a vertical industry focus into areas like education and healthcare as examples. 
Another example is the way in which we are managing our top multinational accounts in collaboration with Vodafone where this makes sense for both companies. In terms of our acquisition of AWS spectrum from SpectrumCo, we are looking forward to closing the transaction after review by the Department of Justice and approval by the FCC, which we anticipate by midyear. We are also making progress in our additional agreements with the cable companies subject to the DOJ's expected review. 
Just last week, Comcast and Verizon announced that we are offering each other's products and services in Seattle and Portland as our initial markets. We expect to launch in additional cities in the coming months.
We have great momentum in Wireless and we expect to build on that strength, driving further penetration of smartphones and furthering our leadership position in 4G LTE. In FiOS, we expect to drive higher penetration in existing markets and effectively capture pent-up demand in multidwelling units and new markets. And in the enterprise space, we are clearly gaining traction as the leading global provider in the information technology solution space. The integration of Terremark and the addition of CloudSwitch have significantly improved our competitive position, giving us a unique set of capabilities to combine solutions around the network, data center, security and cloud infrastructure. 
Another key focus area will be to continue to drive operating efficiencies across and throughout the entire business. With the formation of our operational excellence and process transformation organization, reporting directly to Lowell, we are devoting dedicated resources to examining all cost and processes including product rationalization, back office operations and system consolidation. The upshot of our ability to execute and capture these incremental revenue opportunities and operating efficiencies will be an increase in the cash flows of the business. 
As I said, the heavy investment cycles of the first 10 years of Verizon are largely behind us, and we have transformed ourselves into a company very well positioned in the growth markets of the future. We have the platforms, we have the people and we have the capabilities. We are poised to build on the strong foundation we have, accelerate the momentum we've achieved, further increase investment returns and create significant shareholder value in the years to come.
With that, I will turn the call back to John, so we can get to your questions."

Actually, John and I are doing this call remotely from our Innovation Center up here in Waltham, which is just a pillar of how we're going to accelerate our growth in the future. As of many of you visited this facility, you saw the innovation of the products and the services, which I believe are pioneer in the industry of developing these types of solutions that will increase our revenue from a machine-to-machine perspective and everything that is going to be driven over our LTE network, which we believe we are a market leader in. So if you take the Wireless asset and then the FiOS asset and you look back to what we said back in January of 2011, when Lowell and I first stood on the stage live, we stated that we had a year of execution in front of us and we have certain targets that we wanted to hit. And I think that coming out of this year, I would say that my position has not changed from where I stood on that stage. So our growth opportunities for the future, I believe, are there. As I said in my script remarks, I believe that the $2.15, as you look at it for 2012, should be a baseline of $2.20 as you project our growth out. But I would reiterate that my position from January has not changed as I sit here at the end of this year. Going on to postpaid ARPU growth, I think, if you look at this, we continue to grow our ARPU growth. I think that from an overall perspective, if you break that down, we had our phone ARPU grow to an all-time high of 4%. Now if you look back, that was 3.3% in the second quarter. That went up to 3.7% in the third and now sitting at 4% overall. So you can see that the smartphone penetration is accelerating that phone ARPU growth. As we've talked in the past, the Internet category has some dilution in it. So year-over-year, we're down 11% and this is reflected back when we changed our prices back in October perspective. So on an ARPU perspective of Internet devices, down 11%, but overall revenue growth from that category as we said, we did this to expand the category. And again, this quarter, we were up 24% year-over-year in the amount of Internet devices we added and we continue to have our strongest quarter of the year. So we are executing on the expansion of that category. So year-over-year, the actual revenue is up 10%, even though that there is some dilution in the ARPU side. So I think, John, to answer your question, I'm extremely positive and I stay with what I've said coming out of the third quarter. We continue to see that we can accrete our ARPU into the future of 2012."

First, start off with FiOS and our continued penetration there and we continue to gain market share in every market. New York continues to be our highest growing market there. So FiOS is a critical component to the growth of the Wireline on a top line basis. The other strategy that we've talked about a little bit in the past is the strategy of migrating our copper plant over to the FiOS plant, now that we have substantial FiOS passing prems, where there is also copper. So what you're going to going to see this year is a very strategic initiative that we go out and we look at areas, where there are chronic copper problems and we start to transform them onto our FiOS network. And the math would say, if there is a chronic problem that we have to visit more than 2x a year, the actual financial benefit of us transforming that to FiOS pays for itself within that year. So we will strategically start to go in there. What that brings is, that brings an enormous expense savings to us from just an overall operational plant perspective. That's one big component. The second is, obviously, with the new organization of Enterprise, we believe that with the acquisitions of Terremark and CloudSwitch, we continue to grow that top line. As I said, Terremark had an outstanding quarter, sequentially up 10%. That came out of a September all-time high booking. That will continue into '12 because, obviously, those bookings don't book on the same quarter that you sell. In this business, it takes 6 to 12 months to record that revenue. So I think we're continuing to expand on our cloud services basis, which also helps top line revenue for Wireline. And then you get into the cost initiatives, which continue to really be a focus of the whole business unit. So from a foundational standpoint, what I would say is this, on a linear basis, you will see us increase Wireline margin. Will  we have some setbacks here and there? Obviously, in the first quarter, we have a lot of tax resets and so forth. So from that perspective, you may see us decline a little bit in the first quarter. But from that point, we will accelerate and continue to overall improve the Wireline margin of the business. Now on the improvement side, I would tell you that we continue, from a labor negotiation standpoint, we continue to negotiate at the table. Obviously, as I said before, we expect that we need to reconfigure the cost structure of our Wireline business. And that gets to the heart of the healthcare and the pension benefits of the Wireline representative and employees. So our position has not changed, we will continue to negotiate in good faith with the union. And we'll report out when those negotiations are ended and where we end for that contractual period."

So any trends, I know it's early in the year, but I think -- how we should be thinking about Wireless margins in Q1? And then staying on wireless, you noted that there was some pressure on other service revenues from wholesale roaming, I think that you lost your telematics customer. Can you just give us a little bit more color around that and what's going to make that better in 2012?"

So if you look at our LTE lineup and just to give you some numbers. We sold almost 15 million Android-based products, and if you do the math for the quarter, it's about 10.8 million iPhone products. So they're both extremely significant to our portfolio. If you look at LTE, we're coming out of the year with almost 18 devices on our network and we will add 6 more in the first quarter of this year, leading us to 24. So I think that the way we look at it is, our momentum coming out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter and, obviously, the first quarter will be more of what we saw in the first 3 quarters because, obviously, the fourth quarter is always a much higher volume quarter just because of seasonality. So I would think that, Simon, on this one, what I would say is this: is we have a proven track record in Wireless that we both drive profitability and growth. And I would expect that in 2012, we will get back to and continue to improve on the Wireless margins. So if you look at what we did in the third quarter, going back, we had an iPhone in our portfolio. We had 3 quarters under our belt with a very real large lineup of 4G LTE devices, and we produced the highest margin in Wireless in the history of the Wireless business of 47.8% margins. So, I guess, what I would say to you is that, we will strive to continue to improve on the Wireless margins, not only on the top line growth perspective, but we also in the last 2 years trimmed out almost $3 billion of cost in our Wireless business. So again, I think the focus will be to improve and continue to grow, as well improve on the profitability of the Wireless margins. On the wholesale side, there are 2 things happening. Obviously, I reported out that the third quarter that with the sale of the Alltel properties, we knew that AT&T would be moving that traffic off of our network, which they did. And then in the reseller base, I think it's very important to note that the resellers that we have contracts with are mainly prepaid resellers. And as I've said in the past, as this has declined in the last couple of quarters, we have an issue with us which is, I will only enter into agreements that are win-win for both. And right now, the market is at a point, where I'm not going to compete on the wholesale rates that are in the marketplace. Although this is an extremely important channel for us and we continue to work with our highest resellers, we do have a shift mix in the reseller base. So we added 371,000 net reseller adds, but some of this is a mix change going into lower, what I would call, live source-type offerings and more universal service fund-type  offerings, so they carry a lower ARPU than some of our historical prepaid voice resellers would. But overall, the profitability of this is still very substantial. But I also think it's important to note that as we attack the prepaid market, we performed and launched our Unleashed product, which coming out of the third quarter, I said and was very optimistic, that this would be the first quarter that we showed positive net adds in that product space and we actually did. So from a net perspective, we had net adds in prepaid for the first time in, at least in the past 2 years. So we are starting to gain momentum in the prepaid market, both through the reseller channel but also through our unleashed channel. So I think that's what you can continue to see. So that's for the wholesale roaming side."

And I think you've seen that Verizon Wireless has managed this extremely efficiently by moving higher and Internet devices off of the 3G network on to our 4G network. And just one other note is, in the fourth quarter, all of our Internet devices sold, 100% of those adds, were all on the 4G LTE network. So I think from a CapEx standpoint, what I would say is, I would not expect any change here from a disciplined capital spending coming out of the back end of 2011 going into '12. And as I said, we will continue to improve our overall CapEx-to-revenue ratio. So I wouldn't expect you to see anything differently than what we've executed on through 2011. As far as cash outlay, from a cash tax perspective, as you know, the bonus depreciation is Safe Harbor for 2012. So there really is no additional cash tax from the bonus depreciation and, obviously, there's still a lot of things that we're looking at for 2012 from a bonus depreciation discussion down in Washington of an extension of that, possible overall corporate tax restructure. So we look at those things. But I will tell you, that even without that, we continue on a very complex organization of taxes for federal purposes, continue to strategize and continue to think of how we best utilize our structure to make sure that we have as minimal cash outlay as possible from a cash tax perspective. The only thing I will highlight from a cash differentiation for 2012 is the pension plan contribution, as I talked about. This will go from $400 million up to $1.26 million for '12, and those contributions will be made more or less smoothly through the year, but the first and the third quarter will be around $400 million and then evenly in the second and fourth quarters. So that really is the only change from what I would expect from a cash outlay. The only other thing I would say is, as our profits continue to increase and we grow bottom line, obviously, our cash taxes will increase with that."

We have now over 200 million POPs covered, which exceeded what our original plans were to achieve 185 million POPs. And as I said, we initially told that we would have 3G and 4G coverage about the same by the end of 2013, and we have now said by mid-2013, we'll have that coverage fulfilled. So, I think, from just an overall leadership position and a market position, I think we're in great shape. From a pricing perspective, obviously, we did the fourth quarter promotion, where we said we doubled your allowance coming, so that we would have more enticement of people looking at the 4G product. And as you can see, we had our all-time high of 4G devices moved, over 2.4 million devices in the quarter moved, from that strategy. So I think overall pricing what I would say is this, I think you'll see more movement on device pricing than you will on overall service pricing. We'll have to see what the competitive marketplace holds for this. But I think that from just an overall perspective, LTE will be a market leadership for us. And it's not only around just the retail market, but we can't lose sight of the machine-to-machine market. And obviously, I said, I was sitting up here in the innovation lab, there is a lot of technology and innovation that's going to come out around, on automobile, around healthcare, around energy conservation that really will leap bound anything that we see currently in the marketplace today. So I think that from a machine-to-machine perspective, we continue to see growth in our adds quarter-over-quarter, and I see that continuing through 2012 and have a market leadership position there."

They have $11.6 billion of debt, so they're actually in a surplus position of $700 million. For 2012, they have about $1.6 billion of maturities coming, that will be paid down. And as I said, within the next week, we will have a $10 billion distribution to both of the parents there. So that's the situation of the cash and the debt on the Wireless side. From an enterprise perspective, I think that it's critical here, just overall, with this organizational structure that Lowell has set up with the Enterprise Solutions Group. It is key for us because, I said before, as we approached our enterprise customers, we still had a delineation between a wireless solution and a wireline solution. And now that the organizations come together with the product rationalization that I talked about, it's going to be critical for us to present one solution to our customer end-to-end. And that really, I think, will elevate where we are today just from an overall strategic services position. But to get to your question, Mike, about exactly what are we selling. Obviously, cloud services, the acquisition of Terremark, the addition of CloudSwitch, the opening of the NAP center in Amsterdam, the expansion of our São Paulo, Brazil data center which quite honestly, up to the acquisition of Terremark, Verizon really never played or had a position in Latin America, so this is a very high growth area for us. So I think, one, absolutely around the cloud, but also the convergence of cloud and what that brings to from an overall enterprise mobility standpoint and the integration of that cloud and that mobility solution when you look at machine-to-machine and cloud and what that can bring to an enterprise customer in a vertical solution set. So I think you're going to see more and more around cloud, but machine-to-machine. And then obviously, around our IT and its advanced communications offerings. But there also is a differentiation as to what we sell here in North America versus what we sell outside of North America. And as I said before, outside on international, again, this quarter we grew our international enterprise base by an excess of 9%. So even with all the pressures you see around the world, we continue to grow. Now, obviously, that's because of our low market share in those markets, but continued growth for us. And as we expand internationally, I think you'll see more international growth out of us, especially around the cloud services. And as I said, the collaboration of Vodafone where it makes sense. So I think there's a couple of different facets there, but I am very -- I have a very good outlook for Enterprise revenue growth going into '12, even with the continued stabilization of the economy and we have not forecasted much growth there but stabilization would be a key. And if there is growth there, then I think we are even more optimistic on our Enterprise growth."

And there will probably be some more price increases in 2012 as we go here. But I think the differentiation we have here is, we have a superior product in FiOS. It is taking hold in the marketplace. We are seeing, as I said, New York is our highest growing market. This past year, we crossed a milestone in Virginia. We passed 40% penetration on our video services. You can see we had a good quarter on broadband and connection in FiOS. And I think if you look at the line loss that we set at 7.2%, you can see that, that strategy of the chronic, we started that in the fourth quarter of this year a little bit. You can see that we are starting to convert copper voice customers onto FiOS. So continuing to grow and hold on to that decline in revenue stream of the legacy products. So I think, overall, FiOS will continue to play a very important strategic role in the future of Wireline. We will compete vigorously with this, even with the agreements that we entered into with the cable companies. If you look at the innovation agreement, that innovation will come into FiOS. And being a superior product already, that innovation will add what we can bring to the consumer base from an overall perspective. So I think, overall, I'm very optimistic on our FiOS penetration for 2012."

As we continue to mature this, we have said that we are looking at family data plans, if you will, and we continue to look at that. And obviously, the play there is to make sure that it's a win-win for the customer and a win-win for us from an accretion standpoint. So we continue to work that. But I think it's important to note that we are a premium-priced product, but we will win in the marketplace just like we did with Unleashed even though that that's priced $10 above the market. We now see that there are niches of people that want to be on the best network in the world. So I think that will continue to be our strategy, and we'll see here as 2012 goes. As far as Wireline goes on that, I think wholesale, we continue to see pressure on the wholesale side of the business just from a legacy voice. And as we transformed this business from a legacy voice business to a data business, continue with our fiber to the cell  program, which we are building out for various wireless carriers. This continues to be very good business for us, but not quite enough to offset the voice loss. So I think we'll continue to see pressure in there going into 2012. As far as the other category, this is legacy MCI 108 traffic, the call collect-type traffic, which will continue to decline. It's not something that's strategic for us and we'll just really move that as a cash cow at this point, and that will continue to decline. So overall, the focus here is on the consumer Wireline margin, the Enterprise portfolio and then also the wholesale portfolio."

Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning, I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is Fran Shammo.
Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.
I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.
This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, we reported a loss of $0.71 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include a noncash pension and benefits charge of $5.6 billion on a pretax basis. This mark-to-market adjustment related to our current year asset returns, discount rate and mortality assumption changes in our pension and postretirement plans. This adjustment is in accordance with the accounting policy we adopted a year ago, which requires us to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur and not smooth the effects over a longer period of time. 
Adjusting for $1.23 per share of nonoperational items, fourth quarter EPS was $0.52, bringing our full year 2011 adjusted EPS to $2.15. The comparable adjusted EPS in 2010 was $2.08. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran."

Before we get into the details, let me start with a few summary comments. We finished the year very strong, creating value for our shareholders in 2011 by generating a total return of 18.2% through a combination of stock price appreciation of 12.1% and our dividend payments. Our stock price appreciation outpaced our peers, as well as the S&P, Dow Jones and broader indices. For the fifth consecutive year, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase, indicating their confidence in the sustainability of our business model, cash flows and our improving earnings profile into 2012 and beyond.
In 2011, we also made some smart investments for the future growth and improved profitability. While very disciplined in our approach to capital spending, we continue to invest in networks and new technologies, which will be the platform for accelerated growth. 
On the strategic front, we made some moves that will significantly improve our competitive position. These include the acquisitions of Terremark and CloudSwitch in the cloud computing space, several agreements to purchase additional spectrum, joint efforts around innovation with a number of partners including the cable companies and, of course, our continued leadership in the rapid development of the 4G LTE ecosystem. 
We also renewed our focus on delivering solutions to customers and the markets we serve by better leveraging our capabilities across all parts of the business, wireless, FiOS, Strategic Services, the cloud, digital media and our global high-speed IP network. Our recently formed Global Enterprise solutions organization will strengthen our ability to provide fully integrated customer solutions. 
In addition to making these investments in our future, 2011 was a great year of solid execution. We posted record revenue growth in the fourth quarter, resulting in adjusted revenue growth of 6.2% for the full year, a significant acceleration from just below 2% growth in 2010. In addition to our strong revenue results, our sharp focus on capturing operating efficiencies helped us to mitigate a number of cost pressures, driving an increase to consolidated EBITDA of more than $950 million. 
We also had a strong year in terms of cash generation with $13.5 billion in free cash flow. 2011 was an impressive year on a number of fronts, giving us tremendous confidence about our long-term growth prospects.
Now let's turn our attention to the fourth quarter, starting with a few highlights. 
As I just noted, we had a very strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter. Our 7.7% year-over-year growth was easily our highest quarterly growth of the year, and in fact, the highest quarterly growth since the formation of Verizon 11 years ago. In wireless, we had our best quarter ever in terms of smartphone sales, 4G LTE device sales and customer upgrades, along with the most retail gross adds in the 3 years. We lead the industry in retail postpaid connections and our 1.2 million postpaid net adds this quarter demonstrates that we continue to gain market share. We are by far the market leader in 4G LTE, which is now available in 195 markets covering more than 200 million POPs, with increasing customer awareness of its superior speeds, capabilities and new high-quality devices.
4G LTE is really taking hold. In addition to record device sales in the quarter, we are seeing a high-level activity at our innovation centers in Waltham and San Francisco. We currently offer about 20 4G LTE smartphone and data devices, and at CES, we announced 2 more mobile hotspots now called Jetpacks. Three smartphones: 2 for Motorola and one from LG and the Samsung Galaxy Tablet. Clearly, the Verizon 4G LTE network is becoming the destination of choice for consumer and enterprise customers, which is a strong indicator for us looking forward.
In Wireline, our revenue mix continues to improve, with FiOS representing 61% of our consumer revenue and enterprise Strategic Services making up 51% of our Global Enterprise revenue in the quarter. We effectively worked through the numerous challenges of the third quarter to restore Wireline segment profitability. Wireline EBITDA increased to $2.4 billion in the quarter, resulting in a 23.8% EBITDA margin, in line with where we ended the second quarter. Now that we are back on track, I am confident that we will see Wireline margin expansion in 2012. Again, a strong finish to a solid year, making us very confident about our growth opportunities in 2012 and beyond.
Let's turn to Slide 5 next. Fourth quarter consolidated revenues grew 7.7% year-over-year, resulting in adjusted annual growth of 6.2%, solidly within our 2011 guidance range of 4% to 8%. Reported earnings for the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis were a net loss of $0.71 per share due to the significant noncash charge associated with our pension and postretirement plans. The largest component of this actuarial true-up, has to do with our discount rate assumption, which was 5.75% at the beginning of the year. At the end of the year, this rate is adjusted to an estimate of the yields of high-quality long-term bonds, which was determined to be 5%. 
Another part of this true-up relates to our return on pension assets. We assumed an 8% ROA at the beginning of the year and we came in at 5% for the year. There were also adjustments required based on mortality assumption changes. Excluding non-operational items, we earned $0.52 per share in the quarter, bringing our full year 2011 adjusted EPS result to $2.15, up 3.4% from a comparable $2.08 per share in 2010. 
Coming out of the third quarter, we indicated that we were on track to meet our 2011 earnings guidance of 5% to 8% growth. Earlier this month, I indicated that a very strong December resulted in higher-than-expected wireless device sales, which sets up well for 2012 but resulted in us falling a little short of our full year EPS growth target by $0.02. I would also remind you that our $2.15 adjusted result included $0.05 of negative impact, primarily from the storms in the third quarter. So from my perspective, an adjusted EPS of $2.20 is a more logical starting point for you when considering our 2012 earnings growth potential.
Let's turn next to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 6. Our free cash flow in the fourth quarter and full year was once again a combination of strong cash generation and reduced levels of capital spending. Capital expenditures for the full year totaled $16.2 billion, representing a decrease of 1.3% from 2010. In addition to being lower than the prior year, the $16.2 billion was favorable to our guidance of $16.5 billion. 
Our capital efficiency has improved steadily and was below 15% for the year. With the heavy investment cycles necessary to transform our business largely behind us, we would expect our CapEx to revenue ratio, which is already at a historical low, to continue declining based on disciplined capital spending and improving revenue growth trends. 
In Wireless, capital spending in the fourth quarter was $1.8 billion, bringing the full year to $9 billion, an increase of 6.3%. The incremental spending in 2011 was a combination of 3G capacity requirements, driven by the Apple iPhone and the continued rapid expansion of our 4G LTE network. 
In 2012, we will continue to migrate traffic from our 3G EV-DO network to 4G LTE, thereby freeing up 3G capacity and improving our capital and operating efficiencies. 
In addition, we will continue to expand our 4G LTE network coverage, which is already the largest in the nation and our target is to have 4G LTE coverage similar to our 3G coverage by mid-2013.
In Wireline, capital spending was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $6.4 billion, a decline of more than $800 million or 12%. The decline in spending was driven by lower FiOS build-out cost, as well as efficiency gains from investing in newer technologies. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the year in a strong financial position. Total debt was $55.2 billion and net debt was $41.8 billion. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.2x. As a reminder, the previously announced $10 billion Verizon Wireless cash distribution will occur next week. 
Let's now move into a review of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7.
Our Wireless business had another impressive quarter of growth, particularly with regard to retail customer activity. Total revenue grew to $18.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Retail service revenue, which includes both postpaid and prepaid, grew 7.8% year-over-year, which is a 90-basis point improvement in growth over the third quarter. 
Total service revenue in the quarter grew 6.4% year-over-year, up from 6.1% growth in the third quarter. Within total service revenues, growth was impacted by year-over-year declines in roaming and wholesale revenue, which collectively amounted to roughly $140 million in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we expect to see less impact on year-over-year growth rates from these factors as we move through 2012.
Total data revenue grew to $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 19.2% year-over-year. Data now represents 41.6% of total service revenue. Data revenue growth continued to be driven by web and email services, which increased to $4 billion in the quarter, up more than 34% year-over-year. Messaging revenue, which makes up about 30% of total data, grew nearly 4% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. 
Let's take a closer look at our connections growth on Slide 8. We ended the year with industry-leading total connections of 108.7 million, up 6.3% from 2010. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market with 87.4 million connections, driven by demand for our unmatched portfolio of 3G and 4G LTE handsets and Internet data devices. Retail net adds of 1.5 million in the quarter were the highest we've seen in 3 years. Within retail, 1.2 million were postpaid and 252,000 were prepaid. Within the postpaid net add mix, 1 million were smartphones and 400,000 were Internet data devices. The remaining being the net change in basic phones. Of particular interest, more than 700,000 of these net adds were 4G LTE smartphones or data devices.
In retail prepaid, fourth quarter net add growth was equally distributed between tablets and phones. This quarter marks the first time in 2 years that prepaid phones, excluding tablets, had positive net adds. This is due to the success of our $50 monthly unlimited prepaid phone offer, which we put in place on a national basis in mid-September. 
Postpaid device sales, which include both gross adds and upgrades, were significantly higher this quarter, driven by the Apple iPhone 4S, as well as the increasing popularity of our 4G LTE smartphones and Internet data devices. Retail postpaid gross adds totaled 3.6 million in the quarter, an increase of 10% sequentially and 7.6% year-over-year. The percentage of postpaid customers upgrading this quarter moved up to 10%.
The continued demand for our wireless products is not only driving growth in connections and revenue, but also strengthening our industry-leading customer loyalty metrics. Our churn metrics this quarter were excellent once again, with retail postpaid churn of only 0.94%, an improvement of 7 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 and take a closer look at our smartphones and retail postpaid ARPU metrics.
As I said, we had a record quarter in terms of smartphone sales, increasing the penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 44%. A year ago, smartphone penetration was 28%. We have made very good progress in 2011. 70% of all retail postpaid phones sold this quarter were smartphones, a solid increase from 60% in each of the last 2 quarters. 
During the quarter, we activated 4.3 million Apple iPhones and sold 1.6 million 4G LTE smartphones. In addition, we sold roughly 700,000 4G LTE Internet data devices. As I said, sales of 4G LTE products are clearly gaining momentum. 
Shifting now to ARPU. Retail postpaid ARPU was $54.80 this quarter, up 2.5% year-over-year. Retail postpaid phone ARPU exceeds $56, up 4% on a year-over-year basis. Postpaid Internet devices have an ARPU of just under $49, which was down 11% from a year ago. This decline was mainly due to a strategic price change we made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We made this pricing move to expand the market, given our expectation that the superior capabilities of 4G LTE will generate more demand and increase data usage on these devices. We did expand the market in 2011 with approximately 3.8 million unit sales, which included mobile hotspots, USB modems and tablets. We now have about 7 million subscribers with these devices, representing about 8% of our retail postpaid base.
While the unit growth of these devices is diluting our overall retail postpaid ARPU at this time, fourth quarter revenue growth from these devices was 10% on a year-over-year basis. In addition to making a positive contribution to top line growth, the greater efficiency of our 4G LTE network means that this data revenue is also generating higher margins and driving improved profitability. 
Let's conclude our Wireless segment review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 10.
2011 was another strong year of industry leadership in terms of margin performance and cash generation. With the introduction of the Apple iPhone and numerous 4G LTE smartphones during the year, we indicated last January that margins would fluctuate in certain quarters depending on new device rollouts and sales. 
Looking back on our quarterly margin performance in 2011, shows this to be the case, with strong sales in the first and fourth quarters pressuring EBITDA. As I mentioned, the sales volumes in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations but, obviously, will create more opportunity for growth in 2012.
Our strong performance in terms of customer additions and market share gains, coupled with increased smartphone penetration, drove increases in retail service revenues and accelerating phone ARPU. In addition, our intense focus on cost efficiency is clearly helping to mitigate the cost of higher equipment subsidies. Our industry-leading customer retention has also helped the margin and performance, which is a testament to the quality and reliability of our network and to the overall customer experience. 
Verizon Wireless continues to be the industry leader. And with another year of impressive overall performance, we've built great momentum heading into a new year, expecting to sustain our strong growth and profitability. 
Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 11. Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $10.1 billion, a decline of $150 million or 1.5% year-over-year. With the full year Wireline revenue totaled $40.7 billion, down 1.3%. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenue grew 1.3% year-over-year, driven by FiOS revenue growth of 18.2%. In Global Enterprise, fourth quarter revenue also grew 1.3%, driven once again by Strategic Services, which increased 14.7% year-over-year. As I've said, Strategic Services, which include Terremark are growing portion of our revenue mix, representing 51% of total enterprise revenue in the fourth quarter.
From a profitability perspective, the fourth quarter Wireline EBITDA margin recovered nicely from the challenges of the third quarter, increasing 240 basis points sequentially to 23.8%. 
Let's take a closer look at our revenue performance, starting with mass markets on Slide 12.
Fourth quarter revenue for mass markets increased 0.7% on a year-over-year basis. Consumer revenue, which represents a majority of this category, grew 1.3% in the quarter. Consumer ARPU steadily increased throughout the year and is now more than $96. I would also highlight that our residential connections trends continue to improve. We lost 183,000 retail residential connections in the fourth quarter, representing the 7.3% decline, compared with the loss of 303,000 or 9% in the fourth quarter of last year. 
In broadband, we added 201,000 FiOS Internet subscribers in the quarter, increasing our subscriber base to 4.8 million and penetration to 36%. By adding in our 3.9 million high-speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with a total of 8.7 million broadband connections, adding a net positive 98,000 broadband connections in the fourth quarter. 
In FiOS Video, we added 194,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.2 million and increasing our penetration to 32%. Within our FiOS subscriber base, about 3.5 million customers are triple play and FiOS ARPU increased in the fourth quarter to more than $148 per month. In terms of our deployment, we ended the year with 16.5 million premises passed, adding just over 900,000 in 2011. We had 13.6 million homes open for sale for Internet and 13.3 million for video.
From my perspective, 2011 was a very good year for FiOS, both operationally and financially. For the full year, FiOS revenue grew 20% to $8.3 billion. Looking ahead, our focus will once again be to increase penetration, drive market and wallet share gains, realize more efficiency from a cost perspective and expand margins. 
Let's move next to our business markets, starting with Global Enterprise.
Strategic Services continued to drive the year-over-year improvement in Global Enterprise revenue, led by very strong growth in advanced services such as managed network, call center, IP communications and our cloud offerings. In the fourth quarter, these services totaled $2 billion, up 14.7% year-over-year, representing just over half of Global Enterprise revenue. As we've seen for the last several quarters, the growth in Strategic Services outpaced the decline in core Enterprise Services. Terremark revenues were up about 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter and roughly 18% year-over-year.
Within our Global Enterprise solutions, we are focused on shifting our product mix to higher gross service offerings and we continue to gain traction here. In less strategic areas like core voice, data and hardware, we've continued to look for ways to improve overall margin profitability. One example is our deemphasis on sales of hardware or CPE, particularly drop-ship equipment that is not part of an overall enterprise solutions bundle. 
During 2011, hardware sales were down roughly $340 million on an annual basis. In the fourth quarter alone, hardware revenue was down $147 million or 21.6% year-over-year. Looking at the services revenue component of Global Enterprises reveals a more positive growth trend. In the fourth quarter, Enterprise Services revenue grew 2.7% year-over-year, excluding Terremark, which was not part of our results a year ago. If Terremark was included, the rate of growth would've been higher but would not represent a true baseline.
In Global Wholesale, revenues in the fourth quarter declined 7.6% year-over-year due primarily to declines in voice, where we continued to experience secular pressures and lower volumes, offset in part by increases in certain data services. Our deemphasis of certain nonprofitable International Voice routes created downward pressure on revenue, but did contribute to improved wholesale margins. 
Let's move to Slide 14 for our 2011 wrap up.
We had a strong finish to a very solid year in 2011, giving us great momentum and confidence heading into the new year. Wireless, FiOS and Enterprise Strategic Services all contributed to significant improvements and adjusted revenue growth, where we moved from just under 2% in 2010 to more than 6% in 2011. These revenue improvements and our focus on capturing operating efficiencies helped us to mitigate various cost pressures throughout the business, creating solid growth in earnings and strong free cash flow, supported by our disciplined approach to capital spending. 
On the strategic front, we made a number of investments that have improved our competitive position and differentiated us in the marketplace, setting the stage for future growth and improved profitability. I believe investors recognized our progress in 2011, as our stock price appreciation and competitive dividend generated a total return to shareholders of 18.2%.
We enter 2012 with great confidence in our ability to take advantage of the market opportunities we see in our key strategic growth areas. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, you will see a renewed focus on delivering solutions to all of our customers and the markets that we serve by better leveraging our capabilities across all parts of the business. Our Global Enterprise solutions organization is just one example, highlighting a more integrated approach in how we develop and deliver customer solutions, including a vertical industry focus into areas like education and healthcare as examples. 
Another example is the way in which we are managing our top multinational accounts in collaboration with Vodafone where this makes sense for both companies. In terms of our acquisition of AWS spectrum from SpectrumCo, we are looking forward to closing the transaction after review by the Department of Justice and approval by the FCC, which we anticipate by midyear. We are also making progress in our additional agreements with the cable companies subject to the DOJ's expected review. 
Just last week, Comcast and Verizon announced that we are offering each other's products and services in Seattle and Portland as our initial markets. We expect to launch in additional cities in the coming months.
We have great momentum in Wireless and we expect to build on that strength, driving further penetration of smartphones and furthering our leadership position in 4G LTE. In FiOS, we expect to drive higher penetration in existing markets and effectively capture pent-up demand in multidwelling units and new markets. And in the enterprise space, we are clearly gaining traction as the leading global provider in the information technology solution space. The integration of Terremark and the addition of CloudSwitch have significantly improved our competitive position, giving us a unique set of capabilities to combine solutions around the network, data center, security and cloud infrastructure. 
Another key focus area will be to continue to drive operating efficiencies across and throughout the entire business. With the formation of our operational excellence and process transformation organization, reporting directly to Lowell, we are devoting dedicated resources to examining all costs and processes including product rationalization, back office operations and system consolidation. The upshot of our ability to execute and capture these incremental revenue opportunities and operating efficiencies will be an increase in the cash flows of the business. 
As I've said, the heavy investment cycles of the first 10 years of Verizon are largely behind us, and we have transformed ourselves into a company very well positioned in the growth markets of the future. We have the platforms, we have the people and we have the capabilities. We are poised to build on the strong foundation we have, accelerate the momentum we've achieved, further increase investment returns and create significant shareholder value in the years to come.
With that, I will turn the call back to John, so we can get to your questions."

Based on what you're seeing now, how do you expect those sort of growth trends on the postpaid ARPU side to progress, maybe in the first quarter and an outlook for 2012, if possible?"

Actually, John and I are doing this call remotely from our Innovation Center up here in Waltham, which is just a pillar of how we're going to accelerate our growth in the future. As of many of you visited this facility, you saw the innovation of the products and the services, which I believe are pioneer in the industry of developing these types of solutions that will increase our revenue from a machine-to-machine perspective and everything that is going to be driven over our LTE network, which we believe we are a market leader in. So if you take the Wireless asset and then the FiOS asset and you look back at to what we said back in January of 2011, when Lowell and I first stood on this stage live, we stated that we had a year of execution in front of us and we ha certain targets that we wanted to hit. And I think that coming out of this year, I would say that my position has not changed from where I stood on that stage. So growth opportunities for the future, I believe, are there. As I said in my script remarks, I believe that the $2.15, as you look at it for 2012, should be a baseline of $2.20 as you project our growth out. But I would reiterate that my position from January has not changed as I sit here at the end of this year. Going on to postpaid ARPU growth, I think, if you look at this, we continue to grow our ARPU growth. I think that from an overall perspective, if you break that down, we had our phone ARPU grow to an all-time high of 4%. Now if you look back, that was 3.3% in the second quarter. That went up to 3.7% in the third and now sitting at 4% overall. So you can see that the smartphone penetration is accelerating that phone ARPU growth. As we've talked in the past, the Internet category has some dilution in it. So year-over-year, we're down 11% and this is reflected back when we changed our prices back in October perspective. So on an ARPU perspective of Internet devices, down 11%, but overall revenue growth from that category as we said, we did this to expand the category. And again, this quarter, we were up 24% year-over-year in the amount of Internet devices we added and we continue to have our strongest quarter of the year. So we are executing on the expansion of that category. So year-over-year, the actual revenue is up 10%, even though that there is some dilution in the ARPU side. So I think, John, to answer your question, I'm extremely positive and I stay with what I've said coming out of the third quarter. We continue to see that we can accrete our ARPU into the future of 2012."

First, start off with FiOS and our continued penetration there and we continue to gain market share in every market. New York continues to be our highest growing market there. So FiOS is a critical component to the growth of the Wireline on a top line basis. The other strategy that we've talked about a little bit in the past is the strategy of migrating our copper plant over to the FiOS plant, now that we have substantial FiOS passing prems, where there is also copper. So what you're going to going to see this year is a very strategic initiative that we go out and we look at areas, where there are chronic copper problems and we start to transform them onto our FiOS network. And the math would say, if there is a chronic problem that we have to visit more than 2x a year, the actual financial benefit of us transforming that to FiOS pays for itself within that year. So we will strategically start to go in there. What that brings is, that brings an enormous expense savings to us from just an overall operational plant perspective. That's one big component. The second is, obviously, with the new organization of Enterprise, we believe that with the acquisitions of Terremark and CloudSwitch, we continue to grow that top line. As I said, Terremark had an outstanding quarter, sequentially up 10%. That came out of a September all-time high booking. That will continue into '12 because, obviously, those bookings don't book all in the same quarter that you sell. In this business, it takes 6 to 12 months to record that revenue. So I think we're continuing to expand on our cloud services bases, which also helps top line revenue for Wireline. And then you get into the cost initiatives, which continue to really be a focus of the whole business unit. So from a foundational standpoint, what I would say is this, on a linear basis, you will see us increase Wireline margin. Will we have some setbacks here and there? Obviously, in the first quarter, we have a lot of tax resets and so forth. So from that perspective, you may see us decline a little bit in the first quarter. But from that point, we will accelerate and continue to overall improve the Wireline margin of the business. Now on the improvement side, I would tell you that we continue, from a labor negotiation standpoint, we continue to negotiate at the table. Obviously, as I said before, we expect that we need to reconfigure the cost structure of our Wireline business. And that gets to the heart of the healthcare and the pension benefits of the Wireline representative and employees. So our position has not changed, we will continue to negotiate in good faith with the union. And we'll report out when those negotiations are ended and where we end for that contractual period."

And then staying on wireless, you noted that there was some pressure on other service revenues from wholesale, roaming, I think that you lost your Telematics customer. Can you just give us a little bit more color about -- around that and what's going to sort of make that better in 2012?"

So if you look at our LTE lineup and just to give you some numbers. We sold almost 15 million Android-based products, and if you do the math for the quarter, it's about 10.8 million iPhone products. So they're both extremely significant to our portfolio. If you look at LTE, we're coming out of the year with almost 18 devices on our network and we will add 6 more in the first quarter of this year, leading us to 24. So I think that the way we look at it is, our momentum coming out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter and, obviously, the first quarter will be more of what we saw in the first 3 quarters because, obviously, the fourth quarter is always a much higher volume quarter just because of seasonality. So I would think that, Simon, on this one, what I would say is this: is we have a proven track record in Wireless that we both drive profitability and growth. And I would expect that in 2012, we will get back to and continue to improve on the Wireless margins. So if you look at what we did in the third quarter, going back, we had an iPhone in our portfolio. We had 3 quarters under our belt with a very real large lineup of 4G LTE devices, and we produced the highest margin in Wireless in the history of the Wireless business at 47.8% margins. So, I guess, what I would say to you is, is that we will strive to continue to improve on the Wireless margins, not only on the top line growth perspective, but we also in the last 2 years trimmed out almost $3 billion of cost in our Wireless business. So again, I think the focus will be to improve and continue to grow, as well improve on the profitability of the Wireless margins. On the wholesale side, there are 2 things happening. Obviously, I reported out that the third quarter, that with the sale of the Alltel properties, we knew that AT&T would be moving that traffic off of our network, which they did. And then in the reseller base, I think it's very important to note that the resellers that we have contracts with are mainly prepaid resellers. And as I've said in the past, as this has declined in the last couple of quarters, we have an issue with us which is, I will only enter into agreements that are win-win for both. And right now, the market is at a point, where I'm not going to compete on the wholesale rates that are in the marketplace. Although this is an extremely important channel for us and we continue to work with our highest resellers, we do have a shift mix in the reseller base. So we added 371,000 net reseller adds, but some of this is a mix change going into lower, what I would call, live source-type offerings and more universal service fund-type offerings, so they carry a lower ARPU than some of our historical prepaid voice resellers would. But overall, the profitability of this is still very substantial. But I also think it's important to note that as we attack the prepaid market, we performed and launched our Unleashed product which, coming out of the third quarter I said, and was very optimistic, that this would be the first quarter that we showed positive net adds in that product space and we actually did. So from a net perspective, we had net adds in prepaid for the first time in, at least in the past 2 years. So we are starting to gain momentum in the prepaid market, both through the reseller channel but also through our unleashed channel. So I think that's what you can continue to see. So that's for the wholesale roaming side."

And I think you've seen that Verizon Wireless has managed this extremely efficiently by moving higher end Internet devices off of the 3G network onto our 4G network. And just one other note is, in the fourth quarter, all of our Internet devices sold, 100% of those adds, were all on the 4G LTE network. So I think from a CapEx standpoint, what I would say is, I would not expect any change here from a disciplined capital spending coming out of the back end of 2011 going into '12. And as I said, we will continue to improve our overall CapEx-to-revenue ratio. So I wouldn't expect you to see anything differently than what we've executed on through 2011. As far as cash outlay, from a cash tax perspective, as you know, the bonus depreciation is Safe Harbor for 2012. So there really is no additional cash tax from the bonus depreciation and, obviously, there's still a lot of things that we're looking at for 2012 from a bonus depreciation discussion down in Washington, of an extension of that, possible overall corporate tax restructure. So we look at those things. But I will tell you, that even without that, we continue on a very complex organization of taxes for federal purposes, continue to strategize and continue to think of how we best utilize our structure to make sure that we have as minimal cash outlay as possible from a cash tax perspective. The only thing I will highlight from a cash differentiation for 2012 is the pension plan contribution, as I talked about. This will go from $400 million up to $1.26 million (sic) for '12, and those contributions will be made more or less smoothly through the year, but the first and the third quarter will be around $400 million and then evenly in the second and fourth quarters. So that really is the only change from what I would expect from a cash outlay. The only other thing I would say is, as our profits continue to increase and we grow bottom line, obviously, our cash taxes will increase with them."

We have now over 200 million POPs covered, which exceeded what our original plans were to achieve 185 million POPs. And as I said, we initially told that we would have 3G and 4G coverage about the same by the end of 2013, and we have now said by mid-2013, we'll have that coverage fulfilled. So, I think, from just an overall leadership position and a market position, I think we're in great shape. From a pricing perspective, obviously, we did the fourth quarter promotion, where we said we doubled your allowance coming, so that we would have more enticement of people looking at the 4G product. And as you can see, we had our all-time high of 4G devices moved, of over 2.4 million devices in the quarter moved, from that strategy. So I think overall pricing what I would say is this, I think you'll see more movement on device pricing than you will on overall service pricing. We'll have to see what the competitive marketplace holds for this. But I think that from just an overall perspective, LTE will be a market leadership for us. And it's not only around just the retail market, but we can't lose sight of the machine-to-machine market. And obviously, I said, I was sitting up here in the innovation lab, there is a lot of technology and innovation that's going to come out around an automobile, around healthcare, around energy conservation that really will leap bound anything that we see currently in the marketplace today. So I think that from a machine-to-machine perspective, we continue to see growth in our adds quarter-over-quarter, and I see that continuing through 2012 and have a market leadership position there."

They have $11.6 billion of debt, so they're actually in a surplus position of $700 million. For 2012, they have about $1.6 billion of maturities coming that will be paid down. And as I said, within the next week, we will have a $10 billion distribution to both of the parents there. So that's the situation of the cash and the debt on the Wireless side. From an enterprise perspective, I think that it's critical here, just overall, with this organizational structure that Lowell has set up with the Enterprise Solutions Group. It is key for us because, I said before, as we approached our enterprise customers, we still had a delineation between a wireless solution and a wireline solution. And now that the organizations come together with the product rationalization that I talked about, it's going to be critical for us to present one solution to our customer end-to-end. And that really, I think, will elevate where we are today just from an overall strategic services position. But to get to your question, Mike, about exactly what are we selling. Obviously, cloud services, the acquisition of Terremark, the addition of CloudSwitch, the opening of the NAP center in Amsterdam, the expansion of our São Paulo, Brazil data center which quite honestly, up to the acquisition of Terremark, Verizon really never played or had a position in Latin America, so this is a very high growth area for us. So I think, one, absolutely around the cloud, but also the convergence of cloud and what that brings to -- from an overall enterprise mobility standpoint and the integration of that cloud and that mobility solution when you look at machine-to-machine and cloud and what that can bring to an enterprise customer in a vertical solution set. So I think you're going to see more and more around cloud, but machine-to-machine. And then obviously, around our IT and advanced communication offerings. But there also is a differentiation as to what we sell here in North America versus what we sell outside of North America. And as I said before, outside on international, again, this quarter we grew our international enterprise base by an excess of 9%. So even with all of the pressures you see around the world, we continue to grow. Now, obviously, that's because of our low market share in those markets, but continued growth for us. And as we expand internationally, I think you'll see more international growth out of us, especially around the cloud services. And as I said, the collaboration of Vodafone where it makes sense. So I think there's a couple of different facets there, but I am very -- I have a very good outlook for our Enterprise revenue growth going into '12, even with the continued stabilization of the economy and we have not forecasted much growth there but stabilization would be a key. And if there is growth there, then I think we are even more optimistic on our Enterprise growth."

And there will probably be some more price increases in 2012 as we go here. But I think the differentiation we have here is, we have a superior product in FiOS. It is taking hold in the marketplace. We are seeing, as I said, New York is our highest growing market. This past year, we crossed a milestone in Virginia. We passed 40% penetration on our video services. You can see we had a good quarter on broadband connection in FiOS. And I think if you look at the line loss that we set at 7.2%, you can see that, that strategy of the chronic, we started that in the fourth quarter of this year a little bit. You can see that we are starting to convert copper voice customers onto FiOS. So continuing to grow and hold on to that declining revenue stream of the legacy products. So I think, overall, FiOS will continue to play a very important strategic role in the future of Wireline. We will compete vigorously with this, even with the agreements that we entered into with the cable companies. If you look at the innovation agreement, that innovation will come into FiOS. And being a superior product already, that innovation will add what we can bring to the consumer base from an overall perspective. So I think, overall, I'm very optimistic on our FiOS penetration for 2012."

We set our tier pricing structure when we launched our 4G network. And as I've said, the way we positioned our 4G tier pricing was that based on our future view of where usage would go, we saw that we had opportunity from a tiered structure and the proliferation of video through the LTE network that we would grow our revenue streams. And that's what we're seeing just from an overall tiered pricing structure. As we continue to mature this, we have said that we are looking at family data plans, if you will, and we continue to look at that. And obviously, the play there is, is to make sure that it's a win-win for the customer and a win-win for us from an accretion standpoint. So we continue to work that. But I think that it's important to note that we are a premium-priced product, but we will win in the marketplace just like we did with Unleashed even though that, that's priced $10 above the market. We now see that there are niches of people that want to be on the best network in the world. So I think that will continue to be our strategy, and we'll see here as 2012 goes. As far as Wireline goes on that, I think wholesale, we continue to see pressure on the wholesale side of the business just from a legacy voice. And as we transform this business from a legacy voice business to a data business, continue with our fiber to the cell  program, which we are building out for various wireless carriers. This continues to be very good business for us, but not quite enough to offset the voice loss. So I think we'll continue to see pressure in there going into 2012. As far as the other category, this is legacy MCI 108 traffic, call collect-type traffic, which will continue to decline. It's not something that's strategic for us and we'll just really move that as a cash cow at this point, and that will continue to decline. So overall, the focus here is on the consumer Wireline margin, the Enterprise portfolio and then also the wholesale portfolio."

Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning, I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is Fran Shammo.
Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.
I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.
This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, we reported a loss of $0.71 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include a noncash pension and benefits charge of $5.6 billion on a pretax basis. This mark-to-market adjustment related to our current year asset returns, discount rate and mortality assumption changes in our pension and postretirement plans. This adjustment is in accordance with the accounting policy we adopted a year ago, which requires us to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur and not smooth the effects over a longer period of time. 
Adjusting for $1.23 per share of nonoperational items, fourth quarter EPS was $0.52, bringing our full year 2011 adjusted EPS to $2.15. The comparable adjusted EPS in 2010 was $2.08. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran."

Before we get into the details, let me start with a few summary comments. We finished the year very strong, creating value for our shareholders in 2011 by generating a total return of 18.2% through a combination of stock price appreciation of 12.1% and our dividend payments. Our stock price appreciation outpaced our peers, as well as the S&P, Dow Jones and broader indices. For the fifth consecutive year, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase, indicating their confidence in the sustainability of our business model, cash flows and our improving earnings profile into 2012 and beyond.
In 2011, we also made some smart investments for the future growth and improved profitability. While very disciplined in our approach to capital spending, we continue to invest in networks and new technologies, which will be the platform for accelerated growth. 
On the strategic front, we made some moves that will significantly improve our competitive position. These include the acquisitions of Terremark and CloudSwitch in the cloud computing space, several agreements to purchase additional spectrum, joint efforts around innovation with a number of partners including the cable companies and, of course, our continued leadership in the rapid development of the 4G LTE ecosystem. 
We also renewed our focus on delivering solutions to customers and the markets we serve by better leveraging our capabilities across all parts of the business, wireless, FiOS, Strategic Services, the cloud, digital media and our global high-speed IP network. Our recently formed Global Enterprise solutions organization will strengthen our ability to provide fully integrated customer solutions. 
In addition to making these investments in our future, 2011 was a great year of solid execution. We posted record revenue growth in the fourth quarter, resulting in adjusted revenue growth of 6.2% for the full year, a significant acceleration from just below 2% growth in 2010. In addition to our strong revenue results, our sharp focus on capturing operating efficiencies helped us to mitigate a number of cost pressures, driving an increase to consolidated EBITDA of more than $950 million. 
We also had a strong year in terms of cash generation with $13.5 billion in free cash flow. 2011 was an impressive year on a number of fronts, giving us tremendous confidence about our long-term growth prospects.
Now let's turn our attention to the fourth quarter, starting with a few highlights. 
As I just noted, we had a very strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter. Our 7.7% year-over-year growth was easily our highest quarterly growth of the year, and in fact, the highest quarterly growth since the formation of Verizon 11 years ago. In wireless, we had our best quarter ever in terms of smartphone sales, 4G LTE device sales and customer upgrades, along with the most retail gross adds in the 3 years. We lead the industry in retail postpaid connections and our 1.2 million postpaid net adds this quarter demonstrates that we continue to gain market share. We are by far the market leader in 4G LTE, which is now available in 195 markets covering more than 200 million POPs, with increasing customer awareness of its superior speeds, capabilities and new high-quality devices.
4G LTE is really taking hold. In addition to record device sales in the quarter, we are seeing a high-level activity at our innovation centers in Waltham and San Francisco. We currently offer about 20 4G LTE smartphone and data devices, and at CES, we announced 2 more mobile hotspots now called Jetpacks. Three smartphones: 2 for Motorola and one from LG and the Samsung Galaxy Tablet. Clearly, the Verizon 4G LTE network is becoming the destination of choice for consumer and enterprise customers, which is a strong indicator for us looking forward.
In Wireline, our revenue mix continues to improve, with FiOS representing 61% of our consumer revenue and enterprise Strategic Services making up 51% of our Global Enterprise revenue in the quarter. We effectively worked through the numerous challenges of the third quarter to restore Wireline segment profitability. Wireline EBITDA increased to $2.4 billion in the quarter, resulting in a 23.8% EBITDA margin, in line with where we ended the second quarter. Now that we are back on track, I am confident that we will see Wireline margin expansion in 2012. Again, a strong finish to a solid year, making us very confident about our growth opportunities in 2012 and beyond.
Let's turn to Slide 5 next. Fourth quarter consolidated revenues grew 7.7% year-over-year, resulting in adjusted annual growth of 6.2%, solidly within our 2011 guidance range of 4% to 8%. Reported earnings for the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis were a net loss of $0.71 per share due to the significant noncash charge associated with our pension and postretirement plans. The largest component of this actuarial true-up, has to do with our discount rate assumption, which was 5.75% at the beginning of the year. At the end of the year, this rate is adjusted to an estimate of the yields of high-quality long-term bonds, which was determined to be 5%. 
Another part of this true-up relates to our return on pension assets. We assumed an 8% ROA at the beginning of the year and we came in at 5% for the year. There were also adjustments required based on mortality assumption changes. Excluding non-operational items, we earned $0.52 per share in the quarter, bringing our full year 2011 adjusted EPS result to $2.15, up 3.4% from a comparable $2.08 per share in 2010. 
Coming out of the third quarter, we indicated that we were on track to meet our 2011 earnings guidance of 5% to 8% growth. Earlier this month, I indicated that a very strong December resulted in higher-than-expected wireless device sales, which sets up well for 2012 but resulted in us falling a little short of our full year EPS growth target by $0.02. I would also remind you that our $2.15 adjusted result included $0.05 of negative impact, primarily from the storms in the third quarter. So from my perspective, an adjusted EPS of $2.20 is a more logical starting point for you when considering our 2012 earnings growth potential.
Let's turn next to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 6. Our free cash flow in the fourth quarter and full year was once again a combination of strong cash generation and reduced levels of capital spending. Capital expenditures for the full year totaled $16.2 billion, representing a decrease of 1.3% from 2010. In addition to being lower than the prior year, the $16.2 billion was favorable to our guidance of $16.5 billion. 
Our capital efficiency has improved steadily and was below 15% for the year. With the heavy investment cycles necessary to transform our business largely behind us, we would expect our CapEx to revenue ratio, which is already at a historical low, to continue declining based on disciplined capital spending and improving revenue growth trends. 
In Wireless, capital spending in the fourth quarter was $1.8 billion, bringing the full year to $9 billion, an increase of 6.3%. The incremental spending in 2011 was a combination of 3G capacity requirements, driven by the Apple iPhone and the continued rapid expansion of our 4G LTE network. 
In 2012, we will continue to migrate traffic from our 3G EV-DO network to 4G LTE, thereby freeing up 3G capacity and improving our capital and operating efficiencies. 
In addition, we will continue to expand our 4G LTE network coverage, which is already the largest in the nation and our target is to have 4G LTE coverage similar to our 3G coverage by mid-2013.
In Wireline, capital spending was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $6.4 billion, a decline of more than $800 million or 12%. The decline in spending was driven by lower FiOS build-out cost, as well as efficiency gains from investing in newer technologies. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the year in a strong financial position. Total debt was $55.2 billion and net debt was $41.8 billion. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.2x. As a reminder, the previously announced $10 billion Verizon Wireless cash distribution will occur next week. 
Let's now move into a review of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7.
Our Wireless business had another impressive quarter of growth, particularly with regard to retail customer activity. Total revenue grew to $18.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Retail service revenue, which includes both postpaid and prepaid, grew 7.8% year-over-year, which is a 90-basis point improvement in growth over the third quarter. 
Total service revenue in the quarter grew 6.4% year-over-year, up from 6.1% growth in the third quarter. Within total service revenues, growth was impacted by year-over-year declines in roaming and wholesale revenue, which collectively amounted to roughly $140 million in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we expect to see less impact on year-over-year growth rates from these factors as we move through 2012.
Total data revenue grew to $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 19.2% year-over-year. Data now represents 41.6% of total service revenue. Data revenue growth continued to be driven by web and email services, which increased to $4 billion in the quarter, up more than 34% year-over-year. Messaging revenue, which makes up about 30% of total data, grew nearly 4% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. 
Let's take a closer look at our connections growth on Slide 8. We ended the year with industry-leading total connections of 108.7 million, up 6.3% from 2010. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market with 87.4 million connections, driven by demand for our unmatched portfolio of 3G and 4G LTE handsets and Internet data devices. Retail net adds of 1.5 million in the quarter were the highest we've seen in 3 years. Within retail, 1.2 million were postpaid and 252,000 were prepaid. Within the postpaid net add mix, 1 million were smartphones and 400,000 were Internet data devices. The remaining being the net change in basic phones. Of particular interest, more than 700,000 of these net adds were 4G LTE smartphones or data devices.
In retail prepaid, fourth quarter net add growth was equally distributed between tablets and phones. This quarter marks the first time in 2 years that prepaid phones, excluding tablets, had positive net adds. This is due to the success of our $50 monthly unlimited prepaid phone offer, which we put in place on a national basis in mid-September. 
Postpaid device sales, which include both gross adds and upgrades, were significantly higher this quarter, driven by the Apple iPhone 4S, as well as the increasing popularity of our 4G LTE smartphones and Internet data devices. Retail postpaid gross adds totaled 3.6 million in the quarter, an increase of 10% sequentially and 7.6% year-over-year. The percentage of postpaid customers upgrading this quarter moved up to 10%.
The continued demand for our wireless products is not only driving growth in connections and revenue, but also strengthening our industry-leading customer loyalty metrics. Our churn metrics this quarter were excellent once again, with retail postpaid churn of only 0.94%, an improvement of 7 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 and take a closer look at our smartphones and retail postpaid ARPU metrics.
As I said, we had a record quarter in terms of smartphone sales, increasing the penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 44%. A year ago, smartphone penetration was 28%. We have made very good progress in 2011. 70% of all retail postpaid phones sold this quarter were smartphones, a solid increase from 60% in each of the last 2 quarters. 
During the quarter, we activated 4.3 million Apple iPhones and sold 1.6 million 4G LTE smartphones. In addition, we sold roughly 700,000 4G LTE Internet data devices. As I said, sales of 4G LTE products are clearly gaining momentum. 
Shifting now to ARPU. Retail postpaid ARPU was $54.80 this quarter, up 2.5% year-over-year. Retail postpaid phone ARPU exceeds $56, up 4% on a year-over-year basis. Postpaid Internet devices have an ARPU of just under $49, which was down 11% from a year ago. This decline was mainly due to a strategic price change we made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We made this pricing move to expand the market, given our expectation that the superior capabilities of 4G LTE will generate more demand and increase data usage on these devices. We did expand the market in 2011 with approximately 3.8 million unit sales, which included mobile hotspots, USB modems and tablets. We now have about 7 million subscribers with these devices, representing about 8% of our retail postpaid base.
While the unit growth of these devices is diluting our overall retail postpaid ARPU at this time, fourth quarter revenue growth from these devices was 10% on a year-over-year basis. In addition to making a positive contribution to top line growth, the greater efficiency of our 4G LTE network means that this data revenue is also generating higher margins and driving improved profitability. 
Let's conclude our Wireless segment review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 10.
2011 was another strong year of industry leadership in terms of margin performance and cash generation. With the introduction of the Apple iPhone and numerous 4G LTE smartphones during the year, we indicated last January that margins would fluctuate in certain quarters depending on new device rollouts and sales. 
Looking back on our quarterly margin performance in 2011, shows this to be the case, with strong sales in the first and fourth quarters pressuring EBITDA. As I mentioned, the sales volumes in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations but, obviously, will create more opportunity for growth in 2012.
Our strong performance in terms of customer additions and market share gains, coupled with increased smartphone penetration, drove increases in retail service revenues and accelerating phone ARPU. In addition, our intense focus on cost efficiency is clearly helping to mitigate the cost of higher equipment subsidies. Our industry-leading customer retention has also helped the margin and performance, which is a testament to the quality and reliability of our network and to the overall customer experience. 
Verizon Wireless continues to be the industry leader. And with another year of impressive overall performance, we've built great momentum heading into a new year, expecting to sustain our strong growth and profitability. 
Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 11. Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $10.1 billion, a decline of $150 million or 1.5% year-over-year. With the full year Wireline revenue totaled $40.7 billion, down 1.3%. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenue grew 1.3% year-over-year, driven by FiOS revenue growth of 18.2%. In Global Enterprise, fourth quarter revenue also grew 1.3%, driven once again by Strategic Services, which increased 14.7% year-over-year. As I've said, Strategic Services, which include Terremark are growing portion of our revenue mix, representing 51% of total enterprise revenue in the fourth quarter.
From a profitability perspective, the fourth quarter Wireline EBITDA margin recovered nicely from the challenges of the third quarter, increasing 240 basis points sequentially to 23.8%. 
Let's take a closer look at our revenue performance, starting with mass markets on Slide 12.
Fourth quarter revenue for mass markets increased 0.7% on a year-over-year basis. Consumer revenue, which represents a majority of this category, grew 1.3% in the quarter. Consumer ARPU steadily increased throughout the year and is now more than $96. I would also highlight that our residential connections trends continue to improve. We lost 183,000 retail residential connections in the fourth quarter, representing the 7.3% decline, compared with the loss of 303,000 or 9% in the fourth quarter of last year. 
In broadband, we added 201,000 FiOS Internet subscribers in the quarter, increasing our subscriber base to 4.8 million and penetration to 36%. By adding in our 3.9 million high-speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with a total of 8.7 million broadband connections, adding a net positive 98,000 broadband connections in the fourth quarter. 
In FiOS Video, we added 194,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.2 million and increasing our penetration to 32%. Within our FiOS subscriber base, about 3.5 million customers are triple play and FiOS ARPU increased in the fourth quarter to more than $148 per month. In terms of our deployment, we ended the year with 16.5 million premises passed, adding just over 900,000 in 2011. We had 13.6 million homes open for sale for Internet and 13.3 million for video.
From my perspective, 2011 was a very good year for FiOS, both operationally and financially. For the full year, FiOS revenue grew 20% to $8.3 billion. Looking ahead, our focus will once again be to increase penetration, drive market and wallet share gains, realize more efficiency from a cost perspective and expand margins. 
Let's move next to our business markets, starting with Global Enterprise.
Strategic Services continued to drive the year-over-year improvement in Global Enterprise revenue, led by very strong growth in advanced services such as managed network, call center, IP communications and our cloud offerings. In the fourth quarter, these services totaled $2 billion, up 14.7% year-over-year, representing just over half of Global Enterprise revenue. As we've seen for the last several quarters, the growth in Strategic Services outpaced the decline in core Enterprise Services. Terremark revenues were up about 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter and roughly 18% year-over-year.
Within our Global Enterprise solutions, we are focused on shifting our product mix to higher gross service offerings and we continue to gain traction here. In less strategic areas like core voice, data and hardware, we've continued to look for ways to improve overall margin profitability. One example is our deemphasis on sales of hardware or CPE, particularly drop-ship equipment that is not part of an overall enterprise solutions bundle. 
During 2011, hardware sales were down roughly $340 million on an annual basis. In the fourth quarter alone, hardware revenue was down $147 million or 21.6% year-over-year. Looking at the services revenue component of Global Enterprises reveals a more positive growth trend. In the fourth quarter, Enterprise Services revenue grew 2.7% year-over-year, excluding Terremark, which was not part of our results a year ago. If Terremark was included, the rate of growth would've been higher but would not represent a true baseline.
In Global Wholesale, revenues in the fourth quarter declined 7.6% year-over-year due primarily to declines in voice, where we continued to experience secular pressures and lower volumes, offset in part by increases in certain data services. Our deemphasis of certain nonprofitable International Voice routes created downward pressure on revenue, but did contribute to improved wholesale margins. 
Let's move to Slide 14 for our 2011 wrap up.
We had a strong finish to a very solid year in 2011, giving us great momentum and confidence heading into the new year. Wireless, FiOS and Enterprise Strategic Services all contributed to significant improvements and adjusted revenue growth, where we moved from just under 2% in 2010 to more than 6% in 2011. These revenue improvements and our focus on capturing operating efficiencies helped us to mitigate various cost pressures throughout the business, creating solid growth in earnings and strong free cash flow, supported by our disciplined approach to capital spending. 
On the strategic front, we made a number of investments that have improved our competitive position and differentiated us in the marketplace, setting the stage for future growth and improved profitability. I believe investors recognized our progress in 2011, as our stock price appreciation and competitive dividend generated a total return to shareholders of 18.2%.
We enter 2012 with great confidence in our ability to take advantage of the market opportunities we see in our key strategic growth areas. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, you will see a renewed focus on delivering solutions to all of our customers and the markets that we serve by better leveraging our capabilities across all parts of the business. Our Global Enterprise solutions organization is just one example, highlighting a more integrated approach in how we develop and deliver customer solutions, including a vertical industry focus into areas like education and healthcare as examples. 
Another example is the way in which we are managing our top multinational accounts in collaboration with Vodafone where this makes sense for both companies. In terms of our acquisition of AWS spectrum from SpectrumCo, we are looking forward to closing the transaction after review by the Department of Justice and approval by the FCC, which we anticipate by midyear. We are also making progress in our additional agreements with the cable companies subject to the DOJ's expected review. 
Just last week, Comcast and Verizon announced that we are offering each other's products and services in Seattle and Portland as our initial markets. We expect to launch in additional cities in the coming months.
We have great momentum in Wireless and we expect to build on that strength, driving further penetration of smartphones and furthering our leadership position in 4G LTE. In FiOS, we expect to drive higher penetration in existing markets and effectively capture pent-up demand in multidwelling units and new markets. And in the enterprise space, we are clearly gaining traction as the leading global provider in the information technology solution space. The integration of Terremark and the addition of CloudSwitch have significantly improved our competitive position, giving us a unique set of capabilities to combine solutions around the network, data center, security and cloud infrastructure. 
Another key focus area will be to continue to drive operating efficiencies across and throughout the entire business. With the formation of our operational excellence and process transformation organization, reporting directly to Lowell, we are devoting dedicated resources to examining all costs and processes including product rationalization, back office operations and system consolidation. The upshot of our ability to execute and capture these incremental revenue opportunities and operating efficiencies will be an increase in the cash flows of the business. 
As I've said, the heavy investment cycles of the first 10 years of Verizon are largely behind us, and we have transformed ourselves into a company very well positioned in the growth markets of the future. We have the platforms, we have the people and we have the capabilities. We are poised to build on the strong foundation we have, accelerate the momentum we've achieved, further increase investment returns and create significant shareholder value in the years to come.
With that, I will turn the call back to John, so we can get to your questions."

Actually, John and I are doing this call remotely from our Innovation Center up here in Waltham, which is just a pillar of how we're going to accelerate our growth in the future.

Actually, John and I are doing this call remotely from our Innovation Center up here in Waltham, which is just a pillar of how we're going to accelerate our growth in the future. As of many of you visited this facility, you saw the innovation of the products and the services, which I believe are pioneer in the industry of developing these types of solutions that will increase our revenue from a machine-to-machine perspective and everything that is going to be driven over our LTE network, which we believe we are a market leader in. So if you take the Wireless asset and then the FiOS asset and you look back at to what we said back in January of 2011, when Lowell and I first stood on this stage live, we stated that we had a year of execution in front of us and we ha certain targets that we wanted to hit. And I think that coming out of this year, I would say that my position has not changed from where I stood on that stage. So growth opportunities for the future, I believe, are there. As I said in my script remarks, I believe that the $2.15, as you look at it for 2012, should be a baseline of $2.20 as you project our growth out. But I would reiterate that my position from January has not changed as I sit here at the end of this year. Going on to postpaid ARPU growth, I think, if you look at this, we continue to grow our ARPU growth. I think that from an overall perspective, if you break that down, we had our phone ARPU grow to an all-time high of 4%. Now if you look back, that was 3.3% in the second quarter. That went up to 3.7% in the third and now sitting at 4% overall. So you can see that the smartphone penetration is accelerating that phone ARPU growth. As we've talked in the past, the Internet category has some dilution in it. So year-over-year, we're down 11% and this is reflected back when we changed our prices back in October perspective. So on an ARPU perspective of Internet devices, down 11%, but overall revenue growth from that category as we said, we did this to expand the category. And again, this quarter, we were up 24% year-over-year in the amount of Internet devices we added and we continue to have our strongest quarter of the year. So we are executing on the expansion of that category. So year-over-year, the actual revenue is up 10%, even though that there is some dilution in the ARPU side. So I think, John, to answer your question, I'm extremely positive and I stay with what I've said coming out of the third quarter.

First, start off with FiOS and our continued penetration there and we continue to gain market share in every market. New York continues to be our highest growing market there. So FiOS is a critical component to the growth of the Wireline on a top line basis. The other strategy that we've talked about a little bit in the past is the strategy of migrating our copper plant over to the FiOS plant, now that we have substantial FiOS passing prems, where there is also copper. So what you're going to going to see this year is a very strategic initiative that we go out and we look at areas, where there are chronic copper problems and we start to transform them onto our FiOS network. And the math would say, if there is a chronic problem that we have to visit more than 2x a year, the actual financial benefit of us transforming that to FiOS pays for itself within that year. So we will strategically start to go in there. What that brings is, that brings an enormous expense savings to us from just an overall operational plant perspective. That's one big component. The second is, obviously, with the new organization of Enterprise, we believe that with the acquisitions of Terremark and CloudSwitch, we continue to grow that top line. As I said, Terremark had an outstanding quarter, sequentially up 10%. That came out of a September all-time high booking. That will continue into '12 because, obviously, those bookings don't book all in the same quarter that you sell. In this business, it takes 6 to 12 months to record that revenue. So I think we're continuing to expand on our cloud services bases, which also helps top line revenue for Wireline. And then you get into the cost initiatives, which continue to really be a focus of the whole business unit. So from a foundational standpoint, what I would say is this, on a linear basis, you will see us increase Wireline margin. Will we have some setbacks here and there? Obviously, in the first quarter, we have a lot of tax resets and so forth. So from that perspective, you may see us decline a little bit in the first quarter. But from that point, we will accelerate and continue to overall improve the Wireline margin of the business. Now on the improvement side, I would tell you that we continue, from a labor negotiation standpoint, we continue to negotiate at the table. Obviously, as I said before, we expect that we need to reconfigure the cost structure of our Wireline business. And that gets to the heart of the healthcare and the pension benefits of the Wireline representative and employees. So our position has not changed, we will continue to negotiate in good faith with the union. And we'll report out when those negotiations are ended and where we end for that contractual period."

And then staying on wireless, you noted that there was some pressure on other service revenues from wholesale, roaming, I think that you lost your Telematics customer. Can you just give us a little bit more color about -- around that and what's going to sort of make that better in 2012?"

So if you look at our LTE lineup and just to give you some numbers. We sold almost 15 million Android-based products, and if you do the math for the quarter, it's about 10.8 million iPhone products. So they're both extremely significant to our portfolio. If you look at LTE, we're coming out of the year with almost 18 devices on our network and we will add 6 more in the first quarter of this year, leading us to 24. So I think that the way we look at it is, our momentum coming out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter and, obviously, the first quarter will be more of what we saw in the first 3 quarters because, obviously, the fourth quarter is always a much higher volume quarter just because of seasonality. So I would think that, Simon, on this one, what I would say is this: is we have a proven track record in Wireless that we both drive profitability and growth. And I would expect that in 2012, we will get back to and continue to improve on the Wireless margins. So if you look at what we did in the third quarter, going back, we had an iPhone in our portfolio. We had 3 quarters under our belt with a very real large lineup of 4G LTE devices, and we produced the highest margin in Wireless in the history of the Wireless business at 47.8% margins. So, I guess, what I would say to you is, is that we will strive to continue to improve on the Wireless margins, not only on the top line growth perspective, but we also in the last 2 years trimmed out almost $3 billion of cost in our Wireless business. So again, I think the focus will be to improve and continue to grow, as well improve on the profitability of the Wireless margins. On the wholesale side, there are 2 things happening. Obviously, I reported out that the third quarter, that with the sale of the Alltel properties, we knew that AT&T would be moving that traffic off of our network, which they did. And then in the reseller base, I think it's very important to note that the resellers that we have contracts with are mainly prepaid resellers. And as I've said in the past, as this has declined in the last couple of quarters, we have an issue with us which is, I will only enter into agreements that are win-win for both. And right now, the market is at a point, where I'm not going to compete on the wholesale rates that are in the marketplace. Although this is an extremely important channel for us and we continue to work with our highest resellers, we do have a shift mix in the reseller base. So we added 371,000 net reseller adds, but some of this is a mix change going into lower, what I would call, live source-type offerings and more universal service fund-type offerings, so they carry a lower ARPU than some of our historical prepaid voice resellers would. But overall, the profitability of this is still very substantial. But I also think it's important to note that as we attack the prepaid market, we performed and launched our Unleashed product which, coming out of the third quarter I said, and was very optimistic, that this would be the first quarter that we showed positive net adds in that product space and we actually did. So from a net perspective, we had net adds in prepaid for the first time in, at least in the past 2 years. So we are starting to gain momentum in the prepaid market, both through the reseller channel but also through our unleashed channel. So I think that's what you can continue to see. So that's for the wholesale roaming side."

And I think you've seen that Verizon Wireless has managed this extremely efficiently by moving higher end Internet devices off of the 3G network onto our 4G network. And just one other note is, in the fourth quarter, all of our Internet devices sold, 100% of those adds, were all on the 4G LTE network. So I think from a CapEx standpoint, what I would say is, I would not expect any change here from a disciplined capital spending coming out of the back end of 2011 going into '12. And as I said, we will continue to improve our overall CapEx-to-revenue ratio. So I wouldn't expect you to see anything differently than what we've executed on through 2011. As far as cash outlay, from a cash tax perspective, as you know, the bonus depreciation is Safe Harbor for 2012. So there really is no additional cash tax from the bonus depreciation and, obviously, there's still a lot of things that we're looking at for 2012 from a bonus depreciation discussion down in Washington, of an extension of that, possible overall corporate tax restructure. So we look at those things. But I will tell you, that even without that, we continue on a very complex organization of taxes for federal purposes, continue to strategize and continue to think of how we best utilize our structure to make sure that we have as minimal cash outlay as possible from a cash tax perspective. The only thing I will highlight from a cash differentiation for 2012 is the pension plan contribution, as I talked about. This will go from $400 million up to $1.26 million for '12, and those contributions will be made more or less smoothly through the year, but the first and the third quarter will be around $400 million and then evenly in the second and fourth quarters. So that really is the only change from what I would expect from a cash outlay. The only other thing I would say is, as our profits continue to increase and we grow bottom line, obviously, our cash taxes will increase with them."

We have now over 200 million POPs covered, which exceeded what our original plans were to achieve 185 million POPs. And as I said, we initially told that we would have 3G and 4G coverage about the same by the end of 2013, and we have now said by mid-2013, we'll have that coverage fulfilled. So, I think, from just an overall leadership position and a market position, I think we're in great shape. From a pricing perspective, obviously, we did the fourth quarter promotion, where we said we doubled your allowance coming, so that we would have more enticement of people looking at the 4G product. And as you can see, we had our all-time high of 4G devices moved, of over 2.4 million devices in the quarter moved, from that strategy. So I think overall pricing what I would say is this, I think you'll see more movement on device pricing than you will on overall service pricing. We'll have to see what the competitive marketplace holds for this. But I think that from just an overall perspective, LTE will be a market leadership for us. And it's not only around just the retail market, but we can't lose sight of the machine-to-machine market. And obviously, I said, I was sitting up here in the innovation lab, there is a lot of technology and innovation that's going to come out around an automobile, around healthcare, around energy conservation that really will leap bound anything that we see currently in the marketplace today. So I think that from a machine-to-machine perspective, we continue to see growth in our adds quarter-over-quarter, and I see that continuing through 2012 and have a market leadership position there."

They have $11.6 billion of debt, so they're actually in a surplus position of $700 million. For 2012, they have about $1.6 billion of maturities coming that will be paid down. And as I said, within the next week, we will have a $10 billion distribution to both of the parents there. So that's the situation of the cash and the debt on the Wireless side. From an enterprise perspective, I think that it's critical here, just overall, with this organizational structure that Lowell has set up with the Enterprise Solutions Group. It is key for us because, I said before, as we approached our enterprise customers, we still had a delineation between a wireless solution and a wireline solution. And now that the organizations come together with the product rationalization that I talked about, it's going to be critical for us to present one solution to our customer end-to-end. And that really, I think, will elevate where we are today just from an overall strategic services position. But to get to your question, Mike, about exactly what are we selling. Obviously, cloud services, the acquisition of Terremark, the addition of CloudSwitch, the opening of the NAP center in Amsterdam, the expansion of our São Paulo, Brazil data center which quite honestly, up to the acquisition of Terremark, Verizon really never played or had a position in Latin America, so this is a very high growth area for us. So I think, one, absolutely around the cloud, but also the convergence of cloud and what that brings to -- from an overall enterprise mobility standpoint and the integration of that cloud and that mobility solution when you look at machine-to-machine and cloud and what that can bring to an enterprise customer in a vertical solution set. So I think you're going to see more and more around cloud, but machine-to-machine. And then obviously, around our IT and advanced communication offerings. But there also is a differentiation as to what we sell here in North America versus what we sell outside of North America. And as I said before, outside on international, again, this quarter we grew our international enterprise base by an excess of 9%. So even with all of the pressures you see around the world, we continue to grow. Now, obviously, that's because of our low market share in those markets, but continued growth for us. And as we expand internationally, I think you'll see more international growth out of us, especially around the cloud services. And as I said, the collaboration of Vodafone where it makes sense. So I think there's a couple of different facets there, but I am very -- I have a very good outlook for our Enterprise revenue growth going into '12, even with the continued stabilization of the economy and we have not forecasted much growth there but stabilization would be a key. And if there is growth there, then I think we are even more optimistic on our Enterprise growth."

We are seeing, as I said, New York is our highest growing market. This past year, we crossed a milestone in Virginia. We passed 40% penetration on our video services. You can see we had a good quarter on broadband connection in FiOS. And I think if you look at the line loss that we set at 7.2%, you can see that, that strategy of the chronic, we started that in the fourth quarter of this year a little bit. You can see that we are starting to convert copper voice customers onto FiOS. So continuing to grow and hold on to that declining revenue stream of the legacy products. So I think, overall, FiOS will continue to play a very important strategic role in the future of Wireline. We will compete vigorously with this, even with the agreements that we entered into with the cable companies. If you look at the innovation agreement, that innovation will come into FiOS. And being a superior product already, that innovation will add what we can bring to the consumer base from an overall perspective. So I think, overall, I'm very optimistic on our FiOS penetration for 2012."

But I think that it's important to note that we are a premium-priced product, but we will win in the marketplace just like we did with Unleashed even though that, that's priced $10 above the market. We now see that there are niches of people that want to be on the best network in the world. So I think that will continue to be our strategy, and we'll see here as 2012 goes. As far as Wireline goes on that, I think wholesale, we continue to see pressure on the wholesale side of the business just from a legacy voice. And as we transform this business from a legacy voice business to a data business, continue with our fiber to the cell program, which we are building out for various wireless carriers. This continues to be very good business for us, but not quite enough to offset the voice loss. So I think we'll continue to see pressure in there going into 2012. As far as the other category, this is legacy MCI 108 traffic, call collect-type traffic, which will continue to decline. It's not something that's strategic for us and we'll just really move that as a cash cow at this point, and that will continue to decline. So overall, the focus here is on the consumer Wireline margin, the Enterprise portfolio and then also the wholesale portfolio."

Before we get into the details, let me start with a few comments about our first quarter results. On our last earnings call in January, I talked about the confidence we have in our ability to benefit from the market opportunities we see in our key strategic growth areas. Our focus will continue to be on execution, striving to capture incremental revenue and driving operating efficiencies throughout the business. With the results of our first quarter, we continue to execute and deliver on the guidance we gave back in January of 2011 and reaffirmed earlier this year. We remain as confident in the direction of our business now as we were then, and we continue to deliver strong results.
Earnings per share were $0.59, up 15.7% over first quarter last year. In Wireless, we saw sharp acceleration of growth in retail service revenue and postpaid ARPU, driven by increased smartphone penetration and higher data device adoption, resulting in increased usage. This top line growth, combined with effective cost management, resulted in a very strong service EBITDA margin. Consumer retail revenue growth also continue to improve, driven by another solid quarter of FiOS performance. Our broadband net adds were the highest we have seen in nearly 3 years. We had an extremely strong quarter of cash generation, free cash flow of $2.4 billion is more than 3.5x the amount generated a year ago. The first quarter is normally the lowest quarter of the year, so we expect to see increasing free cash flow levels going forward. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were down more than 18% as our disciplined approach is resulting in capital efficiency gains and an improving return on investment profile for the entire business.
Let's begin our review with a look at consolidated results on Slide 4. Our consolidated results show strong growth this quarter. On the top line, our growth trends continue to be very positive, coming from all strategic areas, most notably, Wireless services. This quarter, overall revenue growth far outweighed the increase in operating expenses, resulting in double-digit operating income growth of 16.7%. Consolidated EBITDA grew to $9.2 billion, and our margin expanded to 32.7%, up 130 basis points year-over-year and 210 basis points sequentially. 
Let's turn now to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 5. Our Free cash flow this quarter increased $1.7 billion, driven by reduced levels of capital spending and an 18% increase in cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled $3.6 billion in the quarter, a decrease of about $800 million compared to last year. Our overall capital efficiency continue to show steady improvement. We expect our annual CapEx to revenue ratio to decline for the full year based on improving revenue trends and disciplined capital spending. 
In Wireless, capital spending in the quarter was $1.9 billion, which was lower by $850 million or 31% from the first quarter last year. You will recall that at this time last year, we were spending more to meet 3G capacity requirements in connection with our initial launch of the iPhone. As we move through the year, you will see a continued focus on migrating traffic from 3G to 4G LTE, which will drive additional improvements in our capital and operating efficiency. We will also continue to expand our 4G LTE network coverage, which is already the largest in the nation. 
In Wireline, capital spending was $1.5 billion this quarter, about 5% higher than the first quarter last year. This increase is due to timing, strategic spending in enterprise and some copper-to-fiber migration within our residential customer base. 
Our balance sheet remains very strong. You will recall that the $10 billion cash distribution from Verizon Wireless was paid this quarter. We used our proportionate share and part to pay down commercial paper and redeem a maturing bond. As a result, total debt declined by $3.6 billion since the end of last year. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.3x at the end of the quarter. 
Let's now move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 6. Our Wireless business had an impressive quarter and a strong start to the year, posting accelerated growth in service revenue and our highest retail postpaid ARPU accretion in 3 years. Total Wireless revenues of $18.3 billion grew 8.2% and now represent about 65% of Verizon's consolidated revenue. Retail service revenue growth accelerated to 8.9%, 110 basis point increase in growth from the fourth quarter and the highest growth rate we've seen since early 2009. We are seeing strong revenue growth from multiple postpaid sources: Smartphones, tablets and Internet devices. And retail prepaid revenue grew strongly again this quarter, up 17.3%. 
Total service revenue grew 7.7% this quarter, 130 basis points higher than the growth rate in the fourth quarter. Total data revenue of $6.6 billion grew 21.1%. Data now represents nearly 43% of total service revenue. Data revenue growth continues to be driven by web and email services, which increased to $4.3 billion in the quarter, up nearly 36%. 
Let's take a closer look at our connections growth on Slide 7. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market, driven by sustained demand for our 3G and 4G LTE handsets, tablets and Internet devices. With the unmatched service quality of the nation's largest and most reliable wireless network. We have an industry-leading $93 million retail connections, 88 million postpaid and 5 million prepaid. During the quarter, we added 734,000 new retail net connections, 501,000 postpaid and 233,000 prepaid. 
Before we discuss postpaid in more detail, I'd point out that within the prepaid net adds, 138,000 were tablets. About 60% of the prepaid tablets this quarter were 4G LTE. Within the retail postpaid category, gross additions were just over 3 million, down about 12% from a year ago. We believe this decline is both seasonal and a function of the timing of the new device launches last year. Our [indiscernible] ratios with all carriers are favorable, and our postpaid churn metrics remain excellent. Although the first to report, we are confident that our 501,000 postpaid net adds is a strong result. 
Postpaid device sales, both gross adds and upgrades, totaled about 10 million this quarter with 8% of our postpaid base upgraded devices. In addition to smartphones, we are also having great success in the Internet device category, which includes tablets. This quarter, we sold 765,000 4G LTE Internet devices, which is more than last quarter. We are the market leader in this space as mobile hotspots or Jetpacks, USB modems and tablets represent 8% of our retail postpaid connections. I would also point out that 62% of our active tablet base is postpaid. 
Next, let's turn to Slide 8 and take a look at our smartphone and retail postpaid ARPU metrics. We had another strong quarter of smartphone sales, increasing the penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 47%. 72% of all retail postpaid phones sold this quarter were smartphones. We sold 3.2 million Apple iPhone and sold 2.1 million 4G LTE smartphones this quarter. We sold 500,000 or 30% more 4G LTE smartphones this quarter than we did in the fourth quarter. 
Consistent with prior quarters, about 20% of our smartphone sales are gross adds or new to Verizon, and the rest are upgrades from our existing customer base. Within these upgrades, 42% are customers buying smartphone for the first time, representing incremental recurring data revenue. This is a significant point of differentiation and a strength for us. 
Retail postpaid ARPU was $55.43 this quarter, up 3.6%. This is a big acceleration in accretion over what we experienced in 2011. Growth in retail postpaid phone ARPU accelerated to 4.9% this quarter and now exceeds $57. 
Postpaid Internet device ARPU was about $48 this quarter, a decline of 8.7% from last year but an improvement from an 11% year-over-year decline last quarter. Although postpaid ARPU for Internet devices is less than for phones, we are seeing double-digit year-over-year revenue growth driven by increased unit sales. We already have a majority share in this important category, and we continue to expand the market for devices, which enable higher usage. We also expect more network efficiency as an increasing percentage of data traffic moves to our 4G LTE network. 
Let's turn to Slide 9 as I'd like to spend a few more minutes talking about the strength of our 4G LTE leadership. We are by far the market leader in 4G LTE, which is now available in 230 markets and more than 200 million POPs, covering over 2/3 of the country. Throughout the year, we will continue expanding our 4G LTE network with the goal of having a nationwide footprint similar to our 3G network by mid-2013. We are seeing increasing customer awareness of the capabilities of 4G LTE and a growing recognition of the superior performance of smartphones, tablets and Internet devices on the Verizon 4G LTE network. Third-party comparisons of our 4G LTE network performance compared with others generally ranks us highest in terms of consistency of access, performance and speed, with better average download speeds and significantly higher average upload speeds. 
In addition to our network deployment and coverage advantage, sales of 4G LTE products are clearly gaining momentum. In the first quarter, we sold 2.9 million postpaid smartphones and Internet devices, a 22% increase over the fourth quarter. The vast majority of devices we have for sale are 4G LTE. We now have a total of 8 million 4G LTE customer connections, representing 9% of our postpaid base. Of note, about 2/3 of these are smartphones. We remain very pleased by our 4G LTE progress. The Verizon 4G LTE network has become the destination of choice for consumer and enterprise customers, which is a very positive indicator for us looking forward.
Let's conclude our Wireless segment review with the discussion about profitability on Slide 10. In the first quarter, we generated $7.1 billion of EBITDA, which is an increase of 14.2%, and expanded our service EBITDA margin by 410 basis points sequentially to 46.3%. Our margin performance is once again a testament to our ability to execute very well on our strategy of balancing growth and profitability. The combination of accelerating service revenue and ARPU growth, and intense focus on cost controls and consistently excellent churn metrics are contributing to our industry-leading margin performance. Going forward, we will continue to look at opportunities to mitigate the cost of higher equipment subsidies and commissions. We have identified $2 billion of cost saving opportunities for this year, and we are on track to capture these savings. We also announced the $30 upgrade free will go into effect next week. 
Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 11.  Total Wireline revenue declined $202 million or 2% in the first quarter. About 60% of this decline is a result of targeted product rationalization actions we have taken to improve the quality of our revenue mix. Within wholesale, I'm referring to our continued exit from unprofitable international wholesale routes and contracts. In enterprise, it is our deemphasis on selling of flagship hardware or CPE. And the other revenue line item, the majority of the 82 million decline this quarter was from nonstrategic products, which include the former MCI mass markets business, long-distance, local wholesale and calling cards, public pay phones and directory assistance. We are exiting the calling card and public payphone businesses entirely. 
While the Wireline revenue decline was accentuated by these targeted actions this quarter, growth in the strategic areas continues to mitigate the more secular and cyclical declines in other parts of the business. As we have stated, we are taking a hard look at all of our product lines and rationalizing those that are not meeting our strategic and financial requirements. For example, going forward, we will no longer be selling high-speed Internet or DSL over copper in areas where FiOS is available. From a profitability perspective, first quarter EBITDA declined by $148 million year-over-year with 100 basis points decline in the EBITDA margin to 22.6%. The decline is due to several factors, revenue declines in less strategic products and first quarter cost pressures like higher OPEB accruals, increased active benefit cost and escalators in certain content contracts. We have targeted price actions planned to help offset certain cost increases, which will contribute to our overall profitability goals this year. I remain confident that we will achieve EBITDA margin improvement for the full year, and we continue to be very focused on improving the long-term profitability of the Wireline business. 
Let's take a closer look at our revenue performance starting with mass markets on Slide 12. As a result of the scale of FiOS and increase penetration, consumer ARPU has continued to steadily increase and is now over $97, up 8%. In addition, our residential connections trends continue to improve. We lost 205,000 retail residential connections in the quarter, representing a 6.8% decline year-over-year compared with a loss of 289,000 or 8.6% at this time last year. In the first quarter, we delivered strong broadband growth [indiscernible] a total of 104,000 net subscribers with a 193,000 FiOS Internet additions, we passed the 5 million FiOS subscriber mark and increased our penetration to 36.4%. 
More than half our FiOS customers already use 20 megabits or higher. And with more devices like tablets, gaming consoles and smart TVs connecting to the Internet at home, demand for higher broadband speed is on the rise. Later this year, we plan to introduce a series of higher speed packages that will further differentiate FiOS as the nation's fastest Internet service and allow us to continue to monetize our investment in the FiOS platform. 
In FiOS Video, we added 180,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.4 million and increasing our penetration to 32.3%. Within our FiOS subscriber base, about 68% are triple-play, and our FiOS ARPU now stands that more than $140 per month. Our focus continues to be on increasing FiOS penetration, realizing additional operating and capital efficiency and expand margins. 
Let's move next to our business markets, starting with Global Enterprise. Strategic Services continue to drive the overall positive growth in Global Enterprise revenue. We continue to post double-digit growth in application services like manage network, data center, security, cloud and IP infrastructure. Within the IP layer, private IP and Ethernet services are contributing to the growth. 
In the first quarter, these services totaled $2 billion, up 11.6%, representing just over half of Global Enterprise revenue. As we've seen for the last several quarters, the growth in Strategic Services did outpaced the decline in core Enterprise Services but not to the same degree. 
As you might expect, we are experiencing some short-term revenue pressure from Europe and foreign-currency. In addition, our deemphasis on sale of hardware was worth about $43 million on a year-over-year basis. Growth in services revenue was 2.3%. Looking ahead, we do expect our enterprise business to contribute more to the overall Wireline revenue growth and profitability.
Our strategic repositioning of Verizon Enterprise Solutions has better aligned our strength in high-growth markets like cloud computing, machine-to-machine and advanced communications. Our acquisitions of best-in-class assets like Cybertrust, Terremark and CloudSwitch, combined with our industry-leading 4G LTE and global IP networks, gives us a unique platform of assets to provide comprehensive, integrated solutions to enterprise organizations. 
In Global Wholesale, revenues in the first quarter declined $181 million or 8.9% due primarily to declines in voice and local services. As I said, we continue to take targeted actions to exit unprofitable routes and contracts, to improve the quality of our revenue mix during this period of secular decline and lower volumes. Partly offsetting these declines were continued growth in certain data services, most notably, fiber-based Ethernet. 
Let's move now to our summary slide. Overall, we had a solid start to the year, and we remain confident in our ability to take advantage of the market opportunities we see and our key strategic growth areas. We are on track with our plans, and we expect to continue to deliver strong results going forward. Our focus will continue to be on execution, striving to capture incremental revenue and driving operating efficiencies throughout the business. Our success in stimulating top line growth and capturing cost savings will enable us to mitigate certain secular declines and cost pressures. 
In terms of recent news, yesterday, we announced the plans to conduct an open sale process for all of our 700 megahertz A and B Spectrum licenses in order to rationalize our Spectrum holdings. We acquired these licenses as part of the FCC auction 73 in 2008. The sale of these license is contingent upon the close of the purchase of the AWS licenses from SpectrumCo, Cocks and leap wireless. These transactions are in varying stages of review by the SEC and the Department of Justice and are expected to close by mid-summer. 
In closing, I'd reemphasize that we are well positioned to capitalize on the investments we've made further improving investment returns and creating significant shareholder value in the years to come. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to John so we can get to your questions."

Can you help us think through prospects for further improvement and the rate of growth from year? And then second question just on Wireline margins, I think the reset in the first quarter was a bit larger than most of us have initially expected sort of going into the process. You talked about confidence in improvement from here. Just wondering how should we think about the pacing of this through the year, would you expect it to be linear and show in your second quarter results and is this more back-end loaded, maybe contingent on the union contract?"

These are 2 actually big questions, and that probably will result in large answer than you would expect. But on Wireless ARPU, let's start of the fact that I think as we started out in 2011, we said that we have a path to accelerate the growth of our revenue. We came out of the fourth quarter, I reiterated my confidence on that projection. And as I sit here today and I will continue to reiterate that we are confident that we will continue to accelerate our growth in this category. And it's going to come from many, many different areas. So you have to keep in mind, number one, our smartphone penetration is at 47%, which means that there are 53% of our phone customers that are still on a basic phone. So we still have a lot of roadway here from a basic to a smart upgrade. And as you know, 42% of our customers this quarter went from a basic phone into a smartphone category, so that is accelerating the growth. In addition, as you heard on the script, our Internet device category is starting to stabilize a bit, and we expect that to continue to go throughout the quarter on an ARPU basis. As last year, we reset prices. We expanded the category, so the growth of that category is expanding for us, but we knew we had some short-term ARPU pressure by the price resets that we've launched into the marketplace. But that set us up for our 4G LTE launches. And as you saw, we had a stellar performance on the number of devices that we moved on our 4G network this quarter. So that's a couple of things. I probably could go into a lot more detail around our data sharing plans, our commercial launches of Fusion and if we want to get to more discussion on that, we can. But we are very, very confident that we are on a path to continue to accelerate the growth of our ARPU. On Wireline margins, just a couple of things here to talk to. So number one, we did have the FiOS to copper migration, which impacted our short-term results but we've talked that this is a strategy that we're deploying. It is better for us long-term to get most of these customers off of our copper network to our FiOS network. As you saw that we are stop selling our DSL and FiOS covered area and we starting to convert a number of customers in this quarter over to our FiOS network from a voice perspective. Now a couple of things here that this will launch, number one, we will see a long-term benefit in our repairs and maintenance decrease over time. We will also get the upsell capability to start selling these voice customers on better speeds of FiOS and better experience. And also then into the linearity TV product that we have to offer. And what we're seeing is the minimum number that we converted last year during our trials, we are starting to see a 30% sale upgrade on those customers, but it does take this 3 to 6 months to convince those customers to upgrade. So this is a longer-term type strategy. In addition, going into the future, you're going to see, you may have already saw, that we are starting to start some price strategic areas. We've also started that in April but over the next 2 quarters, [indiscernible] with priced up in our FiOS packages. In addition, we're going to rebundle certain of our packages to better bundle our content in order to make it more profitable based on the Tier that you picked for us. The other thing is that there's other revenue streams coming from down the pipe like call monitoring control that will contribute to the overall ARPU of our FiOS platform. We also have a very disciplined cost structure in place. As you see that, we declined our SG&A expense year-over-year. In April, we also had another lift to our represented employees, which we had a number of people take. So we've already taken off 1,100 people from payroll since the quarter has closed. We are taking other measures around the consolidation of our back office operations, as I talked to in the past. You see that we are exiting some of our unprofitable or low-margin businesses, which will help us in the future. And then, of course, the union contract and we can talk more about that, but obviously, the business need to cost restructure and that what that is about. So I'll stop there, I'm sure we'll have some more questions here."

You saw as the ARPU increases that you see in the revenue growth. And as we stated last year, coming into this year, that our goal was to get back to our third quarter level of last year's margin and then continue to grow from where, and we're putting in all those actions to do that. As far as the $30 upgrade fee, I'll remind everyone that we started back in 2010 on a strategy to start to take out some of the lucrative promotions we had around upgrades by deleting the new every 2 program, limiting the amount of early upgrade that we allowed. And now the implementation of the $30 upgrade fee, which we were the last carrier to implement. But it's important to, for the overall profitability of the business, and the experience that we expect to have within this business. So I think there's a number of actions that Wireless is taking to continue to focus on the ARPU expansion and then the margin expansion because we like to do both at Verizon, we grow and we expand our margins. And then as far as the use of cash here, on a targeted net debt-to-EBITDA, it's more important that I think we're comfortable with our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. This will improve over time as we continue to delever in certain areas where we think it's reasonable to do. You saw us take the proceeds of the Wireless dividend this quarter to pay down some debt that was maturing that was high interest debt that quite honestly, didn't make sense at this time to refinance in any perspective. So we will continue to manage our cash. It's important. Our dividend policy is extremely important to us, and Lowell and I have said very strongly that we will continue to the policy of our dividend. So I'll stop there, and we'll go on to the next question."

So look, I think it's a safe to say that as we entered into this new negotiation, we knew that this is going to be an extremely difficult negotiation. We have said very strongly that we need cost structure within the Wireline business. Obviously, if you look at the profitability of this business over the last 5 years, it has decreased. And this cost structure is not palatable going forward. So we need to some concessions, we need health care contributions. We need some pension revisions. And look, were not asking for things of that have not already been given to other companies. These are not you issues. They've already been given to some of our peer companies. So we are standing strong. We need this cost restructure in order to build on the profitability of our Wireline unit. The other thing is, look, we've invested over $24 billion into this unit on the FiOS platform. And in order for us to be competitive with our competitors of cable who don't have these very lucrative benefits and average salaries of $90,000 with an incremental $50,000 of healthcare and pension on top of that, we need some cost restructure here. So look, this is a hard negotiation. It took one of our peer companies over 500 days to get to where they year 3 years ago and some of these breakthrough issues. So we continue to negotiate. We continue to put proposals on and we'll see where we go, but we knew this was going to be a long haul. And with my comment of improvement of Wireline margin, it's all built in those comments. On the Wireless adds, I think we're extremely pleased with the growth of our Wireless business on an add basis. If you look at, though there's going to be other categories that drive the growth of Wireless in the future, as I said, we will be launching our data share plan in mid-summer this year. We believe that, that plan, the way we have it designed, will enable us our customers to easily connect to other devices to that plan. And I think that as we do more connections, you noticed we did not disclosed total connections. As I've said that machine-to-machine is becoming a more complicated device and connection of the way the plans are built, so it's not important anymore of total connections is more important of our revenue increase based on the customers that we're growing. I think that if you look at our Fusion product that we just launched in certain states, our trials are going very well. The customers are experiencing, it's extremely strong. We have a target of 10 million homes that we're going to launch to in May of these when we commercially we launched. And that will build to as we build out the 4G LTE footprint to a target of 34 million homes. We believe that's a growth engine for us in future. Then we have tablets, we have prepaid. This is the second quarter in a row where we've grown our prepaid base with our Unleashed product. And in the next week or so, you're going to see us add in a smartphone to our prepaid product on an $80 price point with 1 gigabit of data. So there's a number of actions that we're taking. If you think about the third ecosystem and then also the cable partnership that we also just launched some new markets with Time Warner cable this last quarter, Kansas, Ohio and Carolinas. So we've continue to expand. I think we have a growth rate test to increase adds on a full year basis here, and we're on that track."

And we saw significant volume previous to any volume that we had previously seen on tablet sales. So I think that go into the second quarter, that volume will continue. So yes, there was a little bit of a downward demand in the beginning, waiting for the new iPad to come out. So again, I think we're off to a good start. We sold 390,000 tablets in the quarter. And as we said, the bulk of them were 60% for increase in tablet sales year-over-year. So I think going into the future, tablets will continue to be a very strategic segment of our business. On the Apple iPhone, look, I think as I've said before, we look at every individual handset, we have a broad portfolio. We manage handset by handset that manage our subsidy and again, that's just one aspect of our P&L. And this is just a nature of this business that's grown from the beginning of the industry that we subsidize handsets. I do think though it is important that there is a third ecosystem that's brought into the mix here. And we are fully supportive of that with Microsoft, and as we said that we created the Android platform from beginning. And it is an incredible platform today that we helped to create. And we're looking to do the same thing with the third ecosystem. So that's how we I think that we plan to go into the future here."

On the enterprise, VDMS, think we're making great progress with the new organization and the umbrella organization that John Stratton has over both Wireless and Wireline from an enterprise perspective. We have gone very deep into verticals. We see that there is, and if you paid attention to Lowell's remark here recently at the healthcare forum, we see a lot of healthcare opportunity and are engaging on a lot of partnerships to extend what we think is a really good product set on the reduction of overall healthcare cost in the nation, but also to deliver some really neat innovation-type ideas into the future of healthcare and how we manage that from an enterprise perspective. As far as overall growth of the segment, we did see a decline this quarter in Europe. It was not expected. Just to give you some a sign here. Last year, our European market was growing on average about 13%. It contributes about $450 million of revenue per quarter. We saw that drop to flat this quarter. So there was a drastic pullback in our European market. We don't believe that, that is long-term. We think that that's more of a short-term issue. We already started to see some increased bookings here exiting the first quarter, but that probably won't turn into revenue for 3 to 6 months. As you know, this industry is a longer-term type recording from the time that you get an order. So I think this is a short-term issue for us, but it did put an impact on our overall growth. Now having said that, our cloud services and our strategic nature of our security are those portfolios are growing well. Our overall cloud portfolio grew by 17% quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. I think we're making progress in the areas that we want to make progress in, but again, the portfolio rationalization is also creating a drag here. And as we continue down that path, we will lose some revenue in those less profitable platforms that we really want to discontinue investing in, but it's for the betterment of us and betterment of our customers to move them to a more highly innovative platform. And then the last thing, of course, is the development and launch that we did last June of our VDMS platform, and we will be launching our next phase of that come this June, and we expect to see some growth revenue acceleration from that platform as we go here. So there's a number of things that John is implementing that I think will contribute. As I said in my script here, the contribute of the future growth of the overall Wireline, revenue top line and margin growth."

So let's talk about the facts. So #1, I think Verizon Wireless has shown over time that they are very, very good stewards of Spectrum and efficient Spectrum. And we are responsible in efficient owners of Spectrum as a company policy, we will not hoard the Spectrum. Now when we bought this back in 2008, obviously, we did not have the foresight to know that we will have an opportunity to acquire and I do believe that Spectrum from the cable company. If you look at our Spectrum holdings, we purchased 700 megahertz, which is an extremely efficient and this is where we built our LTE platform on. And then we had the AWS spectrum in these East, which was very efficient from an overbuild perspective on capacity in our LTE platform. And now with the deal that we have with SpectrumCo, we believe that is the most efficient for us to utilize and build out our LTE platform. So hence, the lower 700 megahertz A and B does not fit as nicely into our Spectrum holdings as it may for others. But we think it's the prudent thing to do to sell these licenses off to the rest of the industry for the benefit of their customers and to enhance their ability to build out 4G LTE. So I think we would say that we're being good stewards. This has nothing to do. We did not just wake up yesterday and decide we were going to sell Spectrum because we ran into a roadblock at the FCC. That is continuing. We have a fact that say 180-day clock is going and that we are still very confident that we will get approval for the AWS acquisition from SpectrumCo. But just the 2 other points I want to make here is, #1 this is contingent getting a nice getting the AWS Spectrum approved because, obviously, we would note that spectrum of that's not approved and again, we think it's the right thing for the FCC and maybe a standard for them to use in the future of how Spectrum should be allocated out and sold and efficient ownership and protocols. The other thing is I think there were some articles written that this is going to be a fire sale. This is nothing near a fire sale. We bought this Spectrum back in 2008. We've had carrying costs, and we will be prudent to our shareholders to make sure we get the return our investments. We know what the value of this Spectrum is in the free market, and obviously, we're going to an auction to allow many different parties to participate through a third-party auctioneer. And look, if we don't get the price that we think is a fair price, then we won't go through with the sale, and that's at our discretion. So I think there's some important facts and I'll stop there."

On the $2 billion Wireless cost cutting ideas, I think we've shown that we are very good executioners on the cost-cutting routines of $3 billion in the last 2 years. The $2 billion is a combination of a variety of things. You saw the announcement of some call center rationalization. Obviously, part of this $2 billion is to work on the reduction of our subsidies, and you saw -- you've already seen some of these plans going back with our upgrade fees and some other things. So there's a wide breadth of cost-cutting initiatives that Dan, me and his team are executing on. And right now coming out of the first quarter, we're actually right on track where we expect to be. And then lastly, on the cable companies, obviously, we're still on a trial mode. We're working out the kinks. We launched a couple markets here with Comcast up in Seattle and Portland.

The agreements are still in front of the DOJ and the SEC and we continue to cooperate with them. And we'll wait till the transaction closes and get up for the speed and then we'll talk about that."

In order for your CapEx to be flattish over the course of the year, it would seem like the spending would have to pick up a little bit in Wireless. First of all, is that the correct inclusion? And if so what will be behind that? And the second question is to clarify the statement about margins. Fran, you mentioned sort of getting to the third quarter of last year Wireless EBITDA margin. That was just inside 48%. Is that a point you think you can achieve once again at some quarter during the year or is that actually a full year target for Verizon Wireless?"

Before we get into the details, let me start with a few comments about our first quarter results. On our last earnings call in January, I talked about the confidence we have in our ability to benefit from the market opportunities we see in our key strategic growth areas. Our focus will continue to be on execution, striving to capture incremental revenue and driving operating efficiencies throughout the business. With the results of our first quarter, we continue to execute and deliver on the guidance we gave back in January of 2011 and reaffirmed earlier this year. We remain as confident in the direction of our business now as we were then, and we continue to deliver strong results.
Earnings per share were $0.59, up 15.7% over first quarter last year. In Wireless, we saw a sharp acceleration of growth in retail service revenue and postpaid ARPU, driven by increased smartphone penetration and higher data device adoption, resulting in increased usage. This top line growth, combined with effective cost management, resulted in a very strong service EBITDA margin. Consumer retail revenue growth also continue to improve, driven by another solid quarter of FiOS performance. Our broadband net adds were the highest we have seen in nearly 3 years. 
We had an extremely strong quarter of cash generation. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion is more than 3.5x the amount generated a year ago. The first quarter is normally the lowest quarter of the year, so we expect to see increasing free cash flow levels going forward. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were down more than 18% as our disciplined approach is resulting in capital efficiency gains and an improving return on investment profile for the entire business.
Let's begin our review with a look at consolidated results on Slide 4. Our consolidated results show strong growth this quarter. On the top line, our growth trends continue to be very positive, coming from all strategic areas, most notably, Wireless services. This quarter, overall revenue growth far outweighed the increase in operating expenses, resulting in double-digit operating income growth of 16.7%. Consolidated EBITDA grew to $9.2 billion, and our margin expanded to 32.7%, up 130 basis points year-over-year and 210 basis points sequentially. 
Let's turn now to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 5. Our free cash flow this quarter increased $1.7 billion, driven by reduced levels of capital spending and an 18% increase in cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled $3.6 billion in the quarter, a decrease of about $800 million compared to last year. Our overall capital efficiency continue to show steady improvement. We expect our annual CapEx-to-revenue ratio to decline for the full year based on improving revenue trends and disciplined capital spending. 
In Wireless, capital spending in the quarter was $1.9 billion, which was lower by $850 million or 31% from the first quarter last year. You will recall that at this time last year, we were spending more to meet 3G capacity requirements in connection with our initial launch of the iPhone. As we move through the year, you will see a continued focus on migrating traffic from 3G to 4G LTE, which will drive additional improvements in our capital and operating efficiency. We will also continue to expand our 4G LTE network coverage, which is already the largest in the nation. 
In Wireline, capital spending was $1.5 billion this quarter, about 5% higher than the first quarter last year. This increase is due to timing, strategic spending in enterprise and some copper-to-fiber migration within our residential customer base. 
Our balance sheet remains very strong. You will recall that the $10 billion cash distribution from Verizon Wireless was paid this quarter. We used our proportionate share and part to pay down commercial paper and to redeem a maturing bond. As a result, total debt declined by $3.6 billion since the end of last year. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.3x at the end of the quarter. 
Let's now move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 6. Our Wireless business had an impressive quarter and a strong start to the year, posting accelerated growth in service revenue and our highest retail postpaid ARPU accretion in 3 years. Total Wireless revenues of $18.3 billion grew 8.2% and now represent about 65% of Verizon's consolidated revenue. Retail service revenue growth accelerated to 8.9%, 110 basis point increase in growth from the fourth quarter and the highest growth rate we've seen since early 2009. We are seeing strong revenue growth from multiple postpaid sources: Smartphones, tablets and Internet devices. And retail prepaid revenue grew strongly again this quarter, up 17.3%. 
Total service revenue grew 7.7% this quarter, 130 basis points higher than the growth rate in the fourth quarter. Total data revenue of $6.6 billion grew 21.1%. Data now represents nearly 43% of total service revenue. Data revenue growth continues to be driven by web and email services, which increased to $4.3 billion in the quarter, up nearly 36%. 
Let's take a closer look at our connections growth on Slide 7. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market, driven by sustained demand for our 3G and 4G LTE handsets, tablets and Internet devices. With the unmatched service quality of the nation's largest and most reliable wireless network. We have an industry-leading $93 million retail connections, 88 million postpaid and 5 million prepaid. During the quarter, we added 734,000 new retail net connections, 501,000 postpaid and 233,000 prepaid. 
Before we discuss postpaid in more detail, I'd point out that within the prepaid net adds, 138,000 were tablets. About 60% of the prepaid tablets this quarter were 4G LTE. Within the retail postpaid category, gross additions were just over 3 million, down about 12% from a year ago. We believe this decline is both seasonal and a function of the timing of the new device launches last year. Our porting ratios with all carriers are favorable, and our postpaid churn metrics remain excellent. Although the first to report, we are confident that our 501,000 postpaid net adds is a strong result. 
Postpaid device sales, both gross adds and upgrades, totaled about 10 million this quarter with 8% of our postpaid base upgrading devices. In addition to smartphones, we are also having great success in the Internet device category, which includes tablets. This quarter, we sold 765,000 4G LTE Internet devices, which is more than last quarter. We are the market leader in this space as mobile hotspots or Jetpacks, USB modems and tablets represent 8% of our retail postpaid connections. I would also point out that 62% of our active tablet base is postpaid. 
Next, let's turn to Slide 8 and take a look at our smartphone and retail postpaid ARPU metrics. We had another strong quarter of smartphone sales, increasing the penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 47%. 72% of all retail postpaid phones sold this quarter were smartphones. We sold 3.2 million Apple iPhones and sold 2.1 million 4G LTE smartphones this quarter. We sold 500,000 or 30% more 4G LTE smartphones this quarter than we did in the fourth quarter. 
Consistent with prior quarters, about 20% of our smartphone sales are gross adds or new to Verizon, and the rest are upgrades from our existing customer base. Within these upgrades, 42% are customers buying a smartphone for the first time, representing incremental recurring data revenue. This is a significant point of differentiation and a strength for us. 
Retail postpaid ARPU was $55.43 this quarter, up 3.6%. This is a big acceleration in accretion over what we experienced in 2011. Growth in retail postpaid phone ARPU accelerated to 4.9% this quarter and now exceeds $57. 
Postpaid Internet device ARPU was about $48 this quarter, a decline of 8.7% from last year but an improvement from an 11% year-over-year decline last quarter. Although postpaid ARPU for Internet devices is less than for phones, we are seeing double-digit year-over-year revenue growth driven by increased unit sales. We already have a majority share in this important category, and we continue to expand the market for devices, which enable higher usage. We also expect more network efficiency as an increasing percentage of data traffic moves to our 4G LTE network. 
Let's turn to Slide 9 as I'd like to spend a few more minutes talking about the strength of our 4G LTE leadership. We are by far the market leader in 4G LTE, which is now available in 230 markets and more than 200 million POPs, covering over 2/3 of the country. Throughout the year, we will continue expanding our 4G LTE network with the goal of having a nationwide footprint similar to our 3G network by mid-2013. We are seeing increasing customer awareness of the capabilities of 4G LTE and a growing recognition of the superior performance of smartphones, tablets and Internet devices on the Verizon 4G LTE network. Third-party comparisons of our 4G LTE network performance compared with others generally ranks us highest in terms of consistency of access, performance and speed, with better average download speeds and significantly higher average upload speeds. 
In addition to our network deployment and coverage advantage, sales of 4G LTE products are clearly gaining momentum. In the first quarter, we sold 2.9 million postpaid smartphones and Internet devices, a 22% increase over the fourth quarter. The vast majority of devices we have for sale are 4G LTE. We now have a total of 8 million 4G LTE customer connections, representing 9% of our postpaid base. Of note, about 2/3 of these are smartphones. We remain very pleased by our 4G LTE progress. The Verizon 4G LTE network has become the destination of choice for consumer and enterprise customers, which is a very positive indicator for us looking forward.
Let's conclude our Wireless segment review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 10. In the first quarter, we generated $7.1 billion of EBITDA, which is an increase of 14.2%, and expanded our service EBITDA margin by 410 basis points sequentially to 46.3%. Our margin performance is once again a testament to our ability to execute very well on our strategy of balancing growth and profitability. The combination of accelerating service revenue and ARPU growth, and intense focus on cost controls and consistently excellent churn metrics are contributing to our industry-leading margin performance. 
Going forward, we will continue to look at opportunities to mitigate the cost of higher equipment subsidies and commissions. We have identified $2 billion of cost saving opportunities for this year, and we are on track to capture these savings. We also announced the $30 upgrade free, which will go into effect next week. 
Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 11.  Total Wireline revenue declined $202 million or 2% in the first quarter. About 60% of this decline is a result of targeted product rationalization actions we have taken to improve the quality of our revenue mix. Within wholesale, I'm referring to our continued exit from unprofitable international wholesale routes and contracts. In Enterprise, it is our deemphasis on selling of drop ship hardware or CPE. And the other revenue line item, the majority of the 82 million decline this quarter was from nonstrategic products, which include the former MCI mass markets business, long-distance, local wholesale and calling cards, public pay phones and directory assistance. We are exiting the calling card and public payphone businesses entirely. 
While the Wireline revenue decline was accentuated by these targeted actions this quarter, growth in the strategic areas continues to mitigate the more secular and cyclical declines in other parts of the business. As we have stated, we are taking a hard look at all of our product lines and rationalizing those that are not meeting our strategic and financial requirement. For example, going forward, we will no longer be selling high-speed Internet or DSL over copper in areas where FiOS is available. 
From a profitability perspective, first quarter EBITDA declined by $148 million year-over-year with 100 basis points decline in the EBITDA margin to 22.6%. The decline is due to several factors, revenue declines in less-strategic products and first quarter cost pressures like higher OPEB accruals, increased active benefit cost and escalators in certain content contracts. We have targeted price actions planned to help offset certain cost increases, which will contribute to our overall profitability goals this year. I remain confident that we will achieve EBITDA margin improvement for the full year, and we continue to be very focused on improving the long-term profitability of the Wireline business. 
Let's take a closer look at our revenue performance starting with mass markets on Slide 12. As a result of the scale of FiOS and increased penetration, consumer ARPU has continued to steadily increase and is now over $97, up 8%. In addition, our residential connections trends continued to improve. We lost 205,000 retail residential connections in the quarter, representing a 6.8% decline year-over-year compared with a loss of 289,000 or 8.6% at this time last year. In the first quarter, we delivered strong broadband growth, gaining a total of 104,000 net subscribers. With a 193,000 FiOS Internet additions, we passed the 5 million FiOS subscriber mark and increased our penetration to 36.4%. 
More than half our FiOS customers already use 20 megabit speed or higher. And with more devices like tablets, game consoles and smart TVs connecting to the Internet at home, demand for higher broadband speeds is on the rise. Later this year, we plan to introduce a series of higher speed packages that will further differentiate FiOS as the nation's fastest Internet service and allow us to continue to monetize our investment in the FiOS platform. 
In FiOS Video, we added 180,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.4 million and increasing our penetration to 32.3%. Within our FiOS subscriber base, about 68% are triple-play, and our FiOS ARPU now stands that more than $148 per month. Our focus continues to be on increasing FiOS penetration, realizing additional operating and capital efficiencies and expanding margin. 
Let's move next to our business markets, starting with Global Enterprise. Strategic Services continue to drive the overall positive growth in Global Enterprise revenue. We continue to post double-digit growth in application services like managed network, data center, security, cloud and IT infrastructure. Within the IP layer, private IP and Ethernet services are contributing to the growth. 
In the first quarter, these services totaled $2 billion, up 11.6%, representing just over half of Global Enterprise revenue. As we've seen for the last several quarters, the growth in Strategic Services did outpace the decline in core Enterprise Services but not to the same degree. 
As you might expect, we are experiencing some short-term revenue pressure from Europe and foreign-currency. In addition, our deemphasis on sale of hardware was worth about $43 million on a year-over-year basis. Growth in services revenue was 2.3%. Looking ahead, we do expect our enterprise business to contribute more to the overall Wireline revenue growth and profitability.
Our strategic repositioning of Verizon Enterprise Solutions has better aligned our strength in high-growth markets like cloud computing, machine-to-machine and advanced communications. Our acquisitions of best-in-class assets like Cybertrust, Terremark and CloudSwitch, combined with our industry-leading 4G LTE and global IP networks, gives us a unique platform of assets to provide comprehensive, integrated solutions to enterprise organizations. 
In Global Wholesale, revenues in the first quarter declined $181 million or 8.9% due primarily to declines in voice and local services. As I said, we continue to take targeted actions to exit unprofitable routes and contracts, to improve the quality of our revenue mix during this period of secular decline and lower volumes. Partly offsetting these declines were continued growth in certain data services, most notably, fiber-based Ethernet. 
Let's move now to our summary slide. Overall, we had a solid start to the year, and we remain confident in our ability to take advantage of the market opportunities we see and our key strategic growth areas. We are on track with our plans, and we expect to continue to deliver strong results going forward. Our focus will continue to be on execution, striving to capture incremental revenue and driving operating efficiencies throughout the business. Our success in stimulating top line growth and capturing cost savings will enable us to mitigate certain secular declines and cost pressures. 
In terms of recent news, yesterday, we announced the plans to conduct an open sale process for all of our 700 megahertz A and B Spectrum licenses in order to rationalize our Spectrum holdings. We acquired these licenses as part of the FCC auction 73 in 2008. The sale of this license is contingent upon the close of the purchase of the AWS licenses from SpectrumCo,  Cox and Leap Wireless. These transactions are at varying stages of review by the FCC and the Department of Justice and are expected to close by mid-summer.
In closing, I'd reemphasize that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the investments we've made, further improving investment returns and creating significant shareholder value in the years to come.
With that, I will now turn the call back to John so we can get to your questions."

And then second question just on Wireline margins, I think the reset in the first quarter was a bit larger than most of us had initially expected sort of going into the process. You talked about confidence in improvement from here. Just wondering how should we think about the pacing of this through the year? Would you expect it to be fairly linear and show up in the second quarter results or is this more back-end loaded, maybe contingent on a union contract?"

These are 2 actually big questions, and that probably will result in larger answers than you would expect. But on Wireless ARPU, let's start of the fact that I think as we started out in 2011, we said that we had a path to accelerate the growth of our revenue. We came out of the fourth quarter, I reiterated my confidence on that projection. And as I sit here today and I will continue to reiterate that we are confident that we will continue to accelerate our growth in this category. And it's going to come from many, many different areas. So you have to keep in mind, number one, our smartphone penetration is at 47%, which means that there are 53% of our phone customers that are still on a basic phone. So we still have a lot of roadway here from a basic to smart upgrade. And as you know, 42% of our customers this quarter went from a basic phone into a smartphone category, so that is accelerating the growth. In addition, as you heard on the script, our Internet device category is starting to stabilize a bit, and we expect that to continue to go throughout the quarter on an ARPU basis. As last year, we reset prices. We expanded the category, so the growth of that category is expanding for us, but we knew we had some short-term ARPU pressure by the price resets that we launched into the marketplace. But that set us up for our 4G LTE launches. And as you saw, we had a stellar performance on a number of devices that we moved on our 4G network this quarter. So that's a couple of things. I probably could go into a lot more detail around our data sharing plans, our commercial launch of Fusion and if we want to get to more discussion on that, we can. But we are very, very confident that we are on a path to continue to accelerate the growth of our ARPU. On Wireline margins, just a couple of things here to talk to. So number one, we did have the FiOS-to-copper migration, which impacted our short-term results but we've talked that this is a strategy that we're deploying. It is better for us long-term to get most of these customers off of our copper network to our FiOS network. As you saw that we are stop selling our naked DSL and FiOS covered area and we started to convert a number of customers in this quarter over to our FiOS network from a voice perspective. Now a couple of things here that this will launch, number one, we will see a long-term benefit in our repairs and maintenance decrease over time. We will also get the upsell capability to start selling these voice customers on better speeds of FiOS and better experience. And also then into the linear TV product that we have to offer. And what we're seeing is the minimum number that we converted last year during our trials, we are starting to see a 30% sale upgrade on those customers, but it does take us 3 to 6 months to convince those customers to upgrade. So this is a longer-term type strategy. In addition, going into the future, you're going to see, you may have already saw, that we are starting to do some price ops in strategic areas. We've also started that in April but over the next 2 quarters, we're going to have several priced ops in our FiOS packages. In addition, we're going to rebundle certain of our packages to better bundle our content in order to make it more profitable based on the Tier that you picked for us. The other thing is that there's other revenue streams coming from down the pipe like home monitoring control that will contribute to the overall ARPU of our FiOS platform. We also have a very disciplined cost structure in place. As you see that, we declined our SG&A expense year-over-year. In April, we also had another lift to our represented employees, which we had a number of people take. So we've already taken off 1,100 people from payroll since the quarter has closed. We are taking other measures around the consolidation of our back office operations, as I've talked to in the past. You see that we are exiting some of our unprofitable or low-margin businesses, which will help us in the future. And then, of course, the union contract and we can talk more about that. But obviously, the business needs a cost restructure and that's what that is about. So I'll stop there, I'm sure we'll have some more questions here."

I guess there's a couple of things here that are important. #1 is, as you know, we have been on a 2-year track here to reduce expenses in our Wireless unit. And over the last 2 years, we've taken out about $3 billion of expense. This year, we have another target of $2 billion. So I know that everyone is focused in on the subsidy model, but as I've said, that's just one line item in our P&L, and it takes managing the entire business to be an efficient business. And I think that Wireless has done a really excellent job on reduction of cost and creating more efficiency within the model. And that's what's driving the margins. You saw as the ARPU increases that you see in the revenue growth. And as we stated last year coming into this year, that our goal was to get back to our third quarter level of last year's margin and then continue to grow from there, and we're putting in all those actions to do that. As far as the $30 upgrade fee, I'll remind everyone that we started back in 2010 on a strategy to start to take out some of the lucrative promotions we had around upgrades by deleting the New Every Two program, limiting the amount of early upgrades that we allowed. And now the implementation of the $30 upgrade fee, which we were the last carrier to implement. But it's important to, for the overall profitability of the business, and the experience that we expect to have within this business. So I think there's a number of actions that Wireless is taking to continue to focus on the ARPU expansion and then the margin expansion because we like to do both at Verizon, we grow and we expand our margins. And then as far as the use of cash here, on a targeted net debt-to-EBITDA. It's more important that I think we're comfortable with our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. This will improve over time as we continue to delever in certain areas where we think it's reasonable to do. You saw us take the proceeds of the Wireless dividend this quarter to pay down some debt that was maturing that was high-interest debt that, quite honestly, didn't make sense at this time to refinance in any perspective. So we will continue to manage our cash reporting. Our dividend policy is extremely important to us, and Lowell and I have said very strongly that we will continue to the policy of our dividend. So I'll stop there, and we'll go on to the next question."

So look, I think it's a safe to say that as we entered into this new negotiation, we knew that this is going to be an extremely difficult negotiation. We have said very strongly that we need cost structure within the Wireline business. Obviously, if you look at the profitability of this business over the last 5 years, it has decreased. And this cost structure is not palatable going forward. So we need to some concessions, we need health care contributions. We need some pension revisions. And look, were not asking for things of that have not already been given to other companies. These are not new issues. They've already been given to some of our peer companies. So we are standing strong. We need this cost restructure in order to build on the profitability of our Wireline unit. The other thing is, look, we've invested over $24 billion into this unit on the FiOS platform. And in order for us to be competitive with our competitors of cable who don't have these very lucrative benefits and average salaries of $90,000 with an incremental $50,000 of healthcare and pension on top of that, we need some cost restructure here. So look, this is a hard negotiation. It took one of our peer companies over 500 days to get to where they year 3 years ago and some of these breakthrough issues. So we continue to negotiate. We continue to put proposals on and we'll see where we go, but we knew this was going to be a long haul. And with my comment of improvement of Wireline margin, it's all built in those comments. On the Wireless adds, I think we're extremely pleased with the growth of our Wireless business on an add basis. If you look at, though there's going to be other categories that drive the growth of Wireless in the future, as I said, we will be launching our data share plan in mid-summer this year. We believe that, that plan, the way we have it designed, will enable us our customers to easily connect other devices to that plan. And I think that as we do more connections, you notice that we did not disclose total connections. As I've said that machine-to-machine is becoming a more complicated device and connection of the way the plans are built, so it's not important anymore of total connections. It's more important of our revenue increase based on the customers that we're growing. I think that if you look at our Fusion product that we just launched in certain states, our trials are going very well. The customers' experience is extremely strong. We had a target of 10 million homes that we're going to launch to in May of this when we commercially we launch. And that will build to as we build out the 4G LTE footprint to a target of 34 million homes. We believe that's a growth engine for us in future. Then we have tablets, we have prepaid. This is the second quarter in a row where we've grown our prepaid base with our Unleashed product. And in the next week or so, you're going to see us add in a smartphone to our prepaid product on an $80 price point with 1 gigabit of data. So there's a number of actions that we're taking. If you think about the third ecosystem and then also the cable partnership that we also just launched some new markets with Time Warner cable this past quarter, Kansas, Ohio and Carolinas. So we've continue to expand. I think we have a growth rate test to increase adds on a full year basis here, and we're on that track."

And then second, we've been getting a lot of questions about your ability to control iPhone subsidies. And maybe you can help us out a little bit.

And we saw significant volume previous to any volume that we had previously seen on tablet sales. So I think that going to the second quarter, that volume will continue. So yes, there was a little bit of a downward demand in the beginning, waiting for the new iPad to come out. So again, I think we're off to a good start. We sold 390,000 tablets in the quarter. And as we said, bulk of them were, 60%, for increase in tablet sales year-over-year. So I think going into the future, tablets will continue to be a very strategic segment of our business. On the Apple iPhone, look, I think as I've said before, we look at every individual handset, we have a broad portfolio. We manage it handset-by-handset and manage our subsidy and again, that's just one aspect of our P&L. And this is just a nature of this business that's grown from the beginning of the industry that we subsidize handsets. I do think though it is important that there is a third ecosystem that's brought into the mix here. And we are fully supportive of that with Microsoft, and as we said that we created the Android platform from beginning. And it is an incredible platform today that we helped to create. And we're looking to do the same thing with a third ecosystem. So that's how I think that we plan to go into the future here."

On the enterprise, VDMS, think we're making great progress with the new organization and the umbrella organization that John Stratton has over both Wireless and Wireline from an enterprise perspective. We have gone very deep into verticals. We see that there is, and if you paid attention to Lowell's remarks here recently at the healthcare forum, we see a lot of healthcare opportunity and are engaging in a lot of partnerships to extend what we think is a really good product set on the reduction of overall healthcare cost in the nation, but also to deliver some really neat innovation-type ideas into the future of healthcare and how we manage that from an enterprise perspective. As far as overall growth of the segment, we did see a decline this quarter in Europe. It was not expected. Just to give you some baseline here, last year, our European market was growing on average about 13%. It contributes about $450 million of revenue per quarter. We saw that drop to flat this quarter. So there was a drastic pullback in our European market. We don't believe that, that is long-term. We think that that's more of a short-term issue. We already started to see some increased bookings here exiting the first quarter, but that probably won't turn into revenue for 3 to 6 months. As you know, this industry is a longer-term type recording from the time that you get an order. So I think this is a short-term issue for us, but it did put an impact on our overall growth. Now having said that, our cloud services and our strategic nature of our security are those portfolios are growing well. Our overall cloud portfolio grew by 17% quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. So I think we're making progress in the areas that we want to make progress in, but again, the portfolio rationalization is also creating a drag here. And as we continue down that path, we will lose some revenue in those less-profitable platforms that we really want to discontinue investing in, but it's for the betterment of us and betterment of our customers to move them to a more highly innovative platform. And then the last thing, of course, is the development and launch that we did last June of our VDMS platform, and we will be launching our next phase of that come this June, and we expect to see some growth revenue acceleration from that platform as we go here. So there's a number of things that John is implementing that I think will contribute. As I said in my script here, the -- contribute of the future growth of the overall Wireline, revenue top line and margin growth."

So let's talk about the facts. So #1, I think Verizon Wireless has shown over time that they are very, very good stewards of Spectrum and efficient Spectrum. And we are responsible and efficient owners of the Spectrum. And as a company policy, we will not hoard the Spectrum. Now when we bought this back in 2008, obviously, we did not have the foresight to know that we would have an opportunity to acquire AWS Spectrum from the cable company. And if you look at our Spectrum holdings, we purchased the 700 megahertz, which is an extremely efficient and this is where we built our LTE platform on. And then we had the AWS spectrum in these East, which was very efficient from an overbuild perspective on capacity of our LTE platform. And now with the deal that we have with SpectrumCo, we believe that is the most efficient for us to utilize and build out our LTE platform. So hence, the lower 700 megahertz A and B does not fit as nicely into our Spectrum holdings as it may for others. But we think it's the prudent thing to do, to sell these licenses off to the rest of the industry for the benefit of their customers and to enhance their ability to build out 4G LTE. So I think we would say that we're being good stewards. This has nothing to do. We did not just wake up yesterday and decide we were going to sell Spectrum because we ran into a roadblock at the FCC. That is continuing. We have a fact that say 180-day clock is going and that we are still very confident that we will get approval for the AWS acquisition from SpectrumCo. But just the 2 other points I want to make here is, #1 this is contingent on us getting the a getting the AWS Spectrum approved because, obviously, we would note that spectrum of that's not approved and again, we think it's the right thing for the FCC and maybe a standard for them to use in the future of how Spectrum should be allocated out and sold and efficient ownership and protocols. The other thing is I think there were some articles written that this is going to be a fire sale. This is nothing near a fire sale. We bought this Spectrum back in 2008. We've had carrying costs, and we will be prudent to our shareholders to make sure we get the return our investments. We know what the value of this Spectrum is in the free market, and obviously, we're going to an auction to allow many different parties to participate through a third-party auctioneer. And look, if we don't get the price that we think is a fair price, then we won't go through with the sale, and that's at our discretion. So I think there's some important facts and I'll stop there."

On the $2 billion Wireless cost cutting ideas, I think we've shown that we are very good executioners on the cost-cutting routines of $3 billion in the last 2 years. The $2 billion is a combination of a variety of things. You saw the announcement of some call center rationalization. Obviously, part of this $2 billion is to work on the reduction of our subsidies, and you saw -- you already seen some of these plans going back with our upgrade fees and some other things. So there's a wide breadth of cost-cutting initiatives that Dan, me and his team are executing on. And right now coming out of the first quarter, we're actually right on track where we expected to be. And then lastly, on the cable companies, obviously, we're still on a trial mode. We're working out the kinks. We launched a couple markets here with Comcast up in Seattle and Portland.

The agreements are still in front of the DOJ and the FCC and we continue to cooperate with them. And we'll wait till the transaction closes and get up full to speed and then we'll talk about that."

As far as Verizon Wireless depreciation and amortization, look, at the beginning of every year, we have a policy that we look at our asset base and reevaluate all of our estimated lives on all of our asset bases. And sometimes make decisions to accelerate and sometimes make decisions to reevaluate the lives that we have in a certain asset.

Before we get into the details, let me start with a few comments about our first quarter results. On our last earnings call in January, I talked about the confidence we have in our ability to benefit from the market opportunities we see in our key strategic growth areas. Our focus will continue to be on execution, striving to capture incremental revenue and driving operating efficiencies throughout the business. With the results of our first quarter, we continue to execute and deliver on the guidance we gave back in January of 2011 and reaffirmed earlier this year. We remain as confident in the direction of our business now as we were then, and we continue to deliver strong results.
Earnings per share were $0.59, up 15.7% over first quarter last year. In Wireless, we saw a sharp acceleration of growth in retail service revenue and postpaid ARPU, driven by increased smartphone penetration and higher data device adoption, resulting in increased usage. This top line growth, combined with effective cost management, resulted in a very strong service EBITDA margin. Consumer retail revenue growth also continues to improve, driven by another solid quarter of FiOS performance. Our broadband net adds were the highest we have seen in nearly 3 years.
We had an extremely strong quarter of cash generation. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion is more than 3.5x the amount generated a year ago. The first quarter is normally the lowest quarter of the year, so we expect to see increasing free cash flow levels going forward. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were down more than 18% as our disciplined approach is resulting in capital efficiency gains and an improving return on investment profile for the entire business.
Let's begin our review with a look at consolidated results on Slide 4. Our consolidated results show strong growth this quarter. On the top line, our growth trends continue to be very positive, coming from all strategic areas, most notably, Wireless services. This quarter, overall revenue growth far outweighed the increase in operating expenses, resulting in double-digit operating income growth of 16.7%. Consolidated EBITDA grew to $9.2 billion, and our margin expanded to 32.7%, up 130 basis points year-over-year and 210 basis points sequentially.
Let's turn now to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 5. Our free cash flow this quarter increased $1.7 billion, driven by reduced levels of capital spending and an 18% increase in cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled $3.6 billion in the quarter, a decrease of about $800 million compared to last year. Our overall capital efficiency continued to show steady improvement. We expect our annual CapEx-to-revenue ratio to decline for the full year based on improving revenue trends and disciplined capital spending.
In Wireless, capital spending in the quarter was $1.9 billion, which was lower by $850 million or 31% from the first quarter last year. You will recall that at this time last year, we were spending more to meet 3G capacity requirements in connection with our initial launch of the iPhone. As we move through the year, you will see a continued focus on migrating traffic from 3G to 4G LTE, which will drive additional improvements in our capital and operating efficiency. We will also continue to expand our 4G LTE network coverage, which is already the largest in the nation.
In Wireline, capital spending was $1.5 billion this quarter, about 5% higher than the first quarter last year. This increase is due to timing, strategic spending in enterprise and some copper-to-fiber migration within our residential customer base.
Our balance sheet remains very strong. You will recall that the $10 billion cash distribution from Verizon Wireless was paid this quarter. We used our proportionate share and part to pay down commercial paper and to redeem a maturing bond. As a result, total debt declined by $3.6 billion since the end of last year. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.3x at the end of the quarter.
Let's now move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 6. Our Wireless business had an impressive quarter and a strong start to the year, posting accelerated growth in service revenue and our highest retail postpaid ARPU accretion in 3 years. Total Wireless revenues of $18.3 billion grew 8.2% and now represent about 65% of Verizon's consolidated revenue. Retail service revenue growth accelerated to 8.9%, 110 basis point increase in growth from the fourth quarter and the highest growth rate we've seen since early 2009. We are seeing strong revenue growth from multiple postpaid sources: Smartphones, tablets and Internet devices. And retail prepaid revenue grew strongly again this quarter, up 17.3%.
Total service revenue grew 7.7% this quarter, 130 basis points higher than the growth rate in the fourth quarter. Total data revenue of $6.6 billion grew 21.1%. Data now represents nearly 43% of total service revenue. Data revenue growth continues to be driven by web and email services, which increased to $4.3 billion in the quarter, up nearly 36%.
Let's take a closer look at our connections growth on Slide 7. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market, driven by sustained demand for our 3G and 4G LTE handsets, tablets and Internet devices. With the unmatched service quality of the nation's largest and most reliable wireless network. We have an industry-leading $93 million retail connections, 88 million postpaid and 5 million prepaid. During the quarter, we added 734,000 new retail net connections, 501,000 postpaid and 233,000 prepaid.
Before we discuss postpaid in more detail, I'd point out that within the prepaid net adds, 138,000 were tablets. About 60% of the prepaid tablets this quarter were 4G LTE. Within the retail postpaid category, gross additions were just over 3 million, down about 12% from a year ago. We believe this decline is both seasonal and a function of the timing of the new device launches last year. Our porting ratios with all carriers are favorable, and our postpaid churn metrics remain excellent. Although the first to report, we are confident that our 501,000 postpaid net adds is a strong result.
Postpaid device sales, both gross adds and upgrades, totaled about 10 million this quarter with 8% of our postpaid base upgrading devices. In addition to smartphones, we are also having great success in the Internet device category, which includes tablets. This quarter, we sold 765,000 4G LTE Internet devices, which is more than last quarter. We are the market leader in this space as mobile hotspots or Jetpacks, USB modems and tablets represent 8% of our retail postpaid connections. I would also point out that 62% of our active tablet base is postpaid.
Next, let's turn to Slide 8 and take a look at our smartphone and retail postpaid ARPU metrics. We had another strong quarter of smartphone sales, increasing the penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 47%. 72% of all retail postpaid phones sold this quarter were smartphones. We sold 3.2 million Apple iPhones and sold 2.1 million 4G LTE smartphones this quarter. We sold 500,000 or 30% more 4G LTE smartphones this quarter than we did in the fourth quarter.
Consistent with prior quarters, about 20% of our smartphone sales are gross adds or new to Verizon, and the rest are upgrades from our existing customer base. Within these upgrades, 42% are customers buying a smartphone for the first time, representing incremental recurring data revenue. This is a significant point of differentiation and a strength for us.
Retail postpaid ARPU was $55.43 this quarter, up 3.6%. This is a big acceleration in accretion over what we experienced in 2011. Growth in retail postpaid phone ARPU accelerated to 4.9% this quarter and now exceeds $57.
Postpaid Internet device ARPU was about $48 this quarter, a decline of 8.7% from last year but an improvement from an 11% year-over-year decline last quarter. Although postpaid ARPU for Internet devices is less than for phones, we are seeing double-digit year-over-year revenue growth driven by increased unit sales. We already have a majority share in this important category, and we continue to expand the market for devices, which enable higher usage. We also expect more network efficiency as an increasing percentage of data traffic moves to our 4G LTE network.
Let's turn to Slide 9, as I'd like to spend a few more minutes talking about the strength of our 4G LTE leadership. We are by far the market leader in 4G LTE, which is now available in 230 markets and more than 200 million POPs, covering over 2/3 of the country. Throughout the year, we will continue expanding our 4G LTE network with the goal of having a nationwide footprint similar to our 3G network by mid-2013. We are seeing increasing customer awareness of the capabilities of 4G LTE and a growing recognition of the superior performance of smartphones, tablets and Internet devices on the Verizon 4G LTE network. Third-party comparisons of our 4G LTE network performance compared with others generally ranks us highest in terms of consistency of access, performance and speed, with better average download speeds and significantly higher average upload speed.
In addition to our network deployment and coverage advantage, sales of 4G LTE products are clearly gaining momentum. In the first quarter, we sold 2.9 million postpaid smartphones and Internet devices, a 22% increase over the fourth quarter. The vast majority of devices we have for sale are 4G LTE. We now have a total of 8 million 4G LTE customer connections, representing 9% of our postpaid base. Of note, about 2/3 of these are smartphones. We remain very pleased by our 4G LTE progress. The Verizon 4G LTE network has become the destination of choice for consumer and enterprise customers, which is a very positive indicator for us looking forward.
Let's conclude our Wireless segment review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 10. In the first quarter, we generated $7.1 billion of EBITDA, which is an increase of 14.2%, and expanded our service EBITDA margin by 410 basis points sequentially to 46.3%. Our margin performance is once again a testament to our ability to execute very well on our strategy of balancing growth and profitability. The combination of accelerating service revenue and ARPU growth, and intense focus on cost controls and consistently excellent churn metrics are contributing to our industry-leading margin performance.
Going forward, we will continue to look at opportunities to mitigate the cost of higher equipment subsidies and commissions. We have identified $2 billion of cost saving opportunities for this year, and we are on track to capture these savings. We also announced the $30 upgrade fee, which will go into effect next week.
Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 11. Total Wireline revenue declined $202 million or 2% in the first quarter. About 60% of this decline is a result of targeted product rationalization actions we have taken to improve the quality of our revenue mix. Within wholesale, I'm referring to our continued exit from unprofitable international wholesale routes and contracts. In Enterprise, it is our deemphasis on selling of drop ship hardware or CPE. And the other revenue line item, the majority of the 82 million decline this quarter was from nonstrategic products, which include the former MCI mass markets business, long-distance, local wholesale and calling cards, public pay phones and directory assistance. We are exiting the calling card and public payphone businesses entirely.
While the Wireline revenue decline was accentuated by these targeted actions this quarter, growth in the strategic areas continues to mitigate the more secular and cyclical declines in other parts of the business. As we have stated, we are taking a hard look at all of our product lines and rationalizing those that are not meeting our strategic and financial requirements. For example, going forward, we will no longer be selling high-speed Internet or DSL over copper in areas where FiOS is available.
From a profitability perspective, first quarter EBITDA declined by $148 million year-over-year with 100 basis point decline in the EBITDA margin to 22.6%. The decline is due to several factors, revenue declines in less-strategic products and first quarter cost pressures like higher OPEB accruals, increased active benefit cost and escalators in certain content contracts. We have targeted price actions planned to help offset certain cost increases, which will contribute to our overall profitability goals this year. I remain confident that we will achieve EBITDA margin improvement for the full year, and we continue to be very focused on improving the long-term profitability of the Wireline business.
Let's take a closer look at our revenue performance starting with mass markets on Slide 12. As a result of the scale of FiOS and increased penetration, consumer ARPU has continued to steadily increase and is now over $97, up 8%. In addition, our residential connections trends continued to improve. We lost 205,000 retail residential connections in the quarter, representing a 6.8% decline year-over-year compared with a loss of 289,000 or 8.6% at this time last year. In the first quarter, we delivered strong broadband growth, gaining a total of 104,000 net subscribers. With a 193,000 FiOS Internet additions, we passed the 5 million FiOS subscriber mark and increased our penetration to 36.4%.
More than half our FiOS customers already use 20 megabit speed or higher. And with more devices like tablets, game consoles and smart TVs connecting to the Internet at home, demand for higher broadband speeds is on the rise. Later this year, we plan to introduce a series of higher speed packages that will further differentiate FiOS as the nation's fastest Internet service and allow us to continue to monetize our investment in the FiOS platform.
In FiOS Video, we added 180,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.4 million and increasing our penetration to 32.3%. Within our FiOS subscriber base, about 68% are triple-play, and our FiOS ARPU now stands that more than $148 per month. Our focus continues to be on increasing FiOS penetration, realizing additional operating and capital efficiencies and expanding margins.
Let's move next to our business markets, starting with Global Enterprise. Strategic Services continue to drive the overall positive growth in Global Enterprise revenue. We continue to post double-digit growth in application services like managed network, data center, security, cloud and IT infrastructure. Within the IP layer, private IP and Ethernet services are contributing to the growth.
In the first quarter, these services totaled $2 billion, up 11.6%, representing just over half of Global Enterprise revenue. As we've seen for the last several quarters, the growth in Strategic Services did outpace the decline in core Enterprise Services but not to the same degree.
As you might expect, we are experiencing some short-term revenue pressure from Europe and foreign-currency. In addition, our deemphasis on sale of hardware was worth about $43 million on a year-over-year basis. Growth in services revenue was 2.3%. Looking ahead, we do expect our enterprise business to contribute more to the overall Wireline revenue growth and profitability.
Our strategic repositioning of Verizon Enterprise Solutions has better aligned our strength in high-growth markets like cloud computing, machine-to-machine and advanced communications. Our acquisitions of best-in-class assets like Cybertrust, Terremark and CloudSwitch, combined with our industry-leading 4G LTE and global IP networks, gives us a unique platform of assets to provide comprehensive, integrated solutions to enterprise organizations.
In Global Wholesale, revenues in the first quarter declined $181 million or 8.9% due primarily to declines in voice and local services. As I said, we continue to take targeted actions to exit unprofitable routes and contracts, to improve the quality of our revenue mix during this period of secular decline and lower volumes. Partly offsetting these declines were continued growth in certain data services, most notably, fiber-based Ethernet.
Let's move now to our summary slide. Overall, we had a solid start to the year, and we remain confident in our ability to take advantage of the market opportunities we see and our key strategic growth areas. We are on track with our plans, and we expect to continue to deliver strong results going forward. Our focus will continue to be on execution, striving to capture incremental revenue and driving operating efficiencies throughout the business. Our success in stimulating top line growth and capturing cost savings will enable us to mitigate certain secular declines and cost pressures.
In terms of recent news, yesterday, we announced plans to conduct an open sale process for all of our 700 megahertz A and B Spectrum licenses in order to rationalize our Spectrum holdings. We acquired these licenses as part of the FCC auction 73 in 2008. The sale of this license is contingent upon the close of the purchase of the AWS licenses from SpectrumCo, Cox and Leap Wireless. These transactions are at varying stages of review by the FCC and the Department of Justice and are expected to close by mid-summer.
In closing, I'd reemphasize that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the investments we've made, further improving investment returns and creating significant shareholder value in the years to come.
With that, I will now turn the call back to John so we can get to your questions."

Can you help us think through prospects for further improvement in the rate of growth from here? And then second question just on Wireline margins, I think the reset in the first quarter was a bit larger than most of us had initially expected sort of going into the process. You talked about confidence in improvement from here. Just wondering how should we think about the pacing of this through the year? Would you expect it to be fairly linear and show up in the second quarter results or is this more back-end loaded, maybe contingent on a union contract?"

But on Wireless ARPU, let's start out with the fact that I think as we started out in 2011, we said that we had a path to accelerate",789,"So let's start. These are 2 actually big questions, and that probably will result in larger answers than you would expect. But on Wireless ARPU, let's start out with the fact that I think as we started out in 2011, we said that we had a path to accelerate the growth of our revenue. We came out of the fourth quarter, I reiterated my confidence on that projection. And as I sit here today and I will continue to reiterate that we are confident that we will continue to accelerate our growth in this category. And it's going to come from many, many different areas. So you have to keep in mind, number one, our smartphone penetration is at 47%, which means that there are 53% of our phone customers that are still on a basic phone. So we still have a lot of roadway here from a basic to smart upgrade. And as you know, 42% of our customers this quarter went from a basic phone into a smartphone category, so that is accelerating the growth. In addition, as you heard on the script, our Internet device category is starting to stabilize a bit, and we expect that to continue to go throughout the quarter on an ARPU basis. As last year, we reset prices, we expanded the category, so the growth of that category is expanding for us, but we knew we had some short-term ARPU pressure by the price resets that we launched into the marketplace. But that set us up for our 4G LTE launches. And as you saw, we had a stellar performance on a number of devices that we moved on our 4G network this quarter. So that's a couple of things. I probably could go into a lot more detail around our data sharing plans, our commercial launch of Fusion and if we want to get to more discussion on that, we can. But we are very, very confident that we are on a path to continue to accelerate the growth of our ARPU. On Wireline margins, just a couple of things here, too, to talk to. So number one, we did have the FiOS-to-copper migration, which impacted our short-term results but we've talked that this is a strategy that we're deploying. It is better for us long-term to get most of these customers off of our copper network to our FiOS network. As you saw that we are -- stopped selling our naked DSL in FiOS covered area and we started to convert a number of customers in this quarter over to our FiOS network from a voice perspective. Now a couple of things here that this will launch, number one, we will see a long-term benefit in our repairs and maintenance decrease over time. We will also get the upsell capability to start selling these voice customers on better speeds of FiOS and better experience. And also then into the linear TV product that we have to offer. And what we're seeing is the minimum number that we converted last year during our trials, we're starting to see a 30% sale upgrade on those customers, but it does take us 3 to 6 months to convince those customers to upgrade. So this is a longer-term type strategy. In addition, going into the future, you're going to see, you may have already saw, that we are starting to do some price-ups in strategic areas. We've also started that in April but over the next 2 quarters, we're going to have several priced-ups in our FiOS packages. In addition, we're going to rebundle certain of our packages to better bundle our content in order to make it more profitable based on the Tier that you picked for us. The other thing is that there's other revenue streams coming from down the pipe like home monitoring control that will contribute to the overall ARPU of our FiOS platform. We also have a very disciplined cost structure in place. As you see that, we declined our SG&A expense year-over-year. In April, we also had another ISP [ph] to our represented employees, which we had a number of people take. So we've already taken off 1,100 people from payroll since the quarter has closed. We are taking other measures around the consolidation of our back office operations, as I've talked to in the past. You see that we are exiting some of our unprofitable or low-margin businesses, which will help us in the future. And then, of course, the union contract and we can talk more about that. But obviously, the business needs a cost restructure and that's what that is about. So I'll stop there, I'm sure we'll have some more questions here."

And then, second of all, maybe on use of cash, could you remind us what your target leverage ratio is. We're at the, I guess, 1.3 now given that debt pay down. As we look out to next year and we're modeling another dividend, obviously you don't want to chat and you don't want to sort of look that far out, but I'm just trying to get a sense for the use of cash as we go forward?"

Number one is, as you know, we have been on a 2-year track here to reduce expenses in our Wireless unit. And over the last 2 years, we've taken out about $3 billion of expense. This year, we have another target of $2 billion. So I know that everyone is focused in on the subsidy model, but as I've said, that's just one line item in our P&L, and it takes managing the entire business to be an efficient business. And I think that Wireless has done a really excellent job on reduction of cost and creating more efficiency within the model. And that's what's driving the margins, beside the ARPU increases that you see in the revenue growth. And as we stated last year coming into this year, that our goal was to get back to our third quarter level of last year's margin and then continue to grow from there, and we're putting in all those actions to do that. As far as the $30 upgrade fee, I'll remind everyone that we started back in 2010 on a strategy to start to take out some of the lucrative promotions we had around upgrades by deleting the New Every Two program, limiting the amount of early upgrades that we allowed. And now the implementation of the $30 upgrade fee, which we were the last carrier to implement. But it's important, too, for the overall profitability of the business, and the experience that we expect to have within this business. So I think there's a number of actions that Wireless is taking to continue to focus on the ARPU expansion and then the margin expansion because we like to do both at Verizon, we grow and we expand our margins. And then as far as the use of cash here, on a targeted net debt-to-EBITDA. It's more important that I think we're comfortable with our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. This will improve over time as we continue to delever in certain areas where we think it's reasonable to do. You saw us take the proceeds of the Wireless dividend this quarter to pay down some debt that was maturing that was high-interest debt that, quite honestly, didn't make sense at this time to refinance in any perspective. So we will continue to manage our cash. Important, our dividend policy is extremely important to us, and Lowell and I have said very strongly that we will continue to the policy of our dividend. So I'll stop there, and we'll go on to the next question."

So look, I think it's safe to say that as we entered into this new negotiation, we knew that this is going to be an extremely difficult negotiation. We have said very strongly that we need cost structure within the Wireline business. Obviously, if you look at the profitability of this business over the last 5 years, it has decreased. And this cost structure is not palatable going forward. So we need to some concessions, we need health care contributions. We need some pension revisions. And look, were not asking for things that have not already been given to other companies. These are not new issues. They've already been given to some of our peer companies. So we are standing strong. We need this cost restructure in order to build on the profitability of our Wireline unit. The other thing is, look, we've invested over $24 billion into this unit on the FiOS platform. And in order for us to be competitive with our competitors of cable who don't have these very lucrative benefits and average salaries of $90,000 with an incremental $50,000 of healthcare and pension on top of that, we need some cost restructure here. So look, this is a hard negotiation. It took one of our peer companies over 500 days to get to where they were, 3 years ago in some of these breakthrough issues. So we continue to negotiate. We continue to put proposals on and we'll see where we go, but we knew this was going to be a long haul. And with my comment of improvement of Wireline margins, it's all built in those comments. On the Wireless adds, I think we're extremely pleased with the growth of our Wireless business on an add basis. If you look at, though there's going to be other categories that drive the growth of Wireless in the future, as I said, we will be launching our data share plan in mid-summer this year. We believe that, that plan, the way we have it designed, will enable our customers to easily connect other devices to that plan. And I think that as we do more connections, you notice that we did not disclose total connections. As I've said that machine-to-machine is becoming a more complicated device and connection of the way the plans are built, so it's not important anymore of total connections. It's more important of our revenue increase based on the customers that we're growing. I think that if you look at our Fusion product that we just launched in certain states, our trials are going very well. The customers' experience is extremely strong. We had a target of 10 million homes that we're going to launch to in May, of this year, when we commercially launch. And that we'll build to, as we build out the 4G LTE footprint to a target of 34 million homes. We believe that's a growth engine for us in the future. Then we have tablets, we have prepaid. This is the second quarter in a row where we've grown our prepaid base with our Unleashed product. And in the next week or so, you're going to see us add in a smartphone to our prepaid product on an $80 price point with 1 gigabit of data. So there's a number of actions that we're taking. If you think about the third ecosystem and then also the cable partnership that we also just launched some new markets with Time Warner cable this past quarter, Kansas, Ohio and Carolinas. So we've continue to expand. I think we have a growth rate test to increase adds on a full year basis here, and we're on that track."

It seems like the way you control costs, some [indiscernible] raising upgrade rates, some sort of pushing back on timing rather than cutting down on the actual subsidy of that device, is there a level of control you have on those subsidies over time or are you pretty much stuck with the way things are priced today?"

And we saw significant volume previous to any volume that we had previously seen on tablet sales. So I think that going to the second quarter, that volume will continue. So yes, there was a little bit of a downward demand in the beginning, waiting for the new iPad to come out. So again, I think we're off to a good start. We sold 390,000 tablets in the quarter. And as we said, bulk of them were -- 60% were increase in tablet sales year-over-year. So I think going into the future, tablets will continue to be a very strategic segment of our business. On the Apple iPhone, look, I think as I've said before, we look at every individual handset, we have a broad portfolio. We manage it by handset-by-handset and manage our subsidy and again, that's just one aspect of our P&L. And this is just a nature of this business that's grown from the beginning of the industry that we subsidize handsets. I do think though it is important that there is a third ecosystem that's brought into the mix here. And we are fully supportive of that with Microsoft, and as we said that we created the Android platform from beginning. And it is an incredible platform today that we helped to create. And we're looking to do the same thing with a third ecosystem. So that's how I think that we plan to go into the future here."

On the enterprise, VDMS, think we're making great progress with the new organization and the umbrella organization that John Stratton has over both Wireless and Wireline from an enterprise perspective. We have gone very deep into verticals. We see that there is, and if you paid attention to Lowell's remarks here recently at the healthcare forum, we see a lot of healthcare opportunity and are engaging in a lot of partnerships to extend what we think is a really good product set on the reduction of overall healthcare costs in the nation, but also to deliver some really neat innovation-type ideas into the future of healthcare and how we manage that from an enterprise perspective. As far as overall growth of the segment, we did see a decline this quarter in Europe. It was not expected. Just to give you some baseline here, last year, our European market was growing on average about 13%. It contributes about $450 million of revenue per quarter. We saw that drop to flat this quarter. So there was a drastic pullback in our European market. We don't believe that, that is long-term. We think that that's more of a short-term issue. We already started to see some increased bookings here exiting the first quarter, but that probably won't turn into revenue for 3 to 6 months. As you know, this industry is a longer-term type recording from the time that you get an order. But I think this is a short-term issue for us, but it did put an impact on our overall growth. Now having said that, our cloud services and our strategic nature of our security are those portfolios are growing well. Our overall cloud portfolio grew by 17% quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. So I think we're making progress in the area that we want to make progress in, but again, the portfolio rationalization is also creating a drag here. And as we continue down that path, we will lose some revenue in those less-profitable platforms that we really want to discontinue investing in, but it's for the betterment of us and betterment of our customers to move them to a more highly innovative platform. And then the last thing, of course, is the development and launch that we did last June of our VDMS platform, and we will be launching our next phase of that come this June, and we expect to see some growth revenue acceleration from that platform as we go here. So there's a number of things that John is implementing that I think will contribute. As I said in my script here, the -- contribute of the future growth of the overall Wireline, revenue top line and margin growth."

So let's talk about the facts. So number one, I think Verizon Wireless has shown over time that they are very, very good stewards of Spectrum and efficient Spectrum. And we are responsible and efficient owners of the Spectrum. And as a company policy, we will not hoard the Spectrum. Now when we bought this back in 2008, obviously, we did not have the foresight to know that we would have an opportunity to acquire AWS Spectrum from the cable company. And if you look at our Spectrum holdings, we purchased the 700 megahertz, which is an extremely efficient and this is where we built our LTE platform on. And then we had the AWS spectrum in the East, which was very efficient from an overbuild perspective on capacity of our LTE platform. And now with the deal that we have with SpectrumCo, we believe that is the most efficient for us to utilize and build out our LTE platform. So hence, the lower 700 megahertz A and B does not fit as nicely into our Spectrum holdings as it may for others. But we think it's the prudent thing to do, to sell these licenses off to the rest of the industry for the benefit of their customers and to enhance their ability to build out 4G LTE. So I think we would say that we're being good stewards. This has nothing to do -- we did not just wake up yesterday and decide we were going to sell Spectrum because we ran into a roadblock at the FCC. That is continuing. We have facts that say the 180-day clock is going and that we are still very confident that we will get approval for the AWS acquisition from SpectrumCo. But just the 2 other points I want to make here is, number one, this is contingent on us getting the a getting the AWS Spectrum approved because, obviously, we would need this spectrum if that's not approved and again, we think it's the right thing for the FCC and maybe a standard for them to use in the future of how Spectrum should be allocated out and sold and efficient ownership and protocols. The other thing is I think there were some articles written that this is going to be a fire sale. This is nothing near a fire sale. We bought this Spectrum back in 2008. We've had carrying costs, and we will be prudent to our shareholders to make sure we get the return our investments. We know what the value of this Spectrum is in the free market, and obviously, we're going to an auction to allow many different parties to participate through a third-party auctioneer. And look, if we don't get the price that we think is a fair price, then we won't go through with the sale, and that's at our discretion. So I think there's some important facts and I'll stop there."

On the $2 billion Wireless cost cutting ideas, I think we've shown that we are very good executioners on the cost-cutting routines of $3 billion in the last 2 years. The $2 billion is a combination of a variety of things. You saw the announcement of some call center rationalization. Obviously, part of this $2 billion is to work on the reduction of our subsidies, and you saw -- you're already seeing some of these plans go into action with our upgrade feesand some other things. So there's a wide wrath of cost-cutting initiatives that Dan, me and his team are executing on. And right now coming out of the first quarter, we're actually right on track where we expected to be. And then lastly, on the cable companies, obviously, we're still in a trial mode. We're working out the kinks. We launched a couple markets here with Comcast up in Seattle and Portland.

So we're not seeing what others in the international market have seen. And again, it all comes down to the way you package the bundle and we still have a majority of our customers taking a bundled package of voice and text along with their data plan. So we're starting to see that -- that starting to flatten out perspective. But look, I mean, we keep our eye on this, and with 4G LTE and VoLTE coming at the end of this year into next year, there will be additional opportunities to convert more revenue from our voice products as we launch into more, if you will, IP-type videoconferencing and so forth. As far as Verizon Wireless depreciation and amortization, look, at the beginning of every year, we have a policy that we look at our asset base and reevaluate all of our estimated lives on all of our asset bases. And sometimes make decisions to accelerate and sometimes we make decisions to reevaluate the lives that we have in a certain asset. And we've done that this year as we do every year, and in Verizon Wireless, there was a life extension on our entire EV-DO platform. But this is nothing unusual that we normally don't do. And so that's the answer to that one."

Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning, I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo.
Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.
I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website.
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on the website.
Before Fran takes you through the details of our results, I'd like to cover a few items upfront. Second quarter earnings per share were $0.64, up 12.3% from last year and $0.05 higher than the first quarter. Through the first half of the year, EPS of $1.23 was 15% higher than a year ago. There were no special items of nonoperational nature included in our reported results for the second quarter or the first half of this year for the comparable period in 2011. 
In terms of activity below the operating income line, you will note that equity and earnings from unconsolidated businesses, which is primarily our minority interest in Vodafone Italy, declined by about $50 million this quarter due to the continued economic pressures in Europe. This represents about $0.02 in earnings per share. Other than that, there was nothing unusual in terms of other income, interest or income taxes. 
I'd also point out that the quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Fran."

Before we get into the details, let me start with a few comments about our financial results. We continue to execute well across the entire business. Solid top line performance combined with a strong focus on profitability and cost management has resulted in double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share for the last 2 quarters. This strong operating performance, together with our disciplined capital spending is driving significant increases in free cash flow, resulting in capital efficiency gains and an improving return on investment profile for the entire business. Through the first half of the year, we generated $7.8 billion of free cash flow, which is more than twice the amount we generated in the first half of 2011.
The Wireless business is firing on all cylinders, and our strategic actions and results clearly demonstrate our position of leadership in the industry. We continue to post strong growth in retail service revenue, driven by increased smartphone penetration, Internet device adoption and new customer additions. In the second quarter, this top line growth, combined with effective cost management and excellent customer retention, resulted in our record-setting EBITDA service margin of 49%, which surpassed our previous high of 47.8% in the third quarter of last year. 
In Wireline, consumer revenues were up 2.5%, which was a highest growth rate we've seen in several years. While we continue to face challenges in the enterprise and wholesale markets, we are confident that the decisions we're making and the actions we are taking are the right ones for the long-term. We are intensely focused on profitability management and key actions related to this include product portfolio rationalization, targeted pricing moves and cost management initiatives. I will go through these in more detail during our segment review.
In time, these actions will result in improved Wireline profitability. In spite of some revenue softness this quarter, we were able to increase the EBITDA margin by 50 basis points sequentially to 23.1%, and our objective is to have a stronger EBITDA margin in the second half of 2012. Overall, a strong second quarter and first half putting us solidly on track to meet our financial objectives for the year. Let's begin our review with a look at consolidated results on Slide 4.
On Slide 4, we sustained solid consolidated growth trends in the quarter, with contributions from all strategic areas. Consolidated revenue grew to $28.6 billion, up 3.7%. Our focus on expense controls helped drive double-digit operating income growth of [indiscernible] revenue increased $310 million sequentially, operating income is up over $450 million. This clearly demonstrate that our product rationalization, cost management and process improvement efforts are starting to payoff. We continue to be very focused on improving profitability, moving more of every dollar we generate to the bottom line.
Consolidated EBITDA grew to $9.8 billion and our margin expanded to 34.2%, up 150 basis points on both the year-over-year and sequential basis. The upshot is an improved earnings growth trajectory for this year as indicated in his introductory remarks, we posted better than 12% EPS growth in the second quarter, and we are up 15% year-to-date, which is at the upper end of the guidance we provided in January of last year. 
Let's turn now to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 5. Our free cash flow this quarter increased $3 billion sequentially to $5.4 billion, driven by a 56% increase in cash from operations and reduced levels of capital spending. Capital expenditures totaled $3.9 billion in the quarter, a decrease of about $690 million compared to last year. For the first half, capital spending of $7.4 billion was down more than 16% year-to-date. Our outlook for the full year is flat to down versus $16.2 billion in 2011. We continue to expect our annual CapEx-to-revenue ratio to decline based on improving revenue trends and disciplined capital spending. 
In Wireless, CapEx in the second quarter was $2 billion, which was 23% lower than last year. To the first half, Wireless capital of $3.9 billion was down 27% year-over-year. You will recall that in the first half of last year, we were spending more for 3G capacity in connection with our initial launch of the iPhone. Going forward, we expect to see continued migration of traffic from 3G to our lower-cost 4G LTE platform, which will drive further improvements in operating and capital efficiency.  We will also continue expanding our 4G LTE network coverage, which is already the largest in the nation by a wide margin. 
In Wireline, we spent $1.6 billion in capital during the second quarter, 5.3% less than last year. Through the first half, wireline capital was essentially flat with last year at $3.1 billion. 
Our balance sheet and credit metrics remained very strong. Total debt of $52.4 billion is down $2.8 billion since the end of last year. Net debt was $42.4 billion at the end of June, and our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.2x. 
Let's now move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 6. Our Wireless business has another very impressive quarter, sustaining strong growth in retail service revenue, how your retail postpaid ARPU growth and excellent cost and [indiscernible], resulting in our highest EBITDA service margin ever. Total Wireless revenues of $18.6 billion grew 7.4% and now represents 65% of Verizon's consolidated revenue year-to-date. Our revenue results were driven by 8.6% growth in retail service revenue. Postpaid revenue, which makes up most of retail service grew 8.3%. Retail prepaid revenue was also very strong, up 27.2%, the highest growth we've seen in 4 years. Total service revenue grew 7.3% this quarter and is up 7.5% year-to-date. Data, which represents almost 44% of service revenue, grew 18.5% to $6.9 billion in the quarter. Retail postpaid data revenue grew more than 20%. 
Let's take a closer look at connection growth on Slide 7. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market, driven by sustained demand for our 3G and 4G LTE handsets, tablets and Internet devices, with the unmatched service quality of the nation's largest and most reliable wireless network. We have an industry-leading 94.2 million retail connections, with nearly 89 million postpaid and more than 5.3 million prepaid. During the quarter, we added 1.2 million new retail net connections, 888,000 post paid and 290,000 prepaid. 
Before we discuss postpaid in more detail, I'd highlight another strong quarter of retail prepaid performance with a 24% sequential increase in net adds. Similar to last quarter, tablets represented a little more than half of the adds. However, this quarter, 95% of our prepaid tablet additions were 4G LTE, which is key from the standpoint of better operating and capital efficiency. 
In postpaid, our 888,000 net adds represent a substantial sequential increase from 501,000 in the first quarter. Our [indiscernible] ratios with the major carriers continue to be strong and our churn metrics remained excellent. Retail postpaid churn of 0.84% is the lowest we've seen in 4 years. Postpaid growth additions in the quarter were just over 3.1 million, up about 3% sequentially. As expected, upgrades were lower sequentially with about 7% of our postpaid base upgrading devices in the quarter. 
In addition to increasing smartphone penetration, we also continue to make good progress with Internet devices, which include postpaid tablets. In the second quarter, about 90% of the Internet device sales were 4G LTE. We are far and away the market leader in this space with more than 7.5 million Internet device connections in our retail postpaid base. 
Next, let's turn to Slide 8 and take a look at smartphone and retail postpaid ARPU metrics. We had another strong quarter of smartphone sales, increasing the penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 50%. Once again, an increasing majority of retail postpaid phone sales were smartphones. 73% compared with 60% a year ago. During the second quarter, we activated 2.9 million DROID smartphones, 2.5 million of which were 4G LTE and 2.7 million Apple iPhones, up from 2.3 million a year ago. During the second quarter, 25% of iPhone sales were gross adds or new to Verizon, with 75% representing upgrades from existing customers. In terms of 4G phone sales, 20% were new to Verizon, and 80% upgrades. Importantly, more than 40% of customers upgrading this quarter were borrowing a smartphone for the first time. Retail postpaid ARPU was $56.13 this quarter, up 3.7%, which was higher than the previous record growth of 3.6% last quarter. 
In terms of a mix, retail postpaid phone ARPU of about $58 grew 4.9%, while Internet device ARPU of about $47 declined 6.6%. As expected, Internet device ARPU has become less dilutive to blended postpaid ARPU and growth. In addition, these devices continue to generate double-digit service revenue growth. Our 4G LTE deployment has expanded the market for these devices, all of which enable higher usage of our network.
Our share everything plans, which became available on June 28, represent a new and innovative pricing framework, providing a unique customer value proposition and, at the same time, creating an optimal way for us to monetize increasing data usage. The strategic for us to this plan is to encourage device adoption and stimulate usage. Our plans are designed to make the decision to upgrade to a smartphone or add a tablet much easier. By allowing up to 10 devices to share data, these plans also provide for the creation and adoption of all kinds of new connected devices. Early feedback has been great, and our customer adoption is tracking with our expectations. We are seeing a wide variety of customers and family share accounts, opting in to share everything, including existing smartphone customers with unlimited data plans. 
Let's turn to Slide 9 as I'd like to spend a few more minutes talking about the strength of our 4G LTE leadership. We are by far the market leader in 4G LTE coverage, which is now available in 337 markets covering more than 230 million POPs, which is nearly 75% of the U.S. population. In point of fact, we have more 4G LTE coverage than all of our competitors networks combine. Throughout the year, we will continue expanding our 4G LTE network, with the goal of having a nationwide footprint similar to our 3G network by mid-2013.
We continue to be very pleased with 4G LTE adoption. Customer awareness of our 4G LTE networks superiority is increasing and our new brand advertising further positions us as the network of choice for 4G LTE. Sales of 4G LTE devices have risen steadily. Each and every quarter since we launched service about 1.5 years ago. During the second quarter, 4G LTE smartphone sales increased more than 16% sequentially to 2.5 million units. Nearly 11 million or 12% of our 89 million retail postpaid connections are 4G LTE. Roughly 70% are smartphones and 30% are Internet devices. Stated another way, about 19% of our smartphone base has a 4G LTE handset. And more than 43% of our Internet device connections are 4G LTE.
While these statistics are impressive in their own right, they also show we have lots of room to grow, which is a very positive indicator for us looking forward. 
Let's conclude our Wireless segment review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 10. We generated $7.7 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, which is an increase of 15.8%, and expanded our EBITDA service margin by 270 basis points sequentially to 49%, again, a record high for us. Our margin performance is once again a testament to our sustained ability to execute well on our strategy of balancing growth and profitability. The combination of sustained service revenue and ARPU growth and intense focus on cost management, lower upgrade eligibility and consistently excellent churn metrics are contributing to our industry-leading margin performance. We will continue to look at all opportunities within our cost structure to drive process improvements and operating efficiencies. 
As I previously indicated, we have identified $2 billion in cost-saving opportunities in wireless. And we remain right on track to successfully capture these savings. From a transaction front, our purchase of the AWS licenses from SpectrumCo, Cox and Leap Wireless are varying stages of review by the FCC and the Department of Justice. We continue to expect approval and to close these transactions this summer. Our plans for an open sale process for our 700 megahertz A and B spectrum licenses are proceeding as planned but, of course, remain contingent upon the closing of the AWS purchases I just mentioned. The agreement that we announced in late June with T-Mobile to exchange specific spectrum in the AWS band is also contingent upon the closing of those transactions. These license transfers also require FTC approval, which is expected later this summer. These transactions are good for all parties in the industry as a whole, as we facilitate the best first use of this spectrum for all players. We appreciate the constructive role the FCC has played in this process and look forward to securing approval. 
Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 11.  Second quarter Wireline revenues were flat sequentially, but declined 3.1% year-over-year. From a profitability perspective, Wireline EBITDA declined 6% year-over-year but improved about 2% on a sequential basis with EBITDA margin moving up 50 basis points sequentially to 23.1% despite lower quarterly revenue. Wireline revenue is affected by a number of underlying factors. On the upside, revenue growth is accelerating in the consumer market, driven by FiOS, which again at 2.5% was the highest growth we've seen in several years. Enterprise and wholesale revenue continued to be impacted by secular and global economic challenges, particularly in Europe, as well as by related foreign exchange movements. 
In addition, as we indicated last quarter, we are also making deliberate and specific moves to rationalize and simplify our Enterprise Solutions product portfolio, eliminating products where they no longer make sense, reducing product complexity, streamlining services and consolidating networks to improve efficiency and product profitability. We currently have more than 700 different products and thousands of variations that are defined by particular geography, network or system. This portfolio simplification effort will dramatically improve our go-to-market speed and operations quality. 
In the near term, these actions create revenue impacts. Over time however, the actions will result in margin benefit and improved profitability. We estimate that about 65% of the overall Wireline revenue declined this quarter was a result of our own deliberate actions to improve profitability. Examples include the deemphasis of drop ship CPE, the continued exit from certain international wholesale routes and contracts, decommissioning end-of-life product like ADM, relay and IP VPN, no longer offering dry loop DSL or selling DSL and FiOS market and exiting nonstrategic product lines like calling cards and pay phones. Again, we firmly believe that these are the right actions to be taken at this time. We are on the right track and I am confident that these product rationalization and process simplification initiatives, along with additional cost management actions, would improve the long-term profitability of the Wireline business.
Let's take a closer look at revenue results starting with mass markets on Slide 12. Within mass markets, consumer revenue growth of 2.5% improved from 1.7% and 1.3% in each of the last 2 quarters. As a result of pricing actions related to set-top box rentals, triple-play bundles and higher data speeds available through our new FiOS Quantum offer, the outlook for accelerating consumer growth in the next several quarters looks very encouraging. Our residential connections trends also continue to improve. We lost 199,000 retail residential connections in the quarter, representing a 6.6% decline year-over-year compared with a loss of 240,000 or 8.2% at this time last year. 
FiOS revenue grew 17.4% in the quarter and now represents 65% of consumer revenue. As a result of the increasing scale of FiOS, total consumer ARPU is now over $100, up 8.5% from a year ago. FiOS ARPU now stands at more than $149 per month and 70% of our FiOS consumer customers are triple-play, with voice, Internet and video services. 
In terms of broadband, we added 134,000 new FiOS Internet additions and now have more than the 5.1 million subscribers, representing a penetration of 36.6%. We had a net loss of 132,000 DSL subscribers, which is higher than the last few quarters, primarily due to seasonality. We believe that the discontinuance of a dry loop DSL also negatively impacted net adds but was clearly the right decision from a profitability standpoint. 
In FiOS Video, we added 120,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.5 million and increasing our penetration to 32.6%. We continue to seek ways to drive FiOS revenue growth, improve operating and capital efficiencies and maximize profitability. Keep parts of the strategy include targeted pricing actions, further differentiating our services with the offers like FiOS Quantum. Our copper-to-fiber migration with chronic repair issues within FiOS markets and a number of other cost management initiatives. In light of these actions, we feel a more natural range for FiOS quarterly net adds going forward should be about 20,000 to 30,000 less than our previous range of 180,000 to 200,000. We are confident that at these levels, we can still maintaining and increasing revenue growth trajectory and expand profitability. 
Let's move next to our business markets, starting with Global Enterprise. Global Enterprise revenue was down $32 million sequentially or less than 1% but declined $136 million or 3.4% year-over-year. In addition to a $70 million impact from lower CPE sales in the quarter, foreign currency translation had an $84 million adverse impact on growth as the stronger dollar versus the euro and pound Sterling caused a decline in the current quarter compared with a benefit a year ago. Absent these effects, we would have had positive revenue growth in spite of the continued secular and global economic challenges. 
Strategic Services, which comprises 52% of Global Enterprise revenue totaled $2 billion, up 4.4%. While we continue to perform well in these services, international and FX are having an adverse effect on growth at this time. 
Looking ahead, we do expect our enterprise business to contribute more to the overall Wireline revenue growth and profitability, particularly as we work through our product streamlining and process efficiency initiatives. Our strategic realignment of Verizon Enterprise Solutions will better position us to unlock value in the core business, while better aligning our strength in high-growth markets like cloud computing, machine-to-machine and advanced communications. We remain confident in the strength of the enterprise asset portfolio and the value it will generate over the long-term. 
On the acquisition front, our purchase of your telematics has part Hart-Scott Rodino stage and we expect to complete the transaction in the third quarter. We look forward to combining fuse telematics robust service delivery platform and suite of applications with our global IP network, cloud, mobility and security solutions. We believe that this platform has the potential to reach beyond automotive and transportation and create new m-to-m opportunities in mobile have, asset tracking and home automation to name a few. 
Moving next to Global Wholesale, revenues in the second quarter declined $34 million or 2% sequentially and $203 million or 10% year-over-year due primarily to declines in transport services. We continue to take all the necessary actions to exit unprofitable routes and contracts and to better position the business in the fiber-based Ethernet data services space, as customers with special access transition from DS1s and DS3s. 
Let's move now to our summary slide. Overall, our strong second quarter and first half about putting a solidly on track to meet our financial objectives for the year. We continue to execute very well. Our solid top line performance in the first half of the year has been fueled by strong retail service revenues in Wireless and increasing growth in consumer Wireline. Our record high Wireless margins in the second quarter, combined with our strong focus on improving profitability through product rationalization and cost management in the Wireline, has driven double-digit growth in consolidated operating income and earnings per share for the last 2 quarters. 
This strong operating performance, together with our disciplined capital spending, drove significant increases in free cash flow and in improving return on investment profile for the entire business. We expect to continue to build on this momentum and look forward to a strong second half of the year. 
With that, I will now turn the call over back to John so we can get to your questions."

I am extremely confident with both of these actions, we can double our revenue growth by the end of this year from 2.5% to around 5%, and I am very confident in that we can accomplish that. So one is that we are really concentrating on revenue growth. Second is, as you know, we've really concentrated around copper-to-FiOS migrations. We nearly doubled the amount of migrations we did in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And also what we're seeing is the first quarter migrations up that we accomplished, these customers are generating more ARPU post migrations and free because they are also selected higher speeds under our Quantum offers. So I think the range, as we said, is probably in the neighborhood of 150 to 170. I know you said 160 to 180, but it's around 150 to 170. But we are on a steady growth pattern and I believe that we are really focusing in on better margins and acceleration of the top line. On the Verizon Wireless dividend, I know there's been a lot of press release out there and I'm not sure where this idea is coming from, but I can tell you right now, the only thing I will say is that there's no distribution on the agenda for the upcoming Verizon Wireless board and that's probably all I'm going to say at this point in time."

All right, so on the wholesale side, yes, 10% decline. This was accelerated from 8.9% in the first quarter. And to be honest, I think that we're fighting an uphill battle here on the core voice and LD product that will continue to decline. The focus right now is to reposition ourselves for Ethernet and fiber-to-the-cell and those products are picking up. And I think that quite honestly, the range that you see is probably the range that will continue, it's somewhere between 8% to 10% decline going forward. But again, this is a diminishing revenue stream and we will continue to manage that stream. On the union side of the house, as I mentioned before, when we entered into these negotiations, we knew that this was going to be extremely difficult and very hard negotiation and it was going to be a long-haul, not a shortfall. And given our peers, it took them 500 days to get the contributions and some pension resets and we're now almost a year into this or 365 days. So when you look at the profitability of this business over the last 5 years, it has decreased in this cost structure is not sustainable going forward. We really needed the business to address this cost structure in relation to the benefits, particularly healthcare contributions and pensions. And we need increased flexibility around our work rules, which we -- some of these work rules date back to 1960. So we aren't asking for things that have not already been given to other companies. These are not new issues for the union. Many of our peer companies are already there, so we are standing strong on our position of cost restructure in this business. The negotiations are continuing, albeit slow and the process will take as long as it takes for us. So at this point, that's what our report on the union negotiation."

So on the pension plan, we have looked at the bill preliminary but this is a very complex thing. I will tell you that the beginning of this year, we said we would have to contribute $1.3 billion into the plan. We have $400 million left to contribute for the remaining piece of this year, but I think there's other things that have to go into consideration here other than just the timing benefit of this bill. First, you have to look at the borrowing rates. Second, you have to look at tax rate structures and what the current rate is versus what future rates may be. And then you have to look at the overall pension strategy that we have related to our pension plans. So at this point, I'm not prepared to speak to whether we will adopt the funding plan or not adopt it. What I will tell you is that it's not material to the cash flow either this year or into the next 3 years. And again, it is just a timing issue. So I'll have more to report on that as we complete our analysis and come into 2013. As far as cash flow goes, we had an unbelievable quarter in cash flow from operation generation. Our continued focus in on investment and making the right investments to return additional investment on that and greater returns, both in the Wireline and the Wireless business. We've, as I said, we really have curtailed the spending on our EV-DO networks, which is generating more cash flow on the Wireless business. But again, without really going into a lot of detail here, the dividend policy is extremely important. It is a board decision, but it is very, very important to Lowell and I and we will continue to recommend to the board what we think is appropriate. And from a share buyback, as I said before, I don't think we're in a position to start buying back shares. It is always a timing issue for companies to win the best time to do that is and at this point, we probably won't be in a position to do anything like that until late '13 or early '14."

On July 1, we actually paid down another piece of that debt of $800 million. The cash right now is $8.4 billion, so net debt at the of this quarter was $2.4 billion. On the enterprise business, just to kind of set some of this up. As I said last quarter, our international revenue is about $400 million a quarter. We were growing close to 15% to 17% on a year-over-year basis, both within EMEA and Asia. Last quarter, we said that we saw the first time that it actually went flat on a year-over-year basis and this quarter we actually saw a decline on a year-over-year basis. Strategic Services is about 75% of our sales in international, which is very different than it is here in the United States. So with the FX impact and the impact that Europe is having on that strategic revenue stream, that is having an overall impact on the overall strategic revenue growth. I think the important here is that the way we move forward is that we are really building our business around platforms. And if you look at what we've done, we were rated #1 on the world on security. We have built our data center platform around our Terremark acquisition and now we're going to build our machine-to-machine and applications platform around this fuse telematics. And I think that presents a different paradigm to us going forward so I'm very optimistic on the enterprise business. We are showing still some growth in Strategic Services. And I think if we didn't have the headwinds and some of these other economic pressures, I believe we're a double-digit strategic growth company. There should be no reason why we can't get back to those numbers that we showed in the past 2 years. So I think this is a temporary thing. But given where we are with Europe, this could be another 2 to 3 quarters out, mid-'13 before we start to turn the quarter here. But we are positioning ourselves and I think we're making all the right decisions that when we need to turn the corner and get some economic relief that we will show a very good portfolio here."

I do think though that when we focus in on the consumer side of the house, as I said, I'm very confident that we can double our revenue growth here. We are very focused in on the profitability of FiOS. The profitability increase in Wireline this quarter was really, really centered around the FiOS, really progress that we made on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So I think we have a lot of good things here. And we'll just have to play this out, but very, very confident that we'll improve our Wireline margins here. On the upgrade side of the house, obviously, this is timing. A lot of things going to play here. We've made a lot of moves in the last 1.5 years around restructuring our upgrade policies. As you know, we launched our $30 upgrade fee. Obviously, these all has an impact on the level of upgrades. And then, of course, there's always that rumor mill out there with a new phone coming out in the fourth quarter. And so people maybe waiting. But look, we manage this on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I think the way I look at this though going into the back half of this year on the upgrades is that we'll manage this business on a profit and on a growth trajectory. And if you think about what Wireless has done when we get to the fourth quarter, we will have taken $5 billion out of our cost structure in the last 3 years, which is why we can generate margins of 49% which beat our all-time high from last year. So I think that Wireless has a very good track record and history to deliver both on profitability and growth."

I mean, I think again, just repeat what I said this we'll manage this business both on a growth and profitability perspective for Wireless and I think we've proven that.

So it will really factor in on the volumes that what new devices and I'm sure we're going to have plenty of new devices that come out now and between the holiday season. And if you look at on the device side of the house, we just launched the Samsung Galaxy 3 on our 4G LTE network. And it proves the point that when we launch a very technical phone that's great in appearance and viability, that people accept that phone and that phone is selling extremely well. So all these factors come into play, but I think that we are very, very confident that what we laid out in January of 2011 regardless of what phones come, what phones don't come, and what kind of the season it will be, we will hit our financial objectives. On the FiOS side of the house, as I said, we did have some seasonality pressure here. But look, we have to balance the perspective, almost if you look at our Wireless portfolio, we have to balance the consumer Wireline portfolio in the same fashion. We have to balance growth with revenue acceleration and improving profitability.

Good morning, and welcome to our Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo.
Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.
I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website.
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on the website.
Before Fran takes you through the details of our results, I'd like to cover a few items upfront. Second quarter earnings per share were $0.64, up 12.3% from last year and $0.05 higher than the first quarter. Through the first half of the year, EPS of $1.23 was 15% higher than a year ago. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature included in our reported results for the second quarter or the first half of this year for the comparable periods in 2011. 
In terms of activity below the operating income line, you will note that equity and earnings from unconsolidated businesses, which is primarily our minority interest in Vodafone Italy, declined by about $50 million this quarter due to the continued economic pressures in Europe. This represents about $0.02 in earnings per share. Other than that, there was nothing unusual in terms of other income, interest or income taxes. 
I'd also point out that the quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Fran."

Before we get into the details, let me start with a few comments about our financial results. We continue to execute well across the entire business. Solid top line performance combined with a strong focus on profitability and cost management has resulted in double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share for the last 2 quarters. This strong operating performance together with our disciplined capital spending is driving significant increases in free cash flow, resulting in capital efficiency gains and an improving return on investment profile for the entire business. Through the first half of the year, we generated $7.8 billion of free cash flow, which is more than twice the amount we generated in the first half of 2011.
The Wireless business is firing on all cylinders, and our strategic actions and results clearly demonstrate our position of leadership in the industry. We continue to post strong growth in retail service revenue, driven by increased smartphone penetration, Internet device adoption and new customer additions. In the second quarter, this top line growth, combined with effective cost management and excellent customer retention, resulted in our record-setting EBITDA service margin of 49%, which surpassed our previous high of 47.8% in the third quarter of last year. 
In Wireline, consumer revenues were up 2.5%, which was the highest growth rate we've seen in several years. While we continue to face challenges in the enterprise and wholesale markets, we are confident that the decisions we're making and the actions we are taking are the right ones for the long term. 
We are intensely focused on profitability management, and key actions related to this include product portfolio rationalization, targeted pricing moves and cost management initiatives. I will go through these in more detail during our segment review.
In time, these actions will result in improved Wireline profitability. In spite of some revenue softness this quarter, we were able to increase the EBITDA margin by 50 basis points sequentially to 23.1%, and our objective is to have a stronger EBITDA margin in the second half of 2012. Overall, a strong second quarter and first half, putting us solidly on track to meet our financial objectives for the year. Let's begin our review with a look at consolidated results on Slide 4.
we sustained solid consolidated growth trends in the quarter, with contributions from all strategic areas. Consolidated revenue grew to $28.6 billion, up 3.7%. Our focus on expense controls helped drive double-digit operating income growth of 15.5%. To put this is perspective, while consolidated revenue increased $310 million sequentially, operating income is up over $450 million. This clearly demonstrates that our product rationalization, cost management and process improvement efforts are starting to pay off. We continue to be very focused on improving profitability, moving more of every dollar we generate to the bottom line.
Consolidated EBITDA grew to $9.8 billion and our margin expanded to 34.2%, up 150 basis points on both the year-over-year and sequential basis. The upshot is an improved earnings growth trajectory for this year. As John indicated in his introductory remarks, we posted better than 12% EPS growth in the second quarter and we are up 15% year-to-date, which is at the upper end of the guidance we provided in January of last year. 
Let's turn now to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 5. Our free cash flow this quarter increased $3 billion sequentially to $5.4 billion, driven by a 56% increase in cash from operations and reduced levels of capital spending. Capital expenditures totaled $3.9 billion in the quarter, a decrease of about $690 million compared to last year. For the first half, capital spending of $7.4 billion was down more than 16% year-to-date. Our outlook for the full year is flat to down versus $16.2 billion in 2011. We continue to expect our annual CapEx-to-revenue ratio to decline based on improving revenue trends and disciplined capital spending. 
In Wireless, CapEx in the second quarter was $2 billion, which was 23% lower than last year. Through the first half, Wireless capital of $3.9 billion was down 27% year-over-year. You will recall that in the first half of last year, we were spending more for 3G capacity in connection with our initial launch of the iPhone. Going forward, we expect to see continued migration of traffic from 3G to our lower-cost 4G LTE platform, which will drive further improvements in operating and capital efficiency.  We will also continue expanding our 4G LTE network coverage, which is already the largest in the nation by a wide margin. 
In Wireline, we spent $1.6 billion in capital during the second quarter, 5.3% less than last year. Through the first half, wireline capital was essentially flat with last year at $3.1 billion. 
Our balance sheet and credit metrics remain very strong. Total debt of $52.4 billion is down $2.8 billion since the end of last year. Net debt was $42.4 billion at the end of June, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.2x. 
Let's now move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 6. Our Wireless business had another very impressive quarter, sustaining strong growth in retail service revenue, higher retail postpaid ARPU growth and excellent cost and churn management, resulting in our highest EBITDA service margin ever. 
Total Wireless revenues of $18.6 billion grew 7.4% and now represents 65% of Verizon's consolidated revenue year-to-date. Our revenue results were driven by 8.6% growth in retail service revenue. Postpaid revenue, which makes up most of retail service, grew 8.3%. Retail prepaid revenue was also very strong, up 27.2%, the highest growth we've seen in 4 years. Total service revenue grew 7.3% this quarter and is up 7.5% year-to-date. Data, which represents almost 44% of service revenue, grew 18.5% to $6.9 billion in the quarter. Retail postpaid data revenue grew more than 20%. 
Let's take a closer look at connection growth on Slide 7. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market, driven by sustained demand for our 3G and 4G LTE handsets, tablets and Internet devices, with the unmatched service quality of the nation's largest and most reliable wireless network. We have an industry-leading 94.2 million retail connections, with nearly 89 million postpaid and more than 5.3 million prepaid. During the quarter, we added 1.2 million new retail net connections, 888,000 postpaid and 290,000 prepaid. 
Before we discuss postpaid in more detail, I'd highlight another strong quarter of retail prepaid performance with a 24% sequential increase in net adds. Similar to last quarter, tablets represented a little more than half of the adds. However, this quarter, 95% of our prepaid tablet additions were 4G LTE, which is key from the standpoint of better operating and capital efficiency. 
In postpaid, our 888,000 net adds represent a substantial sequential increase from 501,000 in the first quarter. Our ratios with the major carriers continue to be strong and our churn metrics remain excellent. Retail postpaid churn of 0.84% is the lowest we've seen in 4 years. Postpaid gross additions in the quarter were just over 3.1 million, up about 3% sequentially. As expected, upgrades were lower sequentially, with about 7% of our postpaid base upgrading devices in the quarter. 
In addition to increasing smartphone penetration, we also continue to make good progress with Internet devices, which include postpaid tablets. In the second quarter, about 90% of the Internet device sales were 4G LTE. We are far and away the market leader in this space, with more than 7.5 million Internet device connections in our retail postpaid base. 
Next, let's turn to Slide 8 and take a look at smartphone and retail postpaid ARPU metrics. We had another strong quarter of smartphone sales, increasing the penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 50%. Once again, an increasing majority of retail postpaid phone sales were smartphones, 73% compared with 60% a year ago. During the second quarter, we activated 2.9 million DROID smartphones, 2.5 million of which were 4G LTE, and 2.7 million Apple iPhones, up from 2.3 million a year ago. 
During the second quarter, 25% of iPhone sales were gross adds or new to Verizon, with 75% representing upgrades from existing customers. In terms of 4G phone sales, 20% were new to Verizon and 80% upgrades. Importantly, more than 40% of customers upgrading this quarter were buying a smartphone for the first time. Retail postpaid ARPU was $56.13 this quarter, up 3.7%, which was higher than the previous record growth of 3.6% last quarter. 
In terms of the mix, retail postpaid phone ARPU of about $58 grew 4.9%, while Internet device ARPU of about $47 declined 6.6%. As expected, Internet device ARPU has become less dilutive to blended postpaid ARPU and growth. In addition, these devices continue to generate double-digit service revenue growth. Our 4G LTE deployment has expanded the market for these devices, all of which enable higher usage of our network.
Our ShareEverything Plans, which became available on June 28, represent a new and innovative pricing framework, providing a unique customer value proposition and at the same time creating an optimal way for us to monetize increasing data usage. The strategic thrust of these plans is to encourage device adoption and stimulate usage. Our plans are designed to make the decision to upgrade to a smartphone or add a tablet much easier. By allowing up to 10 devices to share data, these plans also provide for the creation and adoption of all kinds of new connected devices. Early feedback has been great and our customer adoption is tracking with our expectations. We are seeing a wide variety of customers and family share accounts, opting in to share everything, including existing smartphone customers with unlimited data plans. 
Let's turn to Slide 9, as I'd like to spend a few more minutes talking about the strength of our 4G LTE leadership. We are by far the market leader in 4G LTE coverage, which is now available in 337 markets covering more than 230 million POPs, which is nearly 75% of the U.S. population. In point of fact, we have more 4G LTE coverage than all of our competitors' networks combined. Throughout the year, we will continue expanding our 4G LTE network with the goal of having a nationwide footprint similar to our 3G network by mid-2013.
We continue to be very pleased with 4G LTE adoption. Customer awareness of our 4G LTE network superiority is increasing, and our new brand advertising further positions us as the network of choice for 4G LTE. Sales of 4G LTE devices have risen steadily each and every quarter since we launched service about 1.5 years ago. During the second quarter, 4G LTE smartphone sales increased more than 16% sequentially to 2.5 million units. Nearly 11 million or 12% of our 89 million retail postpaid connections are 4G LTE. Roughly 70% are smartphones and 30% are Internet devices. Stated another way, about 19% of our smartphone base has a 4G LTE handset and more than 43% of our Internet device connections are 4G LTE. While these statistics are impressive in their own right, they also show we have lots of room to grow, which is a very positive indicator for us looking forward. 
Let's conclude our Wireless segment review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 10. We generated $7.7 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, which is an increase of 15.8% and expanded our EBITDA service margins by 270 basis points sequentially to 49%. Again, a record high for us. Our margin performance is once again a testament to our sustained ability to execute well on our strategy of balancing growth and profitability. The combination of sustained service revenue and ARPU growth and intense focus on cost management, lower upgrade eligibility and consistently excellent churn metrics are contributing to our industry-leading margin performance. We will continue to look at all opportunities within our cost structure to drive process improvements and operating efficiencies. 
As I previously indicated, we have identified $2 billion in cost savings opportunities within Wireless, and we remain right on track to successfully capture these savings. On the transaction front, our purchase of the AWS licenses from SpectrumCo, Cox and Leap Wireless are at varying stages of a review by the FCC and the Department of Justice. We continue to expect approval and to close these transactions this summer. 
Our plans for an open sale process for our 700 megahertz A and B spectrum licenses are proceeding as planned but, of course, remain contingent upon the closing of the AWS purchases I just mentioned. The agreement that we announced in late June with T-Mobile to exchange specific spectrum in the AWS band is also contingent upon the closing of those transactions. These license transfers also require FCC approval, which is expected later this summer. These transactions are good for all parties in the industry as a whole as we facilitate the best first use of this spectrum for all players. We appreciate the constructive role the FCC has played in this process and look forward to securing approval. 
Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 11.  Second quarter Wireline revenues were flat sequentially but declined 3.1% year-over-year. From a profitability perspective, Wireline EBITDA declined 6% year-over-year but improved about 2% on a sequential basis, with EBITDA margin moving up 50 basis points sequentially to 23.1% despite lower quarterly revenue. Wireline revenue is affected by a number of underlying factors. On the upside, revenue growth is accelerating in the consumer market, driven by FiOS, which again at 2.5% was the highest growth we've seen in several years. Enterprise and wholesale revenue continue to be impacted by secular and global economic challenges, particularly in Europe, as well as by related foreign exchange movements. 
In addition, as we indicated last quarter, we are also making deliberate and specific moves to rationalize and simplify our Enterprise Solutions product portfolio, eliminating products where they no longer make sense, reducing product complexity, streamlining services and consolidating networks to improve efficiency and product profitability. We currently have more than 700 different products and thousands of variations that are defined by particular geography, network or system. This portfolio simplification effort will dramatically improve our go-to-market speed and operations quality. 
In the near term, these actions create revenue impacts. Over time, however, the actions will result in margin benefits and improved profitability. We estimate that about 65% of the overall Wireline revenue decline this quarter was a result of our own deliberate actions to improve profitability. Examples include the deemphasis of drop-shipped CPE, the continued exit from certain international wholesale routes and contracts, decommissioning end-of-life products like ATM, Frame Relay and IP VPN, no longer offering 'Dry Loop' DSL or selling DSL in FiOS markets and exiting nonstrategic product lines like calling cards and pay phones. Again, we firmly believe that these are the right actions to be taken at this time. We are on the right track and I am confident that these product rationalization and process simplification initiatives, along with additional cost management actions, would improve the long-term profitability of the Wireline business.
Let's take a closer look at revenue results, starting with mass markets on Slide 12. Within mass markets, consumer revenue growth of 2.5% improved from 1.7% and 1.3% in each of the last 2 quarters. As a result of pricing actions related to Set-Top Box rentals, Triple-Play bundles and higher data speeds available through our new FiOS Quantum offer, the outlook for accelerating consumer revenue growth in the next several quarters looks very encouraging. 
Our residential connections trends also continue to improve. We lost 199,000 retail residential connections in the quarter, representing a 6.6% decline year-over-year compared with a loss of 240,000 or 8.2% at this time last year. 
FiOS revenue grew 17.4% in the quarter and now represents 65% of consumer revenue. As a result of the increasing scale of FiOS, total consumer ARPU is now over $100, up 8.5% from a year ago. FiOS ARPU now stands at more than $149 per month and 70% of our FiOS consumer customers are Triple-Play, with voice, Internet and video services.
In terms of broadband, we added 134,000 new FiOS Internet additions and now have more than the 5.1 million subscribers, representing a penetration of 36.6%. We had a net loss of 132,000 DSL subscribers, which is higher than the last few quarters, primarily due to seasonality. We believe that the discontinuance of 'Dry Loop' DSL also negatively impacted net adds but was clearly the right decision from a profitability standpoint. 
In FiOS Video, we added 120,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.5 million and increasing our penetration to 32.6%. We continue to seek ways to drive FiOS revenue growth, improve operating and capital efficiencies and maximize profitability. Key parts of this strategy include targeted pricing actions, further differentiating our services with the offers like FiOS Quantum, our copper-to-fiber migration in areas with chronic repair issues within FiOS markets and a number of other cost management initiatives. 
In light of these actions, we feel a more natural range for FiOS quarterly net adds going forward should be about 20,000 to 30,000 less than our previous range of 180,000 to 200,000. We are confident that at these levels, we can still maintain an increasing revenue growth trajectory and expand profitability. 
Let's move next to our business markets, starting with Global Enterprise. Global Enterprise revenue was down $32 million sequentially or less than 1% but declined $136 million or 3.4% year-over-year. In addition to a $70 million impact from lower CPE sales in the quarter, foreign currency translation had an $84 million adverse impact on growth, as the stronger dollar versus the euro and pound sterling caused a decline in the current quarter compared with a benefit a year ago. Absent these effects, we would have had positive revenue growth in spite of the continued secular and global economic challenges. 
Strategic Services, which comprises 52% of Global Enterprise revenue, totaled $2 billion, up 4.4%. While we continue to perform well in these services, international and FX are having an adverse effect on growth at this time. 
Looking ahead, we do expect our enterprise business to contribute more to the overall Wireline revenue growth and profitability, particularly as we work through our product streamlining and process efficiency initiatives. Our strategic realignment of Verizon Enterprise Solutions will better position us to unlock value in the core business while better aligning our strength in high-growth markets like cloud computing, machine-to-machine and advanced communications. We remain confident in the strength of the enterprise asset portfolio and the value it will generate over the long term.
On the acquisition front, our purchase of Hughes Telematics has passed the Hart-Scott Rodino stage and we expect to complete the transaction in the third quarter. We look forward to combining Hughes Telematics' robust service delivery platform and suite of applications with our global IP network, cloud, mobility and security solutions. We believe that this platform has the potential to reach beyond automotive and transportation and create new m-to-m opportunities in mobile health, asset tracking and home automation to name a few.
Moving next to Global Wholesale, revenues in the second quarter declined $34 million or 2% sequentially and $203 million or 10% year-over-year due primarily to declines in transport services. We continue to take all the necessary actions to exit unprofitable routes and contracts and to better position the business in the fiber-based Ethernet data services space, as customers with Special Access transition from DS1s and DS3s. 
Let's move now to our summary slide. Overall, a strong second quarter and first half, putting us solidly on track to meet our financial objectives for the year. We continue to execute very well. Our solid top line performance in the first half of the year has been fueled by strong retail service revenues in Wireless and increasing growth in consumer Wireline. Our record-high Wireless margins in the second quarter, combined with our strong focus on improving profitability through product rationalization and cost management in the Wireline, has driven double-digit growth in consolidated operating income and earnings per share for the last 2 quarters. 
This strong operating performance, together with our disciplined capital spending, drove significant increases in free cash flow and in improving return on investment profile for the entire business. We expect to continue to build on this momentum and look forward to a strong second half of the year. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to John so we can get to your questions."

You slipped a little bit lower than that this quarter. I'm just -- can you help us think through that? You obviously talked about some price hikes. Are we also at a point where the base is large enough that 2Q seasonality and video i.e. worth negative and then rebounds in 3Q is starting to catch up with the business as well? And then second question just on the Wireless distribution. It was roughly this time last year you announced intention for a $10 billion upstream payment to the JV partners. Can you help us think through maybe a timeline for announcing the distribution for next year? And then given the stronger free cash flow that you've seen in the business, would that point sort of conceptually to a bigger distribution?"

So yes, there was -- we actually did have slower growth in this quarter than we anticipated. So a couple of factors here. One was there was a seasonable usually -- unusually high move season in the month of June compared to prior second quarter. So we experienced some additional moves out, and normally in this business, it takes us a quarter to recapture the move-in. So I think that partially was set off from a timing difference. But more importantly, I think that we have refocused more on our profit on the FiOS side. So first, we went through these price ups. You saw some of the benefits there in the first quarter where we drove our consumer revenue growth to 2.5%. And this was the price ups of our Set-Top Boxes and you're going to see more price ups coming in the third quarter around the bundles and into the fourth quarter. In addition, we launched our Quantum product and the price ups that we have on people choosing additional speeds. I am extremely confident with both of these actions, we can double our revenue growth by the end of this year from 2.5% to around 5%, and I'm very confident in that we can accomplish that. So one is that we are really concentrating on revenue growth. Second is, as you know, we've really concentrated around copper to FiOS migrations. We nearly doubled the amount of migrations we did in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And also what we're seeing is the first quarter migrations that we accomplished, these customers are generating more ARPU post-migration than pre because they are also selecting higher speeds under our Quantum offers. So I think the range, as I -- as we said, is probably in the neighborhood of 150 to 170. I know you said 160 to 180, but it's around 150 to 170. But we are on a steady growth pattern, and I believe that we are really focusing in on better margins and acceleration of the top line. On the Verizon Wireless dividend, I know there's been a lot of press lately out there and I'm not sure where this idea's coming from. But I can tell you right now, the only thing I will say is that there's no distribution on the agenda for the upcoming Verizon Wireless board, and that's probably all I'm going to say at this point in time."

All right, so on the Wholesale side, yes, 10% decline. This was accelerated from 8.9% in the first quarter. And to be honest, I think that we're fighting an uphill battle here on the core voice and LD product, and that will continue to decline. The focus right now is to reposition ourselves for Ethernet and fiber-to-the-cell, and those products are picking up. And I think that quite honestly, the range that you see here is probably the range that will continue is somewhere between an 8% to 10% decline going forward. But again, this is a diminishing revenue stream and we will continue to manage that stream. On the union side of the house, as I mentioned before, when we entered into these negotiations, we knew that this was going to be extremely difficult and very hard negotiations. And it was going to be a long haul, not a short haul. And given our peers, it took them 500 days to get the contributions and some pension resets, and we're now almost a year into this or 365 days. So when you look at the profitability of this business over the last 5 years, it has decreased in this cost structure is not sustainable going forward. We really need is a business to address this cost structure in relation to the benefits, particularly health care contributions and pensions, and we need increased flexibility around our work rules, which we -- some of these work rules date back to 1960. So we aren't asking for things that have not already been given to other companies. These are not new issues for the union. Many of our peer companies are already there, so we are standing strong on our position of cost restructure in this business. The negotiations are continuing, albeit slow, and the process will take as long as it takes for us. So at this point, that's what our report on the union negotiation."

I will tell you that at the beginning of this year, we said we would have to contribute $1.3 billion into the plan. We have $400 million left to contribute for the remaining piece of this year. But I think there's other things that have to go into consideration here other than just the timing benefit of this bill. First, you have to look at the borrowing rates. Second, you have to look at tax rate structures and what the current rate is versus what future rates may be. And then you have to look at the overall pension strategy that we have related to our pension plans. So at this point, I'm not prepared to speak to whether we will adopt the funding plan or not adopt it. What I will tell you is that it's not material to the cash flow either this year or into the next 3 years. And again, it is just a timing issue. So I'll have more to report on that as we complete our analysis and come into 2013. As far as cash flow goes, we had an unbelievable quarter in cash flow from operation generation. Our continued focus in on investment and making the right investments to return additional investment on that and get greater returns, both in the Wireline and the Wireless business. We've -- as I said, we really have curtailed the spending on our EV-DO networks, which is generating more cash flow on the Wireless business. But again, without really going into a lot of detail here, the dividend policy is extremely important. It is a board decision, but it is very, very important to Lowell and I, and we will continue to recommend to the board what we think is appropriate. And from a share buyback, as I said before, I don't think we're in a position to start buying back shares. It is always a timing issue for companies to -- when the best time to do that is. And at this point, we probably won't be in a position to do anything like that until late '13 or early '14."

On July 1, we actually paid down another piece of that debt of $800 million. The cash right now is $8.4 billion, so net debt at the end of this quarter was $2.4 billion. On the Enterprise business, just to kind of set some of this up. As I said last quarter, our international revenue was about $400 million a quarter. We were growing close to 15% to 17% on a year-over-year basis, both within EMEA and in Asia. Last quarter, we said that we saw the first time that it actually went flat on a year-over-year basis, and this quarter, we actually saw a decline on a year-over-year basis. Strategic Services is about 75% of our sales in international, which is very different than it is here in the United States. So with the FX impact and the impact that Europe is having on that strategic revenue stream, that is having an overall impact on the overall strategic revenue growth. I think the important thing here is the way we move forward is that we are really building our business around platforms. And if you look at what we've done, we're rated #1 in the world on security. We have built our data center platform around our Terremark acquisition, and now we're going to build our machine-to-machine and applications platform around the Hughes Telematics. And I think that brings a different paradigm to us going forward. So I'm very optimistic on the Enterprise business. We are showing still some growth in Strategic Services. And I think if we didn't have the headwinds and some of these other economic pressures, I believe we're a double-digit strategic growth company. There should be no reason why we can't get back to those numbers that we showed in the past 2 years. So I think this is a temporary thing. But given where we are with Europe, this could be another 2 to 3 quarters out, mid '13 before we start to turn the corner here. But we are positioning ourselves and I think we're making all the right decisions that when we need to turn the corner and get some economic relief, that we will show a very good portfolio here."

Look, we are very, very solid on improving our Wireline margin here in the second half versus the first half. But I think that given some of the cost structure issues that we have, especially around the contract, we think that we can still improve our margins. If we can get to a better end here with the contract, then I think that we can actually improve our margins on a year-over-year basis. But that will come down to a timing issue. I do think, though, that when we focus in on the consumer side of the house, as I said, I'm very confident that we can double our revenue growth here. We are very focused in on the profitability of FiOS. The profitability increase in Wireline this quarter was really, really centered around the FiOS, really progress that we made on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So I think we have a lot of good things here, and we'll just have to play this out. But very, very confident that we'll improve our Wireline margins here. On the upgrade side of the house, obviously, this is timing. A lot of things go into play here. We've made a lot of moves in the last 1.5 years around restructuring our upgrade policies. As you know, we launched our $30 upgrade fee. Obviously, these all has an impact on the level of upgrades. And then, of course, there's always that rumor mill out there with a new phone coming out in the fourth quarter, and so people may be waiting. But look, we manage this on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I think the way I look at this, though, going into the back half of this year on the upgrades is that we'll manage this business on a profit and on a growth trajectory. And if you think about what Wireless has done when we get to the fourth quarter, we will have taken $5 billion out of our cost structure in the last 3 years, which is why we can generate margins of 49%, which beat our all-time high this -- from last year. So I think that Wireless has a very good track record and history to deliver both on profitability and growth."

I mean, I think, again, I'll just repeat what I said is we'll manage this business both on a growth and profitability perspective for Wireless. And I think we've proven that. Look, I mean, obviously, the fourth quarter is always a seasonable volume quarter for the industry. And I expect that to happen again with the holiday season that's coming up. So it will really factor in on the volumes, what new devices and I'm sure we're going to have plenty of new devices that come out between now and the holiday season. And if you look at -- on the device side of the house, we just launched the Samsung GALAXY III on our 4G LTE network. And it proves the point that when we launch a very technical phone that's great in appearance and viability, that people accept that phone, and that phone is selling extremely well. So all these factors come into play, but I think that we are very, very confident that what we laid out in January of 2011, regardless of what phones come, what phones don't come, and what kind of the season it will be, we will hit our financial objectives. On the FiOS side of the house, as I said, we did have some seasonality pressure here. But look, we have to balance the perspective, almost if you look at our Wireless portfolio, we have to balance the consumer Wireline portfolio in the same fashion. We have to balance growth with revenue acceleration and improving profitability. And that's what we're set out to do, and we'll make the decisions and the right ones to -- in order to achieve all 3 of those metrics."

Good morning, and welcome to our Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo.
Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.
I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website.
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on the website.
Before Fran takes you through the details of our results, I'd like to cover a few items upfront. Second quarter earnings per share were $0.64, up 12.3% from last year and $0.05 higher than the first quarter. Through the first half of the year, EPS of $1.23 was 15% higher than a year ago. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature included in our reported results for the second quarter or the first half of this year or the comparable periods in 2011. 
In terms of activity below the operating income line, you will note that equity and earnings from unconsolidated businesses, which is primarily our minority interest in Vodafone Italy, declined by about $50 million this quarter due to the continued economic pressures in Europe. This represents about $0.02 in earnings per share. Other than that, there was nothing unusual in terms of other income, interest or income taxes. 
I'd also point out that the quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Fran."

Before we get into the details, let me start with a few comments about our financial results. We continue to execute well across the entire business. Solid top line performance combined with a strong focus on profitability and cost management has resulted in double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share for the last 2 quarters. This strong operating performance together with our disciplined capital spending is driving significant increases in free cash flow, resulting in capital efficiency gains and an improving return on investment profile for the entire business. Through the first half of the year, we generated $7.8 billion of free cash flow, which is more than twice the amount we generated in the first half of 2011.
The Wireless business is firing on all cylinders, and our strategic actions and results clearly demonstrate our position of leadership in the industry. We continue to post strong growth in retail service revenue, driven by increased smartphone penetration, Internet device adoption and new customer additions. In the second quarter, this top line growth, combined with effective cost management and excellent customer retention, resulted in our record-setting EBITDA service margin of 49%, which surpassed our previous high of 47.8% in the third quarter of last year. 
In Wireline, consumer revenues were up 2.5%, which was the highest growth rate we've seen in several years. While we continue to face challenges in the enterprise and wholesale markets, we are confident that the decisions we're making and the actions we are taking are the right ones for the long term. 
We are intensely focused on profitability management, and key actions related to this include product portfolio rationalization, targeted pricing moves and cost management initiatives. I will go through these in more detail during our segment review.
In time, these actions will result in improved Wireline profitability. In spite of some revenue softness this quarter, we were able to increase the EBITDA margin by 50 basis points sequentially to 23.1%, and our objective is to have a stronger EBITDA margin in the second half of 2012. Overall, a strong second quarter and first half, putting us solidly on track to meet our financial objectives for the year. Let's begin our review with a look at consolidated results on Slide 4.
We sustained solid consolidated growth trends in the quarter with contributions from all strategic areas. Consolidated revenue grew to $28.6 billion, up 3.7%. Our focus on expense controls helped drive double-digit operating income growth of 15.5%. To put this in perspective, while consolidated revenue increased $310 million sequentially, operating income is up over $450 million. This clearly demonstrates that our product rationalization, cost management and process improvement efforts are starting to pay off. We continue to be very focused on improving profitability, moving more of every dollar we generate to the bottom line.
Consolidated EBITDA grew to $9.8 billion, and our margin expanded to 34.2%, up 150 basis points on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. The upshot is an improved earnings growth trajectory for this year. As John indicated in his introductory remarks, we posted better than 12% EPS growth in the second quarter, and we are up 15% year-to-date, which is at the upper end of the guidance we provided in January of last year. 
Let's turn now to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 5. Our free cash flow this quarter increased $3 billion sequentially to $5.4 billion, driven by a 56% increase in cash from operations and reduced levels of capital spending. Capital expenditures totaled $3.9 billion in the quarter, a decrease of about $690 million compared to last year. For the first half, capital spending of $7.4 billion was down more than 16% year-to-date. Our outlook for the full year is flat to down versus $16.2 billion in 2011. We continue to expect our annual CapEx-to-revenue ratio to decline based on improving revenue trends and disciplined capital spending. 
In Wireless, CapEx in the second quarter was $2 billion, which was 23% lower than last year. Through the first half, Wireless capital of $3.9 billion was down 27% year-over-year. You will recall that in the first half of last year, we were spending more for 3G capacity in connection with our initial launch of the iPhone. Going forward, we expect to see continued migration of traffic from 3G to our lower-cost 4G LTE platform, which will drive further improvements in operating and capital efficiency. We will also continue expanding our 4G LTE network coverage, which is already the largest in the nation by a wide margin. 
In Wireline, we spent $1.6 billion in capital during the second quarter, 5.3% less than last year. Through the first half, Wireline capital was essentially flat with last year at $3.1 billion. 
Our balance sheet and credit metrics remain very strong. Total debt of $52.4 billion is down $2.8 billion since the end of last year. Net debt was $42.4 billion at the end of June, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.2x. 
Let's now move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 6. Our Wireless business had another very impressive quarter, sustaining strong growth in retail service revenue, higher retail postpaid ARPU growth and excellent cost and churn management, resulting in our highest EBITDA service margin ever. 
Total Wireless revenues of $18.6 billion grew 7.4% and now represent 65% of Verizon's consolidated revenue year-to-date. Our revenue results were driven by 8.6% growth in retail service revenue. Postpaid revenue, which makes up most of retail service, grew 8.3%. Retail prepaid revenue was also very strong, up 27.2%, the highest growth we've seen in 4 years. Total service revenue grew 7.3% this quarter and is up 7.5% year-to-date. Data, which represents almost 44% of service revenue, grew 18.5% to $6.9 billion in the quarter. Retail postpaid data revenue grew more than 20%. 
Let's take a closer look at connection growth on Slide 7. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market, driven by sustained demand for our 3G and 4G LTE handsets, tablets and Internet devices, with the unmatched service quality of the nation's largest and most reliable wireless network. We have an industry-leading 94.2 million retail connections, with nearly 89 million postpaid and more than 5.3 million prepaid. During the quarter, we added 1.2 million new retail net connections, 888,000 postpaid and 290,000 prepaid. 
Before we discuss postpaid in more detail, I'd highlight another strong quarter of retail prepaid performance with a 24% sequential increase in net adds. Similar to last quarter, tablets represented a little more than half of the adds. However, this quarter, 95% of our prepaid tablet additions were 4G LTE, which is key from the standpoint of better operating and capital efficiency. 
In postpaid, our 888,000 net adds represent a substantial sequential increase from 501,000 in the first quarter. Our porting ratios with the major carriers continue to be strong, and our churn metrics remain excellent. Retail postpaid churn of 0.84% is the lowest we've seen in 4 years. Postpaid gross additions in the quarter were just over 3.1 million, up about 3% sequentially. As expected, upgrades were lower sequentially, with about 7% of our postpaid base upgrading devices in the quarter. 
In addition to increasing smartphone penetration, we also continue to make good progress with Internet devices, which include postpaid tablets. In the second quarter, about 90% of the Internet device sales were 4G LTE. We are far and away the market leader in this space, with more than 7.5 million Internet device connections in our retail postpaid base. 
Next, let's turn to Slide 8 and take a look at smartphone and retail postpaid ARPU metrics. We had another strong quarter of smartphone sales, increasing the penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 50%. Once again, an increasing majority of retail postpaid phone sales were smartphones, 73% compared with 60% a year ago. During the second quarter, we activated 2.9 million DROID smartphones, 2.5 million of which were 4G LTE, and 2.7 million Apple iPhones, up from 2.3 million a year ago. 
During the second quarter, 25% of iPhone sales were gross adds or new to Verizon, with 75% representing upgrades from existing customers. In terms of 4G phone sales, 20% were new to Verizon and 80% upgrades. Importantly, more than 40% of customers upgrading this quarter were buying a smartphone for the first time. Retail postpaid ARPU was $56.13 this quarter, up 3.7%, which was higher than the previous record growth of 3.6% last quarter. 
In terms of the mix, retail postpaid phone ARPU of about $58 grew 4.9%, while Internet device ARPU of about $47 declined 6.6%. As expected, Internet device ARPU has become less dilutive to blended postpaid ARPU and growth. In addition, these devices continue to generate double-digit service revenue growth. Our 4G LTE deployment has expanded the market for these devices, all of which enable higher usage of our network.
Our ShareEverything Plans, which became available on June 28, represent a new and innovative pricing framework, providing a unique customer value proposition and, at the same time, creating an optimal way for us to monetize increasing data usage. The strategic thrust of these plans is to encourage device adoption and stimulate usage. Our plans are designed to make the decision to upgrade to a smartphone or add a tablet much easier. By allowing up to 10 devices to share data, these plans also provide for the creation and adoption of all kinds of new connected devices. Early feedback has been great, and our customer adoption is tracking with our expectations. We are seeing a wide variety of customers and families share accounts, opting in to share everything, including existing smartphone customers with unlimited data plans. 
Let's turn to Slide 9, as I'd like to spend a few more minutes talking about the strength of our 4G LTE leadership. We are by far the market leader in 4G LTE coverage, which is now available in 337 markets, covering more than 230 million POPs, which is nearly 75% of the U.S. population. In point of fact, we have more 4G LTE coverage than all of our competitors' networks combined. Throughout the year, we will continue expanding our 4G LTE network with the goal of having a nationwide footprint similar to our 3G network by mid-2013.
We continue to be very pleased with 4G LTE adoption. Customer awareness of our 4G LTE network superiority is increasing, and our new brand advertising further positions us as the network of choice for 4G LTE. Sales of 4G LTE devices have risen steadily each and every quarter since we launched service about 1.5 years ago. During the second quarter, 4G LTE smartphone sales increased more than 16% sequentially to 2.5 million units. Nearly 11 million or 12% of our 89 million retail postpaid connections are 4G LTE. Roughly 70% are smartphones and 30% are Internet devices. Stated another way, about 19% of our smartphone base has a 4G LTE handset, and more than 43% of our Internet device connections are 4G LTE. While these statistics are impressive in their own right, they also show we have lots of room to grow, which is a very positive indicator for us looking forward. 
Let's conclude our Wireless segment review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 10. We generated $7.7 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, which is an increase of 15.8% and expanded our EBITDA service margins by 270 basis points sequentially to 49%. Again, a record high for us. Our margin performance is once again a testament to our sustained ability to execute well on our strategy of balancing growth and profitability. The combination of sustained service revenue and ARPU growth and intense focus on cost management, lower upgrade eligibility and consistently excellent churn metrics are contributing to our industry-leading margin performance. We will continue to look at all opportunities within our cost structure to drive process improvements and operating efficiencies. 
As I’ve previously indicated, we have identified $2 billion in cost-savings opportunities in Wireless, and we remain right on track to successfully capture these savings. On the transaction front, our purchase of the AWS licenses from SpectrumCo, Cox and Leap Wireless are at varying stages of review by the FCC and the Department of Justice. We continue to expect approval and to close these transactions this summer. 
Our plans for an open sale process for our 700 megahertz A and B spectrum licenses are proceeding as planned but, of course, remain contingent upon the closing of the AWS purchases I just mentioned. The agreement that we announced in late June with T-Mobile to exchange specific spectrum in the AWS band is also contingent upon the closing of those transactions. These license transfers also require FCC approval, which is expected later this summer. These transactions are good for all parties and the industry as a whole as we facilitate the best first use of this spectrum for all players. We appreciate the constructive role the FCC has played in this process and look forward to securing approval. 
Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 11. Second quarter Wireline revenues were flat sequentially but declined 3.1% year-over-year. From a profitability perspective, Wireline EBITDA declined 6% year-over-year but improved about 2% on a sequential basis, with EBITDA margin moving up 50 basis points sequentially to 23.1% despite lower quarterly revenue. Wireline revenue is affected by a number of underlying factors. On the upside, revenue growth is accelerating in the consumer market, driven by FiOS, which again at 2.5% was the highest growth we've seen in several years. Enterprise and wholesale revenue continue to be impacted by secular and global economic challenges, particularly in Europe, as well as by related foreign exchange movements. 
In addition, as we indicated last quarter, we are also making deliberate and specific moves to rationalize and simplify our Enterprise Solutions product portfolio, eliminating products where they no longer make sense, reducing product complexity, streamlining services and consolidating networks to improve efficiency and product profitability. We currently have more than 700 different products and thousands of variations that are defined by particular geography, network or system. This portfolio simplification effort will dramatically improve our go-to-market speed and operations quality. 
In the near term, these actions create revenue impacts. Over time, however, the actions will result in margin benefits and improved profitability. We estimate that about 65% of the overall Wireline revenue decline this quarter was a result of our own deliberate actions to improve profitability. Examples include the deemphasis of drop-shipped CPE; the continued exit from certain international wholesale routes and contracts; decommissioning end-of-life products like ATM, Frame Relay and IP VPN; no longer offering 'Dry Loop' DSL or selling DSL in FiOS markets; and exiting nonstrategic product lines like calling cards and pay phones. Again, we firmly believe that these are the right actions to be taking at this time. We are on the right track, and I am confident that these product rationalization and process simplification initiatives, along with additional cost management actions, will improve the long-term profitability of the Wireline business.
Let's take a closer look at revenue results, starting with mass markets on Slide 12. Within mass markets, consumer revenue growth of 2.5% improved from 1.7% and 1.3% in each of the last 2 quarters. As a result of pricing actions related to Set-Top Box rentals, Triple-Play bundles and higher data speeds available through our new FiOS Quantum offer, the outlook for accelerating consumer revenue growth in the next several quarters looks very encouraging. 
Our residential connections trends also continue to improve. We lost 199,000 retail residential connections in the quarter, representing a 6.6% decline year-over-year, compared with a loss of 240,000 or 8.2% at this time last year. 
FiOS revenue grew 17.4% in the quarter and now represents 65% of consumer revenue. As a result of the increasing scale of FiOS, total consumer ARPU is now over $100, up 8.5% from a year ago. FiOS ARPU now stands at more than $149 per month, and 70% of our FiOS consumer customers are Triple-Play, with voice, Internet and video services.
In terms of broadband, we added 134,000 new FiOS Internet additions and now have more than 5.1 million subscribers, representing a penetration of 36.6%. We had a net loss of 132,000 DSL subscribers, which is higher than the last few quarters, primarily due to seasonality. We believe that the discontinuance of 'Dry Loop' DSL also negatively impacted net adds but was clearly the right decision from a profitability standpoint. 
In FiOS Video, we added 120,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.5 million and increasing our penetration to 32.6%. We continue to seek ways to drive FiOS revenue growth, improve operating and capital efficiencies and maximize profitability. Key parts of this strategy include targeted pricing actions, further differentiating our services with the offers like FiOS Quantum, our copper-to-fiber migration in areas with chronic repair issues within FiOS markets and a number of other cost management initiatives. 
In light of these actions, we feel a more natural range for FiOS quarterly net adds going forward should be about 20,000 to 30,000 less than our previous range of 180,000 to 200,000. We are confident that at these levels, we can still maintain an increasing revenue growth trajectory and expand profitability. 
Let's move next to our business markets, starting with Global Enterprise. Global Enterprise revenue was down $32 million sequentially or less than 1% but declined $136 million or 3.4% year-over-year. In addition to a $70 million impact from lower CPE sales in the quarter, foreign currency translation had an $84 million adverse impact on growth, as the stronger dollar versus the euro and pound sterling caused a decline in the current quarter compared with a benefit a year ago. Absent these effects, we would have had positive revenue growth in spite of the continued secular and global economic challenges. 
Strategic Services, which comprises 52% of Global Enterprise revenue, totaled $2 billion, up 4.4%. While we continue to perform well in these services, international and FX are having an adverse effect on growth at this time. 
Looking ahead, we do expect our enterprise business to contribute more to the overall Wireline revenue growth and profitability, particularly as we work through our product streamlining and process efficiency initiatives. Our strategic realignment of Verizon Enterprise Solutions will better position us to unlock value in the core business while better aligning our strength in high-growth markets like cloud computing, machine-to-machine and advanced communications. We remain confident in the strength of the enterprise asset portfolio and the value it will generate over the long term.
On the acquisition front, our purchase of Hughes Telematics has passed the Hart-Scott-Rodino stage, and we expect to complete the transaction in the third quarter. We look forward to combining Hughes Telematics' robust service delivery platform and suite of applications with our global IP network, cloud, mobility and security solutions. We believe that this platform has the potential to reach beyond automotive and transportation and create new m-to-m opportunities in mobile health, asset tracking and home automation, to name a few.
Moving next to Global Wholesale. Revenues in the second quarter declined $34 million or 2% sequentially and $203 million or 10% year-over-year, due primarily to declines in transport services. We continue to take all the necessary actions to exit unprofitable routes and contracts and to better position the business in the fiber-based Ethernet data services space, as customers with Special Access transition from DS1s and DS3s. 
Let's move now to our summary slide. Overall, a strong second quarter and first half, putting us solidly on track to meet our financial objectives for the year. We continue to execute very well. Our solid top line performance in the first half of the year has been fueled by strong retail service revenues in Wireless and increasing growth in consumer Wireline. Our record-high Wireless margins in the second quarter, combined with our strong focus on improving profitability through product rationalization and cost management in the Wireline, has driven double-digit growth in consolidated operating income and earnings per share for the last 2 quarters. 
This strong operating performance, together with our disciplined capital spending, drove significant increases in free cash flow and an improving return on investment profile for the entire business. We expect to continue to build on this momentum and look forward to a strong second half of the year. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to John so we can get to your questions."

You slipped a little bit lower than that this quarter. I'm just -- can you help us think through that? You obviously talked about some price hikes. Are we also at a point where the base is large enough that 2Q seasonality and video, i.e. where it’s negative and then rebounds in 3Q, is starting to catch up with the business as well? And then second question just on the Wireless distribution. It was roughly this time last year you announced intentions for a $10 billion upstream payment to the JV partners. Can you help us think through maybe a timeline for announcing the distribution for next year? And then given the stronger free cash flow you've seen in the business, would that point sort of conceptually to a bigger distribution?"

So yes, there was -- we actually did have slower growth in this quarter than we anticipated. So a couple of factors here. One was there was a seasonable usually -- unusually high move season in the month of June compared to prior second quarter. So we experienced some additional moves out, and normally in this business, it takes us a quarter to recapture the move-in. So I think that partially was set off from a timing difference. But more importantly, I think that we have refocused more on our profit on the FiOS side. So first, we went through these price-ups. You saw some of the benefits there in the first quarter where we drove our consumer revenue growth to 2.5%. And this was the price-ups of our Set-Top Boxes, and you're going to see more price-ups coming in the third quarter around the bundles and into the fourth quarter. In addition, we launched our Quantum product and the price-ups that we have on people choosing additional speeds. I am extremely confident with both of these actions, we can double our revenue growth by the end of this year from 2.5% to around 5%, and I'm very confident in that we can accomplish that. So one is that we are really concentrating on revenue growth. Second is, as you know, we've really concentrated around copper to FiOS migrations. We nearly doubled the amount of migrations we did in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And also what we're seeing is the first quarter migrations that we accomplished, these customers are generating more ARPU post-migration than pre because they are also selecting higher speeds under our Quantum offers. So I think the range, as I -- as we said, is probably in the neighborhood of 150,000 to 170,000. I know you said 160,000 to 180,000, but it's around 150,000 to 170,000. But we are on a steady growth pattern, and I believe that we are really focusing in on better margins and acceleration of the top line. On the Verizon Wireless dividend, I know there's been a lot of press lately out there, and I'm not sure where this idea's coming from. But I can tell you right now, the only thing I will say is that there's no distribution on the agenda for the upcoming Verizon Wireless board, and that's probably all I'm going to say at this point in time."

All right, so on the Wholesale side, yes, 10% decline. This was accelerated from 8.9% in the first quarter. And to be honest, I think that we're fighting an uphill battle here on the core voice and LD product, and that will continue to decline. The focus right now is to reposition ourselves for Ethernet and fiber-to-the-cell, and those products are picking up. And I think that quite honestly, the range that you see here is probably the range that will continue is somewhere between an 8% to 10% decline going forward. But again, this is a diminishing revenue stream, and we will continue to manage that stream. On the union side of the house, as I mentioned before, when we entered into these negotiations, we knew that this was going to be extremely difficult and very hard negotiations. And it was going to be a long haul, not a short haul. And given our peers, it took them 500 days to get the contributions and some pension resets, and we're now almost a year into this or 365 days. So when you look at the profitability of this business over the last 5 years, it has decreased, and this cost structure is not sustainable going forward. We really need is a business to address this cost structure in relation to the benefits, particularly health care contributions and pensions, and we need increased flexibility around our work rules, which we -- some of these work rules date back to 1960. So we aren't asking for things that have not already been given to other companies. These are not new issues for the union. Many of our peer companies are already there, so we are standing strong on our position of cost restructure in this business. So the negotiations are continuing, albeit slow, and the process will take as long as it takes for us. So at this point, that's what I’ll report on the union negotiation."

I will tell you that at the beginning of this year, we said we would have to contribute $1.3 billion into the plan. We have $400 million left to contribute for the remaining piece of this year. But I think there's other things that have to go into consideration here other than just the timing benefit of this bill. First, you have to look at the borrowing rates. Second, you have to look at tax rate structures and what the current rate is versus what future rates may be. And then you have to look at the overall pension strategy that we have related to our pension plan. So at this point, I'm not prepared to speak to whether we will adopt the funding plan or not adopt it. What I will tell you is that it's not material to the cash flow either this year or into the next 3 years. And again, it is just a timing issue. So I'll have more to report on that as we complete our analysis and come into 2013. As far as cash flow goes, we had an unbelievable quarter in cash flow from operation generation. Our continued focus in on investment and making the right investments to return additional investment on that and get greater returns, both in the Wireline and the Wireless business. We've -- as I said, we really have curtailed the spending on our EV-DO networks, which is generating more cash flow on the Wireless business. But again, without really going into a lot of detail here, the dividend policy is extremely important. It is a board decision, but it is very, very important to Lowell and I, and we will continue to recommend to the board what we think is appropriate. And from a share buyback, as I said before, I don't think we're in a position to start buying back shares. It is always a timing issue for companies to -- when the best time to do that is. And at this point, we probably won't be in a position to do anything like that until late '13, early '14."

On July 1, we actually paid down another piece of that debt of $800 million. The cash right now is $8.4 billion, so net debt at the end of this quarter was $2.4 billion. On the Enterprise business, just to kind of set some of this up. As I said last quarter, our international revenue is about $400 million a quarter. We were growing close to 15% to 17% on a year-over-year basis, both within EMEA and in Asia. Last quarter, we said that we saw the first time that it actually went flat on a year-over-year basis, and this quarter, we actually saw a decline on a year-over-year basis. Strategic Services is about 75% of our sales in international, which is very different than it is here in the United States. So with the FX impact and the impact that Europe is having on that strategic revenue stream, that is having an overall impact on the overall strategic revenue growth. I think the important thing here is the way we move forward is that we are really building our business around platforms. And if you look at what we've done, we're rated #1 in the world on security. We have built our data center platform around our Terremark acquisition, and now we're going to build our machine-to-machine and applications platform around the Hughes Telematics. And I think that brings a different paradigm to us going forward. So I'm very optimistic on the Enterprise business. We are showing still some growth in Strategic Services. And I think if we didn't have the headwinds and some of these other economic pressures, I believe we're a double-digit strategic growth company. There should be no reason why we can't get back to those numbers that we showed in the past 2 years. So I think this is a temporary thing. But given where we are with Europe, this could be another 2 to 3 quarters out, mid '13 before we start to turn the corner here. But we are positioning ourselves, and I think we're making all the right decisions that when we need to turn the corner and get some economic relief, that we will show a very good portfolio here."

Look, we are very, very solid on improving our Wireline margin here in the second half versus the first half. I think that given some of the cost structure issues that we have, especially around the contract, we think that we can still improve our margins. If we can get to a better end here with the contract, then I think that we can actually improve our margins on a year-over-year basis. But that will come down to a timing issue. I do think, though, that when we focus in on the consumer side of the house, as I said, I'm very confident that we can double our revenue growth here. We are very focused in on the profitability of FiOS. The profitability increase in Wireline this quarter was really, really centered around the FiOS, really, progress that we made on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So I think we have a lot of good things here, and we'll just have to play this out. But very, very confident that we'll improve our Wireline margins here. On the upgrade side of the house, obviously, this is timing. A lot of things go into play here. We've made a lot of moves in the last 1.5 years around restructuring our upgrade policies. As you know, we launched our $30 upgrade fee. Obviously, these all has an impact on the level of upgrades. And then, of course, there's always that rumor mill out there with a new phone coming out in the fourth quarter, and so people may be waiting. But look, we manage this on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I think the way I look at this, though, going into the back half of this year on the upgrades is that we'll manage this business on a profit and on a growth trajectory. And if you think about what Wireless has done when we get to the fourth quarter, we will have taken $5 billion out of our cost structure in the last 3 years, which is why we can generate margins of 49%, which beat our all-time high this -- from last year. So I think that Wireless has a very good track record and history to deliver both on profitability and growth."

I mean, I think, again, I'll just repeat what I said is we'll manage this business both on a growth and profitability perspective for Wireless. And I think we've proven that. Look, I mean, obviously, the fourth quarter is always a seasonable volume quarter for the industry. And I expect that to happen again with the holiday season that's coming up. So it will really factor in on the volumes, what new devices and I'm sure we're going to have plenty of new devices that come out between now and the holiday season. And if you look at -- on the device side of the house, we just launched the Samsung GALAXY III on our 4G LTE network. And it proves the point that when we launch a very technical phone that's great in appearance and viability, that people accept that phone, and that phone is selling extremely well. So all these factors come into play, but I think that we are very, very confident that what we laid out in January of 2011, regardless of what phones come, what phones don't come and what kind of a season it will be, we will hit our financial objectives. On the FiOS side of the house, as I said, we did have some seasonality pressure here. But look, we have to balance the perspective, almost if you look at our Wireless portfolio, we have to balance the consumer Wireline portfolio in the same fashion. We have to balance growth with revenue acceleration and improving profitability. And that's what we're set out to do, and we'll make the decisions and the right ones to -- in order to achieve all 3 of those metrics."

Good morning, and welcome to our Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo.
Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.
I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website.
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on the website.
I'd also point out that the quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. Before Fran takes you through the details of our results, I'd like to cover a few items upfront.
For the quarter, we reported earnings of $0.56 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include $232 million or $0.08 per share for nonoperational charges related to patent litigation settlements with TiVo and active video. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.64 in the third quarter, up 14.3% year-over-year. Through 9 months, adjusted EPS is $1.87, an increase of 14.7% from last year. Discussion of consolidated results and growth rates in this presentation exclude the effects of nonoperational items.
As we have previously indicated, we are no longer reporting average revenue per unit or ARPU for wireless postpaid devices. Instead, we are disclosing average revenue per account or ARPA, which we believe is a more beautiful metric going forward given our new shared data pricing plans. Earlier this month, we filed a Form 8-K, which disclosed 10 quarters of historical information for the following retail postpaid metrics. The number of accounts, the average connections per account and the average revenue per account. This information can also be found in our Investor website it is now part of the wireless selected operating statistics included in our financial and operating information schedules. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Fran."

We continue to execute our plan well across the entire business. Consolidated revenue growth increased to 3.9% and our strong focus on cost management and improving profitability resulted in solid double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share for the third consecutive quarter.
The sustained operating performance, together with disciplined capital spending, is driving significant increases in free cash flow, resulting in capital efficiency gains and an improving return on investment profile for the overall Business. Through the first 9 months, we generated $13.4 billion of free cash flow, which is 50% more than last year. The Wireless business is setting global benchmarks for performance, and we are building significant momentum heading into the fourth quarter and 2013.
Service revenue growth increased to 7.5%, driven by increasing smartphone penetration and greater device adoption, stimulated by the successful and well-received introduction of our Share Everything Plans. This sustained revenue growth performance, together with our demonstrated ability to effectively manage cost and retain customers, resulted in a record-setting EBITDA service margin of 50%, even with our strongest subscriber growth in 4 years.
In Wireline, consumer revenue growth accelerated to 4.6%, a sharp increase from 2.5% in the second quarter, driven by increased FiOS revenue per customer. Enterprise and wholesale revenues continue to be impacted by secular and global economic challenges, particularly in Europe. We are confident that our focus on improving long-term profitability through product rationalization and simplification along with process streamlining, will prove to be the right decisions as we build a fundamentally stronger business. 
On September 19, we reached a tentative agreement with the CWA and IBEW for new 3-year contracts covering about 43,000 associates. We believe that this is a fair and balanced agreement that is good for our employees, as well as a real positive for the future of the Wireline business. I will talk more about a tentative agreement during the Wireline segment review. 
Overall, another strong quarter of performance, putting us solidly on track to meet our financial objectives for the year. Let's begin our review with a look at consolidated results on Slide 4.
We sustained our solid consolidated growth trends with positive contributions from all strategic areas. Consolidated revenue growth increased to 3.9%. Our operating leverage and strong focus on expense controls drove operating income up 17.9%, our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Consolidated EBITDA grew to $10 billion, and our margin expanded 40 basis points sequentially to 34.6%, its highest level in nearly 4 years.
Earnings growth also improved. As John indicated in his introductory remarks, adjusted EPS growth was more than 14% in the third quarter and is up nearly 15% year-to-date. Let's turn now to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 5. 
Our free cash flow increased to $5.6 billion in the quarter, driven by higher cash from operations and continued disciplined in our capital spending. Capital expenditures totaled $3.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of about $260 million compared to last year. Year-to-date, capital spending of $11.3 billion was down about 10%. My expectation is that capital spending for the full year will be lower than the $16.2 billion we incurred in 2011.  In addition, we expect our annual CapEx-to-revenue ratio to decline based on improved revenue trends and disciplined capital spending. 
In Wireless, CapEx in the third quarter was $2.1 billion, which was about $350 million higher than last year. Year-to-date, Wireless capital of $6.1 billion was lower by nearly 16%. CapEx savings this year are due primarily to lower capacity spending on a 3G network. We continue to build and expand the nation's largest 4G LTE network. As more customers choose 4G LTE smartphone and devices, the migration of data traffic from 3G to our lower-cost 4G LTE network will drive further improvements in operating and capital efficiency. Apparently, more than 35% of our data traffic is already on the 4G LTE network. 
In Wireline, capital spending was $1.5 billion in the quarter, down $133 million from last year. Year-to-date, Wireline capital was $4.6 billion was about 3% lower. Our previously announced spectrum transactions all closed during the third quarter, representing a net cash outlay of $3.7 billion. In return, we received about 5.9 billion megahertz POPs of high-quality AWS spectrum.
Our balance sheet and credit metrics remain very strong, total debt of $52.8 billion was down $2.4 billion from the end of last year. Net debt was $43.1 billion at the end of the quarter, and our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.1x. I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing pension liabilities and funding, starting on Slide 6.
Yesterday, after the market closed, we announced that we will be transferring approximately $7.5 billion of management retiree pension benefit obligations to Prudential by purchasing a group annuity contract. Rodentia will assume the responsibility in making monthly pension payments to approximately 41,000 management retirees. The transfer will not change the amount of the monthly pension benefits received by these retirees or their surviving beneficiaries. Pension obligations relating to active management and union-represented employees and retirees are not affected. The transaction will remove about 25% of our outstanding pension liability upon closing, which we expect to occur in December.
Turning to Slide 7, this transaction is part of an overall pension derisking strategy and reduces our exposure to funding and income statement volatility caused by change in investment returns, discount rates and longevity risk. It also allows us to transfer this liability at reasonable economics and avoid certain administrative costs, while improving the longer-term financial profile of the business. As a result of this transaction, some additional cash funding will be required in 2012 to fully fund the pension obligations being transferred to Prudential and to maintain the funded status of the pension liabilities that will remain with Verizon. In terms of timing, we already made an additional $930 million pension contribution in September. So on a year-to-date basis, we have made $1.8 billion in contributions. In the fourth quarter, we expect to make another $1.6 billion cash contribution. Our revised outlook for pension funding in 2012 is estimated to be $3.4 billion as compared to the $1.3 billion we estimated at the beginning of the year. 
While this represents more funding this year, we will have no cash funding requirements for pensions in 2013. Based on our current plan assumptions, we also expect contribution requirements in future years to be lower as a result of this transaction. Let's now move into the review of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 8.
Our Wireless business had another excellent quarter, with accelerating growth in retail postpaid connections, better-than-expected adoption and financial performance of our new Share Everything Plans and strong growth in postpaid revenue per account or ARPA. Even more impressive is the fact that we achieved a 50% EBITDA service margin, while activating more smartphones than any other quarter in our history, with the exception of the fourth quarter last year. 
Total Wireless revenues of $19 billion grew 7.3% and represents 65% of Verizon's consolidated revenue year-to-date. Retail service revenue grew 7.9% and total service revenue growth was 7.5% in both the third quarter and year-to-date. As John mentioned, we are disclosing new retail postpaid metrics, replacing ARPU with ARPA, as well as providing the number of postpaid accounts and the average connections per account. The change in reporting aligns with the strategic incentive our shared data plans, which is to encourage device adoption and stimulate usage on our Wireless networks. Since driving service revenue growth is a key to our business model, the more relevant metric going forward is the amount of revenue that we generate per account. 
During the quarter, ARPA grew to more than $145 per month, an increase of 6.5%. In only 3 months, 13% of the retail postpaid base adopted Share Everything Plan. Adoption is ahead of our expectations, and ARPA dilution has been lower, as we are seeing existing customers adding devices and increasing their data usage allowances. 
The combination of incremental revenue from new customers, smartphone upgrades, increased devices connecting to our network and higher usage will more than make up for the effects of the customers initially optimizing their counts. Device adoption and data usage will become the primary drivers of service revenue growth for years to come. Let's take a closer look at connections growth on Slide 9.
As we mentioned coming out of the second quarter, our retail postpaid net adds have continued to accelerate with our strong performance, I am very confident that we continued to gain postpaid market share in the quarter. In addition to our strong device portfolio, network reliability and 4G LTE advantage, the introduction of our Share Everything Plan proved to be yet another compelling reason for customers to choose Verizon. 
During the quarter, we added 1.8 million new retail net connections, with more than 1.5 million postpaid and 228,000 prepaid. We have an industry-leading 95.9 million retail connections with approximately 90.4 million postpaid and 5.5 million prepaid. Our 90.4 million postpaid connections represent 34.8 million accounts, with an average of 2.6 connections per account. 
Before discussing our postpaid results in more detail, let me highlight our retail prepaid performance where we had another strong quarter. Net adds of 228,000 were significantly higher than the year ago, and prepaid revenue continued to positively impact retail service revenue growth. In retail postpaid, our 1.5 million net adds represent a substantial sequential increase from 888,000 in the second quarter and the highest total we've reported in 4 years. Roughly 1/3 of these net adds were Internet devices, which include USB modems, Jetpacks and postpaid tablets. Roughly 95% of our postpaid Internet device activations this quarter were 4G LTE, which is very positive from a data usage perspective and provide additional evidence that our Share Everything Plans are stimulating device adoption. 
As you know, we are the market leader in this space, with 8 million Internet device connections in our retail postpaid base and more importantly, over half of these are 4G LTE. Our churn metrics continue to be market-leading. Retail postpaid churn of 0.91% improved by 3 basis points year-over-year and was up only 7 basis points sequentially in what is typically a seasonally higher quarter. Postpaid gross adds in the quarter were very strong at 4 million, up 27% sequentially and 20% year-over-year, also the highest gross add quarter in 4 years. The number of customers upgrading devices was slightly less than last quarter, representing 6.8% of our retail postpaid connections base. Next, let's turn to Slide 10 to take a look at smartphones and our progress at 4G LTE.
Smartphone penetration increased from just below 50% last quarter to more than 53%, a strong quarter in terms of smartphone adoption. As expected, an increasing majority of postpaid phone sales were smartphones. In the third quarter, we activated 6.8 million smartphones, representing 79% of the total phone category. 3.4 million of these smartphones were Android, of which 3 million were 4G LTE. In terms of Apple iPhones, we activated 3.1 million in the quarter, 21% of which were 4G LTE. 
Another important point is the improving mix of gross adds and upgrades within our smartphone activations. In the third quarter, the percent new to Verizon increased to 31% of total activations, a sharp improvement from the 20% to 23% range we have reported in past quarters. This higher gross add mix is recognition of our 4G LTE Network Advantage since an increasing percentage of our smartphone activations are 4G LTE. In addition, within the customer upgrades, 44% were buying a smartphone for the first time. In terms of 4G LTE coverage, we are by far the market leader. Our 4G LTE service is currently available in 419 markets covering more than 250 million POPs, roughly 80% of the U.S. population. As our TV commercial say, we have more 4G LTE coverage than all of our competitors networks combined. We will continue expanding our 4G LTE network with the goal of having a nationwide footprint similar to our 3G network next year.
Sales of 4G LTE devices have risen steadily each in every quarter since we launched service in late 2010. In the third quarter, this increase was more dramatic as 4G LTE smartphone activations increased to 3.7 million from 2.5 million in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 14.9 million 4G LTE phones and devices in our postpaid base, representing 16.5% of total retail postpaid connections. Said another way, 25% of our smartphones and 51% of our Internet devices are 4G LTE. Very impressive numbers in a relatively short period of time. However, we expect these percentages to continue to ramp as all new smartphones in our device roadmap will be 4G LTE. 
Looking ahead, we see a great deal of new product development activity in M2M, particularly in healthcare and energy. We are also collaborating on an innovative video roadmap with the cable companies as part of our technology joint venture. Let's conclude our Wireless review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 11.
We generated $8.1 billion of EBITDA in the third quarter, an increase of 12.4% and expanded our EBITDA service margin by 100 basis points sequentially to 50%. Again, we achieved this record profitability in a quarter in which we reported the highest number of gross and net adds in 4 years. Simply stated, our margin performance is a testament to our demonstrated and consistent ability to execute well on our strategy of achieving both growth and profitability. The combination of sustainable service revenue growth and intense focus on cost management and consistently excellent churn metrics are all contributing factors of our industry-leading margin performance.
In terms of managing our cost, we will continue to look at any and all opportunities within the business to drive process improvements and operating efficiencies. As I've previously indicated, we identified $2 billion in cost-saving opportunities in Wireless this year, and we have already surpassed that target.
Let's move to our Wireline segment next, starting with mass markets on Slide 12. Mass markets' revenue grew 3.8% due primarily to accelerating growth in the consumer business. Our 4.6% revenue growth was the highest we've seen in 10 years, and we are on track to achieve at least a 5% growth rate in the fourth quarter. This growth, of course, was driven by FiOS where revenue grew 18% in the third quarter and now represents about 2/3 of consumer revenue. The increasing scale of FiOS is driving growth in consumer revenue per month, which increased to nearly $104 in the quarter, up 10.3%. FiOS ARPU is now over $150 per month and about 2/3 of our FiOS consumer customers are triple play with toys, Internet and video services. 
In terms of broadband customer growth, we have 136,000 new FiOS Internet additions in the quarter and now have nearly 5.3 million subscribers, representing penetration of 37%. In DSL, we had a net loss of 144,000, which is a bit higher than the last few quarters. Again, our decision to discontinue offering 'Dry Loop' DSL had a negative impact on gross adds, but was clearly the right decision from a profitability standpoint. In spite of the lack of net subscriber growth, broadband revenues increased both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by our quantum offer and copper-to-fiber migration. 
In FiOS Video, we added about 120,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.6 million, and increasing our penetration to 33%. In terms of FiOS customer growth, we did experience some seasonality with respect to churn, due in part to an increase in customers moving and also some elasticity related to our price increases. Based on our current sales activity, we are expecting improvement in FiOS customer adds in the fourth quarter, along with our continuing revenue growth trajectory. Within mass markets, we are focused on driving revenue growth, improving operating and capital efficiency and maximizing profitability. Key actions this year included targeted price increases, new differentiated services like FiOS Quantum and our copper-to-fiber migration initiative, which is helping to reduce our dependence on copper technology. Through 9 months, we have migrated about 150,000 homes to fiber, and we are on track to exceed 200,000 by the end of the year. We have already experienced a greater than 10% improvement in our trouble report rate, which is saving on repair costs in these areas. We are also beginning to gain some traction in upselling new customers to additional FiOS services, which will result in additional monthly recurring revenue technology. We will have more to say going forward with regard to this important initiative, including how many homes will we be targeting in 2013. Suffice it to say that we are pleased with our progress to date and view the copper-to-fiber migration as an important part of our strategy to reduce the Wireline cost structure. 
Before moving on, I would also add that our residential connection trends continue to improve. During the third quarter, we lost 217,000 retail residential connections, representing a 6.3% decline year-over-year compared with a loss of 278,000 or 8% at this time last year. Let's move to our enterprise markets next on Slide 13. 
As I said my in my overview, our challenge in the enterprise market is primarily one of secular pressures and global economic conditions, which include foreign exchange movements. In addition, as we've previously noted, we are making deliberate moves to rationalize and simplify our Enterprise Solutions product portfolio, which is also putting near-term pressure on revenue comparisons. In the third quarter, Global Enterprise revenue was down $39 million sequentially and declined $140 million or 3.6% compared with a year ago. The majority of which were due to intentional actions in our part.
This includes of the deemphasis of drop shipped CPE and decommissioning end-of-life products like ATM, spring relay and IPVN. Lower CPE sales represented $139 million of the year-over-year decline. Foreign currency translation also had an unfavorable impact on revenue, as the stronger dollar versus the euro and pound Sterling caused a $40 million decline in the third quarter compared with the $37 million increase a year ago. 
We are confident that our product rationalization and streamlining initiatives will fundamentally strengthen the business and improve our operating efficiency. We are also taking actions to enhance our network, facilities and overall end-to-end service provision in order to put the business in a stronger position to benefit when the global economy picks up. These strategic and operational activities are creating some margin pressure in the near term, but will result in improved profitability in 2013.
Strategic Services, which comprised 53% of Global Enterprise revenue, totaled $2 billion, up 4.4%. While we continue to perform relatively well in these services, international and FX continue to have an adverse effect on growth. 
Domestically, we are seeing new contracts and investment decisions being delayed, as enterprise CIOs continue to be cautious with regard to uncertainties involved in the election outcome, the pending fiscal cliff, potential tax reform and other policy changes that may take place. Collectively, these uncertainties have created a wait-and-see approach that is impacting new business. We believe that a better understanding of these impacts will help companies make decisions about their capital commitments, and we are hopeful that enterprises renew their investing activities in 2013. 
During this period, Verizon Enterprise Solutions continues to strengthen its competitive position in higher growth markets like computing, machine-to-machine and advanced communications. In late July, we completed the acquisition of Hughes Telematics, which will expand and accelerate our capabilities in advanced automatics, Telematics and many other machine-to-machine services. 
Moving next to Global Wholesale, revenues in the third quarter declined $45 million sequentially and $181 million or 9.2% year-over-year due primarily to continued declines in transport services. We are taking the necessary actions to exit unprofitable routes and contracts, and to better position the business in the fiber-based Ethernet data services space as customers with special access transition from BS1s and DS3s. Let's move on to Slide 14 next to summarize Wireline.
From a top line perspective, the overall picture was mixed, with some very encouraging signs in the consumer market, while we continue to manage through secular and cyclical challenges at enterprise and wholesale. Our product rationalization initiatives, while putting some near-term pressure on revenue, will ultimately serve to strengthen the business. At the beginning of the year, we were optimistic that EBITDA margin in the second half of 2012, which show improvement compared to the first half. As I have stated at a few Investor Conferences in September, we no longer seeing this being the case, due primarily to growth challenges of the enterprise side and the length of time it took to reach an agreement with our unions. 
In addition, some of the activities to reduce our reliance on older technologies and systems, along with the many process, reengineering efforts we have going, have created margin pressure in the near term. Collectively, all these initiatives are designed to improve the Wireline cost structure. We fully expect that these and other cost management actions will result in improved profitability in 2013 and over the longer term. 
To that end, for the past 15 months, we have talked about the importance of concluding our union contract negotiations and coming up with a contract that is fair and balanced for our employees but at the same time, addresses some key issues related to our ability to achieve improvements in our cost structure. Let's talk a bit more about the contract on Slide 15.
On September 19, we reached a tentative agreement with the CWA and IBEW for new 3-year contracts covering about 43,000 associates. The contracts are currently in the ratification process, which typically takes 30 days. So we hope to be able to announce a definitive agreement very soon. Under the tentative agreement, there are changes to medical and prescription drug plans for active and retired associates, including contributions toward healthcare premiums for active employees. In addition, current retirees will make contributions toward healthcare premiums for some medical plans, while associates who retire after January 1, 2013, will make premium contributions regardless of the medical plan, which they enroll in. 
New associates hired from this point forward will be eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan instead of a traditional pension plan. The agreement also makes changes to old legacy policies, including tighter absence controls and better quality control and training practices. There are new provisions that will result in better work role flexibility such as national cost-sharing, which will improve the customer experience and allow our associates to work more efficiently and cost-effectively. Since the contract has not yet been ratified, I am not going to quantify the annual cost savings at this time. We will have an opportunity to communicate this information at an Investor Conference in early November, so stay tuned for more information on this subject.
Let's move now to our summary slide. Overall, a very good third quarter, keeping us solidly on track to meet our financial objectives for the year. We are executing our plans and investing for the future. Consolidated revenue growth is increasing, and we have had 4 successive quarters of EBITDA margin expansion with the third quarter being the highest margin since 2008. We have built strong earnings momentum with 3 successive quarters of double-digit growth and have generated 50% more free cash flow than last year at this time. Our disciplined capital spending and revenue growth is driving improved capital efficiency. 
In Wireless, we further solidified our excellent spectrum position by closing all our pending transactions. And with our 4G LTE Network Advantage, our unmatched product portfolio and our well-received Share Everything Plans, we feel confident about our ability to sustain our industry-leading profitability in 2013 and beyond. 
In Wireline, although we have work to do, we are putting the right plans in place to strengthen the business and improve profitability in 2013 and over the longer term. Our strategic investments and actions position us very well for sustainable growth. We continue to build for the future, and while we may have some near-term challenges, we are successfully executing a well conceived plan that will drive profitability and create shareholder value in 2013 and into the future.
With that, I will now turn the call back to John so we can address your questions."

And then on the pension side, I think that from a P&L perspective, it's very hard for me to distinguish at this point in time. There are so many in fluctuations here. But I think the key to this whole thing, a couple points I want to make here. So from just an overall cash perspective, which is the real key here because this is really the cash impact of the business. As you know we made a first half contributions of $600 million in the third quarter. We added another $1.2 billion to the plan, so $1.8 billion from a cash impact perspective to date. And then the fourth quarter, we determined that we'll put another $1.6 billion into the plan. All these contributions are tax-deductible. We will not have any 2013 contributions. And that base on our planning and the assumptions that we have in this transaction, the future cash contributions to the pension plan will be less post this transaction close, which we anticipate today, early December. So from that perspective, that to me is the important part. I think everything else is pretty minimal at this point in time."

So the iPhone 5 came out in very late September. There really wasn't all that much volume on the iPhone 5. If you look at our total iPhone adds, we added 3.1 million, 1.1 million than we did a year ago. And about 651,000 of them were iPhone 5, the rest were 4 and 4s. And what we're seeing here is we're seeing that the iPhone 5, we had supply constraints. We're not sure we're going to stand in the fourth quarter with those constraints. But what we are seeing on the 4 and 4s is that we're attracting customers who probably previously did not come to Verizon because of the cost point of that iPhone. So I think you saw that in our net add gross for the quarter. So again, from a trending perspective and all the work that we've done around cost and the $2 billion and if you look at the 3 years, we've taken out $5 billion of cost structure for Wireless. Again, I think that given the volume, there could be some dilution in that margin if the volumes exceed what they were in the third quarter, which I anticipate they will. If you recall back to the first quarter, I said we would accelerate our growth throughout quarters for the year as we come out of the third quarter. You saw, we posted our highest growth in the last 4 years. And I think that we will accelerate that growth into the fourth quarter. So yes, I think we will have some deterioration in the margins in the fourth quarter for Wireless. But at this point, I can't tell you what that will be because I don't know what the volume will be. But obviously, I don't anticipate it to be as much as it was a year ago. And then on the Wireline side, I think this story is a much more complex story but in the short just for the union piece of this, I think we'll wait until the fourth quarter but you're not going to see any benefit this year. But I don't want to really get into the details until this contract is ratified. A number of unions have ratified it, but it will not be ratified by all until the next couple of days are over. So once that happens, I will give some clarity around this during the fourth quarter and into the first quarter."

A lot of complexity to the bidding process here from the individual respective parties. So there's a lot of work to be done here and we're not ready to talk about exactly where we are with these. I think the important point though is we're going to analyze each and every bid. We are also developing our own internal plans to launch this spectrum because as I said before, this is not a fire sale on spectrum. So if we do not get fair value or what we believe to be fair value, then we will use this spectrum internally. But at this point, I think it's too early to communicate exactly how this will proceed. But I think it will happen late in the fourth quarter, possibly not until the first quarter. And if we do come to terms with some of these, then it has to go through the normal SEC approval. We probably close on that probably late third quarter, fourth quarter of 2013. As far as Vodafone dividend, this is a very interesting question because I think we all forget that on January of 2012, we actually did do a dividend, that's $10 billion, and throughout the year during our normal course, we did about another $4.5 billion of tax distribution. So year-to-date, we've done $14.5 billion of dividend distribution out of Wireless. To talk about a further dividend, I think is premature. We have an agreement with Vodafone that we will discuss this before the end of the year. And once we have that discussion then will report out what the decision will be."

We're doing a lot of effort in reconnecting existing homes that already have an LTE on the side of the house or people have moved, so you're going to see a lot more activity around that.

So from a copper shutdown perspective, I think it's highly unlikely that you'll ever see a Verizon have no copper in their network because of the vastness of this matter. But I think strategically, the way we have approached this from a copper-to-fiber migration is all copper is not created equal. We have areas where the copper has really deteriorated because it's 60 years plus. And we are strategically going after what we call chronic troubles. And that is a truck roll that happens in a period of 6 months time. And that costs us about $900 in cash from a perspective of that. So when you look at the overall investment that we have to make to migrate that customer from copper to FiOS, it's more cost-effective to go after those chronic problems first. But not all of the network that leads into one switch is having these chronic problems. So to think about decommissioning every switch in our network will be at huge cost undertaking. So we believe that the strategy we've outplayed with our copper-to-fiber migration is financially viable. It's better for the customer. we see that from the customers who have migrated in the short term. They're actually buying up into the FiOS Quantum and generating $10, plus more ARPU. So we're strategically going after this. We have also received a lot of regulatory relief already in the states that we deal with from being carrier last resort, replacing in Pennsylvania, fulfilling our obligation of bringing broadband to customers via PA30 ruling, which would be with Wireless instead of Wireline, which is a much more financial beneficial to Verizon. So we have already explored a lot of this regulatory highway, and we will continue with our copper-to-fiber migration under the plan that we are executing."

But I would say that's in combination with a lot of other things that we're doing, but this positions us for the future. I would say though that beyond this, from a pressure standpoint on Wireline, obviously, the third quarter to us is always a seasonal pressure point from a weather condition, a construction issue, fiber cuts and so forth. So that's not unusual for the third quarter to be a bigger margin pressure for us. But the delay of the union contract had an impact on our margins. The huge results, obviously, if you go back and look at on a standalone basis, they contribute to dilution in the Wireline segment because that is now included in the Wireline. As we said, we're in the process of retooling the enterprise, which is putting a little bit of pressure in the expense category with system consolidation and product rationalization. And then we've also deliberately have gone out during the third quarter and we'll probably do a little bit of this in the fourth quarter and accelerated some of the repairs and maintenance within our facilities. We are also doing some additional work in our networks to increase our diversity and reliability within the Wireline network. So there's a lot of things that's putting a little bit of pressure on Wireline.

First, as I said in the few of the Investor Conferences, I anticipated and we suspected some consolidation. And I think what the market should walk away with here is that there are 2 very large companies willing to invest in the U.S. Wireless market. I believe this is a sign that this is very good for the industry, and I think this showed the strength of the U.S. market and the growth potential that still available within this market. I think what this means from us is a couple of things. First, if you go back to January 2011, the biggest point that Lowell and I made was we are all about executing on our plan. We have invested and built and remained on our brand to be the best and most reliable network. We have pioneered, launched and now are the largest 4G LTE network with more coverage than all of our competitors combined. I think if you look at our spectrum holding, we have a superior spectrum holding and quality of spectrum with our 700 megahertz continues across the United States, which we've launched our 4G LTE network on. And with the closing of our AWS spectrum with the cable company. So I think we're in a very strong position from a spectrum holding perspective. If you look at our capital, and in the past we have taken a little heat from the market for the amount of capital that we have spent on our networks. But if you look at on average, we spend about $10 billion per year investing in our Wireless and our Wireline IP backbone support for that Wireless network. And I think at the end of the day, I think you would all agree that execution equal result here. I think the third quarter results speak for themselves. So we will continue to execute and we will continue to lead the industry."

That we are seeing our customers move from their old legacy plans. We're seeing customers who are on unlimited plants, move to Share Everything Plan. Now you would think that's these initial customers are optimizing from that. But what we're seeing in the they are attaching more devices. That includes more smartphones and especially with the price points now on some of the lower end iPhones that we have. We're seeing more attachment rates there. We are seeing a lot of attachment on Internet Wi-Fi devices. And I think what we're seeing is they're attaching the my fight device at a $20 price point rather than each individually attaching the tablet. So I think we're seeing very good success in my FIE attachment rates. And from a tablets, we're seeing some of that, but probably not as much as we had expected. But the modify attachment is running extremely higher than we expected. So I think overall, again, what we're seeing in Share Everything is better than what we had expected in our business case."

Good morning, and welcome to our Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo.
Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.
I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which are also available on our website.
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website.
I'd also point out that the quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.
Before Fran takes you through the details of our results, I'd like to cover a few items upfront.
For the quarter, we reported earnings of $0.56 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include $232 million or $0.08 per share for nonoperational charges related to patent litigation settlements with TiVo and ActiveVideo. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.64 in the third quarter, up 14.3% year-over-year. Through 9 months, adjusted EPS is $1.87, an increase of 14.7% from last year. Discussion of consolidated results and growth rates in this presentation exclude the effects of nonoperational items.
As we have previously indicated, we are no longer reporting average revenue per unit or ARPU for wireless postpaid devices. Instead, we are disclosing average revenue per account or ARPA, which we believe is a more beautiful metric going forward given our new shared data pricing plans.
Earlier this month, we filed a Form 8-K which disclosed 10 quarters of historical information for the following retail postpaid metrics: the number of accounts, the average connections per account and the average revenue per account. This information can also be found on our investor website and is now part of the wireless selected operating statistics included in our financial and operating information schedules.
With that, I will turn the call over to Fran."

We continue to execute our plan well across the entire business. Consolidated revenue growth increased to 3.9%, and our strong focus on cost management and improving profitability resulted in solid double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share for the third consecutive quarter. This sustained operating performance, together with disciplined capital spending, is driving significant increases in free cash flow, resulting in capital efficiency gains and an improving return on investment profile for the overall Business. Through the first 9 months, we generated $13.4 billion of free cash flow, which is 50% more than last year. The Wireless business is setting global benchmarks for performance and we are building significant momentum heading into the fourth quarter and 2013.
Service revenue growth increased to 7.5%, driven by increasing smartphone penetration and greater device adoption stimulated by the successful and well-received introduction of our Share Everything Plans. This sustained revenue growth performance, together with our demonstrated ability to effectively manage costs and retain customers, resulted in a record-setting EBITDA service margin of 50% even with our strongest subscriber growth in 4 years.
In Wireline, consumer revenue growth accelerated to 4.6%, a sharp increase from 2.5% in the second quarter, driven by increased FiOS revenue per customer. Enterprise and wholesale revenues continue to be impacted by secular and global economic challenges particularly in Europe. We are confident that our focus on improving long-term profitability through product rationalization and simplification, along with process streamlining, will prove to be the right decisions as we build a fundamentally stronger business.
On September 19, we reached a tentative agreement with the CWA and IBEW for new 3-year contracts covering about 43,000 associates. We believe that this is a fair and balanced agreement that is good for our employees, as well as a real positive for the future of the Wireline business. I will talk more about the tentative agreement during the Wireline segment review.
Overall, another strong quarter of performance, putting us solidly on track to meet our financial objectives for the year.
Let's begin our review with a look at consolidated results on Slide 4.
We sustained our solid consolidated growth trends with positive contributions from all strategic areas. Consolidated revenue growth increased to 3.9%. Our operating leverage and strong focus on expense controls drove operating income up 17.9%, our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Consolidated EBITDA grew to $10 billion. And our margin expanded 40 basis points sequentially to 34.6%, its highest level in nearly 4 years.
Earnings growth also improved. As John indicated in his introductory remarks, adjusted EPS growth was more than 14% in the third quarter and is up nearly 15% year-to-date. Let's turn now to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 5.
Our free cash flow increased to $5.6 billion in the quarter, driven by higher cash from operations and continued discipline in our capital spending. Capital expenditures totaled $3.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of about $260 million compared to last year. Year-to-date, capital spending of $11.3 billion was down about 10%. My expectation is that capital spending for the full year will be lower than the $16.2 billion we incurred in 2011.  In addition, we expect our annual CapEx-to-revenue ratio to decline based on improved revenue trends and disciplined capital spending.
In Wireless, CapEx in the third quarter was $2.1 billion which was about $350 million higher than last year. Year-to-date, Wireless capital of $6.1 billion was lower by nearly 16%. CapEx savings this year are due primarily to lower capacity spending on the 3G network.
We continue to build and expand the nation's largest 4G LTE network. As more customers choose 4G LTE smartphones and devices, the migration of data traffic from 3G to our lower-cost 4G LTE network will drive further improvements in operating and capital efficiency. Apparently, more than 35% of our data traffic is already on the 4G LTE network.
In Wireline, capital spending was $1.5 billion in the quarter, down $133 million from last year. Year-to-date, Wireline capital of $4.6 billion was about 3% lower. Our previously announced spectrum transactions all closed during the third quarter, representing a net cash outlay of $3.7 billion. In return, we received about 5.9 billion megahertz POPs of high-quality AWS spectrum.
Our balance sheet and credit metrics remain very strong. Total debt of $52.8 billion was down $2.4 billion from the end of the last year. Net debt was $43.1 billion at the end of the quarter, and our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.1x.
I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing pension liabilities and funding, starting on Slide 6.
Yesterday, after the market closed, we announced that we will be transferring approximately $7.5 billion of management retiree pension benefit obligations to Prudential by purchasing a group annuity contract. Prudential will assume the responsibility in making monthly pension payments to approximately 41,000 management retirees. The transfer will not change the amount of the monthly pension benefit received by these retirees or their surviving beneficiaries. Pension obligations relating to active management and union-represented employees and retirees are not affected. The transaction will remove about 25% of our outstanding pension liabilities upon closing, which we expect to occur in December.
Turning to Slide 7. This transaction is part of an overall pension derisking strategy and reduces our exposure to funding and income statement volatility caused by change in investment returns, discount rates and longevity risk. It also allows us to transfer this liability at reasonable economics and avoid certain administrative costs while improving the longer-term financial profile of the business.
As a result of this transaction, some additional cash funding will be required in 2012 to fully fund the pension obligations being transferred to Prudential and to maintain the funded status of the pension liabilities that will remain with Verizon. In terms of timing, we already made an additional $930 million pension contribution in September, so on a year-to-date basis, we have made $1.8 billion in contributions. In the fourth quarter, we expect to make another $1.6 billion cash contribution. Our revised outlook for pension funding in 2012 is estimated to be $3.4 billion, as compared to the $1.3 billion we estimated at the beginning of the year. While this represents more funding this year, we will have no cash funding requirements for pensions in 2013. Based on our current plan assumptions, we also expect contribution requirements in future years to be lower as a result of this transaction.
Let's now move into the review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 8.
Our Wireless business had another excellent quarter, with accelerating growth in retail postpaid connections, better-than-expected adoption and financial performance of our new Share Everything Plans and strong growth in postpaid revenue per account or ARPA. Even more impressive is the fact that we achieved a 50% EBITDA service margin while activating more smartphones than any other quarter in our history, with the exception of the fourth quarter last year.
Total Wireless revenues of $19 billion grew 7.3% and represents 65% of Verizon's consolidated revenue year-to-date. Retail service revenue grew 7.9% and total service revenue growth was 7.5% in both the third quarter and year-to-date. As John mentioned, we are disclosing new retail postpaid metrics, replacing ARPU with ARPA, as well as providing the number of postpaid accounts and the average connections per account. The change in reporting aligns with the strategic intent of our shared data plans, which is to encourage device adoption and stimulate usage on our wireless network. Since driving service revenue growth is the key to our business model, the more relevant metric going forward is the amount of revenue that we generate per account.
During the quarter, ARPA grew to more than $145 per month, an increase of 6.5%. In only 3 months, 13% of the retail postpaid base adopted Share Everything Plans. Adoption is ahead of our expectations and ARPA dilution has been lower as we are seeing existing customers adding devices and increasing their data usage allowances.
The combination of incremental revenue from new customers, smartphone upgrades, increased devices connecting to our network and higher usage will more than make up for the effects of the customers initially optimizing their accounts. Device adoption and data usage will become the primary drivers of service revenue growth for years to come. Let's take a closer look at connections growth on Slide 9.
As we mentioned coming out of the second quarter, our retail postpaid net adds have continued to accelerate. With our strong performance, I am very confident that we continued to gain postpaid market share in the quarter. In addition to our strong device portfolio, network reliability and 4G LTE advantage, the introduction of our Share Everything Plans proved to be yet another compelling reason for customers to choose Verizon.
During the quarter, we added 1.8 million new retail net connections, with more than 1.5 million postpaid and 228,000 prepaid. We have an industry-leading 95.9 million retail connections, with approximately 90.4 million postpaid and 5.5 million prepaid. Our 90.4 million postpaid connections represent 34.8 million accounts with an average of 2.6 connections per account.
Before discussing our postpaid results in more detail, let me highlight our retail prepaid performance where we had another strong quarter. Net adds of 228,000 were significantly higher than a year ago and prepaid revenue continued to positively impact retail service revenue growth. In retail postpaid, our 1.5 million net adds represent a substantial sequential increase from 888,000 in the second quarter and the highest total we've reported in 4 years. Roughly 1/3 of these net adds were Internet devices, which include USB modems, jetpacks and postpaid tablets. Roughly 95% of our postpaid Internet device activations this quarter were 4G LTE, which is very positive from a data usage perspective and provides additional evidence that our Share Everything Plans are stimulating device adoption. As you know, we are the market leader in this space, with 8 million Internet device connections in our retail postpaid base, and more importantly, over half of these are 4G LTE.
Our churn metrics continue to be market leading. Retail postpaid churn of 0.91% improved by 3 basis points year-over-year and was up only 7 basis points sequentially in what is typically a seasonally higher quarter. Postpaid gross adds in the quarter were very strong at 4 million, up 27% sequentially and 20% year-over-year, also the highest gross add quarter in 4 years. The number of customers upgrading devices was slightly less than last quarter, representing 6.8% of our retail postpaid connections base.
Next, let's turn to Slide 10 and take a look at smartphones and our progress in 4G LTE.
Smartphone penetration increased from just below 50% last quarter to more than 53%, a strong quarter in terms of smartphone adoption. As expected, an increasing majority of postpaid phone sales were smartphones. In the third quarter, we activated 6.8 million smartphones, representing 79% of the total phone category. 3.4 million of these smartphones were Android of which 3 million were 4G LTE. In terms of Apple iPhones, we activated 3.1 million in the quarter, 21% of which were 4G LTE.
Another important point is the improving mix of gross adds and upgrades within our smartphone activations. In the third quarter, the percent new to Verizon increased to 31% of total activations, a sharp improvement from the 20% to 23% range we have reported in past quarters. This higher gross add mix is recognition of our 4G LTE network advantage since an increasing percentage of our smartphone activations are 4G LTE. In addition, within the customer upgrades, 44% were buying a smartphone for the first time.
In terms of 4G LTE coverage, we are by far the market leader. Our 4G LTE service is currently available in 419 markets covering more than 250 million POPs, roughly 80% of the U.S. population. As our TV commercial say, we have more 4G LTE coverage than all of our competitors' networks combined. We will continue expanding our 4G LTE network, with the goal of having a nationwide footprint similar to our 3G network next year.
Sales of 4G LTE devices have risen steadily each and every quarter since we launched service in late 2010. In the third quarter, this increase was more dramatic as 4G LTE smartphone activations increased to 3.7 million from 2.5 million in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 14.9 million 4G LTE phones and devices in our postpaid base, representing 16.5% of total retail postpaid connections. Said another way, 25% of our smartphones and 51% of our Internet devices are 4G LTE, very impressive numbers in a relatively short period of time. However, we expect these percentages to continue to ramp as all new smartphones in our device roadmap will be 4G LTE.
Looking ahead, we see a great deal of new product development activity in M2M, particularly in healthcare and energy. We are also collaborating on an innovative video roadmap with the cable companies as part of our technology joint venture.
Let's conclude our Wireless review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 11.
We generated $8.1 billion of EBITDA in the third quarter, an increase of 12.4%, and expanded our EBITDA service margin by 100 basis points sequentially to 50%. Again, we achieved this record profitability in a quarter in which we reported the highest number of gross and net adds in 4 years. Simply stated, our margin performance is a testament to our demonstrated and consistent ability to execute well on our strategy of achieving both growth and profitability. The combination of sustainable service revenue growth and intense focus on cost management and consistently excellent churn metrics are all contributing factors to our industry-leading margin performance.
In terms of managing our cost, we will continue to look at any and all opportunities within the business to drive process improvements and operating efficiencies. As I've previously indicated, we identified $2 billion in cost-saving opportunities in Wireless this year, and we have already surpassed that target.
Let's move to our Wireline segment next, starting with Mass Markets on Slide 12. Mass Markets revenue grew 3.8% due primarily to accelerating growth in the consumer business. Our 4.6% revenue growth was the highest we've seen in 10 years, and we are on track to achieve at least a 5% growth rate in the fourth quarter. This growth, of course, was driven by FiOS where revenue grew 18% in the third quarter and now represents about 2/3 of consumer revenue. The increasing scale of FiOS is driving growth in consumer revenue per month which increased to nearly $104 in the quarter, up 10.3%. FiOS ARPU is now over $150 per month, and about 2/3 of our FiOS consumer customers are triple-play with voice, Internet and video services.
In terms of broadband customer growth, we had 136,000 new FiOS Internet additions in the quarter and now have nearly 5.3 million subscribers, representing penetration of 37%. In DSL, we had a net loss of 144,000, which is a bit higher than the last few quarters. Again, our decision to discontinue offering dry-loop DSL had a negative impact on gross adds but was clearly the right decision from a profitability standpoint. In spite of the lack of net subscriber growth, broadband revenues increased both sequentially and year-over-year driven by our Quantum offer and copper-to-fiber migration.
In FiOS Video, we added about 120,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.6 million and increasing our penetration to 33%. In terms of FiOS customer growth, we did experience some seasonality with respect to churn due in part to an increase in customers moving and also some elasticity related to our price increases. Based on our current sales activity, we are expecting improvement in FiOS customer adds in the fourth quarter, along with our continuing revenue growth trajectory.
Within Mass Markets, we are focused on driving revenue growth, improving operating and capital efficiency and maximizing profitability. Key actions this year included targeted price increases, new differentiated services like FiOS Quantum and our copper-to-fiber migration initiative which is helping to reduce our dependence on copper technology. Through 9 months, we have migrated about 150,000 homes to fiber, and we are on track to exceed 200,000 by the end of the year. We have already experienced a greater-than-10% improvement in our trouble report rate, which is saving on repair costs in these areas. We are also beginning to gain some traction in upselling new customers through additional FiOS services, which will result in additional monthly recurring revenue. We will have more to say, going forward, with regard to this important initiative, including how many homes will we be targeting in 2013. Suffice it to say that we are pleased with our progress to date and view the copper-to-fiber migration as an important part of our strategy to reduce the Wireline cost structure.
Before moving on, I would also add that our residential connection trends continue to improve. During the third quarter, we lost 217,000 retail residential connections, representing a 6.3% decline year-over-year, compared with a loss of 278,000 or 8% at this time last year.
Let's move to our enterprise markets next on Slide 13. As I said my in my overview, our challenge in the enterprise markets is primarily one of secular pressures and global economic conditions which include foreign exchange movements. In addition, as we've previously noted, we are making deliberate moves to rationalize and simplify our enterprise solutions product portfolio, which is also putting near-term pressure on revenue comparisons.
In the third quarter, Global Enterprise revenue was down $39 million sequentially and declined $140 million or 3.6% compared with a year ago, the majority of which were due to intentional actions on our part. This includes the deemphasis of drop-ship CPE and decommissioning end-of-life products like ATM, frame relay and IP VPN. Lower CPE sales represented $139 million of the year-over-year decline.
Foreign currency translation also had an unfavorable impact on revenue as the stronger dollar versus the euro and pound Sterling caused a $40 million decline in the third quarter compared with the $37 million increase a year ago.
We are confident that our product rationalization and streamlining initiatives will fundamentally strengthen the business and improve our operating efficiency. We are also taking actions to enhance our network, facilities and overall end-to-end service provisioning in order to put the business in a stronger position to benefit when the global economy picks up. These strategic and operational activities are creating some margin pressure in the near term but will result in improved profitability in 2013.
Strategic services, which comprised 53% of Global Enterprise revenue, totaled $2 billion, up 4.4%. While we continue to perform relatively well in these services, international and FX continue to have an adverse effect on growth.
Domestically, we are seeing new contracts and investment decisions being delayed as enterprise CIOs continue to be cautious with regard to uncertainties involved in the election outcome, the pending fiscal cliff, potential tax reform and other policy changes that may take place. Collectively, these uncertainties have created a wait-and-see approach that is impacting new business. We believe that a better understanding of these impacts will help companies make decisions about their capital commitments and we are hopeful that enterprises renew their investing activities in 2013.
During this period, Verizon Enterprise Solutions continues to strengthen its competitive position in higher-growth markets like computing, machine-to-machine and advanced communications. In late July, we completed the acquisition of Hughes Telematics, which will expand and accelerate our capabilities in advanced automotive, fleet telematics and many other machine-to-machine services.
Moving next to Global Wholesale. Revenues in the third quarter declined $45 million sequentially and $181 million or 9.2% year-over-year due primarily to continued declines in transport services. We are taking the necessary actions to exit unprofitable routes and contracts and to better position the business in the fiber-based Ethernet data services space as customers with special access transition from DS1s and DS3s.
Let's move on to Slide 14 next to summarize Wireline. From a top line perspective, the overall picture is mixed, with some very encouraging signs in the consumer market while we continue to manage through secular and cyclical challenges in enterprise and wholesale. Our product rationalization initiatives, while putting some near-term pressure on revenue, will ultimately serve to strengthen the business. At the beginning of the year, we were optimistic that EBITDA margin in the second half of 2012 would show improvement compared to the first half. As I have stated at a few investor conferences in September, we're no longer seeing this being the case due primarily to growth challenges on the enterprise side and the length of time it took to reach an agreement with our unions.
In addition, some of the activities to reduce our reliance on older technologies and systems, along with the many processed reengineering efforts we have going, have created margin pressure in the near term. Collectively, all these initiatives are designed to improve the Wireline cost structure. We fully expect that these and other cost management actions will result in improved profitability in 2013 and over the longer term.
To that end, for the past 15 months, we have talked about the importance of concluding our union contract negotiations and coming up with a contract that is fair and balanced for our employees but, at the same time, addresses some key issues related to our ability to achieve improvements in our cost structure. Let's talk a bit more about the contract on Slide 15.
On September 19, we reached a tentative agreement with the CWA and IBEW for new 3-year contracts covering about 43,000 associates. The contracts are currently in the ratification process, which typically takes 30 days, so we hope to be able to announce a definitive agreement very soon. Under the tentative agreement, there are changes to medical and prescription drug plans for active and retired associates, including contributions toward healthcare premiums for active employees. In addition, current retirees will make contributions toward healthcare premiums for some medical plans, while associates who retire after January 1, 2013, will make premium contributions regardless of the medical plan which they enroll in.
New associates hired from this point forward will be eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan instead of a traditional pension plan. The agreement also makes changes to old legacy policies, including tighter absence controls and better quality control and training practices. There are new provisions that will result in better work rule flexibility such as national cost-sharing, which will improve the customer experience and allow our associates to work more efficiently and cost-effectively. Since the contract has not yet been ratified, I am not going to quantify the annual cost savings at this time. We will have an opportunity to communicate this information at an investor conference in early November, so stay tuned for more information on this subject.
Let's move now to our summary slide. Overall, a very good third quarter, keeping us solidly on track to meet our financial objectives for the year. We are executing our plans and investing for the future.
Consolidated revenue growth is increasing and we have had 4 successive quarters of EBITDA margin expansion, with the third quarter being the highest margin since 2008. We have built strong earnings momentum with 3 successive quarters of double-digit growth and have generated 50% more free cash flow than last year at this time. Our disciplined capital spending and revenue growth is driving improved capital efficiency.
In Wireless, we further solidified our excellent spectrum position by closing all our pending transactions. And with our 4G LTE network advantage, our unmatched product portfolio and our well-received Share Everything Plans, we feel confident about our ability to sustain our industry-leading profitability in 2013 and beyond.
In Wireline, although we have work to do, we are putting the right plans in place to strengthen the business and improve profitability in 2013 and over the longer term. Our strategic investments and actions position us very well for sustainable growth. We continue to build for the future. And while we may have some near-term challenges, we are successfully executing a well-conceived plan that will drive profitability and create shareholder value in 2013 and into the future.
With that, I will now turn the call back to John so we can address your questions."

And then on the pension side, I think that, from a P&L perspective, it's very hard for me to distinguish at this point in time. There are so many fluctuations here. But I think the key to this whole thing, a couple points I want to make here. So from a -- just an overall cash perspective, which is the real -- the key here because this is really the cash impact of the business: As you know we made a first half contribution of $600 million. In the third quarter, we added another $1.2 billion to the plan, so $1.8 billion from a cash impact perspective to date. And in the fourth quarter, we determined that we'll put another $1.6 billion into the plan. All these contributions are tax deductible. We will not have any 2013 contributions and that, based on our planning and the assumptions that we have in this transaction, the future cash contributions to the pension plan will be less post this transaction close which we anticipate to be early December. So from that perspective, that to me is the important part. I think everything else is pretty minimal at this point in time."

So the iPhone 5 came out in very late September. There really wasn't all that much volume on the iPhone 5. If you look at our total iPhone adds, we added 3.1 million, 1.1 million than we did a year ago. And about 651,000 of them were iPhone 5s, the rest were 4 and 4s. And what we're seeing here is we're seeing that, the iPhone 5, we had supply constraints. We're not sure where we're going to stand in the fourth quarter with those constraints. But what we are seeing on the 4 and 4s is that we're attracting customers who probably previously did not come to Verizon because of the cost point of that iPhone. So I think you saw that in our net add gross for the quarter. So again, in -- from a trending perspective and all the work that we've done around cost and the $2 billion, and if you look at the 3 years, we've taken out $5 billion of cost structure of Wireless. Again, I think that, given the volume, there could be some dilution in that margin if the volumes exceed what they were in the third quarter, which I anticipate they will. If you recall back to the first quarter, I said we would accelerate our growth throughout the quarters for the year. As we come out of the third quarter, you saw we posted our highest growth in the last 4 years, and I think that we will accelerate that growth into the fourth quarter. So yes, I think we will have some deterioration in the margins in the fourth quarter for Wireless, but at this point I can't tell you what that will be because I don't know what the volume will be. But obviously, I don't anticipate it to be as much as it was a year ago. And then on the Wireline side, I think this story is a much more complex story, but in the short -- just for the union piece of this, I think we'll wait till the fourth quarter, but you're not going to see any benefit this year. But I don't want to really get into the details until this contract is ratified. A number of unions have ratified it, but it will not be ratified by all until the next couple of days are over. So once that happens, I will give some more clarity around this during the fourth quarter and into the first quarter."

We have a lot of interested parties, a lot of complexity to the bidding process here from the individual respective parties. So there's a lot of work to be done here and we're not ready to talk about exactly where we are with these. I think the important point, though, is we're going to analyze each and every bid. We are also developing our own internal plans to launch this spectrum because, as I said before, this is not a fire sale on spectrum, so if we do not get fair value or what we believe to be fair value, then we'll only [ph] use this spectrum internally. But at this point, I think it's too early to communicate exactly how this will proceed, but I think it will happen late in the fourth quarter, possibly not till the first quarter. And if we do come to terms with some of these, then it has to go through the normal FCC approval. We probably wouldn't close on that probably till late third quarter, fourth quarter of 2013. As far as Vodafone dividend, this is a very interesting question because I think we all forget that, on January of 2012, we actually did do a dividend, that's $10 billion. And throughout the year during our normal course, we did about another $4.5 billion of tax distributions. So year-to-date, we've done $14.5 billion of dividend distributions out of Wireless. To talk about a further dividend, I think, is premature. We have an agreement with Vodafone that we will discuss this at the -- before the end of the year.

So from a copper shutdown perspective, I think it's highly unlikely that you'll ever see a Verizon have no copper in their network because of the vastness of this network. But I think, strategically, the way we have approached this from a copper-to-fiber migration is all in the -- all copper is not created equal. We have areas where the copper has really deteriorated because it's 60 years plus. And we are strategically going after what we call chronic troubles, and that is a truck roll that happens in a period of 6 months time and that costs us about $900 in cash from a perspective of that. So when you look at the overall investment that we have to make to migrate that customer from copper to FiOS, it's more cost-effective to go after those chronic problems first. But not all of the network that leads into one switch is having these chronic problems, so to think about decommissioning every switch in our network would be a huge cost undertaking. So we believe that the strategy we've outlaid with our copper-to-fiber migration is financially viable. It's better for the customer. We see that, from the customers who have -- we have migrated in the short term, they're actually buying up into the FiOS Quantum and generating $10-plus more ARPU. So we're strategically going after this. We have also received a lot of regulatory relief already in the states that we deal with from being the carrier of last resort, replacing in Pennsylvania, fulfilling our obligation of bringing broadband to customers via a PA 30 ruling, which would be with Wireless instead of Wireline which is a -- much more financial beneficial to Verizon. So we have already explored a lot of this regulatory highway and we will continue with our copper-to-fiber migration under the plan that we are executing."

We have been dealing with a -- what we call a number of chartered customers, which includes many content providers and movie houses in helping us to customize this package and get this thing to market. We anticipate that we'll come to market in 2013. I won't be specific on that date at this point in time. But we believe we have a very viable product to come to marketplace that will significantly change the way content is, if you will, packaged and picked and shipped. So we will have more to say on that within 2013, but I think that will start to contribute to some of the Wireline top growth and help to improve the margin overall. And then, I'm sorry, I -- you mentioned Redbox. We are very close to launching here in the fourth quarter with Redbox. VDMS plays a very critical role in the content delivery with that joint venture with Redbox. And again, I think, moving into 2013, the business case that we have with us with Redbox will improve our top line and contribute to the profitability of the overall Wireline segment."

I think what you'll is what you saw in the third quarter, that we continue to very closely manage the CapEx on the Wireline side of the business. Meanwhile, Wireless will continue with their plan to build out the 4G LTE by midyear next year to compare to our 3G footprint. I don't see a substantial change in the CapEx trajectory here. But obviously, this does depend on growth, and we hang our hat on being the best network, most reliable network in the industry and we're not going to lose that position. So Wireless has been A-plus in this area and I don't believe that will change, but I don't think there's a significant change in the capital trajectory here."

And there's obviously some lengths to that and the longer-term benefits, I think, are pretty clear. But just give a sense, if you can, as to maybe the magnitude of margin pressure as you do that migration process over the next year or so. And then secondly, in the Wireless side, we've had this sort of honeymoon with the change in policy with respect to upgrade window that, I think, should be coming to a close right about now. So as we look into the fourth quarter and get this pool of people that are now upgrade eligible that have not been for the last 6 months, how should we be thinking about upgrade percentages as we go through maybe both 4Q as well as 1Q?"

So migration and Wireline pressure, I guess there's a couple of things here. And it's not just the migration. But obviously, doing some of this work does increase some CapEx to us and does increase some of the operating expense to us, but I would say that's in combination with a lot of other things that we're doing. But this positions us for the future. I would say though that, beyond this, from a pressure standpoint on Wireline, obviously, the third quarter to us is always a seasonal pressure point from a weather condition, a construction issue, fiber cuts and so forth, so that's not unusual for the third quarter to be a bigger margin pressure for us. But the delay of the union contract had an impact on our margins. The huge results, obviously, if you go back and look at Hughes on a standalone basis, they contribute to dilution in the Wireline segment because that is now included in the Wireline. As we said, we're in the process of retooling the enterprise, which is putting a little bit of pressure in the expense category with system consolidation and product rationalization. And then we've also deliberately have gone out during the third quarter, and we'll probably do a little bit of this in the fourth quarter, and accelerated some of the repairs and maintenance within our facilities. We are also doing some additional work in our networks to increase our diversity and reliability within the wireline network. So there's a lot of things that's putting a little bit of pressure on Wireline, but again, I think we're taking this opportunity during the lull of the economic condition, preparing for this economic turn that hopefully will come in 2013. And I think we'll be in a better position to ride that wave when it comes. So I think it's a combination of all that. And then on the Wireless side, with the upgrade window, I guess the way I would put it this way is our upgrade percentage will be more in the fourth quarter than it was in the third quarter, but I will tell you I think it will be less than the fourth quarter of the year ago."

First, as I said in a few of the investor conferences, I anticipated and we expected some consolidation. And I think what the market should walk away with here is that there are 2 very large companies willing to invest in the U.S. wireless market. I believe this is a sign that this is very good for the industry and I think this shows the strength of the U.S. market and the growth potential that's still available within this market. I think what this means from us is a couple of things. First, if you go back to January 2011, the biggest point that Lowell and I made was we are all about executing on our plan. We have invested and built and remained on our brand to be the best and most reliable network. We have pioneered, launched and now are the largest 4G LTE network with more coverage than all of our competitors combined. I think, if you look at our spectrum holding, we have a superior spectrum holding and quality of spectrum with our 700-megahertz contiguous across the United States, which we've launched our 4G LTE network on, and with the closing of our AWS spectrum with the cable companies. So I think we're in a very strong position from a spectrum holding perspective. If you look at our capital -- and in the past, we've taken a little heat from the market for the amount of capital that we have spent on our networks. But if you look at -- on average, we spend about $10 billion per year investing in our wireless and our wireline IP backbone support for that wireless network. And I think -- at the end of the day, I think you would all agree that execution equal results here. I think the third quarter results speak for themselves. So we will continue to execute and we will continue to lead the industry."

So on the accounts, we're not going to split the accounts here between business and consumer, so we'll just leave as we'll give the accounts, we'll give the devices per account and the ARPA on that. As far as the Shared Everything Plans, I think the best answer is we're seeing a little bit of everything, that we are seeing our customers move from their old legacy plans, we're seeing customers who were on unlimited plants move to Share Everything Plan. Now you would think that these initial customers that moved are optimizing from that, but what we're seeing is that they are attaching more devices. That includes more smartphones. And especially with the price points now on some of the lower-end iPhones that we have, we're seeing more attachment rates there. We are seeing a lot of attachment on Internet WiFi devices. And I think what we're seeing is they're attaching the MiFi device at a $20 price point rather than each individually attaching a tablet. So I think we're seeing very good success in MiFi attachment rates. And from the tablets, we're seeing some of that but probably not as much as we had expected, but the MiFi attachment is running extremely higher than we expected. So I think, overall, again, what we're seeing in Shared Everything is better than what we had expected in our business case."

Good morning, and welcome to our Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo.
Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. 
This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.
I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website.
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website.
I'd also point out that the quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.
Before Fran takes you through the details of our results, I'd like to cover a few items up front.
For the quarter, we reported earnings of $0.56 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include $232 million or $0.08 per share for nonoperational charges related to patent litigation settlements with TiVo and ActiveVideo. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.64 in the third quarter, up 14.3% year-over-year. Through 9 months, adjusted EPS is $1.87, an increase of 14.7% from last year. Discussion of consolidated results and growth rates in this presentation exclude the effects of nonoperational items.
As we have previously indicated, we are no longer reporting average revenue per unit or ARPU for wireless postpaid devices. Instead, we are disclosing average revenue per account or ARPA, which we believe is a more meaningful metric going forward given our new shared data pricing plans.
Earlier this month, we filed a Form 8-K which disclosed 10 quarters of historical information for the following retail postpaid metrics: the number of accounts, the average connections per account and the average revenue per account. This information can also be found on our investor website and is now part of the wireless selected operating statistics included in our financial and operating information schedules.
With that, I will turn the call over to Fran."

We continue to execute our plan well across the entire business. Consolidated revenue growth increased to 3.9%, and our strong focus on cost management and improving profitability resulted in solid double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share for the third consecutive quarter. This sustained operating performance together with disciplined capital spending is driving significant increases in free cash flow, resulting in capital efficiency gains and an improving return on investment profile for the overall business. Through the first 9 months, we generated $13.4 billion of free cash flow, which is 50% more than last year. The Wireless business is setting global benchmarks for performance, and we are building significant momentum heading into the fourth quarter and 2013.
Service revenue growth increased to 7.5%, driven by increasing smartphone penetration and greater device adoption, stimulated by the successful and well-received introduction of our Share Everything Plans. This sustained revenue growth performance together with our demonstrated ability to effectively manage costs and retain customers resulted in a record-setting EBITDA service margin of 50% even with our strongest subscriber growth in 4 years.
In Wireline, consumer revenue growth accelerated to 4.6%, a sharp increase from 2.5% in the second quarter, driven by increased FiOS revenue per customer. Enterprise and wholesale revenues continue to be impacted by secular and global economic challenges, particularly in Europe. We are confident that our focus on improving long-term profitability through product rationalization and simplification along with process streamlining will prove to be the right decisions as we build a fundamentally stronger business.
On September 19, we reached a tentative agreement with the CWA and IBEW for new 3-year contracts covering about 43,000 associates. We believe that this is a fair and balanced agreement that is good for our employees as well as a real positive for the future of the Wireline business. I will talk more about the tentative agreement during the Wireline segment review.
Overall, another strong quarter of performance, putting us solidly on track to meet our financial objectives for the year.
Let's begin our review with a look at consolidated results on Slide 4.
We sustained our solid consolidated growth trends with positive contributions from all strategic areas. Consolidated revenue growth increased to 3.9%. Our operating leverage and strong focus on expense controls drove operating income up 17.9%, our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Consolidated EBITDA grew to $10 billion. And our margin expanded 40 basis points sequentially to 34.6%, its highest level in nearly 4 years.
Earnings growth also improved. As John indicated in his introductory remarks, adjusted EPS growth was more than 14% in the third quarter and is up nearly 15% year-to-date. 
Let's turn now to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 5.  Our free cash flow increased to $5.6 billion in the quarter, driven by higher cash from operations and continued discipline in our capital spending. Capital expenditures totaled $3.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of about $260 million compared to last year. Year-to-date, capital spending of $11.3 billion was down about 10%. My expectation is that capital spending for the full year will be lower than the $16.2 billion we incurred in 2011.  In addition, we expect our annual CapEx-to-revenue ratio to decline based on improved revenue trends and disciplined capital spending.
In Wireless, CapEx in the third quarter was $2.1 billion, which was about $350 million higher than last year. Year-to-date, Wireless capital of $6.1 billion was lower by nearly 16%. CapEx savings this year are due primarily to lower capacity spending on the 3G network.
We continue to build and expand the nation's largest 4G LTE network. As more customers choose 4G LTE smartphones and devices, the migration of data traffic from 3G to our lower-cost 4G LTE network will drive further improvements in operating and capital efficiency. Apparently, more than 35% of our data traffic is already on the 4G LTE network.
In Wireline, capital spending was $1.5 billion in the quarter, down $133 million from last year. Year-to-date, Wireline capital of $4.6 billion was about 3% lower. Our previously announced spectrum transactions all closed during the third quarter, representing a net cash outlay of $3.7 billion. In return, we received about 5.9 billion megahertz POPs of high-quality AWS spectrum.
Our balance sheet and credit metrics remain very strong. Total debt of $52.8 billion was down $2.4 billion from the end of the last year. Net debt was $43.1 billion at the end of the quarter, and our ""net debt to adjusted EBITDA"" ratio was about 1.1x.
I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing pension liabilities and funding, starting on Slide 6.
Yesterday, after the market closed, we announced that we will be transferring approximately $7.5 billion of management retiree pension benefit obligations to Prudential by purchasing a group annuity contract. Prudential will assume the responsibility in making monthly pension payments to approximately 41,000 management retirees. The transfer will not change the amount of the monthly pension benefit received by these retirees or their surviving beneficiaries. Pension obligations relating to active management and union-represented employees and retirees are not affected. The transaction will remove about 25% of our outstanding pension liabilities upon closing, which we expect to occur in December.
Turning to Slide 7. This transaction is part of an overall pension derisking strategy and reduces our exposure to funding and income statement volatility caused by change in investment returns, discount rates and longevity risk. It also allows us to transfer this liability at reasonable economics and avoid certain administrative costs while improving the longer-term financial profile of the business.
As a result of this transaction, some additional cash funding will be required in 2012 to fully fund the pension obligations being transferred to Prudential and to maintain the funded status of the pension liabilities that will remain with Verizon. In terms of timing, we already made an additional $930 million pension contribution in September, so on a year-to-date basis, we have made $1.8 billion in contributions. In the fourth quarter, we expect to make another $1.6 billion cash contribution. Our revised outlook for pension funding in 2012 is estimated to be $3.4 billion as compared to the $1.3 billion we estimated at the beginning of the year. While this represents more funding this year, we will have no cash funding requirements for pensions in 2013. Based on our current plan assumptions, we also expect contribution requirements in future years to be lower as a result of this transaction.
Let's now move into the review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 8.
Our Wireless business had another excellent quarter, with accelerating growth in retail postpaid connections, better-than-expected adoption and financial performance of our new Share Everything Plans and strong growth in postpaid revenue per account or ARPA. Even more impressive is the fact that we achieved a 50% EBITDA service margin while activating more smartphones than any other quarter in our history, with the exception of the fourth quarter last year.
Total Wireless revenues of $19 billion grew 7.3% and represent 65% of Verizon's consolidated revenue year-to-date. Retail service revenue grew 7.9%, and total service revenue growth was 7.5% in both the third quarter and year-to-date. As John mentioned, we are disclosing new retail postpaid metrics, replacing ARPU with ARPA as well as providing the number of postpaid accounts and the average connections per account. The change in reporting aligns with the strategic intent of our shared data plans, which is to encourage device adoption and stimulate usage on our wireless network. Since driving service revenue growth is the key to our business model, the more relevant metric going forward is the amount of revenue that we generate per account.
During the quarter, ARPA grew to more than $145 per month, an increase of 6.5%. In only 3 months, 13% of the retail postpaid base adopted Share Everything Plans. Adoption is ahead of our expectations and ARPA dilution has been lower as we are seeing existing customers adding devices and increasing their data usage allowances.
The combination of incremental revenue from new customers, smartphone upgrades, increased devices connecting to our network and higher usage will more than make up for the effects of the customers initially optimizing their accounts. Device adoption and data usage will become the primary drivers of service revenue growth for years to come. Let's take a closer look at connections growth on Slide 9.
As we mentioned coming out of the second quarter, our retail postpaid net adds have continued to accelerate. With our strong performance, I am very confident that we continued to gain postpaid market share in the quarter. In addition to our strong device portfolio, network reliability and 4G LTE advantage, the introduction of our Share Everything Plans proved to be yet another compelling reason for customers to choose Verizon.
During the quarter, we added 1.8 million new retail net connections, with more than 1.5 million postpaid and 228,000 prepaid. We have an industry-leading 95.9 million retail connections, with approximately 90.4 million postpaid and 5.5 million prepaid. Our 90.4 million postpaid connections represent 34.8 million accounts with an average of 2.6 connections per account.
Before discussing our postpaid results in more detail, let me highlight our retail prepaid performance, where we had another strong quarter. Net adds of 228,000 were significantly higher than a year ago, and prepaid revenue continued to positively impact retail service revenue growth. In retail postpaid, our 1.5 million net adds represent a substantial sequential increase from 888,000 in the second quarter and the highest total we've reported in 4 years. Roughly 1/3 of these net adds were Internet devices, which include USB modems, Jetpacks and postpaid tablets. Roughly 95% of our postpaid Internet device activations this quarter were 4G LTE, which is very positive from a data usage perspective and provides additional evidence that our Share Everything Plans are stimulating device adoption. As you know, we are the market leader in this space, with 8 million Internet device connections in our retail postpaid base, and more importantly, over half of these are 4G LTE.
Our churn metrics continue to be market-leading. Retail postpaid churn of 0.91% improved by 3 basis points year-over-year and was up only 7 basis points sequentially in what is typically a seasonally higher quarter. Postpaid gross adds in the quarter were very strong at 4 million, up 27% sequentially and 20% year-over-year, also the highest gross add quarter in 4 years. The number of customers upgrading devices was slightly less than last quarter, representing 6.8% of our retail postpaid connections base.
Next, let's turn to Slide 10 and take a look at smartphones and our progress in 4G LTE.
Smartphone penetration increased from just below 50% last quarter to more than 53%, a strong quarter in terms of smartphone adoption. As expected, an increasing majority of postpaid phone sales were smartphones. In the third quarter, we activated 6.8 million smartphones, representing 79% of the total phone category. 3.4 million of these smartphones were Android, of which 3 million were 4G LTE. In terms of Apple iPhones, we activated 3.1 million in the quarter, 21% of which were 4G LTE.
Another important point is the improving mix of gross adds and upgrades within our smartphone activations. In the third quarter, the percent new to Verizon increased to 31% of total activations, a sharp improvement from the 20% to 23% range we have reported in past quarters. This higher gross add mix is recognition of our 4G LTE network advantage since an increasing percentage of our smartphone activations are 4G LTE. In addition, within the customer upgrades, 44% were buying a smartphone for the first time.
In terms of 4G LTE coverage, we are by far the market leader. Our 4G LTE service is currently available in 419 markets covering more than 250 million POPs, roughly 80% of the U.S. population. As our TV commercials say, we have more 4G LTE coverage than all of our competitors' networks combined. We will continue expanding our 4G LTE network with the goal of having a nationwide footprint similar to our 3G network next year.
Sales of 4G LTE devices have risen steadily each and every quarter since we launched service in late 2010. In the third quarter, this increase was more dramatic as 4G LTE smartphone activations increased to 3.7 million from 2.5 million in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 14.9 million 4G LTE phones and devices in our postpaid base, representing 16.5% of total retail postpaid connections. Said another way, 25% of our smartphones and 51% of our Internet devices are 4G LTE, very impressive numbers in a relatively short period of time. However, we expect these percentages to continue to ramp as all new smartphones in our device roadmap will be 4G LTE.
Looking ahead, we see a great deal of new product development activity in M2M, particularly in healthcare and energy. We are also collaborating on an innovative video roadmap with the cable companies as part of our technology joint venture.
Let's conclude our Wireless review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 11.
We generated $8.1 billion of EBITDA in the third quarter, an increase of 12.4%, and expanded our EBITDA service margin by 100 basis points sequentially to 50%. Again, we achieved this record profitability in a quarter in which we reported the highest number of gross and net adds in 4 years. Simply stated, our margin performance is a testament to our demonstrated and consistent ability to execute well on our strategy of achieving both growth and profitability. The combination of sustainable service revenue growth and intense focus on cost management and consistently excellent churn metrics are all contributing factors to our industry-leading margin performance.
In terms of managing our cost, we will continue to look at any and all opportunities within the business to drive process improvements and operating efficiencies. As I've previously indicated, we identified $2 billion in cost-saving opportunities in Wireless this year, and we have already surpassed that target.
Let's move to our Wireline segment next, starting with Mass Markets on Slide 12. Mass Markets revenue grew 3.8%, due primarily to accelerating growth in the consumer business. Our 4.6% revenue growth was the highest we've seen in 10 years, and we are on track to achieve at least a 5% growth rate in the fourth quarter. This growth, of course, was driven by FiOS, where revenue grew 18% in the third quarter and now represents about 2/3 of consumer revenue. The increasing scale of FiOS is driving growth in consumer revenue per month, which increased to nearly $104 in the quarter, up 10.3%. FiOS ARPU is now over $150 per month, and about 2/3 of our FiOS consumer customers are triple-play with voice, Internet and video services.
In terms of broadband customer growth, we had 136,000 new FiOS Internet additions in the quarter and now have nearly 5.3 million subscribers, representing penetration of 37%. In DSL, we had a net loss of 144,000, which is a bit higher than the last few quarters. Again, our decision to discontinue offering dry-loop DSL had a negative impact on gross adds but was clearly the right decision from a profitability standpoint. In spite of the lack of net subscriber growth, broadband revenues increased both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by our Quantum offer and copper-to-fiber migration.
In FiOS Video, we added about 120,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.6 million and increasing our penetration to 33%. In terms of FiOS customer growth, we did experience some seasonality with respect to churn, due in part to an increase in customers moving and also some elasticity related to our price increases. Based on our current sales activity, we are expecting improvement in FiOS customer adds in the fourth quarter along with our continuing revenue growth trajectory.
Within Mass Markets, we are focused on driving revenue growth, improving operating and capital efficiency and maximizing profitability. Key actions this year included targeted price increases, new differentiated services like FiOS Quantum and our copper-to-fiber migration initiative, which is helping to reduce our dependence on copper technology. Through 9 months, we have migrated about 150,000 homes to fiber, and we are on track to exceed 200,000 by the end of the year. We have already experienced a greater-than-10% improvement in our trouble report rate, which is saving on repair costs in these areas. We are also beginning to gain some traction in upselling new customers through additional FiOS services, which will result in additional monthly recurring revenue. We will have more to say going forward with regard to this important initiative, including how many homes will we be targeting in 2013. Suffice it to say that we are pleased with our progress to date and view the copper-to-fiber migration as an important part of our strategy to reduce the Wireline cost structure.
Before moving on, I would also add that our residential connection trends continue to improve. During the third quarter, we lost 217,000 retail residential connections, representing a 6.3% decline year-over-year, compared with a loss of 278,000 or 8% at this time last year.
Let's move to our enterprise markets next on Slide 13. As I said my in my overview, our challenge in the enterprise markets is primarily one of secular pressures and global economic conditions, which include foreign exchange movements. In addition, as we've previously noted, we are making deliberate moves to rationalize and simplify our enterprise solutions product portfolio, which is also putting near-term pressure on revenue comparisons.
In the third quarter, Global Enterprise revenue was down $39 million sequentially and declined $140 million or 3.6% compared with a year ago, the majority of which were due to intentional actions on our part. This includes the deemphasis of drop-ship CPE and decommissioning end-of-life products like ATM, frame relay and IP VPN. Lower CPE sales represented $139 million of the year-over-year decline.
Foreign currency translation also had an unfavorable impact on revenue as the stronger dollar versus the euro and pound Sterling caused a $40 million decline in the third quarter compared with a $37 million increase a year ago.
We are confident that our product rationalization and streamlining initiatives will fundamentally strengthen the business and improve our operating efficiency. We are also taking actions to enhance our network, facilities and overall end-to-end service provisioning in order to put the business in a stronger position to benefit when the global economy picks up. These strategic and operational activities are creating some margin pressure in the near term but will result in improved profitability in 2013.
Strategic services, which comprised 53% of Global Enterprise revenue, totaled $2 billion, up 4.4%. While we continue to perform relatively well in these services, international and FX continue to have an adverse effect on growth.
Domestically, we are seeing new contracts and investment decisions being delayed as enterprise CIOs continue to be cautious with regard to uncertainties involving the election outcome, the pending fiscal cliff, potential tax reform and other policy changes that may take place. Collectively, these uncertainties have created a wait-and-see approach that is impacting new business. We believe that a better understanding of these impacts will help companies make decisions about their capital commitments, and we are hopeful that enterprises renew their investing activities in 2013.
During this period, Verizon Enterprise Solutions continues to strengthen its competitive position in higher-growth markets like cloud computing, machine-to-machine and advanced communications. In late July, we completed the acquisition of Hughes Telematics, which will expand and accelerate our capabilities in advanced automotive, fleet telematics and many other machine-to-machine services.
Moving next to Global Wholesale. Revenues in the third quarter declined $45 million sequentially and $181 million or 9.2% year-over-year, due primarily to continued declines in transport services. We are taking the necessary actions to exit unprofitable routes and contracts and to better position the business in the fiber-based Ethernet data services space as customers with special access transition from DS1s and DS3s.
Let's move on to Slide 14 next to summarize Wireline. From a top line perspective, the overall picture is mixed, with some very encouraging signs in the consumer market while we continue to manage through secular and cyclical challenges in enterprise and wholesale. Our product rationalization initiatives, while putting some near-term pressure on revenue, will ultimately serve to strengthen the business. At the beginning of the year, we were optimistic that EBITDA margin in the second half of 2012 would show improvement compared to the first half. As I have stated at a few investor conferences in September, we're no longer seeing this being the case, due primarily to growth challenges on the enterprise side and the length of time it took to reach an agreement with our unions.
In addition, some of the activities to reduce our reliance on older technologies and systems along with the many processed reengineering efforts we have going have created margin pressure in the near term. Collectively, all these initiatives are designed to improve the Wireline cost structure. We fully expect that these and other cost management actions will result in improved profitability in 2013 and over the longer term.
To that end, for the past 15 months, we have talked about the importance of concluding our union contract negotiations and coming up with a contract that is fair and balanced for our employees but at the same time addresses some key issues related to our ability to achieve improvements in our cost structure. Let's talk a bit more about the contract on Slide 15.
On September 19, we reached a tentative agreement with the CWA and IBEW for new 3-year contracts covering about 43,000 associates. The contracts are currently in the ratification process, which typically takes 30 days, so we hope to be able to announce a definitive agreement very soon. Under the tentative agreement, there are changes to medical and prescription drug plans for active and retired associates, including contributions toward healthcare premiums for active employees. In addition, current retirees will make contributions toward healthcare premiums for some medical plans, while associates who retire after January 1, 2013 will make premium contributions regardless of the medical plan which they enroll in.  New associates hired from this point forward will be eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan instead of a traditional pension plan. The agreement also makes changes to old legacy policies, including tighter absence controls and better quality control and training practices. There are new provisions that will result in better work rule flexibility, such as national call-sharing, which will improve the customer experience and allow our associates to work more efficiently and cost-effectively. Since the contract has not yet been ratified, I am not going to quantify the annual cost savings at this time.  We will have an opportunity to communicate this information at an investor conference in early November, so stay tuned for more information on this subject.
Let's move now to our summary slide. Overall, a very good third quarter, keeping us solidly on track to meet our financial objectives for the year. We are executing our plans and investing for the future.
Consolidated revenue growth is increasing, and we have had 4 successive quarters of EBITDA margin expansion, with the third quarter being the highest margin since 2008. We have built strong earnings momentum with 3 successive quarters of double-digit growth and have generated 50% more free cash flow than last year at this time. Our disciplined capital spending and revenue growth is driving improved capital efficiency.
In Wireless, we further solidified our excellent spectrum position by closing all our pending transactions. And with our 4G LTE network advantage, our unmatched product portfolio and our well-received Share Everything Plans, we feel confident about our ability to sustain our industry-leading profitability in 2013 and beyond.
In Wireline, although we have work to do, we are putting the right plans in place to strengthen the business and improve profitability in 2013 and over the longer term. Our strategic investments and actions position us very well for sustainable growth. We continue to build for the future. And while we may have some near-term challenges, we are successfully executing a well-conceived plan that will drive profitability and create shareholder value in 2013 and into the future.
With that, I will now turn the call back to John so we can address your questions."

But I think the key to this whole thing, a couple points I want to make here. So from a -- just an overall cash perspective, which is the real -- the key here, because this is really the cash impact of the business: As you know, we made a first half contribution of $600 million. In the third quarter, we added another $1.2 billion to the plan, so $1.8 billion from a cash impact perspective to date. And in the fourth quarter, we determined that we'll put another $1.6 billion into the plan. All these contributions are tax-deductible. We will not have any 2013 contributions and that, based on our planning and the assumptions that we have in this transaction, the future cash contributions to the pension plan will be less post this transaction close, which we anticipate to be early December. So from that perspective, that, to me, is the important part. I think everything else is pretty minimal at this point in time."

And what we're seeing here is we're seeing that, the iPhone 5, we had supply constraints. We're not sure where we're going to stand in the fourth quarter with those constraints. But what we are seeing on the 4 and 4S is that we're attracting customers who probably previously did not come to Verizon because of the cost point of that iPhone. So I think you saw that in our net add gross for the quarter. So again, in -- from a trending perspective and all the work that we've done around cost and the $2 billion, and if you look at the 3 years, we've taken out $5 billion of cost structure of Wireless. Again, I think that, given the volume, there could be some dilution in that margin if the volumes exceed what they were in the third quarter, which I anticipate they will. If you recall back to the first quarter, I said we would accelerate our growth throughout the quarters for the year. As we come out of the third quarter, you saw we posted our highest growth in the last 4 years, and I think that we will accelerate that growth into the fourth quarter. So yes, I think we will have some deterioration in the margins in the fourth quarter for Wireless, but at this point I can't tell you what that will be because I don't know what the volume will be. But obviously, I don't anticipate it to be as much as it was a year ago. And then on the Wireline side, I think this story is a much more complex story, but in the short -- just for the union piece of this, I think we'll wait till the fourth quarter, but you're not going to see any benefit this year. But I don't want to really get into the details until this contract is ratified. A number of unions have ratified it, but it will not be ratified by all until the next couple of days are over. So once that happens, I will give some more clarity around this during the fourth quarter and into the first quarter."

So on the 700 megahertz, we started this process late in the third quarter. The process is ongoing. We have a lot of interested parties, a lot of complexity to the bidding process here from the individual respective parties. So there's a lot of work to be done here, and we're not ready to talk about exactly where we are with these. I think the important point, though, is we're going to analyze each and every bid. We are also developing our own internal plans to launch this spectrum, because as I said before, this is not a fire sale on spectrum, so if we do not get fair value or what we believe to be fair value, then we'll use this spectrum internally. But at this point, I think it's too early to communicate exactly how this will proceed, but I think it will happen late in the fourth quarter, possibly not till the first quarter. And if we do come to terms with some of these, then it has to go through the normal FCC approval. We probably wouldn't close on that probably till late third quarter, fourth quarter of 2013. As far as Vodafone dividend, this is a very interesting question, because I think we all forget that on January of 2012, we actually did do a dividend at $10 billion. And throughout the year during our normal course, we did about another $4.5 billion of tax distributions. So year-to-date, we've done $14.5 billion of dividend distributions out of Wireless. To talk about a further dividend, I think, is premature. We have an agreement with Vodafone that we will discuss this at the -- before the end of the year. And once we have that discussion, then we'll report out what the decision will be."

We're doing a lot of effort in reconnecting existing homes that already have an ONT on the side of the house for people who have moved in, so you're going to see a lot more activity around that.

So from a copper shutdown perspective, I think it's highly unlikely that you'll ever see a Verizon have no copper in their network because of the vastness of this network. But I think, strategically, the way we have approached this from a copper-to-fiber migration is all in the -- all copper is not created equal. We have areas where the copper has really deteriorated, because it's 60 years-plus. And we are strategically going after what we call chronic troubles, and that is a truck roll that happens in a period of 6 months' time, and that costs us about $900 in cash from a perspective of that. So when you look at the overall investment that we have to make to migrate that customer from copper to FiOS, it's more cost-effective to go after those chronic problems first. But not all of the network that leads into one switch is having these chronic problems, so to think about decommissioning every switch in our network would be a huge cost undertaking. So we believe that the strategy we've outlaid with our copper-to-fiber migration is financially viable. It's better for the customer. We see that, from the customers who have -- we have migrated in the short term, they're actually buying up into the FiOS Quantum and generating $10-plus more ARPU. So we're strategically going after this. We have also received a lot of regulatory relief already in the states that we deal with from being the carrier of last resort, replacing in Pennsylvania, fulfilling our obligation of bringing broadband to customers via a PA30 ruling, which would be with Wireless instead of Wireline, which is a much more financial beneficial to Verizon. So we have already explored a lot of this regulatory highway, and we will continue with our copper-to-fiber migration under the plan that we are executing."

Meanwhile, Wireless will continue with their plan to build out the 4G LTE by midyear next year to compare to our 3G footprint. I don't see a substantial change in the CapEx trajectory here.

But obviously, doing some of this work does increase some CapEx to us and does increase some of the operating expense to us, but I would say that's in combination with a lot of other things that we're doing. But this positions us for the future. I would say, though, that, beyond this, from a pressure standpoint on Wireline, obviously, the third quarter to us is always a seasonal pressure point from a weather condition, a construction issue, fiber cuts and so forth, so that's not unusual for the third quarter to be a bigger margin pressure for us. But the delay of the union contract had an impact on our margins. The huge results, obviously, if you go back and look at Hughes on a standalone basis, they contribute to dilution in the Wireline segment, because that is now included in the Wireline. As we said, we're in the process of retooling the enterprise, which is putting a little bit of pressure in the expense category with system consolidation and product rationalization. And then we've also deliberately have gone out during the third quarter, and we'll probably do a little bit of this in the fourth quarter, and accelerated some of the repairs and maintenance within our facilities. We are also doing some additional work in our networks to increase our diversity and reliability within the Wireline network. So there's a lot of things that's putting a little bit of pressure on the Wireline, but again, I think we're taking this opportunity during the lull of the economic condition preparing for this economic turn that hopefully will come in 2013. And I think we'll be in a better position to ride that wave when it comes. So I think it's a combination of all that. And then on the Wireless side, with the upgrade window, I guess the way I would put it this way is our upgrade percentage will be more in the fourth quarter than it was in the third quarter, but I will tell you I think it will be less than the fourth quarter of a year ago."

First, as I said in a few of the investor conferences, I anticipated and we suspected some consolidation.

I believe this is a sign that this is very good for the industry, and I think this shows the strength of the U.S. market and the growth potential that's still available within this market. I think what this means from us is a couple of things. First, if you go back to January 2011, the biggest point that Lowell and I made was we are all about executing on our plan. We have invested and built and remained on our brand to be the best and most reliable network. We have pioneered, launched and now are the largest 4G LTE network, with more coverage than all of our competitors combined. I think if you look at our spectrum holding, we have a superior spectrum holding and quality of spectrum with our 700-megahertz contiguous across the United States, which we've launched our 4G LTE network on, and with the closing of our AWS spectrum with the cable companies. So I think we're in a very strong position from a spectrum holding perspective. If you look at our capital -- and in the past, we've taken a little heat from the market for the amount of capital that we have spent on our networks. But if you look at -- on average, we spend about $10 billion per year investing in our wireless and our Wireline IP backbone support for that wireless network. And I think -- at the end of the day, I think you would all agree that execution equal results here. I think the third quarter results speak for themselves. So we will continue to execute, and we will continue to lead the industry."

And then just sticking with Shared Everything, it sounds like the initial benefit you got out of the gate was that households are trying to attach Internet devices like tablets and other in MiFis.

So on the accounts, we're not going to split the accounts here between business and consumer.  So we'll just leave it as we'll give the accounts, we'll give the devices per account and the ARPA on that. As far as the Shared Everything Plans, I think the best answer is we're seeing a little bit of everything, that we are seeing our customers move from their old legacy plans, we're seeing customers who were on unlimited plans move to Share Everything Plan. Now you would think that these initial customers that moved are optimizing from that, but what we're seeing is that they are attaching more devices. That includes more smartphones. And especially with the price points now on some of the lower-end iPhones that we have, we're seeing more attachment rates there. We are seeing a lot of attachment on Internet WiFi devices. And I think what we're seeing is they're attaching the MiFi device at a $20 price point rather than each individually attaching a tablet. So I think we're seeing very good success in MiFi attachment rates. And from the tablets, we're seeing some of that but probably not as much as we had expected, but the MiFi attachment is running extremely higher than we expected. So I think, overall, again, what we're seeing in Shared Everything is better than what we had expected in our business case."

Good morning, and welcome to our Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo.
Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.
I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which are also available on our website.
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website. I'd also point out that the quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. Before Fran takes you through the details of our results, I'd like to cover a few items up front.
For the quarter, we reported earnings of $0.56 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include $232 million or $0.08 per share for nonoperational charges related to patent litigation settlements with TiVo and ActiveVideo. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.64 in the third quarter, up 14.3% year-over-year. Through 9 months, adjusted EPS is $1.87, an increase of 14.7% from last year. Discussion of consolidated results and growth rates in this presentation exclude the effects of nonoperational items.
As we have previously indicated, we are no longer reporting average revenue per unit or ARPU for wireless postpaid devices. Instead, we are disclosing average revenue per account or ARPA, which we believe is a more meaningful metric going forward given our new shared data pricing plans.
Earlier this month, we filed a Form 8-K which disclosed 10 quarters of historical information for the following retail postpaid metrics: the number of accounts, the average connections per account and the average revenue per account. This information can also be found on our investor website and is now part of the wireless selected operating statistics included in our financial and operating information schedules.
With that, I will turn the call over to Fran."

We continue to execute our plan well across the entire business. Consolidated revenue growth increased to 3.9%, and our strong focus on cost management and improving profitability resulted in solid double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share for the third consecutive quarter. This sustained operating performance, together with disciplined capital spending, is driving significant increases in free cash flow, resulting in capital efficiency gains and an improving return on investment profile for the overall business. Through the first 9 months, we generated $13.4 billion of free cash flow, which is 50% more than last year. The Wireless business is setting global benchmarks for performance, and we are building significant momentum heading into the fourth quarter and 2013.
Service revenue growth increased to 7.5%, driven by increasing smartphone penetration and greater device adoption, stimulated by the successful and well-received introduction of our Share Everything Plans. This sustained revenue growth performance together with our demonstrated ability to effectively manage costs and retain customers resulted in a record-setting EBITDA service margin of 50% even with our strongest subscriber growth in 4 years.
In Wireline, consumer revenue growth accelerated to 4.6%, a sharp increase from 2.5% in the second quarter, driven by increased FiOS revenue per customer. Enterprise and wholesale revenues continue to be impacted by secular and global economic challenges particularly in Europe. We are confident that our focus on improving long-term profitability through product rationalization and simplification along with process streamlining will prove to be the right decisions as we build a fundamentally stronger business.
On September 19, we reached a tentative agreement with the CWA and IBEW for new 3-year contracts covering about 43,000 associates. We believe that this is a fair and balanced agreement that is good for our employees as well as a real positive for the future of the Wireline business. I will talk more about the tentative agreement during the Wireline segment review. Overall, another strong quarter of performance, putting us solidly on track to meet our financial objectives for the year.
Let's begin our review with a look at consolidated results on Slide 4. We sustained our solid consolidated growth trends with positive contributions from all strategic areas. Consolidated revenue growth increased to 3.9%. Our operating leverage and strong focus on expense controls drove operating income up 17.9%, our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Consolidated EBITDA grew to $10 billion. And our margin expanded 40 basis points sequentially to 34.6%, its highest level in nearly 4 years. Earnings growth also improved. As John indicated in his introductory remarks, adjusted EPS growth was more than 14% in the third quarter and is up nearly 15% year-to-date. 
Let's turn now to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 5. Our free cash flow increased to $5.6 billion in the quarter, driven by higher cash from operations and continued discipline in our capital spending. Capital expenditures totaled $3.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of about $260 million compared to last year. Year-to-date, capital spending of $11.3 billion was down about 10%. My expectation is that capital spending for the full year will be lower than the $16.2 billion we incurred in 2011. In addition, we expect our annual CapEx-to-revenue ratio to decline based on improved revenue trends and disciplined capital spending.
In Wireless, CapEx in the third quarter was $2.1 billion, which was about $350 million higher than last year. Year-to-date, Wireless capital of $6.1 billion was lower by nearly 16%. CapEx savings this year are due primarily to lower capacity spending on the 3G network.
We continue to build and expand the nation's largest 4G LTE network. As more customers choose 4G LTE smartphones and devices, the migration of data traffic from 3G to our lower-cost 4G LTE network will drive further improvements in operating and capital efficiency. Apparently, more than 35% of our data traffic is already on the 4G LTE network.
In Wireline, capital spending was $1.5 billion in the quarter, down $133 million from last year. Year-to-date, Wireline capital of $4.6 billion was about 3% lower. Our previously announced spectrum transactions all closed during the third quarter, representing a net cash outlay of $3.7 billion. In return, we received about 5.9 billion megahertz POPs of high-quality AWS spectrum.
Our balance sheet and credit metrics remain very strong. Total debt of $52.8 billion was down $2.4 billion from the end of the last year. Net debt was $43.1 billion at the end of the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.1x.
I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing pension liabilities and funding, starting on Slide 6. Yesterday, after the market closed, we announced that we will be transferring approximately $7.5 billion of management retiree pension benefit obligations to Prudential by purchasing a group annuity contract. Prudential will assume the responsibility in making monthly pension payments to approximately 41,000 management retirees. The transfer will not change the amount of the monthly pension benefit received by these retirees or their surviving beneficiaries. Pension obligations relating to active management and union-represented employees and retirees are not affected. The transaction will remove about 25% of our outstanding pension liabilities upon closing, which we expect to occur in December.
Turning to Slide 7. This transaction is part of an overall pension derisking strategy and reduces our exposure to funding and income statement volatility caused by change in investment returns, discount rates and longevity risk. It also allows us to transfer this liability at reasonable economics and avoid certain administrative costs while improving the longer-term financial profile of the business.
As a result of this transaction, some additional cash funding will be required in 2012 to fully fund the pension obligations being transferred to Prudential and to maintain the funded status of the pension liabilities that will remain with Verizon. In terms of timing, we already made an additional $930 million pension contribution in September, so on a year-to-date basis, we have made $1.8 billion in contributions. In the fourth quarter, we expect to make another $1.6 billion cash contribution. Our revised outlook for pension funding in 2012 is estimated to be $3.4 billion as compared to the $1.3 billion we estimated at the beginning of the year. While this represents more funding this year, we will have no cash funding requirements for pensions in 2013. Based on our current plan assumptions, we also expect contribution requirements in future years to be lower as a result of this transaction.
Let's now move into the review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 8. Our Wireless business had another excellent quarter, with accelerating growth in retail postpaid connections, better-than-expected adoption and financial performance of our new Share Everything Plans and strong growth in postpaid revenue per account or ARPA. Even more impressive is the fact that we achieved a 50% EBITDA service margin while activating more smartphones than any other quarter in our history, with the exception of the fourth quarter last year.
Total Wireless revenues of $19 billion grew 7.3% and represent 65% of Verizon's consolidated revenue year-to-date. Retail service revenue grew 7.9%, and total service revenue growth was 7.5% in both the third quarter and year-to-date. As John mentioned, we are disclosing new retail postpaid metrics, replacing ARPU with ARPA as well as providing the number of postpaid accounts and the average connections per account. The change in reporting aligns with the strategic intent of our shared data plans, which is to encourage device adoption and stimulate usage on our wireless network. Since driving service revenue growth is the key to our business model, the more relevant metric going forward is the amount of revenue that we generate per account.
During the quarter, ARPA grew to more than $145 per month, an increase of 6.5%. In only 3 months, 13% of the retail postpaid base adopted Share Everything Plans. Adoption is ahead of our expectations and ARPA dilution has been lower as we are seeing existing customers adding devices and increasing their data usage allowances.
The combination of incremental revenue from new customers, smartphone upgrades, increased devices connecting to our network and higher usage will more than make up for the effects of the customers initially optimizing their accounts. Device adoption and data usage will become the primary drivers of service revenue growth for years to come. Let's take a closer look at connections growth on Slide 9.
As we mentioned coming out of the second quarter, our retail postpaid net adds have continued to accelerate. With our strong performance, I am very confident that we continued to gain postpaid market share in the quarter. In addition to our strong device portfolio, network reliability and 4G LTE advantage, the introduction of our Share Everything Plans proved to be yet another compelling reason for customers to choose Verizon.
During the quarter, we added 1.8 million new retail net connections, with more than 1.5 million postpaid and 228,000 prepaid. We have an industry-leading 95.9 million retail connections, with approximately 90.4 million postpaid and 5.5 million prepaid. Our 90.4 million postpaid connections represent 34.8 million accounts with an average of 2.6 connections per account.
Before discussing our postpaid results in more detail, let me highlight our retail prepaid performance, where we had another strong quarter. Net adds of 228,000 were significantly higher than a year ago, and prepaid revenue continued to positively impact retail service revenue growth. In retail postpaid, our 1.5 million net adds represent a substantial sequential increase from 888,000 in the second quarter and the highest total we've reported in 4 years. Roughly 1/3 of these net adds were Internet devices, which include USB modems, Jetpacks and postpaid tablets. Roughly 95% of our postpaid Internet device activations this quarter were 4G LTE, which is very positive from a data usage perspective and provides additional evidence that our Share Everything Plans are stimulating device adoption. As you know, we are the market leader in this space, with 8 million Internet device connections in our retail postpaid base, and more importantly, over half of these are 4G LTE.
Our churn metrics continue to be market-leading. Retail postpaid churn of 0.91% improved by 3 basis points year-over-year and was up only 7 basis points sequentially in what is typically a seasonally higher quarter. Postpaid gross adds in the quarter were very strong at 4 million, up 27% sequentially and 20% year-over-year, also the highest gross add quarter in 4 years. The number of customers upgrading devices was slightly less than last quarter, representing 6.8% of our retail postpaid connections base.
Next, let's turn to Slide 10 and take a look at smartphones and our progress in 4G LTE. Smartphone penetration increased from just below 50% last quarter to more than 53%, a strong quarter in terms of smartphone adoption. As expected, an increasing majority of postpaid phone sales were smartphones. In the third quarter, we activated 6.8 million smartphones, representing 79% of the total phone category. 3.4 million of these smartphones were Android, of which 3 million were 4G LTE. In terms of Apple iPhones, we activated 3.1 million in the quarter, 21% of which were 4G LTE.
Another important point is the improving mix of gross adds and upgrades within our smartphone activations. In the third quarter, the percent new to Verizon increased to 31% of total activations, a sharp improvement from the 20% to 23% range we have reported in past quarters. This higher gross add mix is recognition of our 4G LTE network advantage since an increasing percentage of our smartphone activations are 4G LTE. In addition, within the customer upgrades, 44% were buying a smartphone for the first time.
In terms of 4G LTE coverage, we are by far the market leader. Our 4G LTE service is currently available in 419 markets covering more than 250 million POPs, roughly 80% of the U.S. population. As our TV commercials say, we have more 4G LTE coverage than all of our competitors' networks combined. We will continue expanding our 4G LTE network with the goal of having a nationwide footprint similar to our 3G network next year.
Sales of 4G LTE devices have risen steadily each and every quarter since we launched service in late 2010. In the third quarter, this increase was more dramatic as 4G LTE smartphone activations increased to 3.7 million from 2.5 million in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 14.9 million 4G LTE phones and devices in our postpaid base, representing 16.5% of total retail postpaid connections. Said another way, 25% of our smartphones and 51% of our Internet devices are 4G LTE, very impressive numbers in a relatively short period of time. However, we expect these percentages to continue to ramp as all new smartphones in our device roadmap will be 4G LTE.
Looking ahead, we see a great deal of new product development activity in M2M, particularly in healthcare and energy. We are also collaborating on an innovative video roadmap with the cable companies as part of our technology joint venture.
Let's conclude our Wireless review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 11. We generated $8.1 billion of EBITDA in the third quarter, an increase of 12.4%, and expanded our EBITDA service margin by 100 basis points sequentially to 50%. Again, we achieved this record profitability in a quarter in which we reported the highest number of gross and net adds in 4 years. Simply stated, our margin performance is a testament to our demonstrated and consistent ability to execute well on our strategy of achieving both growth and profitability. The combination of sustainable service revenue growth and intense focus on cost management and consistently excellent churn metrics are all contributing factors to our industry-leading margin performance.
In terms of managing our cost, we will continue to look at any and all opportunities within the business to drive process improvements and operating efficiencies. As I've previously indicated, we identified $2 billion in cost-saving opportunities in Wireless this year, and we have already surpassed that target.
Let's move to our Wireline segment next, starting with Mass Markets on Slide 12. Mass Markets revenue grew 3.8%, due primarily to accelerating growth in the consumer business. Our 4.6% revenue growth was the highest we've seen in 10 years, and we are on track to achieve at least a 5% growth rate in the fourth quarter. This growth, of course, was driven by FiOS, where revenue grew 18% in the third quarter and now represents about 2/3 of consumer revenue. The increasing scale of FiOS is driving growth in consumer revenue per month, which increased to nearly $104 in the quarter, up 10.3%. FiOS ARPU is now over $150 per month, and about 2/3 of our FiOS consumer customers are triple-play with voice, Internet and video services.
In terms of broadband customer growth, we had 136,000 new FiOS Internet additions in the quarter and now have nearly 5.3 million subscribers, representing penetration of 37%. In DSL, we had a net loss of 144,000, which is a bit higher than the last few quarters. Again, our decision to discontinue offering dry-loop DSL had a negative impact on gross adds but was clearly the right decision from a profitability standpoint. In spite of the lack of net subscriber growth, broadband revenues increased both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by our Quantum offer and copper-to-fiber migration.
In FiOS Video, we added about 120,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.6 million and increasing our penetration to 33%. In terms of FiOS customer growth, we did experience some seasonality with respect to churn, due in part to an increase in customers moving and also some elasticity related to our price increases. Based on our current sales activity, we are expecting improvement in FiOS customer adds in the fourth quarter along with our continuing revenue growth trajectory.
Within Mass Markets, we are focused on driving revenue growth, improving operating and capital efficiency and maximizing profitability. Key actions this year included targeted price increases, new differentiated services like FiOS Quantum and our copper-to-fiber migration initiative, which is helping to reduce our dependence on copper technology. Through 9 months, we have migrated about 150,000 homes to fiber, and we are on track to exceed 200,000 by the end of the year. We have already experienced a greater-than-10% improvement in our trouble report rate, which is saving on repair costs in these areas. We are also beginning to gain some traction in upselling new customers through additional FiOS services, which will result in additional monthly recurring revenue. We will have more to say going forward with regard to this important initiative, including how many homes will we be targeting in 2013. Suffice it to say that we are pleased with our progress to date and view the copper-to-fiber migration as an important part of our strategy to reduce the Wireline cost structure.
Before moving on, I would also add that our residential connection trends continue to improve. During the third quarter, we lost 217,000 retail residential connections, representing a 6.3% decline year-over-year, compared with a loss of 278,000 or 8% at this time last year.
Let's move to our enterprise markets next on Slide 13. As I said my in my overview, our challenge in the enterprise markets is primarily one of secular pressures and global economic conditions which include foreign exchange movements. In addition, as we've previously noted, we are making deliberate moves to rationalize and simplify our enterprise solutions product portfolio, which is also putting near-term pressure on revenue comparisons.
In the third quarter, Global Enterprise revenue was down $39 million sequentially and declined $140 million or 3.6% compared with a year ago, the majority of which were due to intentional actions on our part. This includes the de-emphasis of drop-ship CPE and decommissioning end-of-life products like ATM, frame relay and IP VPN. Lower CPE sales represented $139 million of the year-over-year decline.
Foreign currency translation also had an unfavorable impact on revenue as the stronger dollar versus the euro and pound Sterling caused a $40 million decline in the third quarter compared with a $37 million increase a year ago.
We are confident that our product rationalization and streamlining initiatives will fundamentally strengthen the business and improve our operating efficiency. We are also taking actions to enhance our network, facilities and overall end-to-end service provisioning in order to put the business in a stronger position to benefit when the global economy picks up. These strategic and operational activities are creating some margin pressure in the near term but will result in improved profitability in 2013.
Strategic services, which comprised 53% of Global Enterprise revenue, totaled $2 billion, up 4.4%. While we continue to perform relatively well in these services, international and FX continue to have an adverse effect on growth.
Domestically, we are seeing new contracts and investment decisions being delayed as enterprise CIOs continue to be cautious with regard to uncertainties involving the election outcome, the pending fiscal cliff, potential tax reform and other policy changes that may take place. Collectively, these uncertainties have created a wait-and-see approach that is impacting new business. We believe that a better understanding of these impacts will help companies make decisions about their capital commitments, and we are hopeful that enterprises renew their investing activities in 2013.
During this period, Verizon Enterprise Solutions continues to strengthen its competitive position in higher-growth markets like cloud computing, machine-to-machine and advanced communications. In late July, we completed the acquisition of Hughes Telematics, which will expand and accelerate our capabilities in advanced automotive, fleet telematics and many other machine-to-machine services.
Moving next to Global Wholesale. Revenues in the third quarter declined $45 million sequentially and $181 million or 9.2% year-over-year due primarily to continued declines in transport services. We are taking the necessary actions to exit unprofitable routes and contracts and to better position the business in the fiber-based Ethernet data services space as customers with special access transition from DS1s and DS3s.
Let's move on to Slide 14 next to summarize Wireline. From a top line perspective, the overall picture is mixed, with some very encouraging signs in the consumer market while we continue to manage through secular and cyclical challenges in enterprise and wholesale. Our product rationalization initiatives, while putting some near-term pressure on revenue, will ultimately serve to strengthen the business. At the beginning of the year, we were optimistic that EBITDA margin in the second half of 2012 would show improvement compared to the first half. As I have stated at a few investor conferences in September, we're no longer seeing this being the case due primarily to growth challenges on the enterprise side and the length of time it took to reach an agreement with our unions.
In addition, some of the activities to reduce our reliance on older technologies and systems, along with the many processed reengineering efforts we have going, have created margin pressure in the near term. Collectively, all these initiatives are designed to improve the Wireline cost structure. We fully expect that these and other cost management actions will result in improved profitability in 2013 and over the longer term.
To that end, for the past 15 months, we have talked about the importance of concluding our union contract negotiations and coming up with a contract that is fair and balanced for our employees but, at the same time, addresses some key issues related to our ability to achieve improvements in our cost structure. Let's talk a bit more about the contract on Slide 15.
On September 19, we reached a tentative agreement with the CWA and IBEW for new 3-year contracts covering about 43,000 associates. The contracts are currently in the ratification process, which typically takes 30 days, so we hope to be able to announce a definitive agreement very soon. Under the tentative agreement, there are changes to medical and prescription drug plans for active and retired associates, including contributions toward healthcare premiums for active employees. In addition, current retirees will make contributions toward healthcare premiums for some medical plans, while associates who retire after January 1, 2013, will make premium contributions regardless of the medical plan which they enroll in. New associates hired from this point forward will be eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan instead of a traditional pension plan. The agreement also makes changes to old legacy policies, including tighter absence controls and better quality control and training practices. There are new provisions that will result in better work rule flexibility, such as national call-sharing, which will improve the customer experience and allow our associates to work more efficiently and cost-effectively. Since the contract has not yet been ratified, I am not going to quantify the annual cost savings at this time. We will have an opportunity to communicate this information at an investor conference in early November, so stay tuned for more information on this subject.
Let's move now to our summary slide. Overall, a very good third quarter, keeping us solidly on track to meet our financial objectives for the year. We are executing our plans and investing for the future.
Consolidated revenue growth is increasing, and we have had 4 successive quarters of EBITDA margin expansion, with the third quarter being the highest margin since 2008. We have built strong earnings momentum with 3 successive quarters of double-digit growth and have generated 50% more free cash flow than last year at this time. Our disciplined capital spending and revenue growth is driving improved capital efficiency.
In Wireless, we further solidified our excellent spectrum position by closing all our pending transactions. And with our 4G LTE network advantage, our unmatched product portfolio and our well-received Share Everything Plans, we feel confident about our ability to sustain our industry-leading profitability in 2013 and beyond.
In Wireline, although we have work to do, we are putting the right plans in place to strengthen the business and improve profitability in 2013 and over the longer term. Our strategic investments and actions position us very well for sustainable growth. We continue to build for the future. And while we may have some near-term challenges, we are successfully executing a well-conceived plan that will drive profitability and create shareholder value in 2013 and into the future.
With that, I will now turn the call back to John so we can address your questions."

But I think the key to this whole thing, a couple points I want to make here. So from a -- just an overall cash perspective, which is the real -- the key here because this is really the cash impact of the business: As you know, we made a first half contribution of $600 million. In the third quarter, we added another $1.2 billion to the plan, so $1.8 billion from a cash impact perspective to date. And in the fourth quarter, we determined that we'll put another $1.6 billion into the plan. All these contributions are tax-deductible. We will not have any 2013 contributions and that, based on our planning and the assumptions that we have in this transaction, the future cash contributions to the pension plan will be less post this transaction close, which we anticipate to be early December. So from that perspective, that, to me, is the important part. I think everything else is pretty minimal at this point in time."

So the iPhone 5 came out in very late September. There really wasn't all that much volume on the iPhone 5. If you look at our total iPhone adds, we added 3.1 million, 1.1 million than we did a year ago. And about 651,000 of them were iPhone 5s, the rest were 4 and 4S. And what we're seeing here is we're seeing that, the iPhone 5, we had supply constraints. We're not sure where we're going to stand in the fourth quarter with those constraints. But what we are seeing on the 4 and 4S is that we're attracting customers who probably previously did not come to Verizon because of the cost point of that iPhone. So I think you saw that in our net add gross for the quarter. So again, in -- from a trending perspective and all the work that we've done around cost and the $2 billion, and if you look at the 3 years, we've taken out $5 billion of cost structure of Wireless. Again, I think that, given the volume, there could be some dilution in that margin if the volumes exceed what they were in the third quarter, which I anticipate they will. If you recall back to the first quarter, I said we would accelerate our growth throughout the quarters for the year. As we come out of the third quarter, you saw we posted our highest growth in the last 4 years, and I think that we will accelerate that growth into the fourth quarter. So yes, I think we will have some deterioration in the margins in the fourth quarter for Wireless, but at this point I can't tell you what that will be because I don't know what the volume will be. But obviously, I don't anticipate it to be as much as it was a year ago. And then on the Wireline side, I think this story is a much more complex story, but in the short -- just for the union piece of this, I think we'll wait till the fourth quarter, but you're not going to see any benefit this year. But I don't want to really get into the details until this contract is ratified. A number of unions have ratified it, but it will not be ratified by all until the next couple of days are over. So once that happens, I will give some more clarity around this during the fourth quarter and into the first quarter."

So there's a lot of work to be done here, and we're not ready to talk about exactly where we are with these. I think the important point, though, is we're going to analyze each and every bid. We are also developing our own internal plans to launch this spectrum because, as I said before, this is not a fire sale on spectrum, so if we do not get fair value or what we believe to be fair value, then we'll use this spectrum internally. But at this point, I think it's too early to communicate exactly how this will proceed, but I think it will happen late in the fourth quarter, possibly not till the first quarter. And if we do come to terms with some of these, then it has to go through the normal FCC approval. We probably wouldn't close on that probably till late third quarter, fourth quarter of 2013. As far as Vodafone dividend, this is a very interesting question, because I think we all forget that on January of 2012, we actually did do a dividend at $10 billion. And throughout the year during our normal course, we did about another $4.5 billion of tax distributions. So year-to-date, we've done $14.5 billion of dividend distributions out of Wireless. To talk about a further dividend, I think, is premature. We have an agreement with Vodafone that we will discuss this at the -- before the end of the year.

So from a copper shutdown perspective, I think it's highly unlikely that you'll ever see a Verizon have no copper in their network because of the vastness of this network. But I think, strategically, the way we have approached this from a copper-to-fiber migration is all in the -- all copper is not created equal. We have areas where the copper has really deteriorated because it's 60 years plus. And we are strategically going after what we call chronic troubles, and that is a truck roll that happens in a period of 6 months' time, and that costs us about $900 in cash from a perspective of that. So when you look at the overall investment that we have to make to migrate that customer from copper to FiOS, it's more cost-effective to go after those chronic problems first. But not all of the network that leads into one switch is having these chronic problems, so to think about decommissioning every switch in our network would be a huge cost undertaking. So we believe that the strategy we've outlaid with our copper-to-fiber migration is financially viable. It's better for the customer. We see that, from the customers who have -- we have migrated in the short term, they're actually buying up into the FiOS Quantum and generating $10-plus more ARPU. So we're strategically going after this. We have also received a lot of regulatory relief already in the states that we deal with from being the carrier of last resort, replacing in Pennsylvania, fulfilling our obligation of bringing broadband to customers via a PA30 ruling, which would be with Wireless instead of Wireline, which is a much more financial beneficial to Verizon. So we have already explored a lot of this regulatory highway, and we will continue with our copper-to-fiber migration under the plan that we are executing."

It's gross debt of $10 billion, cash of $8.1 billion, so net debt of about $1.9 billion. And then on the Wireline side of the house was VDMS. We are making significant progress. We have been dealing with a -- what we call a number of chartered customers, which includes many content providers and movie houses in helping us to customize this package and get this thing to market. We anticipate that we will come to market in 2013. I won't be specific on that date at this point in time. But we believe we have a very viable product to come to marketplace that will significantly change the way content is, if you will, packaged and picked and shipped. So we will have more to say on that within 2013, but I think that will start to contribute to some of the Wireline top growth and help to improve the margin overall. And then, I'm sorry, I mentioned Redbox. We are very close to launching here in the fourth quarter with Redbox. VDMS plays a very critical role in the content delivery with that joint venture with Redbox. And again, I think, moving into 2013, the business case that we have with us with Redbox will improve our top line and contribute to the profitability of the overall Wireline segment."

I'm saying now it will definitely be down from our 2011 spend. I think the trajectory into '13 will be very similar to the '12. I think what you'll is what you saw in the third quarter, that we continue to very closely manage the CapEx on the Wireline side of the business. Meanwhile, Wireless will continue with their plan to build out the 4G LTE by midyear next year to compare to our 3G footprint. I don't see a substantial change in the CapEx trajectory here. But obviously, this does depend on growth, and we hang our hat on being the best network, most reliable network in the industry, and we're not going to lose that position. So Wireless has been A-plus in this area and I don't believe that will change, but I don't think there's a significant change in the capital trajectory here."

And there's obviously some legs to that, and the longer-term benefits, I think, are pretty clear. But just give a sense, if you can, as to maybe the magnitude of margin pressure as you do that migration process over the next year or so. And then secondly, on the Wireless side, we've had this sort of honeymoon with the change in policy with respect to upgrade window that, I think, should be coming to a close right about now. So as we look into the fourth quarter and get this pool of people that are now upgrade-eligible that have not been for the last 6 months, how should we be thinking about upgrade percentages as we go through maybe both 4Q as well as 1Q?"

So migration and Wireline pressure, I guess there's a couple of things here. And it's not just the migration.

So migration and Wireline pressure, I guess there's a couple of things here. And it's not just the migration. But obviously, doing some of this work does increase some CapEx to us and does increase some of the operating expense to us, but I would say that's in combination with a lot of other things that we're doing. But this positions us for the future. I would say, though, that, beyond this, from a pressure standpoint on Wireline, obviously, the third quarter to us is always a seasonal pressure point from a weather condition, a construction issue, fiber cuts and so forth, so that's not unusual for the third quarter to be a bigger margin pressure for us. But the delay of the union contract had an impact on our margins. The huge results, obviously, if you go back and look at Hughes on a standalone basis, they contribute to dilution in the Wireline segment, because that is now included in the Wireline. As we said, we're in the process of retooling the enterprise, which is putting a little bit of pressure in the expense category with system consolidation and product rationalization. And then we've also deliberately have gone out during the third quarter, and we'll probably do a little bit of this in the fourth quarter, and accelerated some of the repairs and maintenance within our facilities. We are also doing some additional work in our networks to increase our diversity and reliability within the Wireline network. So there's a lot of things that's putting a little bit of pressure on the Wireline, but again, I think we're taking this opportunity during the lull of the economic condition preparing for this economic turn that hopefully will come in 2013. And I think we'll be in a better position to ride that wave when it comes. So I think it's a combination of all that. And then on the Wireless side, with the upgrade window, I guess the way I would put it this way is our upgrade percentage will be more in the fourth quarter than it was in the third quarter, but I will tell you I think it will be less than the fourth quarter of a year ago."

First, as I said in a few of the investor conferences, I anticipated and we suspected some consolidation. And I think what the market should walk away with here is that there are 2 very large companies willing to invest in the U.S. wireless market. I believe this is a sign that this is very good for the industry, and I think this shows the strength of the U.S. market and the growth potential that's still available within this market. I think what this means from us is a couple of things. First, if you go back to January 2011, the biggest point that Lowell and I made was we are all about executing on our plan. We have invested and built and remained on our brand to be the best and most reliable network. We have pioneered, launched and now are the largest 4G LTE network, with more coverage than all of our competitors combined. I think if you look at our spectrum holding, we have a superior spectrum holding and quality of spectrum with our 700-megahertz contiguous across the United States, which we've launched our 4G LTE network on, and with the closing of our AWS spectrum with the cable companies. So I think we're in a very strong position from a spectrum holding perspective. If you look at our capital -- and in the past, we've taken a little heat from the market for the amount of capital that we have spent on our networks. But if you look at -- on average, we spend about $10 billion per year investing in our wireless and our Wireline IP backbone support for that wireless network. And I think -- at the end of the day, I think you would all agree that execution equal results here. I think the third quarter results speak for themselves. So we will continue to execute, and we will continue to lead the industry."

So we'll just leave it as we'll give the accounts, we'll give the devices per account and the ARPA on that. As far as the Shared Everything Plans, I think the best answer is we're seeing a little bit of everything, that we are seeing our customers move from their old legacy plans, we're seeing customers who were on unlimited plans move to Share Everything Plan. Now you would think that these initial customers that moved are optimizing from that, but what we're seeing is that they are attaching more devices. That includes more smartphones. And especially with the price points now on some of the lower-end iPhones that we have, we're seeing more attachment rates there. We are seeing a lot of attachment on Internet WiFi devices. And I think what we're seeing is they're attaching the MiFi device at a $20 price point rather than each individually attaching a tablet. So I think we're seeing very good success in MiFi attachment rates. And from the tablets, we're seeing some of that but probably not as much as we had expected, but the MiFi attachment is running extremely higher than we expected. So I think, overall, again, what we're seeing in Shared Everything is better than what we had expected in our business case."
