Thank you for joining us. I hope you have had a chance to review our press releases announcing our third quarter fiscal 2012 earnings and our enhanced capital allocation program. I'll start this afternoon wit",1730,"Thanks, Kelsey and good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining us. I hope you have had a chance to review our press releases announcing our third quarter fiscal 2012 earnings and our enhanced capital allocation program. I'll start this afternoon with a brief overview of our third quarter performance. I'll then talk to you about our capital allocation strategy, which we first discussed with you at Investor Day in July and then indicated in October that we would provide you an update this quarter. I will conclude with a review of our progress driving sales growth and margin expansion. Rich will then provide details on the quarter and guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2012. We'll then take your questions. 
In the third quarter, we saw growth in revenue and EPS and operating margin expansion, even after adjusting for a single license payment we received. As noted in our release, the unsolicited early single payment from a software company relates to a license agreement we entered into in connection with a litigation settlement we first announced in February 2009. This payment was not included in annual guidance provided by the company in October because we expected it in fiscal years 2013 and 2014. 
Headlines from the quarter, which reflect year-over-year growth rates include: revenue growth of 10% in constant currency and as reported. The license payment added about 3 points to this growth. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, including approximately 2 points from the license payment. Non-GAAP earnings per share growth was 28% in constant currency. The license payment added 10% to this growth. Cash flow from operations, including the license payment, declined 19% in constant currency and 20% as reported. As we've anticipated, cash flow for fiscal 2012 is weighted towards the fourth quarter and this afternoon, we confirmed our cash flow guidance for the year. Our current revenue backlog grew 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported. 
While we had a good quarter on many measures and continued to make solid progress against our long-term goals, we know we are not done. We remain focused on executing our strategy and driving further operational improvements, including new product sales, execution in EMEA, greater sales productivity and continued work on our expense structure. 
Now, let me go to our enhanced capital allocation program, starting with some background. As you recall, in July, we said as part of our long-term guidance, that we expected to return 40% to 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. As I mentioned in October, management and the board were continuing to evaluate ways to optimize our balance sheet, while maintaining the financial flexibility we need to build our business and continue to improve our competitive positioning. We believe our enhanced capital allocation program announced this afternoon puts us on a path to achieving a balanced approach to return more cash to shareholders, while still enabling us to invest in our future. This is a logical extension of the strategic and operational priorities we outlined at Investor Day. 
Fundamentally, the dividend increase and share repurchase authorization underscore the board's and management's confidence in the company's long-term business outlook and our ability to generate significant free cash flow on a consistent basis. It is our consistent free cash flow, driven by our current and projected operating performance, that allows us to fund this ongoing return of capital and at the same time, continue to invest in our future to further improve our strategic market position and deliver superior mainframe enterprise and cloud solutions and services to our customers. 
Today, we are focused on 3 priorities to build long-term value for CA Technologies customers, employees and shareholders. First, to continue to execute our strategy and improve our operating performance. Second, to provide for a greater return of cash to shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases. And third, to effectively use the balance sheet to return additional cash in the near term through an accelerated something. 
In summary, we are targeting to return to shareholders approximately $2.5 billion through fiscal year 2014, or about 80% of our expected cumulative free cash flow over that period. 
Key elements of the program include: One, an increase in the dividend from an annualized rate of $0.20 per share to $1 per share. That is a yield of approximately 4.5% based on yesterday's closing market price and currently puts our dividend yield at the top of comparable technology companies. The board and management view returning cash to shareholders through dividends as an important component of our overall approach to enhancing shareholder value. 
Two, a new $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization through fiscal 2014, including an accelerated repurchase of approximately $500 million under an agreement to be executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Including the accelerated share repurchase and shares repurchased year-to-date, we expect we will have spent approximately $1 billion to buy back shares during fiscal year 2012. The $1.5 billion authorization replaces the approximately $230 million remaining under our current authorization. We are confident we have the balance sheet capacity to get this done and the program is expected to be funded by available U.S. cash. 
Three, our strategic plan anticipates that we will continue our investment in the business consistent with that of previous years, or approximately $1 billion annually. This includes acquisition activity in the range of $300 million to $500 million per year, on average, through fiscal 2014 and the approximately $600 million we invest on average in organic research and development. So let me answer the critical question of how we intend to continue to improve execution against our strategic plan. 
As we've highlighted in this afternoon's capital allocation release, we remain comfortable with the long-term targets for the period ending March 31, 2015, that we provided at Investor Day in July. This includes an acceleration to mid-single-digit constant currency organic revenue growth and an expansion of our non-GAAP operating margin by 100 basis points a year. Our expectation is that, over time, much of this operating margin expansion will come from improvements in execution in our Enterprise Solutions segment, driven by accelerating product sales and greater efficiency in our sales force. We intend to continue to drive more growth and more profit from each dollar we invest and we will continue to systematically improve productivity and efficiency in our organization. 
In our second quarter earnings call, we outlined 3 immediate growth initiatives: Expanding product penetration in new accounts and growth geographies; continuing to improve our results in EMEA; and driving consistent performance out of our acquisitions. In terms of product penetration, this past quarter, we focused on 3 main areas. 
First, we continued our market segmentation initiative, which as a first step, includes the rebalancing of our sales force to align what has been a highly concentrated coverage model to new opportunities in approximately 1,000 large new enterprise accounts and approximately 7,000 accounts in the midmarket. Focusing these groups on sales of new products to new customers, our market segmentation effort is designed to drive product penetration in new accounts and accelerate performance of our acquisitions. 
Second, we told you we expect to add an incremental 300 new quota-carrying sales reps globally by year end. 1/3 of these resources will be new to CA Technologies, while 2/3 reflect a reallocation of existing internal resources. All of this will be accomplished under our current expense profile. At this point, we are approximately halfway through this process and expect to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter. 
Finally, we have continued to make significant investments in growth geographies. These are long-term investments in markets that are key to accelerating new product sales and our ongoing success in the years to come. This quarter, we had excellent results in Latin America, where we added more than 30 new enterprise customers to the region and expanded our footprint in more than 60 current customers. In Asia Pacific, we added more than 30 new logos to the region, including 15 for Nimsoft. Growth in new product sales more than doubled in China and grew more than 40% in Korea. 
Next in EMEA, we believe the team we have in place is introducing the right discipline and incentive structure to keep both our renewals process and new business pipeline on track. Our plan is focused on improving sales execution and productivity, driving marketing and brand awareness and developing our people. While we do not want to get ahead of ourselves, we were pleased to see modest revenue growth in EMEA this quarter and wins with Volkswagen SAP, Daimler and Credit Agricole. 
Lastly, with respect to acquisitions, we believe our strategy to aggressively capitalize on the evolution of virtualization management, cloud computing implementation and SaaS delivery of IT is working. We continue to focus on driving results from investments we have made, both through organic development and in companies such as Nimsoft, 3Tera AppLogic, ITKO and Arcot. Results achieved during the quarter give us confidence that our strategy to reach new customers and the midmarket is the right one. This quarter, Nimsoft added a record 100 new logos and in December, we received notification that Net One Systems formally selected Nimsoft to be their platform of choice for their future business services for their XOC managed operations center, one of the largest in Japan. 
We closed a significant transaction with IGT, which selected AppLogic to continue innovating how casino games, systems and experiences are delivered with the IGT cloud. 
ITKO delivered a record quarter, closed 5 deals over $1 million and saw their average transaction size significantly increase. Customers like DirecTV and SoCal Edison report return on their investment in ITKO in terms of weeks and continue to expand their usage and licenses. 
Finally, our Arcot is protecting approximately 150 million identities worldwide. During the 2011 holiday shopping season, we averaged 1 million transactions per day for our e-commerce authentication on our SaaS platform. 
In conclusion, the strategic initiatives and priorities we continue to pursue, in combination with our enhanced capital allocation program, reflect the ongoing commitment of the CA Technologies board, management and employees to deliver outstanding solutions and services to our customers and attractive, sustainable returns to CA shareholders. Now, I will turn the call over to Rich for a closer look at the third quarter."

Turning to our third quarter results, please note that our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated and all results are from continuing operations. As Bill mentioned, this quarter's results include the single license pay",1064,"Thank you, Bill. Turning to our third quarter results, please note that our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated and all results are from continuing operations. As Bill mentioned, this quarter's results include the single license payment from a software company. This payment came in earlier than we had anticipated and was not included in the fiscal year 2012 guidance we provided in October. 
The single license payments contributed the following to the quarter: Revenue of $39 million reported in our Mainframe Solutions segment and in the software fees and other line on the P&L: GAAP and non-GAAP operating income of $36 million; GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.05; and cash flow of $39 million. 
Total revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion grew 10% in constant currency and as reported. Eight points of this growth was organic, while 2 points of this growth came from acquisitions. This quarter, we saw $20 million increase in perpetual sales associated with Enterprise Solutions products, including $10 million of products that were newly eligible for upfront recognition during the quarter. 
From a segment perspective, Mainframe Solutions revenue was $682 million, up 9% in constant currency and as reported. The single license payment contributed 6 points of growth in constant currency and as reported to Mainframe Solutions. 
Our Enterprise Solutions revenue was $478 million, up 11% in constant currency and 12% as reported. Services revenue was $103 million, up 16% in constant currency and 17% as reported. 
Underlying our results for the quarter, total new capacity and new product sales were up low-single digits. In Mainframe Solutions, new product sales for the quarter grew, both with and without single license payment. Capacity sales were down more than 20%. Quarter-to-quarter capacity will fluctuate, driven by the nature of the customers in our underlying renewal portfolio. Year-to-date, we are encouraged by the capacity trends which are up and believe that IBM mainframe is bringing increased attention to the platform and over time, should serve as a slow, steady tailwind to CA Technologies. 
Enterprise Solutions new product sales were down approximately 5%. We saw growth in Virtualization & Automation and Identity and Access management. This was offset by Service Portfolio Management and Service Assurance. Underneath these Service Assurance results, we saw growth in Application Performance Management that was offset by Infrastructure Monitoring. 
Finally, new service engagements were down slightly year-over-year. 
Our renewal yield was just below 90%. We closed one transaction, a merger, that negatively skewed the results during the quarter. Excluding this transaction, the renewal yield would've been in the mid-90s. We continue to expect the 2012 renewal portfolio to be down approximately 15% year-over-year. For modeling purposes, please note that fourth quarter 2012 renewals face a difficult year-over-year comparison. This is due to the more than $500 million system integrator license agreement that was signed last year in our fiscal fourth quarter. 
Looking at revenue backlog, current revenue backlog was $3.6 billion, up 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $8.1 billion, up 2% in constant currency and as reported. 
From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $475 million, up 21% in constant currency and 23% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. Operating margins for Mainframe Solutions was 59%. Operating margins for Enterprise Solutions was 12%. This includes 4 points of continued investment in this segment. Finally, operating margin for Services was 11%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.65, up 28% in constant currency and 30% as reported, including a year-over-year $0.01 tailwind from currency. This quarter, EPS benefited from previously mentioned license payment, operational improvements and our stock repurchase program. 
Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the third quarter of 2012 was 31.5%. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $396 million, down 19% in constant currency and 20% as reported. Single installment payments were $107 million in the third quarter compared to $152 million in the previous period. Total billings backlog of $5 billion was up 7% in constant currency and 6% as reported. DSOs were essentially flat year-over-year. 
Moving to third quarter GAAP results, third quarter operating margin before interest and taxes was 33%. GAAP operating income was $413 million, up 22% in constant currency and 24% as reported and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.54, up 39% in constant currency and 42% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was 34.9%. 
Now, moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in net cash. Between October 1st and December 31st, we purchased approximately 9.6 million shares of stock for a total of approximately $200 million. 
Now, let me turn to fiscal 2012 guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based on December 31 exchange rates. This includes a partial hedge of operating income and updates our expectations for share count. Guidance is the following: Total revenue growth is now expected to be 6% in constant currency, at the high end of our previous range of 5% to 6%. This translates to reported revenue of $4.8 billion; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 11% to 13%, an increase from our previous range of 7% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.21 to $2.25. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 11% to 13%, an increase from our previous range of 6% to 9%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.86 to $1.90. 
We continue to expect that cash flow from operations will grow at 3% to 5% constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.44 billion to $1.47 billion. Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 31% to 32% in this fiscal year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 463 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 486 million shares. This share count reflects the $500 million ASR under an agreement we expect to execute in the company's fourth quarter. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be a strong 34% for fiscal year 2012. And now, I'll turn the call back over the Bill."

The acquisitions we've been making over the last 2 years, many of them now have moved into the organic area and as we've added additional capability for those, those are supporting our organic growth as we move forward and that will continue into next year. When you look at the segmentation that we talked about in the last quarter, with the 300 additional sales reps we were moving out and we're moving into the segmentation area, that growth, new products and new accounts, will add to the organic growth as we go forward. And I think one of the probably key points that's worth looking at in the quarter is that you may recall a year ago when Nimsoft was reporting, we talked about 20 or 30 new accounts. We had over 200 new logos in the quarter. And so with Nimsoft and with Latin America coming on very strong, now starting to get growth in the Asia countries and a return a bit from EMEA, we're starting to see organic growth coming out what we had previously gone from the new products and acquisitions, as well as from new segmentation pieces.

Service Assurance was mixed where we had good growth in Application Performance Management and that was offset a bit by Infrastructure and Monitoring. And we had a decline in Service Portfolio Management. So it was mixed. But in general, we had some very good bright spots. We had very good mainframe new license sales as well, excluding even that single license payment."

First of all, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your philosophy between the return of shareholder funds in the form of dividends versus buybacks? Obviously, you've been much more skewed towards buyback historically and that is a very significant increase in the dividend here today. And then secondly, I wanted to ask, I understand, Rich, what you're saying about there's this no need to issue debt here but I guess my question would be why not? If you look at few years ago, CA had $1 billion more in net cash and $1 billion more in debt. So clearly, there's the flexibility on the balance sheet that would give you more flexibility today including the possibility of an even greater return of cash to shareholders, particularly when the cost of debt is so low. So just wondering if you're targeting a specific debt rating there or really what your thought process is on those 2 issues?"

On your second question on why we wouldn't leverage up the balance sheet, that tends to be more of a shorter-term view. If we were to do something like that, it would really be more for a large acquisition or something along those lines which we don not plan on doing at this time.

Thank you for joining us. I hope you have had a chance to review our press releases announcing our third quarter fiscal 2012 earnings and our enhanced capital allocation program. I'll start this afternoon wit",1735,"Thanks, Kelsey and good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining us. I hope you have had a chance to review our press releases announcing our third quarter fiscal 2012 earnings and our enhanced capital allocation program. I'll start this afternoon with a brief overview of our third quarter performance. I'll then talk to you about our capital allocation strategy, which we first discussed with you at Investor Day in July and then indicated in October that we would provide you an update this quarter. I will conclude with a review of our progress driving sales growth and margin expansion. Rich will then provide details on the quarter and guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2012. We'll then take your questions.
In the third quarter, we saw growth in revenue and EPS and operating margin expansion, even after adjusting for a single license payment we received. As noted in our release, the unsolicited early single payment from a software company relates to a license agreement we entered into in connection with a litigation settlement we first announced in February 2009. This payment was not included in annual guidance provided by the company in October because we expected it in fiscal years 2013 and 2014.
Headlines from the quarter, which reflect year-over-year growth rates include: revenue growth of 10% in constant currency and as reported. The license payment added about 3 points to this growth. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, including approximately 2 points from the license payment. Non-GAAP earnings per share growth was 28% in constant currency. The license payment added 10% to this growth. Cash flow from operations, including the license payment, declined 19% in constant currency and 20% as reported. As we had anticipated, cash flow for fiscal 2012 is weighted towards the fourth quarter and this afternoon, we confirmed our cash flow guidance for the year. Our current revenue backlog grew 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported.
While we had a good quarter on many measures and continued to make solid progress against our long-term goals, we know we are not done. We remain focused on executing our strategy and driving further operational improvements, including new product sales, execution in EMEA, greater sales productivity and continued work on our expense structure.
Now let me go to our enhanced capital allocation program, starting with some background. As you recall, in July, we said as part of our long-term guidance, that we expected to return 40% to 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. As I mentioned in October, management and the board were continuing to evaluate ways to optimize our balance sheet, while maintaining the financial flexibility we need to build our business and continue to improve our competitive positioning. We believe our enhanced capital allocation program announced this afternoon puts us on a path to achieving a balanced approach to return more cash to shareholders, while still enabling us to invest in our future. This is a logical extension of the strategic and operational priorities we outlined at Investor Day.
Fundamentally, the dividend increase and share repurchase authorization underscore the board's and management's confidence in the company's long-term business outlook and our ability to generate significant free cash flow on a consistent basis. It is our consistent free cash flow, driven by our current and projected operating performance, that allows us to fund this ongoing return of capital and at the same time, continue to invest in our future to further improve our strategic market position and deliver superior mainframe enterprise and cloud solutions and services to our customers.
Today, we are focused on 3 priorities to build long-term value for CA Technologies customers, employees and shareholders. First, to continue to execute our strategy and improve our operating performance. Second, to provide for a greater return of cash to shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases. And third, to effectively use the balance sheet to return additional cash in the near term through an accelerated buyback.
In summary, we are targeting to return to shareholders approximately $2.5 billion through fiscal year 2014, or about 80% of our expected cumulative free cash flow over that period.
Key elements of the program include: One, an increase in the dividend from an annualized rate of $0.20 per share to $1 per share. That is a yield of approximately 4.5% based on yesterday's closing market price and currently puts our dividend yield at the top of comparable technology companies. The board and management view returning cash to shareholders through dividends as an important component of our overall approach to enhancing shareholder value.
Two, a new $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization through fiscal 2014, including an accelerated repurchase of approximately $500 million under an agreement to be executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Including the accelerated share repurchase and shares repurchased year-to-date, we expect we will have spent approximately $1 billion to buy back shares during fiscal year 2012. The $1.5 billion authorization replaces the approximately $230 million remaining under our current authorization. We are confident we have the balance sheet capacity to get this done and the program is expected to be funded by available U.S. cash.
Three, our strategic plan anticipates that we will continue our investment in the business consistent with that of previous years, or approximately $1 billion annually. This includes acquisition activity in the range of $300 million to $500 million per year, on average, through fiscal 2014 and the approximately $600 million we invest on average each year in organic research and development.
So let me answer the critical question of how we intend to continue to improve execution against our strategic plan. As we've highlighted in this afternoon's capital allocation release, we remain comfortable with the long-term targets for the period ending March 31, 2015, that we provided at Investor Day in July. This includes an acceleration to mid-single digit constant currency organic revenue growth and an expansion of our non-GAAP operating margin by 100 basis points a year. Our expectation is that, over time, much of this operating margin expansion will come from improvements in execution in our Enterprise Solutions segment, driven by accelerating product sales and greater efficiency in our sales force. We intend to continue to drive more growth and more profit from each dollar we invest, and we will continue to systematically improve productivity and efficiency in our organization.
In our second quarter earnings call, we outlined 3 immediate growth initiatives: Expanding product penetration in new accounts and growth geographies; continuing to improve our results in EMEA; and driving consistent performance out of our acquisitions. In terms of product penetration, this past quarter, we focused on 3 main areas.
First, we continued our market segmentation initiative, which as a first step, includes the rebalancing of our sales force to align what has been a highly concentrated coverage model to new opportunities in approximately 1,000 large new enterprise accounts and approximately 7,000 accounts in the midmarket. Focus in these groups on sales of new products to new customers, our market segmentation effort is designed to drive product penetration in new accounts and accelerate performance of our acquisitions.
Second, we told you we expect to add an incremental 300 new quota-carrying sales reps globally by year end. 1/3 of these resources will be new to CA Technologies, while 2/3 reflect a reallocation of existing internal resources. All of this will be accomplished under our current expense profile. At this point, we are approximately halfway through this process and expect to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter.
Finally, we have continued to make significant investments in growth geographies. These are long-term investments in markets that are key to accelerating new product sales and our ongoing success in the years to come. This quarter, we had excellent results in Latin America, where we added more than 30 new enterprise customers to the region and expanded our footprint in more than 60 current customers. In Asia Pacific, we added more than 30 new logos to the region, including 15 for Nimsoft. Growth in new product sales more than doubled in China and grew more than 40% in Korea.
Next in EMEA, we believe the team we have in place is introducing the right discipline and incentive structure to keep both our renewals process and new business pipeline on track. Our plan is focused on improving sales execution and productivity, driving marketing and brand awareness and developing our people. While we do not want to get ahead of ourselves, we were pleased to see modest revenue growth in EMEA this quarter and wins with Volkswagen, SAP, Daimler and Crédit Agricole.
Lastly, with respect to acquisitions, we believe our strategy to aggressively capitalize on the evolution of virtualization management, cloud computing implementation and SaaS delivery of IT is working. We continue to focus on driving results from investments we have made, both through organic development and in companies such as Nimsoft, 3Tera AppLogic, ITKO and Arcot. Results achieved during the quarter give us confidence that our strategy to reach new customers and the midmarket is the right one. This quarter, Nimsoft added a record 100 new logos and in December, we received notification that Net One Systems formally selected Nimsoft to be their platform of choice for their future business services for their XOC managed operations center, one of the largest in Japan.
We closed a significant transaction with IGT, which selected AppLogic to continue innovating how casino games, systems and experiences are delivered with the IGT cloud.
ITKO delivered a record quarter, closed 5 deals over $1 million and saw their average transaction size significantly increase. Customers like DIRECTV and SoCal Edison report return on their investment in ITKO in terms of weeks and continue to expand their usage and licenses.
Finally, Arcot is protecting approximately 150 million identities worldwide. During the 2011 holiday shopping season, we averaged 1 million transactions per day for our e-commerce authentication on our SaaS platform.
In conclusion, the strategic initiatives and priorities we continue to pursue, in combination with our enhanced capital allocation program, reflect the ongoing commitment of the CA Technologies board, management and employees to deliver outstanding solutions and services to our customers at an attractive, sustainable returns to CA shareholders.
Now I will turn the call over to Rich for a closer look at the third quarter."

Turning to our third quarter results, please note that our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated and all results are from continuing operations. As Bill mentioned, this quarter's result include the single license paym",1068,"Thank you, Bill. Turning to our third quarter results, please note that our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated and all results are from continuing operations. As Bill mentioned, this quarter's result include the single license payment from a software company. This payment came in earlier than we had anticipated and was not included in the fiscal year 2012 guidance we provided in October.
The single license payment contributed the following to the quarter: Revenue of $39 million reported in our Mainframe Solutions segment and in the software fees and other line on the P&L; GAAP and non-GAAP operating income of $36 million; GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.05; and cash flow of $39 million.
Total revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion and grew 10% in constant currency and as reported. 8 points of this growth was organic, while 2 points of this growth came from acquisitions. This quarter, we saw a $20 million increase in perpetual sales associated with Enterprise Solution products, including $10 million of products that were newly eligible for upfront recognition during the quarter.
From a segment perspective, Mainframe Solution revenue was $682 million, up 9% in constant currency and as reported. The single license payment contributed 6 points of growth in constant currency and as reported to Mainframe Solutions.
Our Enterprise Solutions revenue was $478 million, up 11% in constant currency and 12% as reported. Services revenue was $103 million, up 16% in constant currency and 17% as reported.
Underlying our results for the quarter, total new capacity and new product sales were up low-single digits. In Mainframe Solutions, new product sales for the quarter grew, both with and without single license payment. Capacity sales were down more than 20%. Quarter-to-quarter capacity will fluctuate, driven by the nature of the customers in our underlying renewal portfolio. Year-to-date, we are encouraged by the capacity trends which are up and believe that IBM mainframe is bringing increased attention to the platform and over time, should serve as a slow, steady tailwind to CA Technologies.
Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were down approximately 5%. We saw growth in Virtualization and Automation and Identity and Access Management. This was offset by Service Portfolio Management and Service Assurance. Underneath these Service Assurance results, we saw growth in Application Performance Management that was offset by infrastructure monitoring.  Finally, new service engagements were down slightly year-over-year.
Our renewal yield was just below 90%. We closed one transaction, a merger, that negatively skewed the results during the quarter. Excluding this transaction, the renewal yield would've been in the mid-90s. We continue to expect the 2012 renewal portfolio to be down approximately 15% year-over-year. For modeling purposes, please note that fourth quarter 2012 renewals face a difficult year-over-year comparison. This is due to the more than $500 million system integrator license agreement that was signed last year in our fiscal fourth quarter.
Looking at revenue backlog, current revenue backlog was $3.6 billion, up 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $8.1 billion, up 2% in constant currency and as reported.
From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $475 million, up 21% in constant currency and 23% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. Operating margins for Mainframe Solutions was 59%. Operating margins for Enterprise Solutions was 12%. This includes 4 points of continued investment in this segment. Finally, operating margin for Services was 11%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.65, up 28% in constant currency and 30% as reported, including a year-over-year $0.01 tailwind from currency. This quarter, EPS benefited from previously mentioned license payment, operational improvements and our stock repurchase program.
Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the third quarter of 2012 was 31.5%. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $396 million, down 19% in constant currency and 20% as reported. Single installment payments were $107 million in the third quarter compared to $152 million in the previous period. Total billings backlog of $5 billion was up 7% in constant currency and 6% as reported. DSOs were essentially flat year-over-year.
Moving to third quarter GAAP results, third quarter operating margin before interest and taxes was 33%. GAAP operating income was $413 million, up 22% in constant currency and 24% as reported. And GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.54, up 39% in constant currency and 42% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was 34.9%.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in net cash. Between October 1 and December 31, we purchased approximately 9.6 million shares of stock for a total of approximately $200 million.
Now let me turn to fiscal 2012 guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based on December 31 exchange rates. This includes a partial hedge of operating income and updates our expectations for share count. Guidance is the following: Total revenue growth is now expected to be 6% in constant currency, at the high end of our previous range of 5% to 6%. This translates to reported revenue of $4.8 billion; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 11% to 13%, an increase from our previous range of 7% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.21 to $2.25. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 11% to 13%, an increase from our previous range of 6% to 9%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.86 to $1.90.
We continue to expect that cash flow from operations will grow at 3% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.44 billion to $1.47 billion. Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 31% to 32% in this fiscal year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 463 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 486 million shares. This share count reflects the $500 million ASR under an agreement we expect to execute in the company's fourth quarter. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be a strong 34% for fiscal year 2012. And now, I will turn the call back over to Bill."

The acquisitions we've been making over the last 2 years, many of them now have moved into the organic area and as we've added additional capability to those, those are supporting our organic growth as we go forward and that'll continue into next year. When you look at the segmentation that we talked about in the last quarter, with the 300 additional sales reps were moving out and we're moving into the segmentation area, that growth, new products and new accounts, will add to the organic growth as we go forward. And I think one of the probably key points that's worth looking at in the quarter is that you may recall a year ago when Nimsoft was reporting, we talked about 20 or 30 new accounts. We had over 200 new logos in the quarter. And so, with Nimsoft and with Latin America coming on very strong, now starting to get growth in the Asia countries and a return a bit from EMEA, we're starting to see the organic growth coming out of what we had previously done from the new products and acquisitions, as well as from new segmentation pieces. So as we look forward on the base business, we see organic growth being the way we move next year."

In fact, I think you've seen it in the industry, the IMP's is actually cutting back a little bit in its historical way that it flowed and what we're finding is that we're bringing the Nimsoft piece up as the PMCV [ph] on the other piece goes down and that is, for us, been one of the strength pieces as to the way it's balanced it versus the way the rest of the market, for some of our competitors have worked.

First of all, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your philosophy between the return of shareholder funds in the form of dividends versus buybacks? Obviously, you've been much more skewed towards buybacks historically and that is a very significant increase in the dividend here today. And then just secondly, I wanted to ask, I understand, Rich, what you're saying about there's no need to issue debt here, but I guess my question would be why not? If you look a few years ago, CA had $1 billion more in net cash and $1 billion more in debt. So clearly, there's the flexibility on the balance sheet, and it would give you more flexibility today, including the possibility of an even greater return of cash to shareholders, particularly when the cost of debt is so low. So just wondering if you're targeting a specific debt rating there or really what your thought process is on those 2 issues?"

And we think by having the dividends, it really rewards our shareholders and the partnership we have with them over time. On your second question on why we wouldn't leverage up the balance sheet, that tends to be more of a shorter-term view. If we were to do something like that, it would really be more for a large acquisition or something along those lines which we don not plan on doing at this time. We do not see the advantage of taking on incremental debt, and we are happy with the credit ratings that we currently have."

Thank you for joining us. I hope you have had a chance to review our press releases announcing our third quarter fiscal 2012 earnings and our enhanced capital allocation program. I'll start this afternoon wit",1734,"Thanks, Kelsey and good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining us. I hope you have had a chance to review our press releases announcing our third quarter fiscal 2012 earnings and our enhanced capital allocation program. I'll start this afternoon with a brief overview of our third quarter performance. I'll then talk to you about our capital allocation strategy, which we first discussed with you at Investor Day in July and then indicated in October that we would provide you an update this quarter. I will conclude with a review of our progress driving sales growth and margin expansion. Rich will then provide details on the quarter and guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2012. We'll then take your questions.
In the third quarter, we saw growth in revenue and EPS and operating margin expansion, even after adjusting for a single license payment we received. As noted in our release, the unsolicited early single payment from a software company relates to a license agreement we entered into in connection with a litigation settlement we first announced in February 2009. This payment was not included in annual guidance provided by the company in October because we expected it in fiscal years 2013 and 2014.
Headlines from the quarter, which reflect year-over-year growth rates include: revenue growth of 10% in constant currency and as reported. The license payment added about 3 points to this growth. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, including approximately 2 points from the license payment. Non-GAAP earnings per share growth was 28% in constant currency. The license payment added 10% to this growth. Cash flow from operations, including the license payment, declined 19% in constant currency and 20% as reported. As we had anticipated, cash flow for fiscal 2012 is weighted towards the fourth quarter and this afternoon, we confirmed our cash flow guidance for the year. Our current revenue backlog grew 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported.
While we had a good quarter on many measures and continued to make solid progress against our long-term goals, we know we are not done. We remain focused on executing our strategy and driving further operational improvements, including new product sales, execution in EMEA, greater sales productivity and continued work on our expense structure.
Now let me go to our enhanced capital allocation program, starting with some background. As you recall, in July, we said as part of our long-term guidance, that we expected to return 40% to 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. As I mentioned in October, management and the board were continuing to evaluate ways to optimize our balance sheet, while maintaining the financial flexibility we need to build our business and continue to improve our competitive positioning. We believe our enhanced capital allocation program announced this afternoon puts us on a path to achieving a balanced approach to return more cash to shareholders, while still enabling us to invest in our future. This is a logical extension of the strategic and operational priorities we outlined at Investor Day.
Fundamentally, the dividend increase and share repurchase authorization underscore the board's and management's confidence in the company's long-term business outlook and our ability to generate significant free cash flow on a consistent basis. It is our consistent free cash flow, driven by our current and projected operating performance, that allows us to fund this ongoing return of capital and at the same time, continue to invest in our future to further improve our strategic market position and deliver superior mainframe enterprise and cloud solutions and services to our customers.
Today, we are focused on 3 priorities to build long-term value for CA Technologies customers, employees and shareholders. First, to continue to execute our strategy and improve our operating performance. Second, to provide for a greater return of cash to shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases. And third, to effectively use the balance sheet to return additional cash in the near term through an accelerated buyback.
In summary, we are targeting to return to shareholders approximately $2.5 billion through fiscal year 2014, or about 80% of our expected cumulative free cash flow over that period.
Key elements of the program include: One, an increase in the dividend from an annualized rate of $0.20 per share to $1 per share. That is a yield of approximately 4.5% based on yesterday's closing market price and currently puts our dividend yield at the top of comparable technology companies. The board and management view returning cash to shareholders through dividends as an important component of our overall approach to enhancing shareholder value.
Two, a new $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization through fiscal 2014, including an accelerated repurchase of approximately $500 million under an agreement to be executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Including the accelerated share repurchase and shares repurchased year-to-date, we expect we will have spent approximately $1 billion to buy back shares during fiscal year 2012. The $1.5 billion authorization replaces the approximately $230 million remaining under our current authorization. We are confident we have the balance sheet capacity to get this done and the program is expected to be funded by available U.S. cash.
Three, our strategic plan anticipates that we will continue our investment in the business consistent with that of previous years, or approximately $1 billion annually. This includes acquisition activity in the range of $300 million to $500 million per year, on average, through fiscal 2014 and the approximately $600 million we invest on average each year in organic research and development.
So let me answer the critical question of how we intend to continue to improve execution against our strategic plan. As we've highlighted in this afternoon's capital allocation release, we remain comfortable with the long-term targets for the period ending March 31, 2015, that we provided at Investor Day in July. This includes an acceleration to mid-single digit constant currency organic revenue growth and an expansion of our non-GAAP operating margin by 100 basis points a year. Our expectation is that, over time, much of this operating margin expansion will come from improvements in execution in our Enterprise Solutions segment, driven by accelerating product sales and greater efficiency in our sales force. We intend to continue to drive more growth and more profit from each dollar we invest, and we will continue to systematically improve productivity and efficiency in our organization.
In our second quarter earnings call, we outlined 3 immediate growth initiatives: Expanding product penetration in new accounts and growth geographies; continuing to improve our results in EMEA; and driving consistent performance out of our acquisitions. In terms of product penetration, this past quarter, we focused on 3 main areas.
First, we continued our market segmentation initiative, which as a first step, includes the rebalancing of our sales force to align what has been a highly concentrated coverage model to new opportunities in approximately 1,000 large new enterprise accounts and approximately 7,000 accounts in the midmarket. Focus in these groups on sales of new products to new customers, our market segmentation effort is designed to drive product penetration in new accounts and accelerate performance of our acquisitions.
Second, we told you we expect to add an incremental 300 new quota-carrying sales reps globally by year end. 1/3 of these resources will be new to CA Technologies, while 2/3 reflect a reallocation of existing internal resources. All of this will be accomplished under our current expense profile. At this point, we are approximately halfway through this process and expect to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter.
Finally, we have continued to make significant investments in growth geographies. These are long-term investments in markets that are key to accelerating new product sales and our ongoing success in the years to come. This quarter, we had excellent results in Latin America, where we added more than 30 new enterprise customers to the region and expanded our footprint in more than 60 current customers. In Asia Pacific, we added more than 30 new logos to the region, including 15 for Nimsoft. Growth in new product sales more than doubled in China and grew more than 40% in Korea.
Next in EMEA. We believe the team we have in place is introducing the right discipline and incentive structure to keep both our renewals process and new business pipeline on track. Our plan is focused on improving sales execution and productivity, driving marketing and brand awareness and developing our people. While we do not want to get ahead of ourselves, we were pleased to see modest revenue growth in EMEA this quarter and wins with Volkswagen, SAP, Daimler and Crédit Agricole.
Lastly, with respect to acquisitions, we believe our strategy to aggressively capitalize on the evolution of virtualization management, cloud computing implementation and SaaS delivery of IT is working. We continue to focus on driving results from investments we have made, both through organic development and in companies such as Nimsoft, 3Tera AppLogic, ITKO and Arcot. Results achieved during the quarter give us confidence that our strategy to reach new customers and the midmarket is the right one. This quarter, Nimsoft added a record 100 new logos and in December, we received notification that Net One Systems formally selected Nimsoft to be their platform of choice for their future business services for their XOC managed operations center, one of the largest in Japan.
We closed a significant transaction with IGT, which selected AppLogic to continue innovating how casino games, systems and experiences are delivered with the IGT cloud.
ITKO delivered a record quarter, closed 5 deals over $1 million and saw their average transaction size significantly increase. Customers like DIRECTV and SoCal Edison report return on their investment in ITKO in terms of weeks and continued to expand their usage and licenses.
Finally, Arcot is protecting approximately 150 million identities worldwide. During the 2011 holiday shopping season, we averaged 1 million transactions per day for our e-commerce authentication on our SaaS platform.
In conclusion, the strategic initiatives and priorities we continue to pursue, in combination with our enhanced capital allocation program, reflect the ongoing commitment of the CA Technologies board, management and employees to deliver outstanding solutions and services to our customers and attractive, sustainable returns to CA shareholders.
Now I will turn the call over to Rich for a closer look at the third quarter."

Turning to our third quarter results, please note that our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated and all results are from continuing operations.

Turning to our third quarter results, please note that our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated and all results are from continuing operations. As Bill mentioned, this quarter's result include the single license payment from the software company. This payment came in earlier than we had anticipated and was not included in the fiscal year 2012 guidance we provided in October.
The single license payment contributed the following to the quarter: revenue of $39 million reported in our Mainframe Solutions segment and in the Software, Fees and Other line on the P&L; GAAP and non-GAAP operating income of $36 million; GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.05; and cash flow of $39 million.
Total revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion and grew 10% in constant currency and as reported. 8 points of this growth was organic, while 2 points of this growth came from acquisitions. This quarter, we saw a $20 million increase in perpetual sales associated with Enterprise Solution products, including $10 million of products that were newly eligible for upfront recognition during the quarter.
From a segment perspective, Mainframe Solution revenue was $682 million, up 9% in constant currency and as reported. The single license payment contributed 6 points of growth in constant currency and as reported to Mainframe Solutions.
Our Enterprise Solutions revenue was $478 million, up 11% in constant currency and 12% as reported. Services revenue was $103 million, up 16% in constant currency and 17% as reported.
Underlying our results for the quarter, total new capacity and new product sales were up low-single digits. In Mainframe Solutions, new product sales for the quarter grew, both with and without single license payment. Capacity sales were down more than 20%. Quarter-to-quarter capacity will fluctuate, driven by the nature of the customers in our underlying renewal portfolio. Year-to-date, we are encouraged by the capacity trends which are up and believe that IBM Mainframe is bringing increased attention to the platform and over time, should serve as a slow, steady tailwind to CA Technologies.
Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were down approximately 5%. We saw growth in Virtualization and Automation and Identity and Access Management. This was offset by Service Portfolio Management and Service Assurance. Underneath these Service Assurance results, we saw growth in Application Performance Management that was offset by infrastructure monitoring.  Finally, new service engagements were down slightly year-over-year.
Our renewal yield was just below 90%. We closed one transaction, a merger, that negatively skewed the results during the quarter. Excluding this transaction, the renewal yield would have been in the mid-90s. We continue to expect the 2012 renewal portfolio to be down approximately 15% year-over-year. For modeling purposes, please note that fourth quarter 2012 renewals face a difficult year-over-year comparison. This is due to a more than $500 million system integrator license agreement that was signed last year in our fiscal fourth quarter.
Looking at revenue backlog. Current revenue backlog was $3.6 billion, up 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $8.1 billion, up 2% in constant currency and as reported.
From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $475 million, up 21% in constant currency and 23% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. Operating margins for Mainframe Solutions was 59%. Operating margins for Enterprise Solutions was 12%. This includes 4 points of continued investment in this segment. Finally, operating margin for Services was 11%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.65, up 28% in constant currency and 30% as reported, including a year-over-year $0.01 tailwind from currency. This quarter, EPS benefited from the previously mentioned license payment, operational improvements and our stock repurchase program.
Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the third quarter of 2012 was 31.5%. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $396 million, down 19% in constant currency and 20% as reported. Single installment payments were $107 million in the third quarter compared to $152 million in the previous period. Total billings backlog of $5 billion was up 7% in constant currency and 6% as reported. DSOs were essentially flat year-over-year.
Moving to third quarter GAAP results, third quarter operating margin before interest and taxes was 33%. GAAP operating income was $413 million, up 22% in constant currency and 24% as reported. And GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.54, up 39% in constant currency and 42% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was 34.9%.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in net cash. Between October 1 and December 31, we purchased approximately 9.6 million shares of stock for a total of approximately $200 million.
Now let me turn to fiscal 2012 guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based on December 31 exchange rates. This includes a partial hedge of operating income and updates our expectations for share count. Guidance is the following: total revenue growth is now expected to be 6% in constant currency, at the high end of our previous range of 5% to 6%. This translates to reported revenue of $4.8 billion; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 11% to 13%, an increase from our previous range of 7% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.21 to $2.25. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 11% to 13%, an increase from our previous range of 6% to 9%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.86 to $1.90.
We continue to expect that cash flow from operations will grow at 3% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.44 billion to $1.47 billion. Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 31% to 32% in this fiscal year.

When you look at the segmentation that we talked about in the last quarter, with the 300 additional sales reps we're moving out and we're moving into the segmentation area, that growth, new products and new accounts, will add to the organic growth as we go forward. And I think one of the probably key points that's worth looking at in the quarter is that you may recall a year ago when Nimsoft was reporting, we talked about 20 or 30 new accounts. We had over 200 new logos in the quarter. And so, with Nimsoft and with Latin America coming on very strong, now starting to get growth in the Asia countries and a return a bit from EMEA, we're starting to see the organic growth coming out of what we had previously done from the new products and acquisitions, as well as from new segmentation pieces.

It will all be predominantly in the Enterprise Solutions segment, as we talked about back in July, and you see us continuing to demonstrate efficiencies that we're able to work through the business in all elements. So sales will become more efficient. We talked about the 300 people that by Q1 will have moved out of overlay positions into quota carrying. So that drives your sales E/R.

If you look a few years ago, CA had $1 billion more in net cash and $1 billion more in debt. So clearly, there's the flexibility on the balance sheet, and it would give you more flexibility today, including the possibility of an even greater return of cash to shareholders, particularly when the cost of debt is so low. So just wondering if you're targeting a specific debt rating there or really what your thought process is on those 2 issues?"

So the first piece, the increase today in the amounts really underscores our confidence in our ability to do -- have a very strong long-term business outlook and our ability to generate cash over the long term, which is going to be given out via dividends. And we think by having the dividends, it really rewards our shareholders and the partnership we have with them over time. On your second question on why we wouldn't leverage up the balance sheet, that tends to be more of a shorter-term view. If we were to do something like that, it would really be more for a very large acquisition or something along those lines which we do not plan on doing at this time. We do not see the advantage of taking on incremental debt, and we are happy with the credit ratings that we currently have."

I hope you have had a chance to review our press releases announcing our third quarter fiscal 2012 earnings and our enhanced capital allocation program. I'll start this afternoon with a brief overview of our third quarter performance. I'll then talk to you about our capital allocation strategy, which we first discussed with you at Investor Day in July and then indicated in October that we would provide you an update this quarter. I will conclude with a review of our progress driving sales growth and margin expansion. Rich will then provide details on the quarter and guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2012. We'll then take your questions.
In the third quarter, we saw growth in revenue and EPS and operating margin expansion, even after adjusting for a single license payment we received. As noted in our release, the unsolicited early single payment from a software company relates to a license agreement we entered into in connection with a litigation settlement we first announced in February 2009. This payment was not included in annual guidance provided by the company in October because we expected it in fiscal years 2013 and 2014.
Headlines from the quarter, which reflect year-over-year growth rates include: revenue growth of 10% in constant currency and as reported. The license payment added about 3 points to this growth. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, including approximately 2 points from the license payment. Non-GAAP earnings per share growth was 28% in constant currency. The license payment added 10% to this growth. Cash flow from operations, including the license payment, declined 19% in constant currency and 20% as reported. As we had anticipated, cash flow for fiscal 2012 is weighted towards the fourth quarter and this afternoon, we confirmed our cash flow guidance for the year. Our current revenue backlog grew 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported.
While we had a good quarter on many measures and continued to make solid progress against our long-term goals, we know we are not done. We remain focused on executing our strategy and driving further operational improvements, including new product sales, execution in EMEA, greater sales productivity and continued work on our expense structure.
Now let me go to our enhanced capital allocation program, starting with some background. As you recall, in July, we said as part of our long-term guidance, that we expected to return 40% to 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. As I mentioned in October, management and the board were continuing to evaluate ways to optimize our balance sheet, while maintaining the financial flexibility we need to build our business and continue to improve our competitive positioning. We believe our enhanced capital allocation program announced this afternoon puts us on a path to achieving a balanced approach to return more cash to shareholders, while still enabling us to invest in our future. This is a logical extension of the strategic and operational priorities we outlined at Investor Day.
Fundamentally, the dividend increase and share repurchase authorization underscore the board's and management's confidence in the company's long-term business outlook and our ability to generate significant free cash flow on a consistent basis. It is our consistent free cash flow, driven by our current and projected operating performance, that allows us to fund this ongoing return of capital and at the same time, continue to invest in our future to further improve our strategic market position and deliver superior mainframe enterprise and cloud solutions and services to our customers.
Today, we are focused on 3 priorities to build long-term value for CA Technologies customers, employees and shareholders. First, to continue to execute our strategy and improve our operating performance. Second, to provide for a greater return of cash to shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases. And third, to effectively use the balance sheet to return additional cash in the near term through an accelerated buyback.
In summary, we are targeting to return to shareholders approximately $2.5 billion through fiscal year 2014, or about 80% of our expected cumulative free cash flow over that period.
Key elements of the program include: One, an increase in the dividend from an annualized rate of $0.20 per share to $1 per share. That is a yield of approximately 4.5% based on yesterday's closing market price and currently puts our dividend yield at the top of comparable technology companies. The board and management view returning cash to shareholders through dividends as an important component of our overall approach to enhancing shareholder value.
Two, a new $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization through fiscal 2014, including an accelerated repurchase of approximately $500 million under an agreement to be executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Including the accelerated share repurchase and shares repurchased year-to-date, we expect we will have spent approximately $1 billion to buy back shares during fiscal year 2012. The $1.5 billion authorization replaces the approximately $230 million remaining under our current authorization. We are confident we have the balance sheet capacity to get this done and the program is expected to be funded by available U.S. cash.
Three, our strategic plan anticipates that we will continue our investment in the business consistent with that of previous years, or approximately $1 billion annually. This includes acquisition activity in the range of $300 million to $500 million per year, on average, through fiscal 2014 and the approximately $600 million we invest on average each year in organic research and development.
So let me answer the critical question of how we intend to continue to improve execution against our strategic plan. As we've highlighted in this afternoon's capital allocation release, we remain comfortable with the long-term targets for the period ending March 31, 2015, that we provided at Investor Day in July. This includes an acceleration to mid-single digit constant currency organic revenue growth and an expansion of our non-GAAP operating margin by 100 basis points a year. Our expectation is that, over time, much of this operating margin expansion will come from improvements in execution in our Enterprise Solutions segment, driven by accelerating product sales and greater efficiency in our sales force. We intend to continue to drive more growth and more profit from each dollar we invest, and we will continue to systematically improve productivity and efficiency in our organization.
In our second quarter earnings call, we outlined 3 immediate growth initiatives: Expanding product penetration in new accounts and growth geographies; continuing to improve our results in EMEA; and driving consistent performance out of our acquisitions. In terms of product penetration, this past quarter, we focused on 3 main areas.
First, we continued our market segmentation initiative, which as a first step, includes the rebalancing of our sales force to align what has been a highly concentrated coverage model to new opportunities in approximately 1,000 large new enterprise accounts and approximately 7,000 accounts in the midmarket. Focus in these groups on sales of new products to new customers, our market segmentation effort is designed to drive product penetration in new accounts and accelerate performance of our acquisitions.
Second, we told you we expect to add an incremental 300 new quota-carrying sales reps globally by year end. 1/3 of these resources will be new to CA Technologies, while 2/3 reflect a reallocation of existing internal resources. All of this will be accomplished under our current expense profile. At this point, we are approximately halfway through this process and expect to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter.
Finally, we have continued to make significant investments in growth geographies. These are long-term investments in markets that are key to accelerating new product sales and our ongoing success in the years to come. This quarter, we had excellent results in Latin America, where we added more than 30 new enterprise customers to the region and expanded our footprint in more than 60 current customers. In Asia Pacific, we added more than 30 new logos to the region, including 15 for Nimsoft. Growth in new product sales more than doubled in China and grew more than 40% in Korea.
Next in EMEA. We believe the team we have in place is introducing the right discipline and incentive structure to keep both our renewals process and new business pipeline on track. Our plan is focused on improving sales execution and productivity, driving marketing and brand awareness and developing our people. While we do not want to get ahead of ourselves, we were pleased to see modest revenue growth in EMEA this quarter and wins with Volkswagen, SAP, Daimler and Crédit Agricole.
Lastly, with respect to acquisitions, we believe our strategy to aggressively capitalize on the evolution of virtualization management, cloud computing implementation and SaaS delivery of IT is working. We continue to focus on driving results from investments we have made, both through organic development and in companies such as Nimsoft, 3Tera AppLogic, ITKO and Arcot. Results achieved during the quarter give us confidence that our strategy to reach new customers and the midmarket is the right one. This quarter, Nimsoft added a record 100 new logos and in December, we received notification that Net One Systems formally selected Nimsoft to be their platform of choice for their future business services for their XOC managed operations center, one of the largest in Japan.
We closed a significant transaction with IGT, which selected AppLogic to continue innovating how casino games, systems and experiences are delivered with the IGT cloud.
ITKO delivered a record quarter, closed 5 deals over $1 million and saw their average transaction size significantly increase. Customers like DIRECTV and SoCal Edison report return on their investment in ITKO in terms of weeks and continued to expand their usage and licenses.
Finally, Arcot is protecting approximately 150 million identities worldwide. During the 2011 holiday shopping season, we averaged 1 million transactions per day for our e-commerce authentication on our SaaS platform.
In conclusion, the strategic initiatives and priorities we continue to pursue, in combination with our enhanced capital allocation program, reflect the ongoing commitment of the CA Technologies board, management and employees to deliver outstanding solutions and services to our customers and attractive, sustainable returns to CA shareholders.
Now I will turn the call over to Rich for a closer look at the third quarter."

Turning to our third quarter results, please note that our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated and all results are from continuing operations.

Turning to our third quarter results, please note that our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated and all results are from continuing operations. As Bill mentioned, this quarter's result include the single license payment from the software company. This payment came in earlier than we had anticipated and was not included in the fiscal year 2012 guidance we provided in October.
The single license payment contributed the following to the quarter: revenue of $39 million reported in our Mainframe Solutions segment and in the Software, Fees and Other line on the P&L; GAAP and non-GAAP operating income of $36 million; GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.05; and cash flow of $39 million.
Total revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion and grew 10% in constant currency and as reported. 8 points of this growth was organic, while 2 points of this growth came from acquisitions. This quarter, we saw a $20 million increase in perpetual sales associated with Enterprise Solution products, including $10 million of products that were newly eligible for upfront recognition during the quarter.
From a segment perspective, Mainframe Solution revenue was $682 million, up 9% in constant currency and as reported. The single license payment contributed 6 points of growth in constant currency and as reported to Mainframe Solutions.
Our Enterprise Solutions revenue was $478 million, up 11% in constant currency and 12% as reported. Services revenue was $103 million, up 16% in constant currency and 17% as reported.
Underlying our results for the quarter, total new capacity and new product sales were up low-single digits. In Mainframe Solutions, new product sales for the quarter grew, both with and without single license payment. Capacity sales were down more than 20%. Quarter-to-quarter capacity will fluctuate, driven by the nature of the customers in our underlying renewal portfolio. Year-to-date, we are encouraged by the capacity trends which are up and believe that IBM Mainframe is bringing increased attention to the platform and over time, should serve as a slow, steady tailwind to CA Technologies.
Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were down approximately 5%. We saw growth in Virtualization and Automation and Identity and Access Management. This was offset by Service Portfolio Management and Service Assurance. Underneath these Service Assurance results, we saw growth in Application Performance Management that was offset by infrastructure monitoring.  Finally, new service engagements were down slightly year-over-year.
Our renewal yield was just below 90%. We closed one transaction, a merger, that negatively skewed the results during the quarter. Excluding this transaction, the renewal yield would have been in the mid-90s. We continue to expect the 2012 renewal portfolio to be down approximately 15% year-over-year. For modeling purposes, please note that fourth quarter 2012 renewals face a difficult year-over-year comparison. This is due to a more than $500 million system integrator license agreement that was signed last year in our fiscal fourth quarter.
Looking at revenue backlog. Current revenue backlog was $3.6 billion, up 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $8.1 billion, up 2% in constant currency and as reported.
From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $475 million, up 21% in constant currency and 23% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. Operating margins for Mainframe Solutions was 59%. Operating margins for Enterprise Solutions was 12%. This includes 4 points of continued investment in this segment. Finally, operating margin for Services was 11%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.65, up 28% in constant currency and 30% as reported, including a year-over-year $0.01 tailwind from currency. This quarter, EPS benefited from the previously mentioned license payment, operational improvements and our stock repurchase program.
Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the third quarter of 2012 was 31.5%. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $396 million, down 19% in constant currency and 20% as reported. Single installment payments were $107 million in the third quarter compared to $152 million in the previous period. Total billings backlog of $5 billion was up 7% in constant currency and 6% as reported. DSOs were essentially flat year-over-year.
Moving to third quarter GAAP results, third quarter operating margin before interest and taxes was 33%. GAAP operating income was $413 million, up 22% in constant currency and 24% as reported. And GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.54, up 39% in constant currency and 42% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was 34.9%.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in net cash. Between October 1 and December 31, we purchased approximately 9.6 million shares of stock for a total of approximately $200 million.
Now let me turn to fiscal 2012 guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based on December 31 exchange rates. This includes a partial hedge of operating income and updates our expectations for share count. Guidance is the following: total revenue growth is now expected to be 6% in constant currency, at the high end of our previous range of 5% to 6%. This translates to reported revenue of $4.8 billion; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 11% to 13%, an increase from our previous range of 7% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.21 to $2.25. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 11% to 13%, an increase from our previous range of 6% to 9%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.86 to $1.90.
We continue to expect that cash flow from operations will grow at 3% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.44 billion to $1.47 billion. Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 31% to 32% in this fiscal year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 463 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 486 million shares. This share count reflects the $500 million ASR under an agreement we expect to execute in the company's fourth quarter. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be a strong 34% for fiscal year 2012. And now, I will turn the call back over to Bill."

The acquisitions we've been making over the last 2 years, many of them now have moved into the organic area and as we've added additional capability to those, those are supporting our organic growth as we go forward and that'll continue into next year. When you look at the segmentation that we talked about in the last quarter, with the 300 additional sales reps we're moving out and we're moving into the segmentation area, that growth, new products and new accounts, will add to the organic growth as we go forward. And I think one of the probably key points that's worth looking at in the quarter is that you may recall a year ago when Nimsoft was reporting, we talked about 20 or 30 new accounts. We had over 200 new logos in the quarter. And so, with Nimsoft and with Latin America coming on very strong, now starting to get growth in the Asia countries and a return a bit from EMEA, we're starting to see the organic growth coming out of what we had previously done from the new products and acquisitions, as well as from new segmentation pieces.

And therefore, you move more of your products to the perpetual license that's accounted for in the SFO line. From a new sales standpoint, I think the way we would tell you is, we were pleased with our Virtualization and Automation, Identity and Access Management. Service Assurance was mixed, where we had good growth in Application Performance Management and that was offset a bit by Infrastructure Monitoring. And we had a decline in Service Portfolio Management. So it was mixed. But in general, we had some very good bright spots.

We don't want to get ahead of ourselves as Bill had said earlier. On your first part of the question, most of the improvements we'll see next year, we continue to make improvements on G&A. It will all be predominantly in the Enterprise Solutions segment, as we talked about back in July, and you see us continuing to demonstrate efficiencies that we're able to work through the business in all elements. So sales will become more efficient. We talked about the 300 people that by Q1 will have moved out of overlay positions into quota carrying. So that drives your sales E/R. Our development E/R, we think, is actually set fairly well. So we're not looking to do much to the sales here. We would always continue to make improvements to the G&A line.

In fact, I think you've seen it in the industry, the IM piece is actually cutting back a little bit in its historical way that it flowed and what we're finding is that we're bringing the Nimsoft piece up as the PMCV [ph] on the other piece goes down and that is, for us, been one of the strength pieces as to the way it's balanced it versus the way the rest of the market for some of our competitors have worked. The second thing is and probably very importantly, the acquisition of ITKO adds significantly to that.

First of all, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your philosophy between the return of shareholder funds in the form of dividends versus buybacks?

And then just secondly, I wanted to ask, I understand, Rich, what you're saying about there's no need to issue debt here, but I guess my question would be why not? If you look a few years ago, CA had $1 billion more in net cash and $1 billion more in debt. So clearly, there's the flexibility on the balance sheet, and it would give you more flexibility today, including the possibility of an even greater return of cash to shareholders, particularly when the cost of debt is so low. So just wondering if you're targeting a specific debt rating there or really what your thought process is on those 2 issues?"

On your second question on why we wouldn't leverage up the balance sheet, that tends to be more of a shorter-term view.

I'll start this afternoon with a brief overview of our third quarter performance. I'll then talk to you about our capital allocation strategy, which we first discussed with you at Investor Day in July and then indicated in October that we would provide you an update this quarter. I will conclude with a review of our progress driving sales growth and margin expansion. Rich will then provide details on the quarter and guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2012. We'll then take your questions.
In the third quarter, we saw growth in revenue and EPS and operating margin expansion, even after adjusting for a single license payment we received. As noted in our release, the unsolicited early single payment from a software company relates to a license agreement we entered into in connection with a litigation settlement we first announced in February 2009. This payment was not included in annual guidance provided by the company in October because we expected it in fiscal years 2013 and 2014.
Headlines from the quarter, which reflect year-over-year growth rates include: revenue growth of 10% in constant currency and as reported. The license payment added about 3 points to this growth. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, including approximately 2 points from the license payment. Non-GAAP earnings per share growth was 28% in constant currency. The license payment added 10% to this growth. Cash flow from operations, including the license payment, declined 19% in constant currency and 20% as reported. As we had anticipated, cash flow for fiscal 2012 is weighted towards the fourth quarter and this afternoon, we confirmed our cash flow guidance for the year. Our current revenue backlog grew 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported.
While we had a good quarter on many measures and continued to make solid progress against our long-term goals, we know we are not done. We remain focused on executing our strategy and driving further operational improvements, including new product sales, execution in EMEA, greater sales productivity and continued work on our expense structure.
Now let me go to our enhanced capital allocation program, starting with some background. As you recall, in July, we said as part of our long-term guidance, that we expected to return 40% to 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. As I mentioned in October, management and the board were continuing to evaluate ways to optimize our balance sheet, while maintaining the financial flexibility we need to build our business and continue to improve our competitive positioning. We believe our enhanced capital allocation program announced this afternoon puts us on a path to achieving a balanced approach to return more cash to shareholders, while still enabling us to invest in our future. This is a logical extension of the strategic and operational priorities we outlined at Investor Day.
Fundamentally, the dividend increase and share repurchase authorization underscore the board's and management's confidence in the company's long-term business outlook and our ability to generate significant free cash flow on a consistent basis. It is our consistent free cash flow, driven by our current and projected operating performance, that allows us to fund this ongoing return of capital and at the same time, continue to invest in our future to further improve our strategic market position and deliver superior mainframe enterprise and cloud solutions and services to our customers.
Today, we are focused on 3 priorities to build long-term value for CA Technologies customers, employees and shareholders. First, to continue to execute our strategy and improve our operating performance. Second, to provide for a greater return of cash to shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases. And third, to effectively use the balance sheet to return additional cash in the near term through an accelerated buyback.
In summary, we are targeting to return to shareholders approximately $2.5 billion through fiscal year 2014, or about 80% of our expected cumulative free cash flow over that period.
Key elements of the program include: One, an increase in the dividend from an annualized rate of $0.20 per share to $1 per share. That is a yield of approximately 4.5% based on yesterday's closing market price and currently puts our dividend yield at the top of comparable technology companies. The board and management view returning cash to shareholders through dividends as an important component of our overall approach to enhancing shareholder value.
Two, a new $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization through fiscal 2014, including an accelerated repurchase of approximately $500 million under an agreement to be executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Including the accelerated share repurchase and shares repurchased year-to-date, we expect we will have spent approximately $1 billion to buy back shares during fiscal year 2012. The $1.5 billion authorization replaces the approximately $230 million remaining under our current authorization. We are confident we have the balance sheet capacity to get this done and the program is expected to be funded by available U.S. cash.
Three, our strategic plan anticipates that we will continue our investment in the business consistent with that of previous years, or approximately $1 billion annually. This includes acquisition activity in the range of $300 million to $500 million per year, on average, through fiscal 2014 and the approximately $600 million we invest on average each year in organic research and development.
So let me answer the critical question of how we intend to continue to improve execution against our strategic plan. As we've highlighted in this afternoon's capital allocation release, we remain comfortable with the long-term targets for the period ending March 31, 2015, that we provided at Investor Day in July. This includes an acceleration to mid-single digit constant currency organic revenue growth and an expansion of our non-GAAP operating margin by 100 basis points a year. Our expectation is that, over time, much of this operating margin expansion will come from improvements in execution in our Enterprise Solutions segment, driven by accelerating product sales and greater efficiency in our sales force. We intend to continue to drive more growth and more profit from each dollar we invest, and we will continue to systematically improve productivity and efficiency in our organization.
In our second quarter earnings call, we outlined 3 immediate growth initiatives: Expanding product penetration in new accounts and growth geographies; continuing to improve our results in EMEA; and driving consistent performance out of our acquisitions. In terms of product penetration, this past quarter, we focused on 3 main areas.
First, we continued our market segmentation initiative, which as a first step, includes the rebalancing of our sales force to align what has been a highly concentrated coverage model to new opportunities in approximately 1,000 large new enterprise accounts and approximately 7,000 accounts in the midmarket. Focus in these groups on sales of new products to new customers, our market segmentation effort is designed to drive product penetration in new accounts and accelerate performance of our acquisitions.
Second, we told you we expect to add an incremental 300 new quota-carrying sales reps globally by year end. 1/3 of these resources will be new to CA Technologies, while 2/3 reflect a reallocation of existing internal resources. All of this will be accomplished under our current expense profile. At this point, we are approximately halfway through this process and expect to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter.
Finally, we have continued to make significant investments in growth geographies. These are long-term investments in markets that are key to accelerating new product sales and our ongoing success in the years to come. This quarter, we had excellent results in Latin America, where we added more than 30 new enterprise customers to the region and expanded our footprint in more than 60 current customers. In Asia Pacific, we added more than 30 new logos to the region, including 15 for Nimsoft. Growth in new product sales more than doubled in China and grew more than 40% in Korea.
Next in EMEA. We believe the team we have in place is introducing the right discipline and incentive structure to keep both our renewals process and new business pipeline on track. Our plan is focused on improving sales execution and productivity, driving marketing and brand awareness and developing our people. While we do not want to get ahead of ourselves, we were pleased to see modest revenue growth in EMEA this quarter and wins with Volkswagen, SAP, Daimler and Crédit Agricole.
Lastly, with respect to acquisitions, we believe our strategy to aggressively capitalize on the evolution of virtualization management, cloud computing implementation and SaaS delivery of IT is working. We continue to focus on driving results from investments we have made, both through organic development and in companies such as Nimsoft, 3Tera AppLogic, ITKO and Arcot. Results achieved during the quarter give us confidence that our strategy to reach new customers and the midmarket is the right one. This quarter, Nimsoft added a record 100 new logos and in December, we received notification that Net One Systems formally selected Nimsoft to be their platform of choice for their future business services for their XOC managed operations center, one of the largest in Japan.
We closed a significant transaction with IGT, which selected AppLogic to continue innovating how casino games, systems and experiences are delivered with the IGT cloud.
ITKO delivered a record quarter, closed 5 deals over $1 million and saw their average transaction size significantly increase. Customers like DIRECTV and SoCal Edison report return on their investment in ITKO in terms of weeks and continued to expand their usage and licenses.
Finally, Arcot is protecting approximately 150 million identities worldwide. During the 2011 holiday shopping season, we averaged 1 million transactions per day for our e-commerce authentication on our SaaS platform.
In conclusion, the strategic initiatives and priorities we continue to pursue, in combination with our enhanced capital allocation program, reflect the ongoing commitment of the CA Technologies board, management and employees to deliver outstanding solutions and services to our customers and attractive, sustainable returns to CA shareholders.
Now I will turn the call over to Rich for a closer look at the third quarter."

Turning to our third quarter results, please note that our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated and all results are from continuing operations. As Bill mentioned, this quarter's result include the single license paym",1070,"Thank you, Bill. Turning to our third quarter results, please note that our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated and all results are from continuing operations. As Bill mentioned, this quarter's result include the single license payment from the software company. This payment came in earlier than we had anticipated and was not included in the fiscal year 2012 guidance we provided in October.
The single license payment contributed the following to the quarter: revenue of $39 million reported in our Mainframe Solutions segment and in the Software, Fees and Other line on the P&L; GAAP and non-GAAP operating income of $36 million; GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.05; and cash flow of $39 million.
Total revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion and grew 10% in constant currency and as reported. 8 points of this growth was organic, while 2 points of this growth came from acquisitions. This quarter, we saw a $20 million increase in perpetual sales associated with Enterprise Solution products, including $10 million of products that were newly eligible for upfront recognition during the quarter.
From a segment perspective, Mainframe Solution revenue was $682 million, up 9% in constant currency and as reported. The single license payment contributed 6 points of growth in constant currency and as reported to Mainframe Solutions.
Our Enterprise Solutions revenue was $478 million, up 11% in constant currency and 12% as reported. Services revenue was $103 million, up 16% in constant currency and 17% as reported.
Underlying our results for the quarter, total new capacity and new product sales were up low-single digits. In Mainframe Solutions, new product sales for the quarter grew, both with and without single license payment. Capacity sales were down more than 20%. Quarter-to-quarter capacity will fluctuate, driven by the nature of the customers in our underlying renewal portfolio. Year-to-date, we are encouraged by the capacity trends which are up and believe that IBM Mainframe is bringing increased attention to the platform and over time, should serve as a slow, steady tailwind to CA Technologies.
Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were down approximately 5%. We saw growth in Virtualization and Automation and Identity and Access Management. This was offset by Service Portfolio Management and Service Assurance. Underneath these Service Assurance results, we saw growth in Application Performance Management that was offset by infrastructure monitoring.  Finally, new service engagements were down slightly year-over-year.
Our renewal yield was just below 90%. We closed one transaction, a merger, that negatively skewed the results during the quarter. Excluding this transaction, the renewal yield would have been in the mid-90s. We continue to expect the 2012 renewal portfolio to be down approximately 15% year-over-year. For modeling purposes, please note that fourth quarter 2012 renewals face a difficult year-over-year comparison. This is due to a more than $500 million system integrator license agreement that was signed last year in our fiscal fourth quarter.
Looking at revenue backlog. Current revenue backlog was $3.6 billion, up 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $8.1 billion, up 2% in constant currency and as reported.
From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $475 million, up 21% in constant currency and 23% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. Operating margins for Mainframe Solutions was 59%. Operating margins for Enterprise Solutions was 12%. This includes 4 points of continued investment in this segment. Finally, operating margin for Services was 11%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.65, up 28% in constant currency and 30% as reported, including a year-over-year $0.01 tailwind from currency. This quarter, EPS benefited from the previously mentioned license payment, operational improvements and our stock repurchase program.
Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the third quarter of 2012 was 31.5%. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $396 million, down 19% in constant currency and 20% as reported. Single installment payments were $107 million in the third quarter compared to $152 million in the previous period. Total billings backlog of $5 billion was up 7% in constant currency and 6% as reported. DSOs were essentially flat year-over-year.
Moving to third quarter GAAP results, third quarter operating margin before interest and taxes was 33%. GAAP operating income was $413 million, up 22% in constant currency and 24% as reported. And GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.54, up 39% in constant currency and 42% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was 34.9%.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in net cash. Between October 1 and December 31, we purchased approximately 9.6 million shares of stock for a total of approximately $200 million.
Now let me turn to fiscal 2012 guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based on December 31 exchange rates. This includes a partial hedge of operating income and updates our expectations for share count. Guidance is the following: total revenue growth is now expected to be 6% in constant currency, at the high end of our previous range of 5% to 6%. This translates to reported revenue of $4.8 billion; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 11% to 13%, an increase from our previous range of 7% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.21 to $2.25. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 11% to 13%, an increase from our previous range of 6% to 9%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.86 to $1.90.
We continue to expect that cash flow from operations will grow at 3% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.44 billion to $1.47 billion. Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 31% to 32% in this fiscal year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 463 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 486 million shares. This share count reflects the $500 million ASR under an agreement we expect to execute in the company's fourth quarter. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be a strong 34% for fiscal year 2012. And now, I will turn the call back over to Bill."

The acquisitions we've been making over the last 2 years, many of them now have moved into the organic area and as we've added additional capability to those, those are supporting our organic growth as we go forward and that'll continue into next year. When you look at the segmentation that we talked about in the last quarter, with the 300 additional sales reps we're moving out and we're moving into the segmentation area, that growth, new products and new accounts, will add to the organic growth as we go forward. And I think one of the probably key points that's worth looking at in the quarter is that you may recall a year ago when Nimsoft was reporting, we talked about 20 or 30 new accounts. We had over 200 new logos in the quarter. And so, with Nimsoft and with Latin America coming on very strong, now starting to get growth in the Asia countries and a return a bit from EMEA, we're starting to see the organic growth coming out of what we had previously done from the new products and acquisitions, as well as from new segmentation pieces.

The single license payment added a little under 1 point of revenue growth, which allowed us to move ourselves up to the high end of guidance. That will probably be a strong 6%, just so people understand where that sits. We thought that it was prudent to keep it within the top end of the range due to the macro environment. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves as Bill had said earlier. On your first part of the question, most of the improvements we'll see next year, we continue to make improvements on G&A. It will all be predominantly in the Enterprise Solutions segment, as we talked about back in July, and you see us continuing to demonstrate efficiencies that we're able to work through the business in all elements. So sales will become more efficient. We talked about the 300 people that by Q1 will have moved out of overlay positions into quota carrying. So that drives your sales E/R. Our development E/R, we think, is actually set fairly well. So we're not looking to do much to the sales here. We would always continue to make improvements to the G&A line. The G&A line of course will benefit all segments."

The second thing is and probably very importantly, the acquisition of ITKO adds significantly to that.

First of all, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your philosophy between the return of shareholder funds in the form of dividends versus buybacks?

And then just secondly, I wanted to ask, I understand, Rich, what you're saying about there's no need to issue debt here, but I guess my question would be why not? If you look a few years ago, CA had $1 billion more in net cash and $1 billion more in debt. So clearly, there's the flexibility on the balance sheet, and it would give you more flexibility today, including the possibility of an even greater return of cash to shareholders, particularly when the cost of debt is so low. So just wondering if you're targeting a specific debt rating there or really what your thought process is on those 2 issues?"

On your second question on why we wouldn't leverage up the balance sheet, that tends to be more of a shorter-term view. If we were to do something like that, it would really be more for a very large acquisition or something along those lines which we do not plan on doing at this time.

I'll then update you on fiscal 2013 priorities, which will provide you details on full-year performance, the quarter and guidance for fiscal 2013 and then we'll then take questions. 
Nearly 3 years ago, we set a strategy aimed at helping customers gain the most from their existing IT investments while at the same time benefiting from new technologies and business services that deliver a competitive advantage. We made a series of strategic acquisitions and significant investments in development to produce a portfolio of solutions and services that leverage our heritage in IT management. We also continued to invest in new routes to market and enhanced our presence in geographies with growth opportunities around the world. Our fiscal 2012 results reflect progress against our strategic goals. For the full fiscal year, revenue grew 7% in constant currency and 9% as reported. 5 points of this growth in constant currency was organic while 2 points of this growth came from acquisitions. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 34%. This includes significant investment in the future of our business. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 31%, at the low end of our expectations in January. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 13% in constant currency and 18% as reported. And finally, cash flow from operations grew 6% in constant currency and 9% as reported. 
During the year, we provided segmented financials, sold our internet security business, acquired ITKO, a leading provider of service virtualization and Base Technologies, a consultancy focused on the management of IT assets, total return on investments and growth markets led by Latin America and Asia-Pacific, announced a return of $2.5 billion in capital to our shareholders through fiscal year 2014, and we finished fiscal 2012 by delivering a solid fourth quarter. Year-over-year, revenue was up 6% in constant currency and 5% as reported. Non-GAAP operating margin was 32%. Non-GAAP EPS grew 10% in constant currency and 17% as reported. Finally, cash flow from operations was up 20% in constant currency and 22% as reported. We paid our first quarter dividend of $0.25, in line with the end of dividend rate of $1 per year we announced in January when we increase the dividend by a fold. We also launched the $500 million accelerated share repurchase program under which we immediately received approximately 15 million shares of our common stock. This program will continue into our first quarter and the final number of shares purchased will be trued up based on the average price of stock over the life of the program. Upon completion of the accelerated share repurchase, CA Technologies will have approximately $1 billion in stock repurchase authorization available through fiscal 2014. 
We accomplished a great deal in fiscal 2012, but we know there is more we can do: to expand product penetration, to continue to improve our results in a where full year revenue was down slightly in constant currency year-over-year and to accelerate performance of acquisitions we have made over the last few years. We see a significant opportunity to expand our market reach and grow our business by penetrating new customer segments with new solutions. 
There are several key components to our plans. The first component is market segmentation. We are executing our market segmentation initiative, deploying approximately 300 incremental new quota-carrying sales reps, approximately 1/3 of those resources are new to CA Technologies while the balance are reallocation of existing internal resources. We are selling new products in 3 customer segments: first, large existing enterprises verbally get approximately 8% of our revenue today. The market opportunity focuses on improving revenue will yields and driving revenue growth to increase account penetration. Second, large New Enterprises. While this market segment includes more than 4,500 potential new customers, we are initially focusing on 1,000 customers selected based on CA Technologies current geographical and vertical strength. We are landing with our most differentiated offerings and expanding through upselling complementary products. Finally, we continue to build our presence in the growth market. For us, the growth market consists of companies with revenue between $300 million and $2 billion and in fast-growing geographies like Latin America and Asia. These customers are looking for integrated offerings that are easy to install and use and have a rapid ROI. We are reaching this market with a combination of teller prospective, inside sales and partner routes to market, offering them technology like our public cloud automation solutions and Nimsoft. Targeting these large new and growth market customer segments more than doubles our total addressable market and we believe will accelerate our new solution sales in new accounts across all the geographies. 
Examples of fourth quarter successes include: a record number of competitive displacements on the mainframe, including new energy; more than 50 new customers in our security business, including American Express and Cin Hub card in Korea; just under half of these customers where new to CA Technologies. Our security solutions protect the identities of over 150 million users worldwide. Just over 60 new customers added the Virtualization Automation, including Toyota Financial services and just under 100 new customers added to Nimsoft. 
Turning to the second component of our 2013 plan. We continue to align our organization to better support these new routes to market: reflect our reporting segments and streamline our business. For example, in the fourth quarter, we aligned our business, both internal business units and some operational to more closely reflect our products and go-to-market strategy. We appointed a Chief Marketing Officer and consolidated our marketing functions into 1 organization. And we continued to enhance our global partner program, which we launched more than a year ago to help partners evolve their businesses and adopt new service delivery models. We are partnering with Mahindra Satyam and Tech Mahindra, an Indian-based systems integrator and service provider leveraging CA Technologies' Rod technology portfolio to provide IT solutions to key vertical markets such as Telco and financial Services. Fujitsu, which won incorporate Nimsoft IT management is a service, moderating in-service desk solutions on its Fujitsu Cloud portfolio Durco Cisco and NetApp, which have fully validated CA Automation Suite for data centers for their offering. B.C.E., which certified 12 CA Technologies off their products to run on Vblock infrastructural platforms, and we have also enhanced our alliances program with major consultancies. With PwC, we are delivering solution offerings with products like service assurance and service virtualization, specifically targeting the financial services and healthcare verticals. With Deloitte, we are delivering offering with our Identity Access Management Solutions for the healthcare vertical. All of this is being done to support our market segmentation, increase our speed of execution, drive the performance cost on improve productivity and efficiency. 
Finally, in addition to our broad portfolio of on-premise software solutions, we continue to invest in our integrated SaaS platform strategy that we discussed at CA World in November. These solutions provide customers scalability combined with simplicity and include our monitoring and service desk solutions from Nimsoft. We are confident this approach will appeal both to our growth market customers who prefer a flexible consumption model, as well as to our traditional large enterprise customers who can quickly adapt new functionality to complement their on-premise capability. 
In fiscal '13, we will continue to focus on expanding our operating margin to improved execution, increased efficiency and continuing to build sales momentum. And with that, I will turn the call over to Rich for a closer look at the fourth quarter and full year."

Total revenue was $1.2 billion and grew 6% in constant currency and 5% as reported. 4 points of this constant currency growth was organic while 2 points came from acquisition. This also includes 21 million products that were newly eligible for upfront revenue recognition in the third quarter of this year. From a perspective, mainframe solution revenue was $629 million, up 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported. Our Enterprise Solutions revenue was $466 million, up 10% in constant currency and as reported. Services revenue was $93 million, up 15% in constant currency and 13% as reported. Underlying our results for the quarter, total new capacity and new product sales were up low single digits. in Mainframe Solutions, new product sales for the quarter were up more than 50%, driven by the competitive replacement and adoption of our correspondent line. Capacity sales were down in the midteens. Quarter-to-quarter capacity will fluctuate driven by the nature of our customers in our underlying renewals portfolio. For the full year, capacity sales were flat. Enterprise Solutions new product sales were up low single digits. We saw growth in Identity and Access Management and Virtualization and Automation. This was offset by service assurance. Underneath the service assurance results, we saw growth in Application Performance Management that was offset by infrastructure monitoring. Finally, the service engagements were up more than 30% Year-over-year. Our renewal yield for the quarter was in the low 90% range. The fiscal 2012, renewal portfolio came in slightly better than the 15% year-over-year decline we'd expected at the end of January. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we closed a $500 million ID outsourcer deal, which made for a challenging year-over-year comparison. We currently expect the 2013 renewal portfolio to be down single digits year-over-year. For modeling purposes, please note that the first quarter 2013 renewals are expected to be a trough for the year. 
Looking at the revenue backlog. Current revenue backlog at the fiscal year end was $3.7 billion, up 1% in constant currency and flat as reported. Total revenue backlog at fiscal year end was $8.5 billion, down 2% in constant currency and 3% as reported. This decline was due to the IT outsourcer deal signed in the fourth quarter of fiscal '11 and the increase in bookings attributable to software fees and other. From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $377 million, up 1% in constant currency and 6% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 32%. Operating margin for Mainframe Solutions the 56%. Our full fiscal year operating margin for Mainframe Solutions was 56% compared to 54% last fiscal year. Operating margins for Enterprise Solutions was 5%. This was primarily due to investment in acquisitions and development. Our full fiscal year operating margins for Enterprise Solutions was 8%, flat last year. 
Finally, operating margins for Services was 6%. Our full fiscal year operating margin for Services was 6% compared to 5% last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.56, up 10% in constant currency and 17% as reported, including a year-over-year $0.03 tailwind from currency. For the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 28% compared to 29% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate was 31% compared to 32% last fiscal year. We continue to see year-over-year benefits from efforts to improve our approach to taxes. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $776 million, up 20% in constant currency and 22% as reported. Single installment payments were $208 million in the fourth quarter compared to $176 million in the previous period. For the year, single installment payments were down, $479 million for fiscal year '12 compared to $542 million in fiscal year '11. Total Billings backlog at fiscal year end of $4.84 billion was down 5% in constant currency and 7% us recorded. Similar to the dynamics underlying revenue backlog, this year-over-year decline was driven by the IT Outsourcing deal signed in the fourth quarter of fiscal '11 and the increase in bookings attributed to software fees and other. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.24 billion in net cash. 
Moving to the fourth quarter GAAP results. Fourth quarter operating margin was 25%. GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $301 million, down 1% in constant currency and up 1% as reported. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.45, up 19% in constant currency and 22% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was 27% compared to 35% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Our full year GAAP tax rate was 31% compared to 32% last year. 
Now let me turn our fiscal 2013 guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based upon the exchange rate of the last day of the preceding quarter or for this quarter, March 31, 2012. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. 
Guidance is the following. Total revenue growth is expected to be 2% to 4% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.85 billion to $4.95 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 9% to 12%. This translates reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.53. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 10% to 14%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.07 to $2.14. We expect the cash flow from operations will grow at 4% to 6% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.56 billion to $1.59 billion. Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 30% to 31% in this fiscal year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 448 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 461 million shares. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 35% for fiscal year 2013. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

On the International business, particularly we saw improvement in both Asia-Pacific and Latin America. We've talked about Latin America before because it's running strong as the geographies running strong for us. We saw growth this quarter in Asia as well two. Now obviously, no at the macro economics are in EMEA. We saw, us we reported last quarter, flattening of our business in EMEA and we think that the clearly have the right management in place  there. And then as we move through this year, will soon an improving environment there but it'll be backend loaded us to get through that. So I think that probably gives you a pretty good and I will throw acreage for the second part of that question."

So let me try to split it out. It is in the three segments area. One of the things we did in the area of what would include the renewals on existing large Enterprises, which is about 80% of our revenue, we've be delayered a lot of the sports support folks and other sales support that folks that we had in there. A lot of those folks now have been applied in the segments that is in the large New Enterprises that will be driving at. That, by design then, increase productivity both in large existing accounts. But if you look at the large new, we're also doing that through partnering so the productivity there is better than the model we've had. And yes, about the compensation fees. On the large New Enterprises, we've taken a bit of a different track there with that in that we put a two-year plan in place for our sales reps there to give them the opportunity to build the relationship with the customer were we glad with a very high tech offering as we have like in ITKO, unique in the industry and then spread out from there. The compensation on a large existing is similar to what it was before but the productivity changes. And then a lot of the new resource I talked about, the 300 we talked about the last couple of quarters, has been deployed and that's going after the 7,000 accounts from growth that are from 300 million to $2 billion. And that is capability along with partner capability and some direct. So the productivity piece there is substantially different than what the other 3 parts are. Let me stop and see if have another question with respect to that."

That's actually helpful, Bill and it's understandable that at least people focused on enterprise accounts, especially those accounts have not been productive are going to need some time to develop those relationships. But it also sort of begs a second question for Rich. Rich, in your prepared remarks you said the Enterprise Solutions, the profit margins, well, they were down. I mean, we saw that. But you said that is primarily due to the sort of acquisition integration, I think. But I guess was it also due to somewhat of what Bill was talking about here? Will be continue to see those margins somewhat suppressed? I mean, listen, the overall margins were actually really good this quarter. It's great to see. But should our expectations for the ES business before margins be somewhat suppressed for a couple of quarters, anyway Komori Beaven a few quarters?"

So the margin revenue expansion, were very confident in the 35% for next year, and your and Bill talk about a 37% as we grow out over time. So we begrudge frac for that. It's just continue to invest like we did. We started to talk about this in the June were we were going to move the 300 folks and now you see them, they're all quoted, they're out in the field and they're starting to sell as a speak.

Than it starts to come back and 14 and 15. So the reason why were seeing single digits is I don't want to the number out like I did and have the walk down because we will have the large company in Europe last quarter we decide that they want to go early. And so that number will move around. They don't move out, they can't dividend.
So let me wrap up if I can. So as we look at this year with our organic guidance of 2% to 4% revenue, we think we hold and gain share especially as we look at the ES marketplace. It's going to be done through 3 primary things: one, were going to pay close attention to our segment marketing operations and performance and we'll see that grow as performance growth to do back and of the year. We're going to continue to focus on our margin improvement. We are committed to the 35% margin for this year, and as I said, that'll put us on the track to move to but 37% we've committed for 2015. And then, we're going to get continuing focus and EMEA improvements as I talked about earlier in the call and continue our growth from the geographies both AP and LA.

I'll start this afternoon with a brief overview of our full year and fourth quarter performance. I'll then update you on fiscal 2013 priorities. Rich will provide details on full year performance, the quarter and guidance for fiscal 2013, and then we'll then take questions. 
Nearly 3 years ago, we set a strategy aimed at helping customers gain the most from their existing IT investments while, at the same time, benefiting from new technologies and business services that deliver a competitive advantage. We made a series of strategic acquisitions and significant investments in development to produce a portfolio of solutions and services that leverage our heritage in IT management. We also continued to invest in new routes to market and enhanced our presence in geographies with growth opportunities around the world. Our fiscal 2012 results reflect progress against our strategic goals. 
For the full fiscal year, revenue grew 7% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Five points of this growth in constant currency was organic, while 2 points of this growth came from acquisitions. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 34%. This includes significant investment in the future of our business. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 31%, at the low end of our expectations in January. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 13% in constant currency and 18% as reported. And finally, cash flow from operations grew 6% in constant currency and 9% as reported. 
During the year, we provided segmented financials, sold our Internet security business; acquired ITKO, a leading provider of service virtualization, and Base Technologies, a consultancy focused on the management of IT assets; total return on investments in growth markets led by Latin America and Asia Pacific; announced a return of $2.5 billion in capital to our shareholders through fiscal year 2014. And we finished fiscal 2012 by delivering a solid fourth quarter. 
Year-over-year, revenue was up 6% in constant currency and 5% as reported. Non-GAAP operating margin was 32%. Non-GAAP EPS grew 10% in constant currency and 17% as reported. Finally, cash flow from operations was up 20% in constant currency and 22% as reported. We paid our first quarter dividend of $0.25, in line with the annual dividend rate of $1 per year we announced in January, when we increased the dividend by a fold. 
We also launched the $500 million accelerated share repurchase program, under which we immediately received approximately 15 million shares of our common stock. This program will continue into our first quarter, and the final number of shares purchased will be trued up based on the average price of stock over the life of the program. Upon completion of the accelerated share repurchase, CA Technologies will have approximately $1 billion in stock repurchase authorization available through fiscal 2014. 
We accomplished a great deal in fiscal 2012, but we know there is more we can do to expand product penetration, to continue to improve our results in EMEA, where full year revenue was down slightly in constant currency year-over-year and to accelerate performance of acquisitions we have made over the last few years. We see a significant opportunity to expand our market reach and grow our business by penetrating new customer segments with new solutions. 
There are several key components to our plans. The first component is market segmentation. We are executing our market segmentation initiative, deploying approximately 300 incremental new quota-carrying sales reps. Approximately 1/3 of those resources are new to CA Technologies, while the balance are reallocation of existing internal resources. We are selling new products in 3 customer segments: first, large existing enterprises where we get approximately 80% of our revenue today. The market opportunity focuses on improving renewal yields and driving revenue growth to increase account penetration. 
Second, large new enterprises. While this market segment includes more than 4,500 potential new customers, we are initially focusing on 1,000 customers selected based on CA Technologies current geographical and vertical strength. We are landing with our most differentiated offerings and expanding through upselling complementary products. 
Finally, we continue to build our presence in the growth market. For us, the growth market consists of companies with revenue between $300 million and $2 billion and in fast-growing geographies like Latin America and Asia. These customers are looking for integrated offerings that are easy to install and use and have a rapid ROI. We are reaching this market with a combination of teleprospecting, inside sales and partner routes to market, offering them technology like our public and private cloud automation solutions and Nimsoft. 
Targeting these large, new and growth market customer segments more than doubles our total addressable market and we believe, will accelerate our new solution sales in new accounts across all the geographies. Examples of fourth quarter successes include: a record number of competitive displacements on the mainframe, including Duke energy; more than 50 new customers in our security business, including American Express and Shinhan Card in Korea, just under half of these customers where new to CA Technologies. Our security solutions protect the identities of over 150 million users worldwide. Just over 60 new customers added the Virtualization and Automation, including Toyota Financial Services and Fuji Xerox Taiwan, and just under 100 new customers added to Nimsoft. 
Turning to the second component of our 2013 plan. We continue to align our organization to better support these new routes to market, reflect our reporting segments and streamline our business. For example, in the fourth quarter, we aligned our business, both internal business units and some operational functions to more closely reflect our products and go-to-market strategy. We appointed a chief marketing officer and consolidated our marketing functions into one organization. 
And we continued to enhance our global partner program, which we launched more than a year ago to help partners evolve their businesses and adopt new service delivery models. We are partnering with: Mahindra Satyam and Tech Mahindra, an Indian-based systems integrator and service provider, leveraging CA Technologies' broad technology portfolio to provide IT solutions to key vertical markets, such as telco and financial services; Fujitsu, which will incorporate Nimsoft IT management-as-a-service, monitoring and service desk solutions on its Fujitsu cloud portfolio; Cisco and NetApp, which have fully validated CA Automation Suite for data centers for their FlexPod offering; VCE, which certified 12 CA Technologies products to run on Vblock Infrastructure Platforms. 
And we have also enhanced our alliances program with major consultancies. With PwC, we are delivering joint solution offerings, with products like Service Assurance and Service Virtualization, specifically targeting the financial services and health care verticals. With Deloitte, we are delivering joint offering with our identity access management solutions for the health care vertical. All of this is being done to support our market segmentation, increase our speed of execution, drive our  performance culture and improve productivity and efficiency. 
Finally, in addition to our broad portfolio of on-premise software solutions, we continue to invest in our integrated SaaS platform strategy that we discussed at CA World in November. These solutions provide customers scalability, combined with simplicity and include our monitoring and service desk solutions from Nimsoft. We are confident this approach will appeal both to our growth market customers, who prefer a flexible consumption model, as well as to our traditional large enterprise customers, who can quickly adapt new functionality to complement their on-premise capability. 
In fiscal '13, we will continue to focus on expanding our operating margin to improved execution, increased efficiency and continuing to build sales momentum. And with that, I will turn the call over to Rich for a closer look at the fourth quarter and full year."

Please note that all growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated. I'll start by running through the details of our full year financial performance. Revenue was $4.81 billion, up 7% in constant currency and 9% as reported.",1201,"Thank you, Bill. Please note that all growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated. I'll start by running through the details of our full year financial performance. 
Revenue was $4.81 billion, up 7% in constant currency and 9% as reported.  Full fiscal year '12 results benefited from 2 points of growth from the large IT outsourcer deal booked the fourth quarter of fiscal '11 and 1 point of mainframe growth from a single license payment received last quarter that will not reoccur in fiscal '13. Non-GAAP operating expense was $3.17 billion, up 7% in constant currency and 8% as reported. Non-GAAP operating margin was 34%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.27, up 13% in constant currency and 18% as reported. And finally, cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion, up 6% in constant currency and 9% as reported. On a GAAP basis, our operating margin also improved 1 percentage point to 29% and our diluted EPS was $1.90, up 14% in constant currency and 19% as reported. 
Now for the fourth quarter details. Total revenue was $1.2 billion and grew 6% in constant currency and 5% as reported. Four points of this constant currency growth was organic, while 2 points came from acquisitions. This also includes 21 million products that were newly eligible for upfront revenue recognition in the third quarter of this year. 
From a segment perspective, Mainframe solution revenue was $629 million, up 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported. Our Enterprise Solutions revenue was $466 million, up 10% in constant currency and as reported. Services revenue was $93 million, up 15% in constant currency and 13% as reported. 
Underlying our results for the quarter, total new capacity and new product sales were up low-single digits. In Mainframe Solutions, new product sales for the quarter were up more than 50%, driven by the competitive replacement and adoption of our Chorus product line. Capacity sales were down in the mid-teens. Quarter-to-quarter capacity will fluctuate driven by the nature of our customers in our underlying renewals portfolio. 
For the full year, capacity sales were flat. Enterprise Solutions new product sales were up low-single digits. We saw growth in Identity and Access Management and Virtualization and Automation. This was offset by Service Assurance. Underneath these Service Assurance results, we saw growth in Application Performance Management that was offset by infrastructure monitoring. 
Finally, new service engagements were up more than 30% year-over-year. Our renewal yield for the quarter was in the low 90% range. The fiscal 2012 renewal portfolio came in slightly better than the 15% year-over-year decline we had expected at the end of January. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we closed a $500 million IT outsourcer deal, which made for a challenging year-over-year comparison. We currently expect the 2013 renewal portfolio to be down single digits year-over-year. For modeling purposes, please note that the first quarter 2013 renewals are expected to be a trough for the year. 
Looking at the revenue backlog. Current revenue backlog at the fiscal year-end was $3.7 billion, up 1% in constant currency and flat as reported. Total revenue backlog at fiscal year-end was $8.5 billion, down 2% in constant currency and 3% as reported. This decline was due to the IT outsourcer deal signed in the fourth quarter of fiscal '11 and the increase in bookings attributable to software fees and other. 
From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $377 million, up 1% in constant currency and 6% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 32%. Operating margin for Mainframe Solutions the 56%. Our full fiscal year operating margin for Mainframe Solutions was 56% compared to 54% last fiscal year. Operating margins for Enterprise Solutions was 5%. This was primarily due to investment in acquisitions and development. Our full fiscal year operating margins for Enterprise Solutions was 8%, flat with last year. Finally, operating margins for Services was 6%. Our full fiscal year operating margin for Services was 6% compared to 5% last year. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.56, up 10% in constant currency and 17% as reported, including a year-over-year $0.03 tailwind from currency. For the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 28% compared to 29% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate was 31% compared to 32% last fiscal year. We continue to see year-over-year benefits from efforts to improve our approach to taxes. 
Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $776 million, up 20% in constant currency and 22% as reported. Single-installment payments were $208 million in the fourth quarter compared to $176 million in the previous period. For the year, single-installment payments were down, $479 million for fiscal year '12 compared to $542 million in fiscal year '11. Total billings backlog at fiscal year-end of $4.84 billion was down 5% in constant currency and 7% as reported. 
Similar to the dynamics underlying revenue backlog, this year-over-year decline was driven by the IT outsourcing deal signed in the fourth quarter of fiscal '11 and the increase in bookings attributed to software fees and other. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.24 billion in net cash. 
Moving to the fourth quarter GAAP results. Fourth quarter operating margin was 25%. GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $301 million, down 1% in constant currency and up 1% as reported. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.45, up 19% in constant currency and 22% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was 27% compared to 35% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Our full year GAAP tax rate was 31% compared to 32% last year. 
Now let me turn to our fiscal 2013 guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based upon the exchange rate of the last day of the preceding quarter or for this quarter March 31, 2012. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. 
Guidance is the following. Total revenue growth is expected to be 2% to 4% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.85 billion to $4.95 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 9% to 12%. This translates reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.53. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 10% to 14%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.07 to $2.14. We expect the cash flow from operations will grow at 4% to 6% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.56 billion to $1.59 billion. The guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. 
Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 30% to 31% in this fiscal year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 448 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 461 million shares. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 35% for fiscal year 2013. 
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

A lot of those folks now have been applied in the segments that is the large new enterprises, that we'll be driving at. That, by design then, improves productivity, both in large existing accounts. But as you look at the large new, we're also doing that through partnering, so the productivity there is better than the model we've had. And yes, about the compensation fees, on the large new enterprises, we've taken a bit of a different track there with that, in that we put a 2-year plan in place for our sales reps there to give them the opportunity to build the relationship with the customer, where we'd land glad with a very high tech offering, which we have like in ITKO, unique in the industry, and then spread out from there. The compensation on a large existing is similar to what it was before, but the productivity changes. And then a lot of the new resource we've talked about, the 300 that we've talked about for the last couple of quarters, has been deployed, and that's going after the about 7,000 accounts from growth that are from $300 million to $2 billion.

So it's -- and it's understandable that at least people focused on enterprise accounts, especially those accounts that have not been productive that are going to need some time to develop those relationships. But it also sort of begs a second question for Rich. Rich, in your prepared remarks you said the Enterprise Solutions, the profit margins, well, they were down. I mean, we saw that. But you said that, that was primarily due to sort of acquisition integration, I think. But I guess was it also due to some of what Bill's talking about here? And is it -- will we continue to see those margins somewhat suppressed? I mean, listen, the overall margins were actually really good this quarter. It's great to see. But should we -- should our expectations for the ES business be -- for margins be somewhat suppressed for a couple of quarters, anyway or maybe even a few quarters?"

But inside of that, we also had ITKO so it makes a pretty difficult compare year-over-year growth. And then, the last part of that is, as we grow out of the product cycle, either new product, which is what we have had invested in some of the areas, or as Bill just described, the build-out of the sales team, that should -- in back half of the year and into the following year, you'll start to see that from a revenue growth rate. So the margin expansion -- we're very confident in the 35% for next year, and you heard Bill talk about the 37% as we go out over time. So we think we're on track for that. It's just a rated phase  for us to continue to invest like we did. We started to talk about this in the June, where we're going to move the 300 folks, and now you see them, they are quoted. They're out in the field, and they're starting to sell as we speak. So that's just hard to pay off in the back half of the year."

Rich will provide details on full year performance, the quarter and guidance for fiscal 2013, and then we'll then take questions. 
Nearly 3 years ago, we set a strategy aimed at helping customers gain the most from their existing IT investments while at the same time benefiting from new technologies and business services that deliver a competitive advantage. We made a series of strategic acquisitions and significant investments in development to produce a portfolio of solutions and services that leverage our heritage in IT management. We also continued to invest in new routes to market and enhance our presence in geographies with growth opportunities around the world. Our fiscal 2012 results reflect progress against our strategic goals. 
For the full fiscal year, revenue grew 7% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Five points of this growth in constant currency was organic, while 2 points of this growth came from acquisitions. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 34%. This includes significant investment in the future of our business. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 31%, at the low end of our expectations in January. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 13% in constant currency and 18% as reported. And finally, cash flow from operations grew 6% in constant currency and 9% as reported. 
During the year, we provided segmented financials; sold our Internet security business; acquired ITKO, a leading provider of service virtualization, and Base Technologies, a consultancy focused on the management of IT assets; total return on investments in growth markets led by Latin America and Asia Pacific; announced a return of $2.5 billion in capital to our shareholders through fiscal year 2014. And we finished fiscal 2012 by delivering a solid fourth quarter. 
Year-over-year, revenue was up 6% in constant currency and 5% as reported. Non-GAAP operating margin was 32%. Non-GAAP EPS grew 10% in constant currency and 17% as reported. Finally, cash flow from operations was up 20% in constant currency and 22% as reported. We paid our first quarter dividend of $0.25, in line with the annual dividend rate of $1 per year we announced in January, when we increased the dividend fivefold. 
We also launched a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program, under which we immediately received approximately 15 million shares of our common stock. This program will continue into our first quarter, and the final number of shares purchased will be trued up based on the average price of stock over the life of the program. Upon completion of the accelerated share repurchase, CA Technologies will have approximately $1 billion in stock repurchase authorization available through fiscal 2014. 
We accomplished a great deal in fiscal 2012, but we know there is more we can do to expand product penetration, to continue to improve our results in EMEA, where full year revenue was down slightly in constant currency year-over-year and to accelerate performance of acquisitions we have made over the last few years. We see a significant opportunity to expand our market reach and grow our business by penetrating new customer segments with new solutions. 
There are several key components to our plans. The first component is market segmentation. We are executing our market segmentation initiative, deploying approximately 300 incremental new quota-carrying sales reps. Approximately 1/3 of those resources are new to CA Technologies, while the balance are reallocation of existing internal resources. We are selling new products in 3 customer segments: first, large existing enterprises where we get approximately 80% of our revenue today. The market opportunity focuses on improving renewal yields and driving revenue growth through increase account penetration.  Second, large new enterprises. While this market segment includes more than 4,500 potential new customers, we are initially focusing on 1,000 customers selected based on CA Technologies current geographical and vertical strength. We are landing with our most differentiated offerings and expanding through upselling complementary products. 
Finally, we continue to build our presence in the growth market. For us, the growth market consists of companies with revenue between $300 million and $2 billion and in fast-growing geographies like Latin America and Asia. These customers are looking for integrated offerings that are easy to install and use and have a rapid ROI. We are reaching this market with a combination of teleprospecting, inside sales and partner routes to market, offering them technology like our public and private cloud automation solutions and Nimsoft. 
Targeting these large, new and growth market customer segments more than doubles our total addressable market and, we believe, will accelerate our new solution sales in new accounts across all the geographies. Examples of fourth quarter successes include: a record number of competitive displacements on the mainframe, including Duke Energy; more than 50 new customers in our security business, including American Express and Shinhan Card in Korea.  Just under half of these customers were new to CA Technologies. Our security solutions protect the identities of over 150 million users worldwide. Just over 60 new customers added to Virtualization and Automation, including Toyota Financial Services and Fuji Xerox Taiwan, and just under 100 new customers added to Nimsoft. 
Turning to the second component of our 2013 plan. We continue to align our organization to better support these new routes to market, reflect our reporting segments and streamline our business. For example, in the fourth quarter, we aligned our business, both internal business units and some operational functions, to more closely reflect our products and go-to-market strategy. We appointed a chief marketing officer and consolidated our marketing functions into one organization. 
And we continued to enhance our global partner program, which we launched more than a year ago to help partners evolve their businesses and adopt new service delivery models. We are partnering with Mahindra Satyam and Tech Mahindra, an Indian-based systems integrator and service provider, leveraging CA Technologies' broad technology portfolio to provide IT solutions to key vertical markets, such as telco and financial services; Fujitsu, which will incorporate Nimsoft IT management-as-a-service, monitoring and service desk solutions on its Fujitsu cloud portfolio; Cisco and NetApp, which have fully validated CA Automation Suite for data centers for their FlexPod offering; VCE, which has certified 12 CA Technologies software products to run on Vblock Infrastructure Platforms. 
And we have also enhanced our alliances program with major consultancies. With PwC, we are delivering joint solution offerings with products like Service Assurance and Service Virtualization, specifically targeting the financial services and health care verticals. With Deloitte, we are delivering joint offerings with our identity access management solutions for the health care vertical. All of this is being done to support our market segmentation, increase our speed of execution, drive our  performance culture and improve productivity and efficiency. 
Finally, in addition to our broad portfolio of on-premise software solutions, we continue to invest in our integrated SaaS platform strategy that we discussed at CA World in November. These solutions provide customers scalability combined with simplicity and include our monitoring and service desk solutions from Nimsoft. We are confident this approach will appeal both to our growth market customers, who prefer a flexible consumption model, as well as to our traditional large enterprise customers, who can quickly adopt new functionality to complement their on-premise capability. 
In fiscal '13, we will continue to focus on expanding our operating margin to improved execution, increased efficiency and continuing to build sales momentum. And with that, I will turn the call over to Rich for a closer look at the fourth quarter and full year."

Please note that all growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated. I'll start by running through the details of our full year financial performance. Revenue was $4.81 billion, up 7% in constant currency and 9% as reported.",1200,"Thank you, Bill. Please note that all growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated. I'll start by running through the details of our full year financial performance. 
Revenue was $4.81 billion, up 7% in constant currency and 9% as reported.  Full fiscal year '12 results benefited from 2 points of growth from the large IT outsourcer deal booked the fourth quarter of fiscal '11 and 1 point of mainframe growth from a single license payment received last quarter that will not reoccur in fiscal '13. Non-GAAP operating expense was $3.17 billion, up 7% in constant currency and 8% as reported. Non-GAAP operating margin was 34%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.27, up 13% in constant currency and 18% as reported. And finally, cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion, up 6% in constant currency and 9% as reported. On a GAAP basis, our operating margin also improved 1 percentage point to 29% and our diluted EPS was $1.90, up 14% in constant currency and 19% as reported. 
Now for the fourth quarter details. Total revenue was $1.2 billion and grew 6% in constant currency and 5% as reported. Four points of this constant currency growth was organic, while 2 points came from acquisitions. This also includes 21 million products that were newly eligible for upfront revenue recognition in the third quarter of this year. 
From a segment perspective, Mainframe solution revenue was $629 million, up 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported. Our Enterprise Solutions revenue was $466 million, up 10% in constant currency and as reported. Services revenue was $93 million, up 15% in constant currency and 13% as reported. 
Underlying our results for the quarter, total new capacity and new product sales were up low single-digits. In Mainframe Solutions, new product sales for the quarter were up more than 50%, driven by the competitive replacement and adoption of our Chorus product line. Capacity sales were down in the mid-teens. Quarter-to-quarter capacity will fluctuate, driven by the nature of our customers in our underlying renewals portfolio. 
For the full year, capacity sales were flat. Enterprise Solutions new product sales were up low single-digits. We saw growth in Identity and Access Management and Virtualization and Automation. This was offset by Service Assurance. Underneath these Service Assurance results, we saw growth in Application Performance Management that was offset by infrastructure monitoring. 
Finally, new service engagements were up more than 30% year-over-year. Our renewal yield for the quarter was in the low-90% range. The fiscal 2012 renewal portfolio came in slightly better than the 15% year-over-year decline we had expected at the end of January. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we closed a $500 million IT outsourcer deal, which made for a challenging year-over-year comparison. We currently expect the 2013 renewal portfolio to be down single-digits year-over-year. For modeling purposes, please note that the first quarter 2013 renewals are expected to be a trough for the year. 
Looking at the revenue backlog. Current revenue backlog at the fiscal year-end was $3.7 billion, up 1% in constant currency and flat as reported. Total revenue backlog at fiscal year-end was $8.5 billion, down 2% in constant currency and 3% as reported. This decline was due to the IT outsourcer deal signed in the fourth quarter of fiscal '11 and the increase in bookings attributable to software fees and other. 
From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $377 million, up 1% in constant currency and 6% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 32%. Operating margin for Mainframe Solutions was 56%. Our full fiscal year operating margin for Mainframe Solutions was 56% compared to 54% last fiscal year. Operating margins for Enterprise Solutions was 5%. This was primarily due to investment in acquisitions and development. Our full fiscal year operating margins for Enterprise Solutions was 8%, flat with last year. Finally, operating margins for Services was 6%. Our full fiscal year operating margin for Services was 6% compared to 5% last year. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.56, up 10% in constant currency and 17% as reported, including a year-over-year $0.03 tailwind from currency. For the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 28% compared to 29% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate was 31% compared to 32% last fiscal year. We continue to see year-over-year benefits from efforts to improve our approach to taxes. 
Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $776 million, up 20% in constant currency and 22% as reported. Single-installment payments were $208 million in the fourth quarter compared to $176 million in the previous period. For the year, single-installment payments were down, $479 million for fiscal year '12 compared to $542 million in fiscal year '11. Total billings backlog at fiscal year-end of $4.84 billion was down 5% in constant currency and 7% as reported. 
Similar to the dynamics underlying revenue backlog, this year-over-year decline was driven by the IT outsourcing deal signed in the fourth quarter of fiscal '11 and the increase in bookings attributed to software fees and other. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.24 billion in net cash. 
Moving to the fourth quarter GAAP results. Fourth quarter operating margin was 25%. GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $301 million, down 1% in constant currency and up 1% as reported. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.45, up 19% in constant currency and 22% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was 27% compared to 35% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Our full year GAAP tax rate was 31% compared to 32% last year. 
Now let me turn to our fiscal 2013 guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based upon the exchange rate of the last day of the preceding quarter or, for this quarter, March 31, 2012. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. 
Guidance is the following. Total revenue growth is expected to be 2% to 4% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.85 billion to $4.95 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 9% to 12%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.53. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 10% to 14%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.07 to $2.14. We expect the cash flow from operations will grow at 4% to 6% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.56 billion to $1.59 billion. The guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. 
Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 30% to 31% in this fiscal year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 448 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 461 million shares. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 35% for fiscal year 2013. 
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

A lot of those folks now have been applied in the segment that is the large new enterprises that we'll be driving at. That by design, then, improves productivity, both in large existing accounts, but as you look at the large new, we're also doing that through partnering, so the productivity there is better than the model we've had. And you asked about the compensation fees.  On the large new enterprises, we've taken a bit of a different track there with that, in that we put a 2-year plan in place for our sales reps there to give them the opportunity to build the relationship with the customer, where we'd land with a very high-tech offering which we have, like an ITKO, unique in the industry, and then spread out from there. The compensation on a large existing is similar to what it was before, but the productivity changes and then a lot of the new resource we've talked about, the 300 that we've talked about for the last couple of quarters, has been deployed, and that's going after the about 7,000 accounts from growth that are from $300 million to $2 billion.

I'd like to start this afternoon by reviewing our first fiscal quarter and the drivers behind our updated guidance. I will discuss the challenges we faced, the progress we made and our execution-related initiatives. I'll then turn the call over to Rich for more detailed review of the financials and guidance before we open the call for questions. 
By now, I hope you've had a chance to read our press release. We are adjusting revenue guidance from 2% to 4% constant currency growth to 1% to 2%. This reflects both the slow start we had to the year and the macroeconomic environment. We increased our expectation for non-GAAP operating margin for the year to 36%. The 36% margin reflects the benefit from an IP transaction closed during the quarter, which provided an incremental $35 million operating income, as well as driving more profitability from the organic business. In addition, we updated our original outlook on non-GAAP earnings per share growth from 9% to 12% to 10% to 12% constant currency and we reaffirmed our outlook on cash flow growth of 4% to 6% in constant currency. 
Despite the headwinds to top line growth we experienced during the quarter, we are committed to delivering the earnings per share and cash flow growth we provided at the beginning of the year. Now, let me provide some comments on the market and our performance in the first quarter. Our revenue grew 1% in constant currency, some growth but short of our expectations. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, including 3 points of contribution from our IP transaction. Our non-GAAP earnings per share and cash flow from operations were up 16% and 10%, respectively in constant currency, both also improved by the IP transaction. We had new product sales decline in North America and EMEA, growth in APJ and continued strong momentum in Latin America. Growth economies continue to reward our investments. 
Clearly, I'm not satisfied with the top line performance in the first quarter. Because of CA Technologies' highly ratable model, it is important for us to get a strong start and we didn't. We knew heading into the year that the renewal portfolio would be down. In fact, we shared this with you at Analyst Day last July and again in Q4 fiscal 2012 earnings call. We also highlighted that first quarter was a trough for the portfolio for the year, with the portfolio coming in approximately 40% lower year-over-year. To give you a sense of this portfolio dynamic, the number of large renewals worth more than $10 million that closed during the quarter was 1/2 that of last year, 4 compared to 8. As a result, the value of large contracts signed during the quarter decreased by approximately $200 million. Renewal of the ELA continues to be a good opportunity for us to sell new products and new capacity. It builds energy and momentum in an account, both for us and the customer. When we have a lighter renewal inventory, we have less opportunity to sell new products. This is also the case for new mainframe capacity, which is tightly correlated to the renewal portfolio. As our portfolio builds in the second half of this year, this will help drive opportunities for new product sales and capacity. While that explains the dynamics behind new product sales and mainframe capacity related to the ELA, it is only part of the story. The other piece relates to the sales of new products outside the renewal. We did not deliver at the level we expected. We knew we had challenges selling outside the renewal and our customer segmentation initiative is designed to address that. 
We created 3 distinct customer segments with unique approaches to reach each of our target customer segments: large existing enterprise customers; large new enterprise customers; and growth market customers. The addition of large, new enterprise and growth market customer segments more than doubles our total addressable market. Although we were below plan for the quarter, we did not anticipate significant traction in these new customer segments in the first half of the year. In fact, we continue to believe that the actions we took will be drivers in the back half of this year and beyond. What we did not adequately plan for in the first quarter was the level of disruption our new customer segmentation efforts would cause in the sales force and the impact it would have on our productivity and large existing accounts. Anytime you move people into new territories, create new coverage models and train extensively, it takes time away from the customers. When combined with the lighter renewal portfolio, we slowed our start to the year. The result, new capacity and new product sales were down approximately 30% year-over-year. 
So with the first quarter behind us and much of the move to customer segmentation largely complete, we are now back in the territories with a renewed focus and a clear set of objectives, further penetrating existing accounts and acquiring new customers. To realize our objectives, we have increased accountability throughout the organization and made a number of important changes. 
We've moved all disciplines associated with our growth markets business under one General Manager worldwide. This allows regional executives to focus exclusively on execution in our large, existing and large new enterprise accounts. We've consolidated all business operations into the finance team, scrubbed the sales pipeline for each region and customer segment and increased executive oversight in key transactions. As a result, we are confident in this afternoon's updated guidance. 
From a new product perspective, we are entering a strong product cycle, leveraging the investments we have made in organic development and intellectual property from our acquisitions. While we have introduced many products enhancements over the last decade and a half, these new solutions raise the bar of innovation and customer productivity. In June, we announced new releases of award-winning CA Mainframe Chorus, together with CA Database Management solutions that provide the fastest path to value for DB2 upgrades. Next month, we will introduce performance analytics capabilities to our service assurance portfolio. The new solution will focus on infrastructure, which we will extend to applications. We now have the ability to rapidly analyze the massive quantities of performance data we collect and provide customers insight into improving their quality of service and customer experience. Service providers in particular, will be able to leverage this capability to simplify and accelerate 4G network rollouts. 
Customer demand for new solutions that can be deployed in both on-premise and SaaS models continues to grow. Providing a choice of delivery model allows customers to migrate at their pace while preserving their current investment, which we believe is a competitive advantage. We continue to build our service management portfolio with these capabilities, including a mobile self-service social interface, advanced dashboard and reporting analytics and world-class software Asset Management that we believe customers will find compelling. We will continue to introduce new products and solutions throughout the back half of the year. These present ongoing upsell opportunities to our current customer base and differentiating technology to retain and attract new customers. Given the timing of these introductions and the associated sales cycles, we expect traction later in fiscal 2013. 
Before I turn the call over to Rich, I would like to address CEO succession. We are working on succession planning. My role, along with the Board of Directors, is to ensure the execution of an effective and smooth transition that will drive the company's future success. Our focus on the business will not waver during this transition, whenever it occurs. I also want to reaffirm that the Board of Directors and Executive management team are committed to the $2.5 billion capital allocation plan we announced in January, including the $1 per share annual dividend and share repurchase program we have put in place. We remain on track to return an average 80% of our cumulative free cash flow for fiscal 2014, which we believe allows us the optimal mix of making investments in the business while returning cash directly to shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to provide details of the quarter."

Total revenue for the quarter was $1.15 billion, up 1% in constant currency and down 2% as reported. This includes a $32 million headwinid from foreign exchange. From a segment perspective, mainframe solution revenue was $628 million, flat in constant currency and down 3% as reported. As a reminder for your models, we have a challenging mainframe revenue compare in the third quarter due to a $39 million single license payment that occurred last year. Our Enterprise Solutions revenue was $426 million, up 2% in constant currency and flat as reported. Services revenue was $91 million, up 4% in constant currency and 1% as reported. 
Underlying these results, Mainframe Solutions new product sales for the quarter were down more than 30%, while new capacity sales were down more than 60%. New mainframe product and capacity sales are highly correlated to the timing of underlying renewals and will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. We anticipate that mainframe new product sales and capacity will accelerate in the back half of the year, driven by a more robust portfolio of renewals. Enterprise Solutions new product sales were down just over 20% this quarter. Finally, new services engagements, which are highly dependent on new product sales were down more than 15% year-over-year. 
Our renewal yield in the quarter was in the low 80% range. This is due to a single transaction where the effect was amplified by the lower amount of renewals in the quarter. Excluding this transaction, our renewal yield was approximately 90%. We continue to expect full year renewal portfolio to be down single-digit year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2012 and it will be back half loaded. 
Looking at revenue backlog, current revenue backlog was $3.5 billion, down 1% in constant currency and 5% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $7.8 billion, down 5% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Backlog was affected by sales performance in the quarter, as well as the higher percentage of sales recognized as software fees and other. We will continue to see headwinds in backlog metrics as contracts burn off the balance sheet in anticipation of an increase in our 2014 renewal portfolio. 
As Bill mentioned, first quarter results include $35 million or approximately $0.05 in GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share from the assignment of certain intellectual property assets to a large technology company. This benefit was recorded as other income and was incremental to full year guidance provided in May. From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $439 million, up 8% in constant currency and 5% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, 35% excluding the IP transaction. Operating margin for Mainframe Solutions was 59%. Operating margins for Enterprise Solutions was 16%. The IP transaction contributed 8 points to Enterprise Solutions margin. Finally, operating margin for Services was 4%. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.63, up 16% in constant currency and 15% as reported. This includes a year-over-year $0.01 headwind from currency. For the first quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 31% compared to 32% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter was $183 million, up 10% in constant currency and 28% as reported. The difference in as-reported and constant currency growth is due to the positive FX impact of the U.S. dollar cash investment by our European subsidiaries. These investments protect the company against European event risk. Next quarter, the maturing FX hedge of these assets will be a headwind as-reported cash flow growth. 
From a year-over-year perspective, cash flow growth was driven by lower tax payments in the quarter and the IP transaction. In addition, single installment payments were $123 million in the first quarter compared to $64 million in the previous period. This increase was driven by Q4 Billings which were paid in Q1. Total Billings backlog of $4.58 billion was down 8% in constant currency and 11% as reported. Billings backlog was affected by the first quarter decrease in sales. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in net cash. During the quarter, we successfully completed our accelerated share repurchase program with the receipt of 3.7 million shares. This was in addition to the 15 million shares received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Subsequent to the completion of the ASR, we repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares for approximately $96 million in Q1. We are authorized to repurchase an additional 900 million of common stock through fiscal 2014. 
Moving to first quarter GAAP results. First quarter GAAP operating margin was 33%, GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $381 million, up 10% in constant currency and 11% as reported. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.51, up 11% in constant currency and 13% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was 35% compared to 32% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. 
Now, let me turn to fiscal 2013 guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based upon exchange rate of the last day of the preceding quarter, or for this quarter, June 30, 2012. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. Updated guidance is the following. Total revenue growth is now expected to be 1% to 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.74 billion to $4.80 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 10% to 12%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.50. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 12% to 14%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.07 to $2.12. We continue to expect that cash flow from operations will grow 4% to 6% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.54 billion to $1.57 billion. Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. 
Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to come in closer to the high end of the 30% to 31% we provided at the outset of this year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 452 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 459 million shares. We now expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 36% for fiscal year 2013. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

What we didn't do to the level that we had anticipated was selling outside of the renewal backlog. So therefore, our overall sales were off from what we had anticipated. What we also have is the headwind of our entire business as it builds out over FY '14 and we head closer and closer to the renewals in FY '14, the backlog shrinks until they're renewed and then the backlog is refilled.

The biggest challenge we had was to move that model into both North America and EMEA. And the thing we did underestimate, which is what you said. We knew we were going to have to move the territories, we moved people into New Enterprises, as well as into the growth area, but the magnitude of the impact that it had with respect to the account changes and the territory changes did in fact have more impact for us than we thought and we ended up in the territory-only part of the quarter.

So that would elongate back to the normal 3, 3.5. So we're not concerned about this. This actually, we saw this not to this degree.

Before I turn the call over, I'd like to highlight that for modeling purposes, our year-over-year currency headwind on revenue guidance is expected to be roughly 2.5 points for the full year. It is forecasted to peak at 4 points in our September quarter.

I'd like to start this afternoon by reviewing our first fiscal quarter and the drivers behind our updated guidance. I will discuss the challenges we faced, the progress we made and our execution-related initiatives. I'll then turn the call over to Rich for more detailed review of the financials and guidance before we open the call for questions. 
By now, I hope you've had a chance to read our press release. We are adjusting revenue guidance from 2% to 4% constant currency growth to 1% to 2%. This reflects both the slow start we had to the year and the macroeconomic environment. We increased our expectation for non-GAAP operating margin for the year to 36%. The 36% margin reflects the benefit from an IP transaction closed during the quarter, which provided an incremental $35 million operating income, as well as driving more profitability from the organic business. In addition, we updated our original outlook on non-GAAP earnings per share growth from 9% to 12% to 10% to 12% in constant currency. And we reaffirmed our outlook on cash flow growth of 4% to 6% in constant currency. 
Despite the headwinds to top line growth we experienced during the quarter, we are committed to delivering the earnings per share and cash flow growth we provided at the beginning of the year. 
Now let me provide some comments on the market and our performance in the first quarter. Our revenue grew 1% in constant currency -- some growth but short of our expectations. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, including 3 points of contribution from our IP transaction. Our non-GAAP earnings per share and cash flow from operations were up 16% and 10%, respectively in constant currency, both also improved by the IP transaction. We had new product sales decline in North America and EMEA, growth in APJ and continued strong momentum in Latin America. Growth economies continue to reward our investments. 
Clearly, I'm not satisfied with the top line performance in the first quarter. Because of CA Technologies' highly ratable model, it is important for us to get a strong start and we didn't. We knew heading into the year that the renewal portfolio would be down. In fact, we shared this with you at Analyst Day last July and again in the Q4 fiscal 2012 earnings call. 
We also highlighted that first quarter was a trough for the portfolio for the year, with the portfolio coming in approximately 40% lower year-over-year. To give you a sense of this portfolio dynamic, the number of large renewals worth more than $10 million that closed during the quarter was 1/2 that of last year, 4 compared to 8. As a result, the value of large contracts signed during the quarter decreased by approximately $200 million. 
Renewal of the ELA continues to be a good opportunity for us to sell new products and new capacity. It builds energy and momentum in an account, both for us and the customer. When we have a lighter renewal inventory, we have less opportunity to sell new products. This is also the case for new mainframe capacity, which is tightly correlated to the renewal portfolio. As our portfolio builds in the second half of this year, this will help drive opportunities for new product sales and capacity. While that explains the dynamics behind new product sales and mainframe capacity related to the ELA, it is only part of the story. The other piece relates to the sales of new products outside the renewal. We did not deliver at the level we expected. 
We knew we had challenges selling outside the renewal and our customer segmentation initiative is designed to address that.  We created 3 distinct customer segments with unique approaches to reach each of our target customer segments: large, existing enterprise customers; large, new enterprise customers; and growth market customers. The addition of large, new enterprise and growth market customer segments more than doubles our total addressable market. Although we were below plan for the quarter, we did not anticipate significant traction in these new customer segments in the first half of the year. In fact, we continue to believe that the actions we took will be drivers in the back half of this year and beyond. 
What we did not adequately plan for in the first quarter was the level of disruption our new customer segmentation efforts would cause in the sales force and the impact it would have on our productivity in large, existing accounts. Any time you move people into new territories, create new coverage models and train extensively, it takes time away from the customers. When combined with the lighter renewal portfolio, we slowed our start to the year. The result, new capacity and new product sales were down approximately 30% year-over-year. 
So with the first quarter behind us and much of the move to customer segmentation largely complete, we are now back in the territories with a renewed focus and a clear set of objectives, further penetrating existing accounts and acquiring new customers. To realize our objectives, we have increased accountability throughout the organization and made a number of important changes. 
We've moved all disciplines associated with our growth markets business under one general manager worldwide. This allows regional executives to focus exclusively on execution in our large, existing and large, new enterprise accounts. We've consolidated all business operations into the finance team, scrubbed the sales pipeline for each region and customer segment and increased executive oversight in key transactions. As a result, we are confident in this afternoon's updated guidance. 
From a new product perspective, we are entering a strong product cycle, leveraging the investments we have made in organic development and intellectual property from our acquisitions. While we have introduced many products enhancements over the last decade and a half, these new solutions raise the bar of innovation and customer productivity. 
In June, we announced new releases of award-winning CA Mainframe Chorus, together with CA Database Management solutions that provide the fastest path to value for DB2 upgrades. 
Next month, we will introduce performance analytics capabilities to our service assurance portfolio. The new solution will focus on infrastructure, which we will extend to applications. We now have the ability to rapidly analyze the massive quantities of performance data we collect and provide customers insight into improving their quality of service and customer experience. Service providers in particular, will be able to leverage this capability to simplify and accelerate 4G network rollouts. 
Customer demand for new solutions that can be deployed in both on-premise and SaaS models continues to grow. Providing a choice of delivery model allows customers to migrate at their pace while preserving their current investment, which we believe is a competitive advantage. We continue to build our service management portfolio with these capabilities, including a mobile, self-service social interface, advanced dashboard and reporting analytics and world-class software asset management that we believe customers will find compelling. 
We will continue to introduce new products and solutions throughout the back half of the year. These present ongoing up-sell opportunities to our current customer base and differentiating technology to retain and attract new customers. Given the timing of these introductions and the associated sales cycles, we expect traction later in fiscal 2013. 
Before I turn the call over to Rich, I would like to address CEO succession. We are working on succession planning. My role, along with the Board of Directors, is to ensure the execution of an effective and smooth transition that will drive the company's future success. Our focus on the business will not waver during this transition, whenever it occurs. 
I also want to reaffirm that the Board of Directors and executive management team are committed to the $2.5 billion capital allocation plan we announced in January, including the $1 per share annual dividend and share repurchase program we have put in place. 
We remain on track to return an average 80% of our cumulative free cash flow through fiscal 2014, which we believe allows us the optimal mix of making investments in the business while returning cash directly to shareholders. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to provide details of the quarter."

Total revenue for the quarter was $1.15 billion, up 1% in constant currency and down 2% as reported. This includes a $32 million headwind from foreign exchange. 
From a segment perspective, Mainframe Solutions revenue was $628 million, flat in constant currency and down 3% as reported. As a reminder for your models, we have a challenging mainframe revenue compare in the third quarter due to a $39 million single license payment that occurred last year. 
Our Enterprise Solutions revenue was $426 million, up 2% in constant currency and flat as reported. 
Services revenue was $91 million, up 4% in constant currency and 1% as reported. 
Underlying these results, Mainframe Solutions new product sales for the quarter were down more than 30%, while new capacity sales were down more than 60%. New mainframe product and capacity sales are highly correlated to the timing of underlying renewals and will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. We anticipate that mainframe new product sales and capacity will accelerate in the back half of the year, driven by a more robust portfolio of renewals. 
Enterprise Solutions new product sales were down just over 20% this quarter. 
Finally, new Services engagements, which are highly dependent on new product sales, were down more than 15% year-over-year. 
Our renewal yield in the quarter was in the low 80% range. This is due to a single transaction, where the effect was amplified by the lower amount of renewals in the quarter. Excluding this transaction, our renewal yield was approximately 90%. We continue to expect full year renewal portfolio to be down single-digit year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2012, and it will be back-half loaded. 
Looking at revenue backlog. Current revenue backlog was $3.5 billion, down 1% in constant currency and 5% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $7.8 billion, down 5% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Backlog was affected by sales performance in the quarter, as well as the higher percentage of sales recognized as software fees and other. We will continue to see headwinds in backlog metrics as contracts burn off the balance sheet in anticipation of an increase in our 2014 renewal portfolio. 
As Bill mentioned, first quarter results include $35 million, or approximately $0.05 in GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share, from the assignment of certain intellectual property assets to a large technology company. This benefit was recorded as other income and was incremental to full year guidance provided in May. 
From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $439 million, up 8% in constant currency and 5% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, 35% excluding the IP transaction. 
Operating margin for Mainframe Solutions was 59%. Operating margins for Enterprise Solutions was 16%. The IP transaction contributed 8 points to Enterprise Solutions margin. 
Finally, operating margin for Services was 4%. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.63, up 16% in constant currency and 15% as reported. This includes a year-over-year $0.01 headwind from currency. For the first quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 31% compared to 32% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. 
Cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter was $183 million, up 10% in constant currency and 28% as reported. The difference in as-reported and constant currency growth is due to the positive FX impact of the U.S. dollar cash investment by our European subsidiaries. These investments protect the company against European event risk. Next quarter, the maturing FX hedge of these assets will be a headwind to as-reported cash flow growth. 
From a year-over-year perspective, cash flow growth was driven by lower tax payments in the quarter and the IP transaction. In addition, single installment payments were $123 million in the first quarter compared to $64 million in the previous period. This increase was driven by Q4 billings which were paid in Q1. 
Total billings backlog of $4.58 billion was down 8% in constant currency and 11% as reported. Billings backlog was affected by the first quarter decrease in sales. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in net cash. 
During the quarter, we successfully completed our accelerated share repurchase program with the receipt of 3.7 million shares. This was in addition to the 15 million shares received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Subsequent to the completion of the ASR, we repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares for approximately $96 million in Q1. We are authorized to repurchase an additional 900 million of common stock through fiscal 2014. 
Moving to first quarter GAAP results. First quarter GAAP operating margin was 33%, GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $381 million, up 10% in constant currency and 11% as reported. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.51, up 11% in constant currency and 13% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was 35% compared to 32% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. 
Now, let me turn to fiscal 2013 guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based upon exchange rates of the last day of the preceding quarter, or for this quarter, June 30, 2012. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. 
Updated guidance is the following: Total revenue growth is now expected to be 1% to 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.74 billion to $4.80 billion. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 10% to 12%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.50. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 12% to 14%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.07 to $2.12. 
We continue to expect that cash flow from operations will grow 4% to 6% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.54 billion to $1.57 billion. 
Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. 
Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to come in closer to the high end of the 30% to 31% we provided at the outset of this year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 452 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 459 million shares. We now expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 36% for fiscal year 2013. 
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

What you're seeing is when we have a low renewal portfolio, you have more as a percentage of what's being done in the quarter. Standalone transactions, they tend to be a little shorter than 3 years. Renewals tend to be a little bit longer. The most important part, if you recall, the top deals that were $10 million or more, there were only 4 this quarter, totaling a little over $60 million, whereas if you look at that same period a year earlier, it was $260 million. So that would elongate back to the normal 3, 3.5. So we're not concerned about this. This actually, we saw this not to this degree. If you look a couple of quarters back, I think it's about 1.5 years ago, you'll also see that when we had a low renewal portfolio and it was predominantly products being sold outside the renewal cycle, it will shorten.

So there were about 200 or so people who are unlayered and put into direct quota carrying. And then as Bill said, we also then hired in some people. There was some attrition as normal, but I would tell you our attrition is actually down year-over-year, so we're seeing good attrition in sales and across the entire company. So attrition is not a problem, which is why we can say that we and the job in the quarter that we're in are what we need to be from a sales. As Bill said, everyone's out in the territory now selling. The second part of that question, overall though, the total sales spending will be down slightly this year compared to last year as will the G&A piece, which allows us to drive to that 36% margin. So across those, we expect to see productivity improvement in the back half of the sales team and we have overall spending down. So it's a good combination to drive the 36% margin."

I'd like to start this afternoon by reviewing our first fiscal quarter and the drivers behind our updated guidance. I will discuss the challenges we faced, the progress we made and our execution-related initiatives. I'll then turn the call over to Rich for more detailed review of the financials and guidance before we open the call for questions. 
By now, I hope you've had a chance to read our press release. We are adjusting revenue guidance from 2% to 4% constant currency growth to 1% to 2%. This reflects both the slow start we had to the year and the macroeconomic environment. We increased our expectation for non-GAAP operating margin for the year to 36%. The 36% margin reflects the benefit from an IP transaction closed during the quarter, which provided an incremental $35 million operating income, as well as driving more profitability from the organic business. In addition, we updated our original outlook on non-GAAP earnings per share growth from 9% to 12% to 10% to 12% in constant currency. And we reaffirmed our outlook on cash flow growth of 4% to 6% in constant currency. 
Despite the headwinds to top line growth we experienced during the quarter, we are committed to delivering the earnings per share and cash flow growth we provided at the beginning of the year. 
Now let me provide some comments on the market and our performance in the first quarter. Our revenue grew 1% in constant currency. Some growth, but short of our expectations. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, including 3 points of contribution from our IP transaction. Our non-GAAP earnings per share and cash flow from operations were up 16% and 10%, respectively in constant currency, both also improved by the IP transaction. We had new product sales decline in North America and EMEA, growth in APJ and continued strong momentum in Latin America. Growth economies continue to reward our investments. 
Clearly, I'm not satisfied with the top line performance in the first quarter. Because of CA Technologies' highly ratable model, it is important for us to get a strong start and we didn't. We knew heading into the year that the renewal portfolio would be down. In fact, we shared this with you at Analyst Day last July and again in the Q4 fiscal 2012 earnings call. 
We also highlighted that first quarter was a trough for the portfolio for the year, with the portfolio coming in approximately 40% lower year-over-year. To give you a sense of this portfolio dynamic, the number of large renewals worth more than $10 million that closed during the quarter was 1/2 that of last year, 4 compared to 8. As a result, the value of large contracts signed during the quarter decreased by approximately $200 million. 
Renewal of the ELA continues to be a good opportunity for us to sell new products and new capacity. It builds energy and momentum in an account, both for us and the customer. When we have a lighter renewal inventory, we have less opportunity to sell new products. This is also the case for new mainframe capacity, which is tightly correlated to the renewal portfolio. As our portfolio builds in the second half of this year, this will help drive opportunities for new product sales and capacity. While that explains the dynamics behind new product sales and mainframe capacity related to the ELA, it is only part of the story. The other piece relates to the sales of new products outside the renewal. We did not deliver at the level we expected. 
We knew we had challenges selling outside the renewal and our customer segmentation initiative is designed to address that.  We created 3 distinct customer segments with unique approaches to reach each of our target customer segments: large, existing enterprise customers; large, new enterprise customers; and growth market customers. The addition of large, new enterprise and growth market customer segments more than doubles our total addressable market. Although we were below plan for the quarter, we did not anticipate significant traction in these new customer segments in the first half of the year. In fact, we continue to believe that the actions we took will be drivers in the back half of this year and beyond. 
What we did not adequately plan for in the first quarter was the level of disruption our new customer segmentation efforts would cause in the sales force and the impact it would have on our productivity in large, existing accounts. Any time you move people into new territories, create new coverage models and train extensively, it takes time away from the customers. When combined with the lighter renewal portfolio, we slowed our start to the year. The result, new capacity and new product sales were down approximately 30% year-over-year. 
So with the first quarter behind us and much of the move to customer segmentation largely complete, we are now back in the territories with a renewed focus and a clear set of objectives, further penetrating existing accounts and acquiring new customers. To realize our objectives, we have increased accountability throughout the organization and made a number of important changes. 
We've moved all disciplines associated with our growth markets business under one general manager worldwide. This allows regional executives to focus exclusively on execution in our large, existing and large, new enterprise accounts. We've consolidated all business operations into the finance team, scrubbed the sales pipeline for each region and customer segment and increased executive oversight in key transactions. As a result, we are confident in this afternoon's updated guidance. 
From a new product perspective, we are entering a strong product cycle, leveraging the investments we have made in organic development and intellectual property from our acquisitions. While we have introduced many products enhancements over the last decade and a half, these new solutions raise the bar of innovation and customer productivity. 
In June, we announced new releases of award-winning CA Mainframe Chorus, together with CA Database Management solutions that provide the fastest path to value for DB2 upgrades. 
Next month, we will introduce performance analytics capabilities to our service assurance portfolio. The new solution will focus on the infrastructure, which we will extend to applications. We now have the ability to rapidly analyze the massive quantities of performance data we collect and provide customers insight into improving their quality of service and customer experience. Service providers in particular, will be able to leverage this capability to simplify and accelerate 4G network rollouts. 
Customer demand for new solutions that can be deployed in both on-premise and SaaS models continues to grow. Providing a choice of delivery model allows customers to migrate at their pace while preserving their current investment, which we believe is a competitive advantage. We continue to build our service management portfolio with these capabilities, including a mobile, self-service social interface, advanced dashboard and reporting analytics and world-class software asset management that we believe customers will find compelling. 
We will continue to introduce new products and solutions throughout the back half of the year. These present ongoing up-sell opportunities to our current customer base and differentiating technology to retain and attract new customers. Given the timing of these introductions and the associated sales cycles, we expect traction later in fiscal 2013. 
Before I turn the call over to Rich, I would like to address CEO succession. We are working on succession planning. My role, along with the Board of Directors, is to ensure the execution of an effective and smooth transition that will drive the company's future success. Our focus on the business will not waver during this transition, whenever it occurs. 
I also want to reaffirm that the Board of Directors and executive management team are committed to the $2.5 billion capital allocation plan we announced in January, including the $1 per share annual dividend and share repurchase program we have put in place. 
We remain on track to return an average 80% of our cumulative free cash flow through fiscal 2014, which we believe allows us the optimal mix of making investments in the business while returning cash directly to shareholders. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to provide details of the quarter."

Total revenue for the quarter was $1.15 billion, up 1% in constant currency and down 2% as reported. This includes a $32 million headwind from foreign exchange. 
From a segment perspective, Mainframe Solutions revenue was $628 million, flat in constant currency and down 3% as reported. As a reminder for your models, we have a challenging mainframe revenue compare in the third quarter due to a $39 million single license payment that occurred last year. 
Our Enterprise Solutions revenue was $426 million, up 2% in constant currency and flat as reported. 
Services revenue was $91 million, up 4% in constant currency and 1% as reported. 
Underlying these results, Mainframe Solutions new product sales for the quarter were down more than 30%, while new capacity sales were down more than 60%. New mainframe product and capacity sales are highly correlated to the timing of underlying renewals and will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. We anticipate that mainframe new product sales and capacity will accelerate in the back half of the year, driven by a more robust portfolio of renewals. 
Enterprise Solutions new product sales were down just over 20% this quarter. 
Finally, new Services engagements, which are highly dependent on new product sales, were down more than 15% year-over-year. 
Our renewal yield in the quarter was in the low 80% range. This is due to a single transaction, where the effect was amplified by the lower amount of renewals in the quarter. Excluding this transaction, our renewal yield was approximately 90%. We continue to expect full year renewal portfolio to be down single-digit year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2012, and it will be back-half loaded. 
Looking at revenue backlog. Current revenue backlog was $3.5 billion, down 1% in constant currency and 5% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $7.8 billion, down 5% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Backlog was affected by sales performance in the quarter, as well as the higher percentage of sales recognized as software fees and other. We will continue to see headwinds in backlog metrics as contracts burn off the balance sheet in anticipation of an increase in our 2014 renewal portfolio. 
As Bill mentioned, first quarter results include $35 million, or approximately $0.05 in GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share, from the assignment of certain intellectual property assets to a large technology company. This benefit was recorded as other income and was incremental to full year guidance provided in May. 
From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $439 million, up 8% in constant currency and 5% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, 35% excluding the IP transaction. 
Operating margin for Mainframe Solutions was 59%. Operating margins for Enterprise Solutions was 16%. The IP transaction contributed 8 points to Enterprise Solutions margin. 
Finally, operating margin for Services was 4%. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.63, up 16% in constant currency and 15% as reported. This includes a year-over-year $0.01 headwind from currency. For the first quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 31% compared to 32% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. 
Cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter was $183 million, up 10% in constant currency and 28% as reported. The difference in as-reported and constant currency growth is due to the positive FX impact of the U.S. dollar cash investment by our European subsidiaries. These investments protect the company against European event risk. Next quarter, the maturing FX hedge of these assets will be a headwind to as-reported cash flow growth. 
From a year-over-year perspective, cash flow growth was driven by lower tax payments in the quarter and the IP transaction. In addition, single installment payments were $123 million in the first quarter compared to $64 million in the previous period. This increase was driven by Q4 billings which were paid in Q1. 
Total billings backlog of $4.58 billion was down 8% in constant currency and 11% as reported. Billings backlog was affected by the first quarter decrease in sales. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in net cash. 
During the quarter, we successfully completed our accelerated share repurchase program with the receipt of 3.7 million shares. This was in addition to the 15 million shares received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Subsequent to the completion of the ASR, we repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares for approximately $96 million in Q1. We are authorized to repurchase an additional 900 million of common stock through fiscal 2014. 
Moving to first quarter GAAP results. First quarter GAAP operating margin was 33%, GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $381 million, up 10% in constant currency and 11% as reported. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.51, up 11% in constant currency and 13% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was 35% compared to 32% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. 
Now, let me turn to fiscal 2013 guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based upon exchange rates of the last day of the preceding quarter, or for this quarter, June 30, 2012. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. 
Updated guidance is the following: Total revenue growth is now expected to be 1% to 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.74 billion to $4.80 billion. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 10% to 12%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.50. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 12% to 14%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.07 to $2.12. 
We continue to expect that cash flow from operations will grow 4% to 6% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.54 billion to $1.57 billion. 
Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. 
Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to come in closer to the high end of the 30% to 31% we provided at the outset of this year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 452 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 459 million shares. We now expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 36% for fiscal year 2013. 
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

What you're seeing is when we have a low renewal portfolio, you have more as a percentage of what's being done in the quarter: standalone transactions, they tend to be a little shorter than 3 years; renewals tend to be a little bit longer. The most important part, if you recall, the top deals that were $10 million or more, there were only 4 this quarter, totaling a little over $60 million, whereas if you look at that same period a year earlier, it was $260 million. So that would elongate back to the normal 3, 3.5. So we're not concerned about this. This actually, we saw this not to this degree. If you look a couple of quarters back, I think it's about 1.5 years ago, you'll also see that when we had a low renewal portfolio and it was predominantly products being sold outside the renewal cycle, it will shorten.

So attrition is not a problem, which is why we can say that we and the job in the quarter that we're in are what we need to be from a sales. As Bill said, everyone's out in the territory now selling. The second part of that question, overall though, the total sales spending will be down slightly this year compared to last year as will the G&A piece, which allows us to drive to that 36% margin. So across those, we expect to see productivity improvement in the back half of the sales team and we have overall spending down. So it's a good combination to drive the 36% margin."

Thank you for joining us. I hope you have had a chance to review our press releases announcing our third quarter fiscal 2012 earnings and our enhanced capital allocation program. I'll start this afternoon wit",1734,"Thanks, Kelsey and good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining us. I hope you have had a chance to review our press releases announcing our third quarter fiscal 2012 earnings and our enhanced capital allocation program. I'll start this afternoon with a brief overview of our third quarter performance. I'll then talk to you about our capital allocation strategy, which we first discussed with you at Investor Day in July and then indicated in October that we would provide you an update this quarter. I will conclude with a review of our progress driving sales growth and margin expansion. Rich will then provide details on the quarter and guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2012. We'll then take your questions.
In the third quarter, we saw growth in revenue and EPS and operating margin expansion, even after adjusting for a single license payment we received. As noted in our release, the unsolicited early single payment from a software company relates to a license agreement we entered into in connection with a litigation settlement we first announced in February 2009. This payment was not included in annual guidance provided by the company in October because we expected it in fiscal years 2013 and 2014.
Headlines from the quarter, which reflect year-over-year growth rates include: revenue growth of 10% in constant currency and as reported. The license payment added about 3 points to this growth. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, including approximately 2 points from the license payment. Non-GAAP earnings per share growth was 28% in constant currency. The license payment added 10% to this growth. Cash flow from operations, including the license payment, declined 19% in constant currency and 20% as reported. As we had anticipated, cash flow for fiscal 2012 is weighted towards the fourth quarter and this afternoon, we confirmed our cash flow guidance for the year. Our current revenue backlog grew 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported.
While we had a good quarter on many measures and continued to make solid progress against our long-term goals, we know we are not done. We remain focused on executing our strategy and driving further operational improvements, including new product sales, execution in EMEA, greater sales productivity and continued work on our expense structure.
Now let me go to our enhanced capital allocation program, starting with some background. As you recall, in July, we said as part of our long-term guidance, that we expected to return 40% to 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. As I mentioned in October, management and the board were continuing to evaluate ways to optimize our balance sheet, while maintaining the financial flexibility we need to build our business and continue to improve our competitive positioning. We believe our enhanced capital allocation program announced this afternoon puts us on a path to achieving a balanced approach to return more cash to shareholders, while still enabling us to invest in our future. This is a logical extension of the strategic and operational priorities we outlined at Investor Day.
Fundamentally, the dividend increase and share repurchase authorization underscore the board's and management's confidence in the company's long-term business outlook and our ability to generate significant free cash flow on a consistent basis. It is our consistent free cash flow, driven by our current and projected operating performance, that allows us to fund this ongoing return of capital and at the same time, continue to invest in our future to further improve our strategic market position and deliver superior mainframe enterprise and cloud solutions and services to our customers.
Today, we are focused on 3 priorities to build long-term value for CA Technologies customers, employees and shareholders. First, to continue to execute our strategy and improve our operating performance. Second, to provide for a greater return of cash to shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases. And third, to effectively use the balance sheet to return additional cash in the near term through an accelerated buyback.
In summary, we are targeting to return to shareholders approximately $2.5 billion through fiscal year 2014, or about 80% of our expected cumulative free cash flow over that period.
Key elements of the program include: One, an increase in the dividend from an annualized rate of $0.20 per share to $1 per share. That is a yield of approximately 4.5% based on yesterday's closing market price and currently puts our dividend yield at the top of comparable technology companies. The board and management view returning cash to shareholders through dividends as an important component of our overall approach to enhancing shareholder value.
Two, a new $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization through fiscal 2014, including an accelerated repurchase of approximately $500 million under an agreement to be executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Including the accelerated share repurchase and shares repurchased year-to-date, we expect we will have spent approximately $1 billion to buy back shares during fiscal year 2012. The $1.5 billion authorization replaces the approximately $230 million remaining under our current authorization. We are confident we have the balance sheet capacity to get this done and the program is expected to be funded by available U.S. cash.
Three, our strategic plan anticipates that we will continue our investment in the business consistent with that of previous years, or approximately $1 billion annually. This includes acquisition activity in the range of $300 million to $500 million per year, on average, through fiscal 2014 and the approximately $600 million we invest on average each year in organic research and development.
So let me answer the critical question of how we intend to continue to improve execution against our strategic plan. As we've highlighted in this afternoon's capital allocation release, we remain comfortable with the long-term targets for the period ending March 31, 2015, that we provided at Investor Day in July. This includes an acceleration to mid-single digit constant currency organic revenue growth and an expansion of our non-GAAP operating margin by 100 basis points a year. Our expectation is that, over time, much of this operating margin expansion will come from improvements in execution in our Enterprise Solutions segment, driven by accelerating product sales and greater efficiency in our sales force. We intend to continue to drive more growth and more profit from each dollar we invest, and we will continue to systematically improve productivity and efficiency in our organization.
In our second quarter earnings call, we outlined 3 immediate growth initiatives: Expanding product penetration in new accounts and growth geographies; continuing to improve our results in EMEA; and driving consistent performance out of our acquisitions. In terms of product penetration, this past quarter, we focused on 3 main areas.
First, we continued our market segmentation initiative, which as a first step, includes the rebalancing of our sales force to align what has been a highly concentrated coverage model to new opportunities in approximately 1,000 large new enterprise accounts and approximately 7,000 accounts in the midmarket. Focus in these groups on sales of new products to new customers, our market segmentation effort is designed to drive product penetration in new accounts and accelerate performance of our acquisitions.
Second, we told you we expect to add an incremental 300 new quota-carrying sales reps globally by year end. 1/3 of these resources will be new to CA Technologies, while 2/3 reflect a reallocation of existing internal resources. All of this will be accomplished under our current expense profile. At this point, we are approximately halfway through this process and expect to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter.
Finally, we have continued to make significant investments in growth geographies. These are long-term investments in markets that are key to accelerating new product sales and our ongoing success in the years to come. This quarter, we had excellent results in Latin America, where we added more than 30 new enterprise customers to the region and expanded our footprint in more than 60 current customers. In Asia Pacific, we added more than 30 new logos to the region, including 15 for Nimsoft. Growth in new product sales more than doubled in China and grew more than 40% in Korea.
Next in EMEA. We believe the team we have in place is introducing the right discipline and incentive structure to keep both our renewals process and new business pipeline on track. Our plan is focused on improving sales execution and productivity, driving marketing and brand awareness and developing our people. While we do not want to get ahead of ourselves, we were pleased to see modest revenue growth in EMEA this quarter and wins with Volkswagen, SAP, Daimler and Crédit Agricole.
Lastly, with respect to acquisitions, we believe our strategy to aggressively capitalize on the evolution of virtualization management, cloud computing implementation and SaaS delivery of IT is working. We continue to focus on driving results from investments we have made, both through organic development and in companies such as Nimsoft, 3Tera AppLogic, ITKO and Arcot. Results achieved during the quarter give us confidence that our strategy to reach new customers and the midmarket is the right one. This quarter, Nimsoft added a record 100 new logos and in December, we received notification that Net One Systems formally selected Nimsoft to be their platform of choice for their future business services for their XOC managed operations center, one of the largest in Japan.
We closed a significant transaction with IGT, which selected AppLogic to continue innovating how casino games, systems and experiences are delivered with the IGT cloud.
ITKO delivered a record quarter, closed 5 deals over $1 million and saw their average transaction size significantly increase. Customers like DIRECTV and SoCal Edison report return on their investment in ITKO in terms of weeks and continued to expand their usage and licenses.
Finally, Arcot is protecting approximately 150 million identities worldwide. During the 2011 holiday shopping season, we averaged 1 million transactions per day for our e-commerce authentication on our SaaS platform.
In conclusion, the strategic initiatives and priorities we continue to pursue, in combination with our enhanced capital allocation program, reflect the ongoing commitment of the CA Technologies board, management and employees to deliver outstanding solutions and services to our customers and attractive, sustainable returns to CA shareholders.
Now I will turn the call over to Rich for a closer look at the third quarter."

Turning to our third quarter results, please note that our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated and all results are from continuing operations.

Turning to our third quarter results, please note that our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated and all results are from continuing operations. As Bill mentioned, this quarter's result include the single license payment from the software company. This payment came in earlier than we had anticipated and was not included in the fiscal year 2012 guidance we provided in October.
The single license payment contributed the following to the quarter: revenue of $39 million reported in our Mainframe Solutions segment and in the Software, Fees and Other line on the P&L; GAAP and non-GAAP operating income of $36 million; GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.05; and cash flow of $39 million.
Total revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion and grew 10% in constant currency and as reported. 8 points of this growth was organic, while 2 points of this growth came from acquisitions. This quarter, we saw a $20 million increase in perpetual sales associated with Enterprise Solution products, including $10 million of products that were newly eligible for upfront recognition during the quarter.
From a segment perspective, Mainframe Solution revenue was $682 million, up 9% in constant currency and as reported. The single license payment contributed 6 points of growth in constant currency and as reported to Mainframe Solutions.
Our Enterprise Solutions revenue was $478 million, up 11% in constant currency and 12% as reported. Services revenue was $103 million, up 16% in constant currency and 17% as reported.
Underlying our results for the quarter, total new capacity and new product sales were up low-single digits. In Mainframe Solutions, new product sales for the quarter grew, both with and without single license payment. Capacity sales were down more than 20%. Quarter-to-quarter capacity will fluctuate, driven by the nature of the customers in our underlying renewal portfolio. Year-to-date, we are encouraged by the capacity trends which are up and believe that IBM Mainframe is bringing increased attention to the platform and over time, should serve as a slow, steady tailwind to CA Technologies.
Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were down approximately 5%. We saw growth in Virtualization and Automation and Identity and Access Management. This was offset by Service Portfolio Management and Service Assurance. Underneath these Service Assurance results, we saw growth in Application Performance Management that was offset by infrastructure monitoring.  Finally, new service engagements were down slightly year-over-year.
Our renewal yield was just below 90%. We closed one transaction, a merger, that negatively skewed the results during the quarter. Excluding this transaction, the renewal yield would have been in the mid-90s. We continue to expect the 2012 renewal portfolio to be down approximately 15% year-over-year. For modeling purposes, please note that fourth quarter 2012 renewals face a difficult year-over-year comparison. This is due to a more than $500 million system integrator license agreement that was signed last year in our fiscal fourth quarter.
Looking at revenue backlog. Current revenue backlog was $3.6 billion, up 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $8.1 billion, up 2% in constant currency and as reported.
From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $475 million, up 21% in constant currency and 23% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. Operating margins for Mainframe Solutions was 59%. Operating margins for Enterprise Solutions was 12%. This includes 4 points of continued investment in this segment. Finally, operating margin for Services was 11%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.65, up 28% in constant currency and 30% as reported, including a year-over-year $0.01 tailwind from currency. This quarter, EPS benefited from the previously mentioned license payment, operational improvements and our stock repurchase program.
Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the third quarter of 2012 was 31.5%. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $396 million, down 19% in constant currency and 20% as reported. Single installment payments were $107 million in the third quarter compared to $152 million in the previous period. Total billings backlog of $5 billion was up 7% in constant currency and 6% as reported. DSOs were essentially flat year-over-year.
Moving to third quarter GAAP results, third quarter operating margin before interest and taxes was 33%. GAAP operating income was $413 million, up 22% in constant currency and 24% as reported. And GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.54, up 39% in constant currency and 42% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was 34.9%.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in net cash. Between October 1 and December 31, we purchased approximately 9.6 million shares of stock for a total of approximately $200 million.
Now let me turn to fiscal 2012 guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based on December 31 exchange rates. This includes a partial hedge of operating income and updates our expectations for share count. Guidance is the following: total revenue growth is now expected to be 6% in constant currency, at the high end of our previous range of 5% to 6%. This translates to reported revenue of $4.8 billion; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 11% to 13%, an increase from our previous range of 7% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.21 to $2.25. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 11% to 13%, an increase from our previous range of 6% to 9%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.86 to $1.90.
We continue to expect that cash flow from operations will grow at 3% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.44 billion to $1.47 billion. Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 31% to 32% in this fiscal year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 463 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 486 million shares. This share count reflects the $500 million ASR under an agreement we expect to execute in the company's fourth quarter. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be a strong 34% for fiscal year 2012. And now, I will turn the call back over to Bill."

The acquisitions we've been making over the last 2 years, many of them now have moved into the organic area and as we've added additional capability to those, those are supporting our organic growth as we go forward and that'll continue into next year. When you look at the segmentation that we talked about in the last quarter, with the 300 additional sales reps we're moving out and we're moving into the segmentation area, that growth, new products and new accounts, will add to the organic growth as we go forward. And I think one of the probably key points that's worth looking at in the quarter is that you may recall a year ago when Nimsoft was reporting, we talked about 20 or 30 new accounts. We had over 200 new logos in the quarter. And so, with Nimsoft and with Latin America coming on very strong, now starting to get growth in the Asia countries and a return a bit from EMEA, we're starting to see the organic growth coming out of what we had previously done from the new products and acquisitions, as well as from new segmentation pieces.

We don't want to get ahead of ourselves as Bill had said earlier. On your first part of the question, most of the improvements we'll see next year, we continue to make improvements on G&A. It will all be predominantly in the Enterprise Solutions segment, as we talked about back in July, and you see us continuing to demonstrate efficiencies that we're able to work through the business in all elements. So sales will become more efficient. We talked about the 300 people that by Q1 will have moved out of overlay positions into quota carrying. So that drives your sales E/R. Our development E/R, we think, is actually set fairly well. So we're not looking to do much to the sales here. We would always continue to make improvements to the G&A line.

And then just secondly, I wanted to ask, I understand, Rich, what you're saying about there's no need to issue debt here, but I guess my question would be why not? If you look a few years ago, CA had $1 billion more in net cash and $1 billion more in debt. So clearly, there's the flexibility on the balance sheet, and it would give you more flexibility today, including the possibility of an even greater return of cash to shareholders, particularly when the cost of debt is so low.

Thank you for joining us. I'd like to start this afternoon by providing some detail on CA Technologies second quarter results and our revised annual and long-term guidance. I will then turn the call over to Ri",1292,"Thanks, Kelsey, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to start this afternoon by providing some detail on CA Technologies second quarter results and our revised annual and long-term guidance. I will then turn the call over to Rich for a more detailed review of the financials and updated guidance before we open the call for questions. 
Let me start by saying that our second quarter was short of our objectives in several areas. Obviously, we are disappointed in our performance because we did not expect the macroeconomic environment to recover quickly and we therefore expect that our marketing transition will be elongated. We are lowering our guidance for the year. I will walk you through the quarter, what has changed in our outlook, what did not work well and some things that did work well. 
Before I do that, let me turn to our expectations as we entered fiscal year '13. We knew the fiscal year '13 renewal portfolio will be down year-over-year. We also knew that we would be reorganizing the salesforce and we were sensitive that the economy might be a headwind this year. Having said that, there are 2 critical aspects of our business that are not performing to plan. 
First, underlying our performance new product and capacity sales did not come in as expected, particularly new sales outside of the renewal. New product and capacity sales were down approximately 25%. Second, as we've outlined our sales force reorganization has been slower to gain traction than we had expected. Clearly, I'm not satisfied with our sales execution and transition to segment marketing, which is the key to our future growth. Finally, I would be remiss in not mentioning the weakening global economic outlook which has impacted our performance. In fact, we saw sales cycle elongate and deals slip out of the quarter. This trend exacerbated our efforts to sell to new customers under the segmented marketing model. 
As we told you when we announced quarter 1, we are closely inspecting the pipeline and managing progression from a segmented view. This is new. This inspection improved the visibility into end quality of pipeline, but shifted the expected time of closing of some transactions to future quarters. All of these was exacerbated by the macroeconomic climate. The results, as Rich will review in greater detail, is that we are reducing our full year expectations for revenue in constant-currency growth to negative 3% to negative 1%. This resulted in updated cash flow guidance of negative 8% to negative 4% in constant currency. 
However, we will continue our focus on cost and expense control through the second half of the year and expect our non-GAAP operating margin which we raised last quarter to be 36% for the full year. As a result, we are updating our outlook for non-GAAP EPS growth to 6% to 10% in constant currency. 
Before addressing the plan for the balance of the year, let me place our second quarter results in perspective. First, there were headwinds that we knew we would have to contend with during the quarter. With the renewal portfolio down year-over-year and the mainframe portion down even more, we expected capacity sales to be down. This, coupled with an uneven macroeconomic environment where buyers are being cautious, resulted in capacity been down approximately 60%. Based on our performance in the first quarter, we saw a trailing effect in cash flows as our quarter 1 new product sales shortfall created a gap in billings that affected Q2. Additionally, our renewal yield was in the high 80% range, a little bit lower than historical levels in this tough economic environment but attributed to 2 transactions. The pipeline, while building, is building slower than we expected. This is the second quarter in a row North America has been down and the impact of economic political uncertainty in Europe was even greater than we expected. As a result, several core product lines declined, including our Application Performance Management and Infrastructure Management businesses. At the same time, there are areas of the business which are performing, though of smaller basis. They include, Mainframe new product sales which were up approximately 10% year-over-year. 
In Latin America, where we have been leveraging channels and partners for 2 years, we grew high teens. APJ, excluding Japan, where we also implemented a partner in segmentation program earlier, was up midteens. Both demonstrated that our segment marketing can produce improved results. Technology investments such as ITKO and Nimsoft delivered double-digit new product sales growth in the quarter and our SaaS revenue grew by more than 30%. 
Let me assure you that CA Technologies competitive position is sound. I talk with customers and visit clients every week and I remain confident that we are well-positioned in the market and our portfolio of products and solutions is compelling. Because of our weak new product sales this year and the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we see a dampening effect on revenue and cash flow growth next year. As a result, we are modifying our long-term guidance. We continue to believe the multi-year financial objectives that we previously shared are correct but we now believe the timeline to reach these objectives will extend beyond our original expectations. We feel very comfortable with our ability to generate cash flow. We expect approximately $1.4 billion in cash flow from operations this year and can come from dividend, share buyback and future investments in the company. The Board of Directors and I remain committed to delivering our $2.5 billion capital allocation plan. This includes the $1 per share annual dividend and share repurchase program we have put in place. 
Now let me turn to our plan to improve the execution of the second half. First, we are continuing to introduce new products to the portfolio. This past quarter, we launched Infrastructure Management 2.0 and Nimsoft Monitors 6 which, together arm our sales force with what we believe is the most complete Infrastructure Management solutions in the market. We will continue to extend our service strategy with a new version of CA Executive Insight, which adds capacity planning dated to our solution that provides managers with IT insight and a business context; expanded monitoring capabilities for mobile browsing in a new version of APM Cloud Monitor; and new integrations of APM with CA from our ITKO acquisition, which will provide advance performance analytics for better decisions in Service Virtualization and testing. 
As I said in the first quarter, we are entering a period of increased product introductions. Second, we are focused on building our partner ecosystem. For example, our partnerships with the India headquarter global systems integrators have driven an approximately 200% increase in related new contract value and we added more than 20 new MSPs at critical distribution channel to reach growth markets. We also recently announced the partnership with Citrix to provide additional management and monitoring capabilities on top of Citrix cloud and desktop virtualization solutions. Products includes CA Nimsoft Monitor, CA Automation Suite and CA Server Automation. 
Third, we are continuing to pay close attention to our expense profile to assure we deliver the 36% non-GAAP operating margin we outlook for the year. We know we work to do, to sell more new products. The full impact of market segmentation was not evident in Q2 and it is going to take longer than we originally expected to gain traction. Our market segmentation has put short-term pressure on our performance. We implemented this strategy because we believe it is the right thing to do for our business and it will have long-term benefits for the future of CA Technologies. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to provide details of the quarter and guidance."

Total revenue for the quarter was $1.15 billion, flat in constant currency and down 4% as reported. This includes a $43 million headwind from foreign exchange. In Mainframe Solutions, revenue was $619 million, down 2% in constant currency and 5% as reported. I want to remind you that we have an unfavorable Mainframe revenue compare in the third quarter due to a $39 million single-license payment that occurred in Q3 last year. 
Turning to Enterprise Solutions, revenue was $438 million, up 1% percent in constant currency and down 2% as reported. Services revenue was $95 million, up 3% in constant currency and down 1% as reported. New Services engagements, which are heavily dependent on new product sales, were down 15% year-over-year. We now expect FY '13 renewal portfolio to be down closer to 10% as compared to FY '12 with Q3 down year-over-year and growth in the fourth quarter. 
Looking at the revenue backlog, current revenue backlog was $3.5 billion, down 2% in constant currency and 3% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $7.5 billion, down 7% in constant currency and 8% as reported. 
Backlog was affected by sales performance in the first half of the year. We also continue to see a headwind the backlog metrics, as contracts burn off the balance sheet in anticipation of an increasing our 2014 renewal portfolio. From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $406 million, up 12% in constant currency and 7% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 35%. 
Operating margin for Mainframe Solutions was 60%. Operating margins for Enterprise Solutions was 6%. Finally, operating margins for Services was 6%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.59, up 22% in constant currency and 16% as reported. This includes a year-over-year $0.02 headwind from currency. For the second quarter, non-GAAP tax rate was 31% compared to 32% for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter was $89 million, down 50% in constant currency and 53% as reported. The FFO was affected by weaker new product sales. We have adjusted our full year outlook accordingly. 
Single installment payments were $95 million in the second quarter, compared to $100 million in the previous period. Total Billings backlog of $4.5 billion was down 10% in constant currency and as reported. Billings backlog was affected by sales performance in the first half of the year. We ended the quarter with approximately $790 million in net cash. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 9.7 million shares for $250 million. We are authorized to repurchase an additional 654 million of common stock for fiscal 2014. 
Moving to second quarter GAAP results, second quarter GAAP operating margin was 29%. GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $337 million, up 12% in constant currency and 1% as reported. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.48, up 15% in constant currency and 2% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was 32% compared to 28% for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. 
Now, let me turn to fiscal 2013 guidance. As been our practice, guidance is based on exchange rate on the last day of the preceding quarter, or for this quarter, September 30, 2012. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. Before I review guidance, I would like to comment on this afternoon's update. Our adjustments take into account both our macroeconomic, which is elongated purchasing cycles and our current view of pipeline progression for the second half of FY '13. 
Updated guidance is the following. Total revenues now expected to be negative 3% to negative 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.58 billion to $4.67 billion. The point of this year-over-year decline in revenue is attributed to a $39 million single-license payment that occurred last year and will not recur. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in a range of 6% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.36 to $2.44. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 8% to 12%, which translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.99 to $2.07. 
Cash flow from operations growth in constant currencies is now expected to be the range of negative 8% to negative 4%. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.38 billion to $1.44 billion. Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to come in closer to the high end of the 30% to 31% we provided at the outset of the year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 449 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 458 million shares. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 36% for fiscal year 2013. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

Market segmentation is the right strategy for CA Technologies. Expanding beyond our core 1000 customers by accessing new channels, leveraging new partnerships and improving our coverage model, will drive growth and expand profitability. 
At the outset of the fiscal year, the timing looked right to introduce these changes. With a lighter renewal portfolio, we hope to minimize the effect on our existing customer base. However, over the last 6 months, we have continued to be challenged selling outside the renewal, both our existing customers as well as potential new ones. Driving this amount of change in an unpredictable economy proved more difficult than we anticipated. Because of our transition to segment marketing and expectations that the macro will not recover significantly, we are not projecting a rebound in the second half of this fiscal year. 
That being said, we understand the challenges we face. We have reset the timeline of our expectations but not our goals, profitability and acquiring new customers. We continue to focus carefully and all details of our sales execution and will continue that focus until we reach our objectives. Now Kelsey, back to you."

In Q2, what we saw was a slight difference and that was a little bit of a elongation in some of these transactions that we're now going to have later on the year. That predominantly sits in the distributor or Enterprise Solutions segment and that $150 million worth of perpetual licenses normally would have flowed to direct cash, as well as the revenue associated with it for the licenses.

Competitive wise, we're very strong position. In fact, one of the things I reviewed going through some of these comments where we've launched several products as we went through this quarter and we are on the front end of a very strong new product announcement cycle. So we don't see competitive losses. So we feel strong on that. If you take a look at the new product sales, it varies by segment. If you look inside the existing accounts, probably the macros that we talked about is probably the biggest factor. Decisions are slowing down. We don't see people making decisions without going out there, there change for approvals as they do it. So that does delay things. And in some cases, customers because of their own demand cycles, are delaying projects or pushing projects out. It's not directly related with the new sales but on the front of the renewal point of view and the existing, the future agreements sometimes in the past have been brought forward. We're not getting as many requests on that. And some that are brought forward to us, we've rejected because we think it has too much impact on the future. So that would sort of put the existing in place. If you look at the new, as Rich mentioned, we're building the pipe as we go through the quarter. The quality of that pipe is better. If you recall, we said and we put that in place was a 2 year plan. We do have accelerators on though for our reps to close the new orders in, the new Enterprise segment as soon as they can and we are moving that competitive accounts. And clearly, the macro cycle, because there are many cases the same size as our existing accounts, the macro environment place on that as well. Then finally, on the growth side, we're building that pipe but we're also going into partnerships with our business partners. And so the productivity, that takes time. Then all 3 of those, as I mentioned, are being impacted and elongated with respect to how implement the segmentation."

And Identity and Access Management, that continues strong. Our was strong but as we've said many times, quarter-to-quarter security goes up and down. We had a strong quarter. I think it was the first quarter it was down a little bit in the second quarter and came back again in the third quarter. It was a longer sales cycle than it is with a lot of our products but security, as I traveled the world, there is nothing that I talk about more because of customers asking us questions, because of the implementation of the cloud, whether it's private or public or a combination of those, is that security piece. So it continues to be a very strong demand for us and we believe it will primarily because of the cloud and that's one of the things we did first, is move our security into the cloud."

That's driven, frankly, by some of the investments we've been making now for the last year, year and a half in our product set that we call the Chorus products and our tools that we provided in that the area. That's helping to improve our revenue in that area. We look at 90% renewal rate as we do the renewals on those. And then I think the final piece of that is when you look at the capacity piece of mainframe, it is largely driven by the customers increased volumes or increased demand. There's been times in the past, for example, in the financial industry which is important to us were we've been the recipient benefits of large banks buying smaller banks. And then that load is transferred onto that and that has pushed some of that capacity. I think what we're seeing now across probably all segments is that there is appears to be a reduction of the demand that those people have. That reduction in demand is impressing them to put capacity on. So that is, I think, one of the key pieces that we see happen with respect the capacity. Then a final point would be that competitive win back. I think a lot of the new tools that we provided in the mainframe area, we are now winning in the mainframe marketplace. And that's adding to our revenue as well. So does that answer your question?"

That was my point earlier when I said why we're more comfortable at the 10% than before we set in the mid-single digits, is we're seeing just a little bit smaller in total transactions as they are being cautious, which I think in their case, it goes back again to the economy."

I'd like to start this afternoon by providing some detail on CA Technologies second quarter results and our revised annual and long-term guidance. I will then turn the call over to Rich for a more detailed review of the financials and updated guidance before we open the call for questions.
Let me start by saying that our second quarter was short of our objectives in several areas. Obviously, we are disappointed in our performance. Because we do not expect the macroeconomic environment to recover quickly and we therefore expect that our marketing transition will be elongated, we are lowering our guidance for the year. I will walk you through the quarter, what has changed in our outlook, what did not work well and some things that did work well.
Before I do that, let me turn to our expectations as we entered fiscal year '13. We knew the fiscal year '13 renewal portfolio would be down year-over-year. We also knew that we would be reorganizing the sales force, and we were sensitive that the economy might be a headwind this year. Having said that, there are 2 critical aspects of our business that are not performing to plan.
First, underlying our performance, new product and capacity sales did not come in as expected, particularly new sales outside of the renewal. New product and capacity sales were down approximately 25%.
Second, as we've outlined, our sales force reorganization has been slower to gain traction than we had expected. Clearly, I'm not satisfied with our sales execution and transition to segment marketing, which is a key to our future growth.
Finally, I would be remiss in not mentioning the weakening global economic outlook which has impacted our performance. In fact, we saw sales cycles elongate and deals slip out of the quarter. This trend exacerbated our efforts to sell to new customers under the segmented marketing model.
As we told you when we announced quarter 1, we are closely inspecting the pipeline and managing progression from a segmented view. This is new. This inspection improved the visibility into and quality of pipeline, but shifted the expected time of closing of some transactions to future quarters. All of this was exacerbated by the macroeconomic climate.
The result, as Rich will review in greater detail, is that we are reducing our full year expectations for revenue in constant currency growth to negative 3% to negative 1%. This results in updated cash flow guidance of negative 8% to negative 4% in constant currency.
However, we will continue our focus on cost and expense control through the second half of the year and expect our non-GAAP operating margin, which we raised last quarter, to be 36% for the full year. As a result, we are updating our outlook for non-GAAP EPS growth to 6% to 10% in constant currency.
Before addressing the plan for the balance of the year, let me place our second quarter results in perspective. First, there were headwinds that we knew we would have to contend with during the quarter. With the renewal portfolio down year-over-year and the mainframe portion down even more, we expected capacity sales to be down. This, coupled with an uneven macro environment where buyers are being cautious, resulted in capacity being down approximately 60%.
Based on our performance in the first quarter, we saw a trailing effect on cash flows, as our quarter 1 new product sales shortfall created a gap in billings that affected Q2.
Additionally, our renewal yield was in the high 80% range, a little bit lower than historical levels in this tough economic environment, but attributed to 2 transactions. The pipeline, while building, is building slower than we expected. This is the second quarter in a row North America has been down, and the impact of the economic political uncertainty in Europe was even greater than we expected. As a result, several core product lines declined, including our Application Performance Management and Infrastructure Management businesses.
At the same time, there are areas of the business which are performing, though off smaller bases. They include: Mainframe new product sales, which were up approximately 10% year-over-year; in Latin America, where we have been leveraging channels and partners for 2 years, we grew high teens; APJ, excluding Japan, where we also implemented a partner in segmentation program earlier, was up mid-teens. Both demonstrated that our segment marketing can produce improved results. Technology investments, such as ITKO and Nimsoft, delivered double-digit new product sales growth in the quarter; and our SaaS revenue grew by more than 30%.
Let me assure you that CA Technologies competitive position is sound. I talk with customers and visit clients every week. And I remain confident that we are well-positioned in the market, and our portfolio of products and solutions is compelling.
Because of our weak new product sales this year and the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we see a dampening effect on revenue and cash flow growth next year. As a result, we are modifying our long-term guidance. We continue to believe the multi-year financial objectives that we previously shared are correct, but we now believe the timeline to reach these objectives will extend beyond our original expectations.
We feel very comfortable with our ability to generate cash flow. We expect approximately $1.4 billion in cash flow from operations this year and can fund the dividend, share buyback and future investments in the company. The Board of Directors and I remain committed to delivering our $2.5 billion capital allocation plan. This includes the $1 per share annual dividend and share repurchase program we have put in place.
Now let me turn to our plan to improve execution in the second half. First, we are continuing to introduce new products to the portfolio. This past quarter, we launched Infrastructure Management 2.0 and Nimsoft Monitor 6, which together arm our sales force with what we believe is the most complete infrastructure management solutions in the market. We will continue to extend our Service Assurance strategy with: A new version of CA Executive Insight, which adds capacity planning data to a solution that provides managers with IT insight in a business context; expanded monitoring capabilities for mobile browsing in a new version of APM Cloud Monitor; and new integrations of APM with CA LISA from our ITKO acquisition, which will provide advanced performance analytics for better decisions in service virtualization and testing.
As I said in the first quarter, we are entering a period of increased product introductions. Second, we are focused on building our partner ecosystem. For example, our partnerships with the India-headquartered global systems integrators have driven an approximately 200% increase in related new contract value. And we added more than 20 new MSPs, a critical distribution channel to reach growth markets. We also recently announced a partnership with Citrix to provide additional management and monitoring capabilities on top of Citrix cloud and desktop virtualization solutions. Products include CA Nimsoft Monitor, CA Automation Suite and CA Server Automation.
Third, we are continuing to pay close attention to our expense profile to assure we deliver the 36% non-GAAP operating margin we outlooked for the year. We know we have work to do to sell more new products. The full impact of market segmentation was not evident in Q2, and it is going to take longer than we originally expected to gain traction. Our market segmentation has put short-term pressure on our performance. We implemented this strategy because we believe it is the right thing to do for our business, and it will have long-term benefits for the future of CA Technologies.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to provide details of the quarter and guidance."

Total revenue for the quarter was $1.15 billion, flat in constant currency and down 4% as reported. This includes a $43 million headwind from foreign exchange.
In Mainframe Solutions, revenue was $619 million, down 2% in constant currency and 5% as reported. I want to remind you that we have an unfavorable mainframe revenue compare in the third quarter due to a $39 million single-license payment that occurred in Q3 last year.
Turning to Enterprise Solutions, revenue was $438 million, up 1% percent in constant currency and down 2% as reported. Services revenue was $95 million, up 3% in constant currency and down 1% as reported. New Services engagements, which are heavily dependent on new product sales, were down 15% year-over-year.
We now expect FY '13 renewal portfolio to be down closer to 10% as compared to FY '12, with Q3 down year-over-year and growth in the fourth quarter.
Looking at the revenue backlog, current revenue backlog was $3.5 billion, down 2% in constant currency and 3% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $7.5 billion, down 7% in constant currency and 8% as reported.
Backlog was affected by sales performance in the first half of the year. We also continue to see a headwind in backlog metrics, as contracts burn off the balance sheet in anticipation of an increasing in our 2014 renewal portfolio.
From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $406 million, up 12% in constant currency and 7% as reported.
For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 35%. Operating margin for Mainframe Solutions was 60%. Operating margin for Enterprise Solutions was 6%. Finally, operating margin for Services was 6%.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.59, up 22% in constant currency and 16% as reported. This includes a year-over-year $0.02 headwind from currency.
For the second quarter, non-GAAP tax rate was 31% compared to 32% for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter was $89 million, down 50% in constant currency and 53% as reported. CFFO was affected by weaker new product sales, we have adjusted our full year outlook accordingly.
Single installment payments were $95 million in the second quarter compared to $100 million in the previous period. Total billings backlog of $4.5 billion was down 10% in constant currency and as reported. Billings backlog was affected by sales performance in the first half of the year.
We ended the quarter with approximately $790 million in net cash. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 9.7 million shares for $250 million. We are authorized to repurchase an additional $654 million of common stock for fiscal 2014.
Moving to second quarter GAAP results. Second quarter GAAP operating margin was 29%. GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $337 million, up 12% in constant currency and 1% as reported. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.48, up 15% in constant currency and 2% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was 32% compared to 28% for the second quarter of fiscal 2012.
Now let me turn to fiscal 2013 guidance. As been our practice, guidance is based on exchange rate on the last day of the preceding quarter or for this quarter, September 30, 2012. This includes a partial hedge of operating income.
Before I review guidance, I would like to comment on this afternoon's update. Our adjustments take into account both our macro environment, which is elongating purchasing cycles, and our current view of pipeline progression for the second half of FY '13.
Updated guidance is the following: Total revenue is now expected to be negative 3% to negative 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.58 billion to $4.67 billion. A point of this year-over-year decline in revenue is attributed to a $39 million single-license payment that occurred last year and will not reoccur.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in a range of 6% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.36 to $2.44.
GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 8% to 12%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.99 to $2.07.
Cash flow from operations growth in constant currency is now expected to be in a range of negative 8% to negative 4%. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.38 billion to $1.44 billion.
Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to come in closer to the high end of the 30% to 31% we provided at the outset of the year.
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 449 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 458 million shares. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 36% for fiscal year 2013.
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

Market segmentation is the right strategy for CA Technologies. Expanding beyond our core 1,000 customers by accessing new channels, leveraging new partnerships and improving our coverage model will drive growth and expand profitability.
At the outset of the fiscal year, the timing looked right to introduce these changes. With a lighter renewal portfolio, we hope to minimize the effect on our existing customer base. However, over the last 6 months, we have continued to be challenged selling outside the renewal, both to our existing customers, as well as potential new ones. Driving this amount of change in an unpredictable economy proved more difficult than we anticipated. Because of our transition to segment marketing and expectations that the macro will not recover significantly, we are not projecting a rebound in the second half of this fiscal year.
That being said, we understand the challenges we face. We have reset the timeline of our expectations, but not our goals of profitability and acquiring new customers. We continue to focus carefully on all details of our sales execution and will continue that focus until we reach our objectives.
And now, Kelsey, back to you."

And those impending events actually proved out to be the way we normally would see them. In Q2, what we saw was a slight difference, and that was a little bit of elongation in some of these transactions that are now going to happen later on the year. That predominantly sits in the distributor enterprise solutions segment. And that $150 million worth of perpetual licenses normally would have flowed to direct cash, as well as the revenue associated with it, for the licenses.

What we're seeing is they're buying just enough for what they really want over a 3- or 4-year transaction. And although it's minor, it was enough that we thought it was the right thing to tweak it down.

Competitive-wise, we're very strong positioned. In fact, one of the things I reviewed going through some of these comments where we've launched several products as we went through this quarter, and we are on the front end of a very strong new product announcement cycle. So we don't see competitive losses. So we feel strong on that. If you take a look at the new product sales, it varies by segment. If you look inside the existing accounts, probably the macro thing we talked about is probably the biggest factor. Decisions are slowing down. We don't see people making decisions without going up their change for approvals as they do it. So that does delay things. And in some cases, customers, because of their own demand cycles, are delaying projects or pushing projects out. It's not directly related with the new sales, but on the -- from a renewal point of view in the existing -- I think future agreements sometimes in the past have been brought forward. We're not getting as many requests on that. And some that are brought forward to us, we've rejected because we think it has too much impact on the future. So that would sort of put the existing in place. If you look at the new, as Rich mentioned, we're building the pipe as we go through the quarter. The quality of that pipe is better. You will recall, we said when we put that in place, it was a 2-year plan. We do have accelerators on though for our reps to close the new orders in the new enterprise segment as soon as they can, and we're moving that competitive accounts. And clearly, the macro cycle, because they're in many cases the same size as our existing accounts, the macro environment plays on that as well. And then finally, on the growth side, we're building that pipe, but we're also building the partnerships with our business partners. And so the productivity, that takes time. And then all 3 of those, as I mentioned, are being impacted and elongated with respect to how we implement the segmentation."

What we saw was, more often than not, a delay by the customer to just put off the purchase."

As you well know, Citrix is one of the leaders in the VDI area. And what they need to add to their customer system and management control piece is that we add to and for them.

So we just thought it was a very strong partnership. As you well know, one of the things that we bring uniquely to the marketplace is we work across all platforms. And so when you work in the marketplace, I think our customers and Citrix looks at it as an opportunity for them to expand their presence in the accounts. It's just a strong partnership for us. On the Identity and Access Management, that continues strong. Our cog was strong. But as we've said many times, quarter-to-quarter, security goes up and down. We had a strong quarter. I think it was the first quarter was down a little bit the second quarter and come back again in the third quarter. It's a longer sales cycle than it is with a lot of our products. But security, as I traveled the world, there is nothing that I talk about more because of customers asking us questions, because of the implementation of the cloud, whether it's private or public or a combination of those, is that security piece. So it continues to be a very strong demand for us and we believe it will, primarily because of the cloud. And that was one of the things we did first, is move our security into the cloud."

So you heard on our prepared remarks that the new product sales in the mainframe was up 10%. That's driven, frankly, by some of the investments we've been making now for the last 1 year, 1.5 years in our product set that we call the Chorus products and our tools that we provided in that the area. And that's helping to improve our revenue in that area. We look at a 90% renewal rate as we do the renewals on those. And then I think the final piece of that is when you look at the capacity piece of mainframe, it is largely driven by the customers' increased volumes or increased demand. There's been times in the past, for example, in the financial industry, which is important to us, where we've been the recipient benefits of large banks buying smaller banks. And then that load is transferred onto that, and that has pushed some of that capacity. I think what we're seeing now across probably all segments is that there appears to be a reduction of the demand that those people have. That reduction in demand is impressing them to put capacity on. So that is, I think, one of the key pieces that we see happening with respect to capacity. And then a final point would be that competitive win back. I think a lot of the new tools that we provided in the mainframe area, we are now winning in the mainframe marketplace, and that's adding to our revenue as well.
So does that answer your question?"

So I think then, let me wrap. I think I would make 3 points. First, we believe that market segmentation is the right strategy for CA Technologies. It is expanding us outside our current base, and that's what's going to allow us to grow and to be even more profitable. We will continue our focus on cost and expense, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And we expect to deliver a 200 basis point increase in our non-GAAP operating margin this year.
And finally, we understand what we have to do to close out the balance of this year. And with a careful focus on all the details at the sales execution we talked about, the segmentation implementation, we're going to continue that focus until we've met those objectives.

Thank you for joining us. I'd like to start this afternoon by providing some detail on CA Technologies' second quarter results and our revised annual and long-term guidance. I will then turn the call over to R",1299,"Thanks, Kelsey, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to start this afternoon by providing some detail on CA Technologies' second quarter results and our revised annual and long-term guidance. I will then turn the call over to Rich for a more detailed review of the financials and updated guidance before we open the call for questions.
Let me start by saying that our second quarter was short of our objectives in several areas. Obviously, we are disappointed in our performance. Because we do not expect the macroeconomic environment to recover quickly and we therefore expect that our marketing transition will be elongated, we are lowering our guidance for the year. I will walk you through the quarter, what has changed in our outlook, what did not work well and some things that did work well.
Before I do that, let me turn to our expectations as we entered fiscal year '13. We knew the fiscal year '13 renewal portfolio would be down year-over-year. We also knew that we would be reorganizing the sales force, and we were sensitive that the economy might be a headwind this year. Having said that, there are 2 critical aspects of our business that are not performing to plan.
First, underlying our performance, new product and capacity sales did not come in as expected, particularly new sales outside of the renewal. New product and capacity sales were down approximately 25%.
Second, as we have outlined, our sales force reorganization has been slower to gain traction than we had expected. Clearly, I'm not satisfied with our sales execution and transition to segment marketing, which is a key to our future growth.
Finally, I would be remiss in not mentioning the weakening global economic outlook which has impacted our performance. In fact, we saw sales cycles elongate and deals slip out of the quarter. This trend exacerbated our efforts to sell to new customers under the segmented marketing model.
As we told you when we announced quarter 1, we are closely inspecting the pipeline and managing progression from a segmented view. This is new. This inspection improved the visibility into and quality of pipeline, but shifted the expected time of closing of some transactions to future quarters. All of this was exacerbated by the macroeconomic climate.
The result, as Rich will review in greater detail, is that we are reducing our full year expectations for revenue in constant currency growth to negative 3% to negative 1%. This results in updated cash flow guidance of negative 8% to negative 4% in constant currency.
However, we will continue our focus on cost and expense control through the second half of the year and expect our non-GAAP operating margin, which we raised last quarter, to be 36% for the full year. As a result, we are updating our outlook for non-GAAP EPS growth to 6% to 10% in constant currency.
Before addressing the plan for the balance of the year, let me place our second quarter results in perspective. First, there were headwinds that we knew we would have to contend with during the quarter. With the renewal portfolio down year-over-year and the mainframe portion down even more, we expected capacity sales to be down. This, coupled with an uneven macro environment where buyers are being cautious, resulted in capacity being down approximately 60%.
Based on our performance in the first quarter, we saw a trailing effect on cash flows, as our quarter 1 new product sales shortfall created a gap in billings that affected Q2.
Additionally, our renewal yield was in the high 80% range, a little bit lower than historical levels in this tough economic environment, but attributed to 2 transactions. The pipeline, while building, is building slower than we expected. This is the second quarter in a row North America has been down, and the impact of the economic political uncertainty in Europe was even greater than we expected. As a result, several core product lines declined, including our Application Performance Management and Infrastructure Management businesses.
At the same time, there are areas of the business which are performing, though off smaller bases. They include: Mainframe new product sales, which were up approximately 10% year-over-year; in Latin America, where we have been leveraging channels and partners for 2 years, we grew high teens; APJ, excluding Japan, where we also implemented a partner and segmentation program earlier, was up mid-teens. Both demonstrated that our segment marketing can produce improved results. Technology investments, such as ITKO and Nimsoft, delivered double-digit new product sales growth in the quarter; and our SaaS revenue grew by more than 30%.
Let me assure you that CA Technologies' competitive position is sound. I talk with customers and visit clients every week. And I remain confident that we are well positioned in the market, and our portfolio of products and solutions is compelling.
Because of our weak new product sales this year and the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we see a dampening effect on revenue and cash flow growth next year. As a result, we are modifying our long-term guidance. We continue to believe the multi-year financial objectives that we previously shared are correct, but we now believe the time line to reach these objectives will extend beyond our original expectations.
We feel very comfortable with our ability to generate cash flow. We expect approximately $1.4 billion in cash flow from operations this year and can fund the dividend, share buyback and future investments in the company. The Board of Directors and I remain committed to delivering our $2.5 billion capital allocation plan. This includes the $1 per share annual dividend and share repurchase program we have put in place.
Now let me turn to our plan to improve execution in the second half. First, we are continuing to introduce new products to the portfolio. This past quarter, we launched Infrastructure Management 2.0 and Nimsoft Monitor 6, which together arm our sales force with what we believe is the most complete infrastructure management solutions in the market. We will continue to extend our Service Assurance strategy with: A new version of CA Executive Insight, which adds capacity planning data to a solution that provides managers with IT insight in a business context; expanded monitoring capabilities for mobile browsing in a new version of APM Cloud Monitor; and new integrations of APM with CA LISA from our ITKO acquisition, which will provide advanced performance analytics for better decisions in service virtualization and testing.
As I said in the first quarter, we are entering a period of increased product introductions. Second, we are focused on building our partner ecosystem. For example, our partnerships with the India-headquartered global systems integrators have driven an approximately 200% increase in related new contract value. And we added more than 20 new MSPs, a critical distribution channel to reach growth markets. We also recently announced a partnership with Citrix to provide additional management and monitoring capabilities on top of Citrix cloud and desktop virtualization solutions. Products include CA Nimsoft Monitor, CA Automation Suite and CA Server Automation.
Third, we are continuing to pay close attention to our expense profile to assure we deliver the 36% non-GAAP operating margin we outlook for the year. We know we have work to do to sell more new products. The full impact of market segmentation was not evident in Q2, and it is going to take longer than we originally expected to gain traction. Our market segmentation has put short-term pressure on our performance. We implemented this strategy because we believe it is the right thing to do for our business, and it will have long-term benefits for the future of CA Technologies.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to provide details of the quarter and guidance."

Total revenue for the quarter was $1.15 billion, flat in constant currency and down 4% as reported. This includes a $43 million headwind from foreign exchange.
In Mainframe Solutions, revenue was $619 million, down 2% in constant currency and 5% as reported. I want to remind you that we have an unfavorable mainframe revenue compare in the third quarter due to a $39 million single-license payment that occurred in Q3 last year.
Turning to Enterprise Solutions, revenue was $438 million, up 1% percent in constant currency and down 2% as reported. Services revenue was $95 million, up 3% in constant currency and down 1% as reported. New Services engagements, which are heavily dependent on new product sales, were down 15% year-over-year.
We now expect FY '13 renewal portfolio to be down closer to 10% as compared to FY '12, with Q3 down year-over-year and growth in the fourth quarter.
Looking at the revenue backlog, current revenue backlog was $3.5 billion, down 2% in constant currency and 3% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $7.5 billion, down 7% in constant currency and 8% as reported.
Backlog was affected by sales performance in the first half of the year. We also continue to see a headwind in backlog metrics, as contracts burn off the balance sheet in anticipation of an increase in our 2014 renewal portfolio.
From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $406 million, up 12% in constant currency and 7% as reported.
For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 35%. Operating margin for Mainframe Solutions was 60%. Operating margin for Enterprise Solutions was 6%. Finally, operating margin for Services was 6%.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.59, up 22% in constant currency and 16% as reported. This includes a year-over-year $0.02 headwind from currency.
For the second quarter, non-GAAP tax rate was 31% compared to 32% for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter was $89 million, down 50% in constant currency and 53% as reported. CFFO was affected by weaker new product sales; we have adjusted our full year outlook accordingly.
Single installment payments were $95 million in the second quarter compared to $100 million in the previous period. Total billings backlog of $4.5 billion was down 10% in constant currency and as reported. Billings backlog was affected by sales performance in the first half of the year.
We ended the quarter with approximately $790 million in net cash. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 9.7 million shares for $250 million. We are authorized to repurchase an additional $654 million of common stock for fiscal 2014.
Moving to second quarter GAAP results. Second quarter GAAP operating margin was 29%. GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $337 million, up 12% in constant currency and 1% as reported. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.48, up 15% in constant currency and 2% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was 32% compared to 28% for the second quarter of fiscal 2012.
Now let me turn to fiscal 2013 guidance. As been our practice, guidance is based on exchange rate on the last day of the preceding quarter or for this quarter, September 30, 2012. This includes a partial hedge of operating income.
Before I review guidance, I would like to comment on this afternoon's update. Our adjustments take into account both our macro environment, which has elongated purchasing cycles, and our current view of pipeline progression for the second half of FY '13.
Updated guidance is the following: Total revenue is now expected to be negative 3% to negative 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.58 billion to $4.67 billion. A point of this year-over-year decline in revenue is attributed to a $39 million single-license payment that occurred last year and will not reoccur.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in a range of 6% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.36 to $2.44.
GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 8% to 12%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.99 to $2.07.
Cash flow from operations growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of negative 8% to negative 4%. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.38 billion to $1.44 billion.
Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to come in closer to the high end of the 30% to 31% we provided at the outset of the year.
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 449 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 458 million shares. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 36% for fiscal year 2013.
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

Market segmentation is the right strategy for CA Technologies. Expanding beyond our core 1,000 customers by accessing new channels, leveraging new partnerships and improving our coverage model will drive growth and expand profitability.
At the outset of the fiscal year, the timing looked right to introduce these changes. With a lighter renewal portfolio, we hope to minimize the effect on our existing customer base. However, over the last 6 months, we have continued to be challenged selling outside the renewal, both to our existing customers, as well as potential new ones. Driving this amount of change in an unpredictable economy proved more difficult than we anticipated. Because of our transition to segment marketing and expectations that the macro will not recover significantly, we are not projecting a rebound in the second half of this fiscal year.
That being said, we understand the challenges we face. We have reset the time line of our expectations, but not our goals of profitability and acquiring new customers. We continue to focus carefully on all details of our sales execution and will continue that focus until we reach our objectives.
And now, Kelsey, back to you."

And those impending events actually proved out to be the way we normally would see them. In Q2, what we saw was a slight difference, and that was a little bit of elongation in some of these transactions that were now going to happen later on in the year. That predominantly sits in the distributed or Enterprise Solutions segment. And that $150 million worth of perpetual licenses normally would have flowed to direct cash, as well as the revenue associated with it, for the licenses. And so what we thought was prudent, looking at the macro environment and the pressure the macro environment has on some of our geographies, and thought it was the right time to take that down."

Competitive-wise, we're very strong positioned. In fact, one of the things I reviewed going through some of these comments were we've launched several products as we went through this quarter, and we are on the front end of a very strong new product announcement cycle. So we don't see competitive losses. So we feel strong on that. If you take a look at the new product sales, it varies by segment. If you look inside the existing accounts, probably the macro thing we talked about is probably the biggest factor. Decisions are slowing down. We don't see people making decisions without going up their change for approvals as they do it. So that does delay things. And in some cases, customers, because of their own demand cycles, are delaying projects or pushing projects out. It's not directly related with the new sales, but on the -- from a renewal point of view in the existing -- I think future agreements sometimes in the past have been brought forward. We're not getting as many requests on that. And some that are brought forward to us, we've rejected because we think it has too much impact on the future. So that would sort of put the existing in place. If you look at the new, as Rich mentioned, we're building the pipe as we go through the quarter. The quality of that pipe is better. You will recall, we said when we put that in place, it was a 2-year plan. We do have accelerators on though for our reps to close the new orders in the new enterprise segment as soon as they can, and we're moving that competitive accounts. And clearly, the macro cycle, because they're in many cases the same size as our existing accounts, the macro environment plays on that as well. And then finally, on the growth side, we're building that pipe, but we're also building the partnerships with our business partners. And so the productivity of that takes time. And then all 3 of those, as I mentioned, are being impacted and elongated with respect to how we implement the segmentation."

As you well know, Citrix is one of the leaders in the VDI area. And what they need to add to their customer system and management control piece is that we add to and for them. And so it gives them more competitors in the marketplace and it gives us opportunity in the marketplace, both in their accounts as well as in our accounts. So we just thought it was a very strong partnership. As you well know, one of the things that we bring uniquely to the marketplace is we work across all platforms. And so when you work in the marketplace, I think our customers and Citrix looks at it as an opportunity for them to expand their presence in the accounts. It's just a strong partnership for us. On the Identity and Access Management, that continues strong. Arcot was strong. But as we've said many times, quarter-to-quarter, security goes up and down. We had a strong quarter, I think it was the first quarter. It was down a little bit the second quarter and come back again in the third quarter. It's a longer sales cycle than it is with a lot of our products. But security, as I travel the world, there is nothing that I talk about more because of customers asking us questions, because of the implementation of the cloud, whether it's private or public or a combination of those, is that security piece. So it continues to be a very strong demand for us and we believe it will, primarily because of the cloud. And that was one of the things we did first, is move our security into the cloud."

The way they wanted to pay their cash was the same. I think what we did see, as Bill alluded to, in North America, which has been a growth engine for us, that was a little slower. We saw some transactions that required higher levels of signature, even -- almost back to a little bit of the '08 feel to it. But that being said, we had strong growth out of Nimsoft, we had strong growth out of ITKO. Our SaaS business grew well. So it was a little bit of a mix.

The key piece of that though, frankly, is we're looking at the pipeline by segment now. And looking at it by segment, as you look at it in different ways by segment and you look at it and inspect for different things as to what the close time would be. So the pipeline clarity by segment is much better. It is building, and the quality of it is building. But also, as we look at it, especially when you think of it, for example, in the enterprise new or in some of the growth areas, some of the things that needed to be done for it to close are then identified. And as a result of that, where we may have had it setting in the second quarter or third quarter, we might now have it setting in our third or fourth quarter. So we've always inspected it before, but we're down to a level of detail now, the way we follow with that, with both Rich and George, primarily because of the segment orientation. And it does give us good confidence into what's building there. And the thing that has been, I guess, the amplifier on the delay really has been the macroeconomic environment because it lengthens the decision cycle, John."

And I think that all led into, John -- George and I saying, we think there's certain sections of certain geographies or certain product lines because they have longer sales cycles, like you heard. Security is a great example, right? When you win, you win big, but it's a longer cycle. So those kinds of things into a large new or into some of the growth markets I think has given us better insight. I think taking down the number, which I'm sure a lot of people said, ""Well, your 2Q really wasn't that far off,"" it really is all about our trust in the pipeline going forward."

So you heard on our prepared remarks that the new product sales in the Mainframe was up 10%.

So you heard on our prepared remarks that the new product sales in the Mainframe was up 10%. That's driven, frankly, by some of the investments we've been making now for the last 1 year, 1.5 years in our product set that we call the Chorus products and our tools that we provide in that area. And that's helping to improve our revenue in that area. We look at a 90% renewal rate as we do the renewals on those. And then I think the final piece of that is when you look at the capacity piece of Mainframe, it is largely driven by the customers' increased volumes or increased demand. There's been times in the past, for example, in the financial industry, which is important to us, where we've been the recipient benefits of large banks buying smaller banks. And then that load is transferred onto that, and that has pushed some of that capacity. I think what we're seeing now across probably all segments is that there appears to be a reduction of the demand that those people have. That reduction in demand is impressing them to put capacity on. So that is, I think, one of the key pieces that we see happening with respect to capacity. And then a final point would be that competitive win back. I think a lot of the new tools that we provide in the mainframe area, we are now winning in the mainframe marketplace, and that's adding to our revenue as well. So does that answer your question?"

And that really is back on some of the financial institutions, I think, because of the pressures they're under. They're not going to put as much headroom out ahead of them. And so they're buying a little bit closer to what their base business is growing at. That's just something we'll cycle back through and catch it later. That was my point earlier when I said why we're more comfortable at the 10% than when before we said in the mid-single digits, is we're seeing just a little bit smaller in total transactions as they're being cautious, which I think in their case, it goes back again to the economy."

So I think then, let me wrap. I think I would make 3 points. First, we believe that market segmentation is the right strategy for CA Technologies. It is expanding us outside our current base, and that's what's going to allow us to grow and to be even more profitable. We will continue our focus on cost and expense, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And we expect to deliver a 200 basis point increase in our non-GAAP operating margin this year.
And finally, we understand what we have to do to close out the balance of this year. And with a careful focus on all the details of the sales execution we talked about, the segmentation implementation, we're going to continue that focus until we've met those objectives. Folks, thanks for hooking up with us."
