The fourth quarter wrapped up a solid year for Expedia. As promised, we completed the spin-off for TripAdvisor in the fourth quarter, unlocking significant value for our shareholders.

As promised, we completed the spin-off for TripAdvisor in the fourth quarter, unlocking significant value for our shareholders. It was a significant effort from a lot of folks in our organization and we're happy to have successfully completed the transaction. We're now completely focused on our stand-alone travel transactions business and eager to prove that we can achieve healthy and meaningful top line profit growth in the years to come. We're investing in key technology projects on modern platforms that will allow us to innovate much more quickly.
Additionally, we're investing in international expansion in order to position the business well for long-term growth. As such, although we saw transaction growth of 11%, gross bookings growth of 12% and revenue growth of 14% for the full year, these investments led to cost deleverage with adjusted EBITDA growing just 1%.
For the fourth quarter, gross bookings grew 10%, revenue grew 7% while adjusted EBITDA was down 4% year-on-year. Mark will have more to say about this after my remarks.
Our key technology projects are on track and proceeding as expected. As we mentioned last quarter, the Expedia brand hotel product is on the new platform and the team is testing and rolling out new innovation that are showing early signs of success. While the overall Expedia brand performance for the quarter was unsatisfactory, its stand-alone result on that growth as measured on a book basis improved for the quarter compared to what we saw in Q3 and a conversion is headed on the right direction. Air and packages continue to perform poorly however, and are weighing on that business.
We believe that air and packages are key to Expedia percent of proposition and we'll continue to invest appropriately. We successfully tested the new air product for Expedia brand site and we'll roll it out through Q1 with the majority of traffic expected to be on the new platform end-to-end aircraft within the quarter. We also portions of the package product on to the new platform, but we still don't still don't expect to have end-to-end packages product finished into the back half of 2012. To be clear, we don't expect improvements from this platform work to have a meaningful impact on Expedia brand's financial return until the back half of 2012, but it is one of the top priorities and we're optimistic we will see things begin to turn.
We continue to progress on our international expansion with Hotels.com in particular seeing healthy room growth across all regions. Our Expedia brand is 6 months into its current contribute your Asia and we see excellent growth rate of progress in that new business. Although we don't consolidate the results for the JV, including it would've contributed roughly 200 basis points of total room night and revenue growth for the quarter.
Importantly, the Expedia brand launched 11 new points of sale in 2011, representing a new record for that brand. And this week marks the full consumer launch of Expedia Mexico which now features our full air product.
Mark will spend more time on the quarterly results but I did want to highlight our robust 19% room night growth, 21% include the AirAsia joint venture this quarter. With the exception of Expedia brand, all of our major brands delivered year-on-year room night growth this quarter as good or better than what we saw in Q3. Overall room night growth in APAC accelerated nicely, when room night growth for the EMEA and Americas region was largely similar to what we saw last quarter. Importantly, we continue to grow room night on a healthy puppies on the U.S. despite its relative maturity so showing that there's still plenty of growth to be had here in what is our most mature market.
We spent a total of $134 million on increased investments in eLong during 2011. We believe that China represents a unique and extremely sizable opportunity and we're happy to be able to continue investing in that market. For Egencia, we're also pleased to completed the acquisition of Traveldoo in the fourth quarter, a leading European provider of corporate online booking tools to enterprises and TMCs. The acquisition addresses a new segment of the managed travel market that we don't have after been Egencia's integrated solution. And although the business operates under Egencia, we'll run Traveldoo on a completely stand-alone basis. In many cases, Traveldoo will compete with Egencia in the same way that our Leisure brands compete with one another today. We're excited by the corporate travel space in the second acquisition portfolio leading companies as we continue to position the business for long-term growth.
In closing, with 2011 behind us, we're squarely focused on executing our 2012 plan. All of our brands are doing quite well with the exception of Expedia brand. We know we have to turn the business around, and we have a good playbook in the teams are executing. As we move into 2012, we'll face some really tough expense comps early in the year but those will abate as the year progresses. By the end of the year, we'll have completed our key technology project, setting us up for faster profit growth in what we think will be an excellent 2013. The business continues to generate significant annual free cash flow and will be disciplined in our capital allocation and our stewardship of that cash.
With that, let me turn it over to Mark."

Strong room night growth was the gross bookings and revenue driver for the quarter. Room night growth was broadly strong across all regions with mid-teens growth in the Americas and EMEA region and much faster and accelerating growth in APAC. Revenue per room night, however, was down 5%. The gap between 2% growth in AVRs and the decrease in revenue per room night was driven primarily by 4 key factors, each of which I would roughly .
We had a year-on-year headwind from the foreign exchange book-to-stay impact. Note that although this depresses revenue per room night, it is largely offset from an economic perspective through our hedging program and has relatively little impact on adjusted EBITDA. Mix also pushed down the revenue per room night, as we saw last quarter, we saw faster growth in our chain hotels versus independents. The cost of our loyalty programs also had an impact. For the Expedia brand, this is a relatively new program which we did not have in place this time last year. And for Hotels.com, this is a program that we recently rolled out to all of our international markets. Note that we managed this item more like selling and marketing expense, but we do report it as cost of revenue. And as we mentioned last quarter, we continued with certain competitive pricing actions designed to ensure that we are putting the best possible deals in front of our customers.
As expected, our air business was down sharply in the quarter due to an 8% decline in ticket volume combined with an 11% decrease in revenue per ticket. The revenue per ticket pressure came from a combination of lacking the change to our merchant air accounting which we described last year and lower overall unit economics from recently negotiated contracts. These were partially offset by higher interline fees and consumer fees on certain international point-of-sale. Generally, we are expecting continued pressure on the air business in 2012.
From a brand perspective, we once again saw strong revenue performance pretty much across the board, with exception of our Expedia brand, which was down 9% year-on-year. Revenue growth for the total business, excluding the Expedia brand, was 21% for the quarter.
Running through key expense categories, we saw nice leverage in cost of revenue this quarter which was aided by an easier comp for Q4 due to an acceleration of some nonrefundable merchant fees and some one-time adjustments in Q4 2010. As expected, selling and marketing faster than revenue, driven largely by mix shift into our Expedia Affiliate network and Hotels.com businesses. This impact was partially offset by a reduction in selling and marketing for Expedia. In addition, selling and marketing headcount grew across most of our brand as well as within our supply organization.
Technology and content grew 29% for the quarter as we continued to see year-on-year impact of the buildup of headcount needed to complete the key technology projects which we have discussed previously. Growth in G&A expense was much higher than we are striving for on an ongoing basis to a number of the factors that are individually insignificant, but when combined with growth in people cost, growth deleverage-ed. These included a tougher year-on-year bonus comp, consulting costs for the reorganization our supply group and its increased expenses related to our efforts to turn the Expedia business around. Also, as we mentioned last quarter, we did have a one-time expense of roughly $7 million in Q4 related to our London office move. This item is spread across multiple expense categories.
Moving on to taxes, our GAAP effective fax rate was lower than expectations for the fourth quarter and certainly lower than we can expect going forward. This was primarily due to a higher proportion of international earnings and favorable adjustments to our valuation allowances. Please note that our go-forward blended tax rate will be lower than it was when we owned TripAdvisor since the travel transaction business had a higher relative proportion earnings in international regions with lower tax rates. Though precision can be difficult on this one, we would expect our effective rate to be in the range of 25% to 28% in 2012. We've had some favorable adjustments in the last couple of quarters and the obvious caveat here is that these can sometimes go the other way.
Free cash flow totaled $618 million for the full year and grow a robust 32%. We used a portion of that free cash flow to make acquisitions and investments totaling just under $200 million, including the Traveldoo acquisition and the eLong transactions mentioned earlier. During the year, we also repurchased 10.6 million shares on a presplit adjusted basis of Expedia for just over $280 million and we paid out a total of just over $75 million in dividends. As we've said consistently over the years, we generate robust cash flow and such invested appropriately on in the business while making opportunistic acquisitions and returning cash to shareholders. As you may have seen on our earnings release, our quarterly dividend is now $0.09 per share effective for the March payout.
In terms of our financial expectations for full-year 2012, we are expecting adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-single-digit range. As a reminder, our revenue is significantly more seasonal without TripAdvisor and our expense comps are quite tough in the first and second quarters, with easing expected as we move throughout the year. As such, we expect most of our adjusted EBITDA growth to build in the back half of 2012. Note that we are basing our guidance on the foreign currency rates that we can see now and we don't try to forecast any future FX fluctuations.
Before I wrap up, a few quick housekeeping items. As we mentioned last quarter, you'll see from our recent disclosure that we've switched to adjusted EBITDA as our primary operating metric. It's effectively OIBA plus depreciation with one other primary difference, being additional exclusion or reserves for occupancy tax litigation settlements. Occupancy tax settlement reserve items are now outside of our core non-GAAP operating measure and outside of G&A. Going forward, they reside in the legal reserves occupancy tax and other line item of our GAAP financials, and I would encourage investors interested in these matters to read the related disclosures in our SEC filings.
You can see the complete definition of adjusted EBITDA in our earnings release along with the reconciliation of net to GAAP measures. Further, for Q3, we had anticipated that our international gross bookings grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis. Since then however, we have taken another look at this and now estimate that international gross bookings actually grew 14% in Q3 on a currency-neutral basis.
Lastly, as part of the TripAdvisor spin-off, we retired our 8.5% notes. The expense associated with this is just under $40 million and will be reported in the first quarter of 2012. The expense will recorded in discontinued operations, and as such, will be excluded from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income. With that, let's turn to questions. Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question."

If it's couponing, if you're talking about competitive pricing actions, I think, going forward, when we see ADRs and ATPs such as they have been, you can expect to see that happening. Now ADR growth has slowed down a little bit, but potentially in 2012, you can see that item easing. But it's tough to say. You'll have to see how things unfold. On loyalty, the thing that's really impacting that item in this quarter last quarter is the fact that we didn't have the Expedia program last, last year at this time. So you've got to -- you basically got a very difficult comp. Now that program was rolled out in probably Q1, really part of Q2. And so as we roll through 2012, the comps on that front will get easier. We also saw an expanded rollout of the Hotels.com program, which again, is to some extent, a one-time item. That happened basically in Q4. So again, you'll see that with a little bit tougher comp throughout 2012. I will say with loyalty as one of those items but as these programs mature, they start to harden up and until that happens, can sometimes see fluctuations in the loyalty accruals, certainly we can see last quarter."

But our relationships with the chain hotels on the ground remain very, very strong. And obviously, our volume remains quite strong. I think that the chain hotels view their business very similarly to how we view our business which is you want to make sure that you have a balance of direct business and you want to make sure that you are getting as much share as you can from the large marketing channels out there. So would I rather have a direct but there than a broker from Google? I'd rather have a direct but I'm doing everything that I can to build a relationship with Google, make sure we're great at search engine marketing, we make sure we're great at SEO, et cetera. And then I think the chains are doing the same thing with us which is we're seeing very good work with them. We have great merchandising partnerships with them and we run terrific promotions with them and we don't see that changing. And I think they're doing exactly what they should be doing which is making sure that they've got a good balance of direct business as well. This is a very, very large industry. It is a global business, and I think during this recovery, you're seeing businesses like ours grow, and you're seeing the chains grow and the point is that in this kind of economic recovery, travel is a great place to allocate capital and travel companies are going to grow. So I don't see a significant risk there as well as we do what we're doing which is provide a great product for our consumers everywhere and being great partners for our suppliers."

The good news is that we're seeing very, very strong opaque inventory on the Hotwire side and that business is really doing quite well. We're also seeing a lot of competition from what I would call Tier 2 and Tier 3 vendors as far as pricing against the top brands out there, which is hitting pricing to some extent. The car companies brands, I think, the fleets are at the appropriate size but I think the car companies have to be a bit more aggressive on pricing in order to get kind of the utilization of the fleets to where they need to be.

The fourth quarter wrapped up a solid year for Expedia. As promised, we completed the spinoff for TripAdvisor in the fourth quarter, unlocking significant value for our shareholders.

As promised, we completed the spinoff for TripAdvisor in the fourth quarter, unlocking significant value for our shareholders. 
There's a significant effort from a lot of folks in our organization, and we're happy to have successfully completed the transaction. We're now completely focused on our standalone travel transactions business and eager to prove that we can achieve healthy and meaningful top line and profit growth in the years to come. We're investing in key technology projects on modern platforms that will allow us to innovate much more quickly.
Additionally, we're investing in international expansion in order to position the business well for long-term growth. As such, although we saw transaction growth of 11%, gross bookings growth of 12% and revenue growth of 14% for the full year, these investments led to cost deleverage with adjusted EBITDA growing just 1%.
For the fourth quarter, gross bookings grew 10%, revenue growth -- grew 7% while adjusted EBITDA was down 4% year-on-year. Mark will have more to say about this after my remarks.
Our key technology projects are on track and proceeding as expected. As we mentioned last quarter, the Expedia brand hotel product is on the new platform, and the team is testing and rolling out new innovation that are showing early signs of success. 
While the overall Expedia brand performance for the quarter was unsatisfactory, its standalone hotel room night growth, as measured on a book basis, improved for the quarter compared to what we saw in Q3, and a conversion is headed on the right direction.  Air and packages continue to perform poorly, however, and are weighing on that business.
We believe that air and packages are key to the Expedia brand value proposition, and we'll continue to invest appropriately. 
We successfully tested the new air product for Expedia brand site, and we'll roll it out through Q1, with the majority of traffic expected to be on the new platform, end-to-end air path by the end of the quarter. 
We also moved portions of the package product on to the new platform, but we still don't expect to have the end-to-end packages product finished onto the back half of 2012. 
To be clear, we don't expect improvements from this platform or to have a meaningful impact on Expedia brand's financial returns until the back half of 2012. But it is one of our top priorities, and we're optimistic we will see things begin to turn.
We continue to progress on our international expansion with Hotels.com in particular, seeing healthy room night growth across all regions. Our Expedia brand is 6 months into its joint venture with AirAsia, and we see excellent growth rate and progress in that new business. 
Although we don't consolidate the results for the JV, including it would have contributed roughly 200 basis points of total room night and revenue growth for the quarter.
Importantly, the Expedia brand launched 11 new points-of-sale in 2011, representing a new record for that brand. And this week marks the full consumer launch of Expedia Mexico, which now features our full air product.
Mark will spend more time on the quarterly results, but I did want to highlight our robust 19% room night growth, 21% if you include the AirAsia joint venture this quarter. 
With the exception of Expedia brand, all of our major brands delivered year-on-year room night growth this quarter as good or better than what we saw in Q3. Overall room night growth in APAC accelerated nicely, while room night growth for the EMEA and Americas region was largely similar to what we saw last quarter. Importantly, we continue to grow room night at a healthy pace in the U.S, despite its relative maturity, showing that there's still plenty of growth to be had here in what is our most mature market.
We spent a total of $134 million on increased investments in eLong during 2011. We believe that China represents a unique and extremely sizable opportunity, and we're happy to be able to continue investing in that market. 
For Egencia, we're also pleased to have completed the acquisition of Traveldoo in the fourth quarter, a leading European provider of corporate online booking tools to enterprises and TMCs. The acquisition addresses a new segment of the travel market that we don't factor with Egencia's integrated solution. 
And although the business operates under Egencia, we'll run Traveldoo on a completely standalone basis. In many cases, Traveldoo will compete with Egencia in the same way that our leisure brands compete with one another today. We're excited about the corporate travel space, and this acquisition adds to our portfolio, leading companies as we continue to position the business for long-term growth.
In closing, with 2011 behind us, we're squarely focused on executing our 2012 plan. All of our brands are doing quite well with the exception of Expedia brand. We know we have to turn that business around, and we have a good playbook, and the teams are executing. 
As we move into 2012, we'll face some really tough expense comps early in the year, but those will abate as the year progresses. By the end of the year, we'll have completed our key technology project, setting us up for faster profit growth in what we think will be an excellent 2013. The business continues to generate significant annual free cash flow, and we'll be disciplined in our capital allocation and our stewardship of that cash.
With that, let me turn it over to Mark."

Strong room night growth was the gross bookings and revenue driver for the quarter. Room night growth was broadly strong across all regions with mid-teens growth in the Americas and EMEA region and much faster and accelerating growth in APAC. 
Revenue per room night, however, was down 5%. And the gap between 2% growth in ADR and the decrease in revenue per room night was driven primarily by 4 key factors, each of which I would roughly equal weight.
We had a year-on-year headwind from the foreign exchange book-to-stay impact. Note that although this depresses revenue per room night, it is largely offset from an economic perspective through our hedging program, and has relatively little impact on adjusted EBITDA. Mix also pushed down the revenue per room night. As we saw last quarter, we saw faster growth in our chain hotels versus independents. 
The cost of our loyalty programs also had an impact. For the Expedia brand, this is a relatively new program, which we did not have in place this time last year. And for Hotels.com, this is a program that we recently rolled out to all of our international markets. 
Note that we managed this item more like selling and marketing expense, but we do record it as contra revenue. And as we mentioned last quarter, we continue with certain competitive pricing actions designed to ensure that we are putting the best possible deals in front of our customers.
As expected, our air business was down sharply in the quarter due to an 8% decline in ticket volume combined with an 11% decrease in revenue per ticket. The revenue per ticket pressure came from a combination of lacking the change to our merchant air accounting, which we described last year, and lower overall unit economics from recently negotiated contracts. These were partially offset by higher interline fees and consumer fees on certain international points-of-sale. Generally, we are expecting continued pressure on the air business in 2012.
From a brand perspective, we once again saw strong revenue performance pretty much across the board, with the exception of our Expedia brand, which was down 9% year-on-year. Revenue growth for the total business, excluding the Expedia brand, was 21% for the quarter.
Running through key expense categories, we saw a nice leverage in cost of revenue this quarter, which was aided by an easier comp for Q4, due to acceleration of some nonrefundable merchant fees and some onetime adjustments in Q4 2010. 
As expected, selling and marketing grew faster than revenue, driven largely by mix shift into our Expedia Affiliate Network and Hotels.com businesses. This impact was partially offset by a reduction in selling and marketing for Expedia. In addition, selling and marketing headcount grew across most of our brand, as well as within our supply organization.
Technology and content grew 29% for the quarter as we continued to see year-on-year impact of the buildup of headcount needed to complete the key technology projects, which we have discussed previously. 
Growth in G&A expense was much higher than we certainly are striving for on an ongoing basis, due to number of factors, which are individually insignificant, but when combined with growth in people cost, drove deleverage. These included a tougher year-on-year bonus comp, consulting costs for the reorganization of our supply group and increased expenses related to our efforts to turn the Expedia business around. Also as we mentioned last quarter, we did have onetime expense of roughly $7 million in Q4 related to our London office move. This item is spread across multiple expense categories.
Moving on to taxes, our GAAP effective fax rate was lower than expectations for the fourth quarter, and certainly lower than we can expect going forward. This was primarily due to a higher proportion of international earnings and favorable adjustments to our valuation allowances. Please note that our go-forward blended tax rate will be lower than it was when we owned TripAdvisor, since the travel transaction business has a higher relative proportion of earnings in the international regions with lower tax rates. 
Though precision can be difficult on this one, we would expect our effective rate to be in the range of 25% to 28% in 2012. We've had some favorable adjustments in the last couple of quarters, and the obvious caveat here is that these can sometimes go the other way.
Free cash flow totaled $618 million for the full year and grew a robust 32%. We used a portion of that free cash flow to make acquisitions and investments totaling just under $200 million, including the Traveldoo acquisition and the eLong transactions mentioned earlier. 
During the year, we also repurchased 10.6 million shares on a presplit adjusted basis of Expedia for just over $280 million, and we paid out a total of just over $75 million in dividends. As we've said consistently over the years, we generate robust cash flow and as such, can invest appropriately in the business while making opportunistic acquisitions and returning cash to shareholders. As you may have seen in our earnings release, our quarterly dividend is now $0.09 per share effective for the March payout.
In terms of our financial expectations for full year 2012, we are expecting adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-single-digit range. As a reminder, our revenue is significantly more seasonal without TripAdvisor and our expense comps are quite tough in the first and second quarters, with easing expected as we move throughout the year. 
As such, we expect most of our adjusted EBITDA growth to build in the back half of 2012. Note that we are basing our guidance on the foreign currency rates that we can see now and we don't try to forecast any future FX fluctuations.
Before I wrap up, a few quick housekeeping items. As we mentioned last quarter, you'll see from our recent disclosure that we've switched to adjusted EBITDA as our primary operating metric. It's effectively OIBA plus depreciation with one other primary difference, being the additional exclusion of reserves for occupancy tax litigation settlements.
Occupancy tax settlement reserve items are now outside of our core non-GAAP operating measure and outside of G&A. Going forward, they reside in the legal reserves occupancy tax and other line item of our GAAP financials, and I would encourage investors interested in these matters to read the related disclosures in our SEC filings.  You can see the complete definition of adjusted EBITDA in our earnings release along with the reconciliation to GAAP measures. 
Further, for Q3, we had estimated that our international gross bookings grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis. Since then, however, we have taken another look at this and now estimate that international gross bookings actually grew 14% in Q3 on a currency-neutral basis.
Lastly, as part of the TripAdvisor spinoff, we retired our 8.5% notes. The expense associated with this is just under $40 million and will be recorded in the first quarter of 2012. The expense will be recorded in discontinued operations, and as such, will be excluded from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income. 
With that, let's turn to questions. Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question."

If it's couponing, if you're talking about the competitive pricing actions, I think it was in going forward, when we see ADR and ATPs such as they have been, you could expect to see that happening. Now ADR growth has slowed down a little bit. So it's potentially in 2012 you can see that item easing. But it's tough to say, you'll have to see how things unfold. On loyalty, the thing that's really impacting that item in this quarter or last quarter is the fact that we didn't have the Expedia program last, last year at this time. So you've got to -- you basically got a really difficult comp. Now that program was rolled out in probably Q1, really part of Q2. And so as we roll through 2012, the comps on that front will get easier. We also saw an expanded rollout of the Hotels.com program, which, again, is to some extent a onetime item. That happened basically in Q4. So again, you'll see that with a little bit tougher comps throughout 2012. I will say with loyalty as one of those items that as these programs mature, they start to harden up. And until that happens, you can sometimes see fluctuations in the loyalty accruals, which certainly we did see last quarter."

And then typically we go into the market and we fill out, not only the chain inventory with independents, et cetera. So when we talk about the Asia Pacific markets, for example, and we're seeing lots of acceleration there, we're adding inventory there. If the chains do get a good bit of market share in those marketplaces, then we'll look to fill up the independent hotels as well. But right now, we've got very good relationships with the chains. They are -- they merchandise quite effectively in our marketplace. And we find that the supply partners who have the closest relationships with our market managers on the ground tend to merchandise pretty effectively and they get an unfair share of our demand, and the chains are doing a really good job of that."

We're also seeing a lot of competition from what I would call tier 2 and tier 3 vendors as far as pricing against the top brands out there, which is hitting pricing to some extent. The car companies, I think, the fleets are at appropriate size, but I think the car companies have to be a bit more aggressive on pricing in order to get kind of the utilization of the fleets to where they need to be.

We are probably in discussions with a significant partner. We do have some key renewals this year. And once we're done with those renewals, we'll still only report back to you on that."

We have taken some of our CPC is down from where we were when we were combined companies internally. I'd say especially on the Expedia side. As Mark said, Expedia's marketing spend has come down year-on-year. But we are in kind of in the middle of measuring the relative volume effect relative to the increases or decreases in CPCs there, and we're right in the middle of it. So I think it's too soon to tell. I think our CPCs will settle out with TripAdvisor as the year moves on. They're an incredibly valuable partner to us. They continue to grow the channel. And with the amount of content that they have and their worldwide expansion, they are going to be a bigger part of ours 5 years from now than they are today. As far as our marketing ROI, the best ROI that we get on our marketing spend is bringing consumers directly to the site. It's the brand investments. Its investments that we're making in e-mail, et cetera. The difficulty in those investments is you don't see the direct ROI on those investments. So the strategy that we have is to keep investing in the variable channels, keep increasing our efficiency, hopefully, in those variable channels as we operationalize conversion improvements, and just how good we are in those variable channels. And then try to convert more and more of those consumers to our loyalty programs into direct consumers. It's a lot to do, but we think it's a sound strategy, and we're executing on itas we speak."

The fourth quarter wrapped up a solid year for Expedia. As promised, we completed the spinoff for TripAdvisor in the fourth quarter, unlocking significant value for our shareholders. There's a significant effort from a lot of folks in our",927,"Thanks, Alan. The fourth quarter wrapped up a solid year for Expedia. As promised, we completed the spinoff for TripAdvisor in the fourth quarter, unlocking significant value for our shareholders. 
There's a significant effort from a lot of folks in our organization, and we're happy to have successfully completed the transaction. We're now completely focused on our standalone travel transactions business and eager to prove that we can achieve healthy and meaningful top line and profit growth in the years to come. We're investing in key technology projects on modern platforms that will allow us to innovate much more quickly.
Additionally, we're investing in international expansion in order to position the business well for long-term growth. As such, although we saw transaction growth of 11%, gross bookings growth of 12% and revenue growth of 14% for the full year, these investments led to cost deleverage with adjusted EBITDA growing just 1%.
For the fourth quarter, gross bookings grew 10%, revenue growth -- grew 7% while adjusted EBITDA was down 4% year-on-year. Mark will have more to say about this after my remarks.
Our key technology projects are on track and proceeding as expected. As we mentioned last quarter, the Expedia brand hotel product is on the new platform, and the team is testing and rolling out new innovation that are showing early signs of success. 
While the overall Expedia brand performance for the quarter was unsatisfactory, its standalone hotel room night growth, as measured on a book basis, improved for the quarter compared to what we saw in Q3, and a conversion is headed on the right direction.  Air and packages continue to perform poorly, however, and are weighing on that business.
We believe that air and packages are key to the Expedia brand value proposition, and we'll continue to invest appropriately. 
We successfully tested the new air product for Expedia brand site, and we'll roll it out through Q1, with the majority of traffic expected to be on the new platform, end-to-end air path by the end of the quarter. 
We also moved portions of the package product on to the new platform, but we still don't expect to have the end-to-end packages product finished until the back half of 2012. 
To be clear, we don't expect improvements from this platform or to have a meaningful impact on Expedia brand's financial returns until the back half of 2012. But it is one of our top priorities, and we're optimistic we will see things begin to turn.
We continue to progress on our international expansion with Hotels.com in particular, seeing healthy room night growth across all regions. Our Expedia brand is 6 months into its joint venture with AirAsia, and we see excellent growth rate and progress in that new business. 
Although we don't consolidate the results for the JV, including it would have contributed roughly 200 basis points of total room night and revenue growth for the quarter.
Importantly, the Expedia brand launched 11 new points-of-sale in 2011, representing a new record for that brand. And this week marks the full consumer launch of Expedia Mexico, which now features our full air product.
Mark will spend more time on the quarterly results, but I did want to highlight our robust 19% room night growth, 21% if you include the AirAsia joint venture this quarter. 
With the exception of Expedia brand, all of our major brands delivered year-on-year room night growth this quarter as good or better than what we saw in Q3. Overall room night growth in APAC accelerated nicely, while room night growth for the EMEA and Americas region was largely similar to what we saw last quarter. Importantly, we continue to grow room night at a healthy pace in the U.S, despite its relative maturity, showing that there's still plenty of growth to be had here in what is our most mature market.
We spent a total of $134 million on increased investments in eLong during 2011. We believe that China represents a unique and extremely sizable opportunity, and we're happy to be able to continue investing in that market. 
For Egencia, we're also pleased to have completed the acquisition of Traveldoo in the fourth quarter, a leading European provider of corporate online booking tools to enterprises and TMCs. The acquisition addresses a new segment of the managed travel market that we don't capture with Egencia's integrated solution. 
And although the business operates under Egencia, we'll run Traveldoo on a completely standalone basis. In many cases, Traveldoo will compete with Egencia in the same way that our leisure brands compete with one another today. We're excited about the corporate travel space, and this acquisition adds to our portfolio, leading companies as we continue to position the business for long-term growth.
In closing, with 2011 behind us, we're squarely focused on executing our 2012 plan. All of our brands are doing quite well with the exception of Expedia brand. We know we have to turn that business around, and we have a good playbook, and the teams are executing. 
As we move into 2012, we'll face some really tough expense comps early in the year, but those will abate as the year progresses. By the end of the year, we'll have completed our key technology projects, setting us up for faster profit growth in what we think will be an excellent 2013. The business continues to generate significant annual free cash flow, and we'll be disciplined in our capital allocation and our stewardship of that cash.
With that, let me turn it over to Mark."

Strong room night growth was the gross bookings and revenue driver for the quarter. Room night growth was broadly strong across all regions with mid-teens growth in the Americas and EMEA region and much faster and accelerating growth in APAC. 
Revenue per room night, however, was down 5%. And the gap between 2% growth in ADRs and the decrease in revenue per room night was driven primarily by 4 key factors, each of which I would roughly equal weight.
We had a year-on-year headwind from the foreign exchange book-to-stay impact. Note that although this depresses revenue per room night, it is largely offset from an economic perspective through our hedging program, and has relatively little impact on adjusted EBITDA. Mix also pushed down the revenue per room night. As we saw last quarter, we saw faster growth in our chain hotels versus independents. 
The cost of our loyalty programs also had an impact. For the Expedia brand, this is a relatively new program, which we did not have in place this time last year. And for Hotels.com, this is a program that we recently rolled out to all of our international markets. 
Note that we managed this item more like selling and marketing expense, but we do record it as contra revenue. And as we mentioned last quarter, we continue with certain competitive pricing actions designed to ensure that we are putting the best possible deals in front of our customers.
As expected, our air business was down sharply in the quarter due to an 8% decline in ticket volume combined with an 11% decrease in revenue per ticket. The revenue per ticket pressure came from a combination of lacking the change to our merchant air accounting, which we described last year, and lower overall unit economics from recently negotiated contracts. These were partially offset by higher interline fees and consumer fees on certain international points-of-sale. Generally, we are expecting continued pressure on the air business in 2012.
From a brand perspective, we once again saw strong revenue performance pretty much across the board, with the exception of our Expedia brand, which was down 9% year-on-year. Revenue growth for the total business, excluding the Expedia brand, was 21% for the quarter.
Running through key expense categories, we saw a nice leverage in cost of revenue this quarter, which was aided by an easier comp for Q4, due to acceleration of some nonrefundable merchant fees and some onetime adjustments in Q4 2010. 
As expected, selling and marketing grew faster than revenue, driven largely by mix shift into our Expedia Affiliate Network and Hotels.com businesses. This impact was partially offset by a reduction in selling and marketing for Expedia. In addition, selling and marketing headcount grew across most of our brand, as well as within our supply organization.
Technology and content grew 29% for the quarter as we continued to see year-on-year impact of the buildup of headcount needed to complete the key technology projects, which we have discussed previously. 
Growth in G&A expense was much higher than we certainly are striving for on an ongoing basis, due to number of factors, which are individually insignificant, but when combined with growth in people cost, drove deleverage. These included a tougher year-on-year bonus comp, consulting costs for the reorganization of our supply group and increased expenses related to our efforts to turn the Expedia business around. Also as we mentioned last quarter, we did have onetime expense of roughly $7 million in Q4 related to our London office move. This item is spread across multiple expense categories.
Moving on to taxes, our GAAP effective fax rate was lower than expectations for the fourth quarter, and certainly lower than we can expect going forward. This was primarily due to a higher proportion of international earnings and favorable adjustments to our valuation allowances. Please note that our go-forward blended tax rate will be lower than it was when we owned TripAdvisor, since the travel transaction business has a higher relative proportion of earnings in the international regions with lower tax rates. 
Though precision can be difficult on this one, we would expect our effective rate to be in the range of 25% to 28% in 2012. We've had some favorable adjustments in the last couple of quarters, and the obvious caveat here is that these can sometimes go the other way.
Free cash flow totaled $618 million for the full year and grew a robust 32%. We used a portion of that free cash flow to make acquisitions and investments totaling just under $200 million, including the Traveldoo acquisition and the eLong transactions mentioned earlier. 
During the year, we also repurchased 10.6 million shares on a presplit adjusted basis of Expedia for just over $280 million, and we paid out a total of just over $75 million in dividends. As we've said consistently over the years, we generate robust cash flow and as such, can invest appropriately in the business while making opportunistic acquisitions and returning cash to shareholders. As you may have seen in our earnings release, our quarterly dividend is now $0.09 per share effective for the March payout.
In terms of our financial expectations for full year 2012, we are expecting adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-single-digit range. As a reminder, our revenue is significantly more seasonal without TripAdvisor and our expense comps are quite tough in the first and second quarters, with easing expected as we move throughout the year. 
As such, we expect most of our adjusted EBITDA growth to build in the back half of 2012. Note that we are basing our guidance on the foreign currency rates that we can see now and we don't try to forecast any future FX fluctuations.
Before I wrap up, a few quick housekeeping items. As we mentioned last quarter, you'll see from our recent disclosure that we've switched to adjusted EBITDA as our primary operating metric. It's effectively OIBA plus depreciation with one other primary difference, being the additional exclusion of reserves for occupancy tax litigation settlements.
Occupancy tax settlement reserve items are now outside of our core non-GAAP operating measure and outside of G&A. Going forward, they reside in the legal reserves occupancy tax and other line item of our GAAP financials, and I would encourage investors interested in these matters to read the related disclosures in our SEC filings.  You can see the complete definition of adjusted EBITDA in our earnings release along with the reconciliation to GAAP measures. 
Further, for Q3, we had estimated that our international gross bookings grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis. Since then, however, we have taken another look at this and now estimate that international gross bookings actually grew 14% in Q3 on a currency-neutral basis.
Lastly, as part of the TripAdvisor spinoff, we retired our 8.5% notes. The expense associated with this is just under $40 million and will be recorded in the first quarter of 2012. The expense will be recorded in discontinued operations, and as such, will be excluded from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income. 
With that, let's turn to questions. Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question."

If it's couponing, if you're talking about the competitive pricing actions, I think listen, going forward, when we see ADR and ATPs such as they have been, you could expect to see that happening. Now ADR growth has slowed down a little bit. So it's potentially in 2012 you can see that item easing. But it's tough to say, you'll have to see how things unfold. On loyalty, the thing that's really impacting that item in this quarter, last quarter is the fact that we didn't have the Expedia program last, last year at this time. So you've got to -- you basically got a really difficult comp. Now that program was rolled out in probably Q1, really part of Q2. And so as we roll through 2012, the comps on that front will get easier. We also saw an expanded rollout of the Hotels.com program, which, again, is to some extent a onetime item. That happened basically in Q4. So again, you'll see that with a little bit tougher comps throughout 2012. I will say with loyalty as one of those items that as these programs mature, they start to harden up. And until that happens, you can sometimes see fluctuations in the loyalty accruals, which certainly we did see last quarter."

I would say, kind of low single-digits growth. And it's been fairly consistent. European ADRs did take a negative kind of -- the growth rate in European ADRs slowed down because of FX, foreign exchange. The same went for APAC. So I would say on a same currency basis, things didn't change. But on a U.S. currency basis, the international ADRs that were quite strong at the beginning of the year became less strong in Q4. But again, that's not a fundamental issue. That is purely a foreign exchange issue. As far as CPCs go, we see CPCs, in general, we haven't seen very significant movement on CPCs in most of our different marketing segments. In general, we've seen CPCs move up and down with ADRs and we're not seeing significant change in that area."

And I would hope to see that in the second half of the year. Again, we haven't done it. But that's why we're investing the way that we are on the technology side. We're not going to make predictions on where Hotels.com, the room night growth and our private label room night growth are going to go, which other than saying that they have been healthy. Hotels.com has already lapped the big increase in acceleration in room nights that it experienced. So the lapping has already happened. And Hotels.com has continued to maintain high revenue -- sorry, room night growth. And hopefully, with execution, we'd expect to see that continue on a go-forward basis. But again, we know that we have to prove that out to you. I think the Q4 room night number was really healthy, and I think it was really healthy without Expedia hitting on all cylinders.

And with the amount of content that they have and their worldwide expansion, they are going to be a bigger part of ours 5 years from now than they are today. As far as our marketing ROI, the best ROI that we get on our marketing spend is bringing consumers directly to the site. It's the brand investments. Its investments that we're making in e-mail, et cetera. The difficulty in those investments is you don't see the direct ROI on those investments. So the strategy that we have is to keep investing in the variable channels, keep increasing our efficiency, hopefully, in those variable channels as we operationalize conversion improvements, and just how good we are in those variable channels.

Expedia iSOFT us all that started this year, with $102 million of adjusted EBITDA generated in the first quarter, exceeding our own expectations. On the top line, gross bookings and revenue growth were again driven by strength in our hotel business, with global room nights growing 24%, a nice acceleration from a 19% we saw in Q4. Including the room nights from Expedia's joint venture with AirAsia, room nights would've grown by 27%. As we mentioned last quarter, all of our major brands other than Expedia continues to perform well, with combined revenue growth of 27%. Results for the Expedia brand are still not where want them to be but they did show improvement. Standalone room night growth has improved over the last 2 quarters from a slight decline year-over-year in the third quarter last year prior to the launch of the new platform, to mid-single-digit growth in the first quarter. While it's clearly too soon to declare any type of victory, the Expedia brand team is starting to execute effectively and we're beginning to see tangible evidence that our focus product like game plan is working. It's also important to note that the technology project on Expedia brand remain on track. We're pushing a significant percentage of U.S. traffic through the new air platform and testing its performance. Optimizations are being implemented and will continue the rollout of the new platform in the second quarter. The work on packages is ongoing and we expect it to be substantially complete by year end. We continue to innovate on the new hotel platform and those of you that visit the site regularly and undoubtedly see some of these improvements. Having the capable test quickly and broadly, deploy new features are keys to success and we've already run more tests on our new platform so far in 2012, than we did all of last year. We expect the most pronounced overall benefits come when consumers can enjoy the best shopping experience in online travels seamlessly across all of our product lines. International revenue growth accelerated in the quarter versus the prior quarter, and we continue to aggressively scale our international businesses, most notably with our recent acquisition or recent announcement that we intent to acquire VIA Travel acquire VIA Travel, E-BID Corporate Travel company in the Nordic region of Europe. As of today, the deal hasn't closed so our comments will be limited but suffice to say that this transaction is almost entirely complimentary to our existing corporate travel business and gives us a strong position in that region. We're committed to driving scale for Egencia and are pleased to be able to use our international cash for this purpose.
Also in regard to international travel, we recently partnered with brand USA promoting travel to America by matching advertising dollars for any travel events that promote their destination or products through an international audience. We're also featuring participating brand partners on a Discover America landing page. Brand USA is a terrific public-private marketing organization that works with the travel industry to promote travel to the U.S. creating jobs in our domestic travel sector.
Lastly, in terms of capital allocation, we repurchased 8.8 million shares so far in 2012 for $291 million, exhausting our previous share repurchase authorization. Since the spinoff from IEC, we allocated $2.7 billion towards a repurchase of our company's stock, returning approximately 36% of our share capital. And we've returned another 168 million to our shareholders through dividends since initiating that program a couple of years ago. We'll continue to look to add value for our shareholders through strong operational execution, as well as smart capital allocation.
In summary, I'm encouraged with our progress and brand Expedia, and with the continuing results of our other brands. Our strategy is on track and our efforts are beginning to show signs of payback. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to talk about the financials."
25915843,184400163,290358,"Expedia Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dara.

From a financial perspective, the first quarter came in better than we'd expected, driven by underlying strength in our global hotel business. Of course, we did have some tailwinds this quarter with the favorable comps on airline ticket volumes and extra day from BP and FX improving slightly since the last conference call. As Dara mentioned, room night growth was robust to 24%, 27% including the results from the AirAsia joint venture and accelerated from Q4 growth rates across all major geographies. Of particular note, total room nights in United States were up 18%, accelerating versus Q4, solid evidence of our ability to grow our direct volumes and share.
Hotels.com, our largest hotel business, is measured by room nights led the charge with room night growth of 37% and sequential acceleration again, across all major regions. Revenue per room night was down 6% on flat AVRs. The gap between the 2 metrics was driven by similar trends as last quarter. Also keep in mind that growth in our APAC hotel business continues to outpace the other regions. And APAC represented the high teens percentage of global room nights in the first quarter. Since ADRs and revenue per room night are much lower in APAC, this will put downward pressure on per room metrics for the foreseeable future. With that said, we believe APAC represents a great long-term growth opportunity for us which we're targeting with our diversified set of key assets including eLong, the AirAsia-Expedia joint venture, Hotels.com, Egencia and our growing affiliate business. Revenue from our Air business represented 11% of our total revenue for the quarter, and although we grew volume 5%, revenue per ticket was down 20%, due primarily to reduced ticket economics combined with lower volume-based incentives. We expect revenue per ticket to continue to be down year-over-year for the duration of 2012, with the impacted easing as we move through the year. Other revenue grew 15% for the quarter on a combination of nice growth across car rental, ad and media, and corporate travel fees. Running through key expense categories, cost of revenue grew just a touch faster than revenue this quarter, as credit card fees grew along with the growth in our merchant gross bookings and as we added headcount to support our growth. This was partially offset by lower debit card fees and an increase in credit card rebates.
Selling and marketing grew at a rate quite a bit slower than revenue growth, driven by decreased online spending for our Expedia brand. We have been systematically pulling out inefficient spend at Expedia and have been generally less aggressive on the marketing front for that brand given where we are in the technology migration projects. Excluding the Expedia brand, selling and marketing grew more in line with revenue. For Expedia, Inc. we do not expect to see the type of leverage that we saw in Q1, as we move forward in 2012. And we are forecasting full-year selling and marketing to go broadly in line with revenue.
Technology and content grew 26% for the quarter, and though a bit lighter than we had expected, we continue to see year-on-year impact of the prior period buildup of headcount needed to complete our key technology projects. While we expect year-over-year growth of our cash spending on technology and content to decrease as we move through 2012, we expect that the recorded growth rate in future quarters will be broadly similar to what we saw in Q1 due to the relative levels of capitalization of these costs and related depreciation. G&A grew 10% for the quarter, largely due to headcount costs to support the overall growth in the business. From a capital allocation perspective, as Dara mentioned, we've repurchased 8.8 million shares for $291 million so far this year, and the Board has authorized an additional tranche of 20 million shares for repurchase. We also paid our $0.09 per share quarterly dividend. Lastly, we announced the Via acquisitions, which we expect to close imminently and assuming it does, you'll see it's impact in our Q2 cash flow statement.
In terms of our financial expectations for full year 2012, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-single-digit range. Remember that Q1 represents our lowest adjusted EBITDA quarter for the year. So while we're happy with the outperformance in the first quarter, it does not have a large impact on full year adjusted EBITDA. Consistent with prior practice, we're not giving guidance for Q2, but we do want to note the top line comps get tougher and that current rates, foreign currency translation is a bigger headwind. While we're quite pleased with Q1 performance and are incrementally confident about our ability to deliver these results, note that the majority of our annual adjusted EBITDA growth is expected to build in the back half of the year and as such, the real story of our full-year results is very much yet to be told.
With that, let's turn to questions. Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question?"

So again, the trends that we saw in the delta between ADR and revenue per room night were similar to what we've seen in prior quarters. Those were the impact of our loyalty programs primarily of the Expedia brand this time last year, Expedia did not have a loyalty program. They do this year and so that's really a tough comp there. In addition the Hotels.com loyalty program expanded internationally during the last quarter. And so again, we've got a tough comp on that front. The second impact that we mentioned on the last call, which was also happening this quarter as well is competitive pricing actions. Primarily that is Hotwire, where Hotwire is having some pretty nice success, pushing volumes through taking lower margins essentially. The third item was the impact of foreign exchange. That, again, was a factor this quarter. And then we also continue to see just mix shift in our hotel business. The change and to otherwise less margin accretive products. So those were by and large the big delta drivers between ADR and revenue per room night. If you look across those 4 things, on the loyalty front, you will start to hit clean comps as we move throughout this year. I think the Expedia program was launched through the end of Q1 and through Q2. So Q3, that gets to be a clean comp. Hotels.com, it's not probably until Q1 of 2013 until you clean that comp. On the Hotwire actions, they've been doing that for a number of quarters now. So I suspect Q2, Q3, you might get a clean comp on that. And then it's always hard to say with FX and the mix shift issue on hotels is just something that's really hard to predict. I think the second was in terms of ADRs in various regions. We continue to see decent strength in ADRs. I think if you look at how our hotel partners, the ones that have reported the trends that they're seeing broadly, ours is consistent with what the paper reported, there is some pockets of ADR because in Europe that we have seen in the rest of the world is by and large looking fairly healthy."

The Expedia Hotel path is -- has been on the new technology platform for the past couple of quarters. And while we won't share specific metrics, our room night volumes -- standalone room night volume on Expedia accelerated nicely in the first quarter over Q4 of last year, which was faster than Q3 of last year. So on a sequential basis, our standalone room night volume is improving. We think that we're just getting started here. And the key here is just translating the new platform into actually new product to consumers that converts better and then marketing more aggressively against that product. So we are, I would say early in that program, but we're already starting to see the benefits that program, and we expect to see further benefits in the back half of the year. Again, similar to what we saw in Hotels.com, although Expedia is somewhat disadvantaged because of its multi-product nature. We are also right in the middle of rolling over from our old air platform to our new air platform, and are actively testing single ticket in different types of transactions on the new platform versus the old platform and we're actively right -- we're in the middle of that testing. We expect to see good results from that testing. We will then start rolling over all of our ticketing worldwide basis to the new platform, which will then enable us to start really testing out new feature functionality and hopefully driving conversions. So the platform upgrade is happening as planned and then hopefully the feature functionality will follow soon just as you've seen in hotels. And on package, that's going to happen really in the back half of the year. It's going to happen sometime in the fourth quarter. All of the work being done is on schedule, and you will see benefits of that hopefully, next year."

The demand profile and at applied will follow the business are so global now that particular Olympics in a particular price isn't going to really move the needle too much. But the market management team is prepared, and we've got good inventory in London during those times. As far as our mobile strategy goes, it is -- you don't really moving along all fronts with Hotels.com really leading the charge there on the mobile side. One of the feature set that we have are exclusive kind of same day only type booking functionality for Hotels.com on a worldwide basis. And then we're also tying in the WelcomeRewards loyalty program into our mobile products as well, which is a very popular program for Hotels.com on a worldwide basis. On Expedia, we have rolled out the Expedia hotels app, which has been built by a combination of our teams and the Mobiata teams. And later in this year, we are going to launch an air product that we're very excited about. And then Hotwire of course, we've relaunched on a global basis as well. So I think mobile right now is at the stage of kind of consistent execution across all of the brands. It is starting to become a channel that we're quite focused on mobile and it's clearly one of our fastest growing channels.

As far as hotel improvement, we are continuing strong continuing conversion on the hotel side. I think that we will see more, and we are -- when I talk about the acceleration of kind of the A/B testing that we're seeing in Expedia has significantly accelerated in the first quarter versus where we were in the fourth quarter or third quarter, last year. So while some of the improvement that we're seeing in the Expedia hotel volume is because of stronger conversion along with better strength on the variable marketing side, I'm certainly expecting more. The more test you do usually, the more test exceed and then you pick the successful ones and you roll that worldwide and we're kind of in the middle of that part process. I know you can obviously, see from the strength of the Hotels.com brand is at -- that's a -- that's kind of kind of a flywheel that you can continue for some period of time. So Hotels.com conversion in particular now that it's rolled over kind of the one-year anniversary or the platform continues to get better as we roll out more and more products and as we optimize the sites better, get rid of bugs, et cetera. And so we're hoping to see that conversion clock continue, and I think Expedia's early in the path and the Hotels.com team and the EAN teams are sort of fall down the path and I think we've proven that hopefully be something that we can keep going for some period of time. As far as the chain negotiations go, we are seeing very healthy volumes with the chains. Our relationships continue to be quite good, and we have and will have some pretty significant negotiations coming up this year. We're confident that we'll continue to work with our major chain partners. But other than that, we're not going to get into the specific details of the relationships one way or the other."

We've got internal brands that are incredibly strong, are very innovative. But we welcome other brands and other ideas using our inventory because it benefits both of us. It pushes hotel volume down to our hotel partners. We have obviously, economic share in that transaction as well. And we think innovation in the travel business is a good thing. So we're working very closely with TripAdvisor on TANCO. We think it's a cool, you product and you're right. In some ways, if a competitor but in a bigger way, we think that it's a partner. And that kind of open philosophy of having a completely open marketplace is something that's pretty fundamental to what we believe and it's not something that we're going to change."

I think, listen, the effect of the hotels on the suppliers is going to be that they need to be much more careful on the revenue management front. And they also need to be able to balance those short-term bookings with the book of business, kind of a long-term book of business, which, for example, on the Expedia sites is really the packages business that we offer to those hotels. So the more they can balance that short and long term, the better off they are. But they do have to, I would say revenue manage more aggressively and also take advantage of different consumer channels kind of more appropriately. The parity pricing everywhere, I think it's going to be tough to pull off when you've got mobile channels, you've got may be Facebook channels, where you can market specifically to consumers let's say in Japan and Germany, differently from consumers in other countries. So I think that, that there is going to be a real change in how hoteliers and our partners revenue manage and hopefully, we will help with the balance book of business, leisure, corporate, package, standalone, desktop and mobile and also deliver to them lots of intelligence or where the demand is coming from or what the demand is weak on a relative basis. As far as the rental fleets go -- the volumes that we saw in the first quarter were healthy but pricing was somewhat less healthy. Pricing was a little weak. But we have seen the fleets get tighter, and we are expecting pricing to tighten up a bit. Although I can't give you specifics on kind of the result in pricing. I think we'll see those results coming in Q2, more than we saw in Q1."

So I'll actually take the second question first. I think if you look at our domestic room night growth this quarter at 18% accelerating from the prior quarter, I think a decent evidence of the fact that we can continue to grow even our domestic market. We are the largest in the U.S. We sell about 1 out of every 20 room nights that's sold on any channel in the U.S. And we're the biggest. So there's lots of headroom in the U.S. market. I think we've said it in the past, the global travel market is a very big opportunity. I think there's room for both ourselves and our competitor, our primary global competitor to grow on into the future before we really start bumping into each other. So with respect to the growth expectations for Expedia relative to what we've seen with Hotels.com, it's really hard to predict. I would just say that we were pleasantly surprised with what we saw with Hotels.com, and we are encouraged with what we've seen with Expedia. And I guess, it is possible that we could see Expedia hit those growth rates, I do remind you though that Expedia is just a little bit more of a complicated business with it being multiproduct. And so there's a little bit more complexity to it. And it's a little bit larger in some markets like the U.S. But theoretically, if you get this right, again, it's a huge market with lots of opportunity and there's lots of room for growth for Hotels.com and Expedia and if we get the technology right, there's lots of opportunity ahead."

And then -- when you look at Expedia on an overall basis, that's a relative disadvantage versus Hotels.com. A fair amount of Expedia's hotel volume also comes from upsells from the air path, et cetera and again, with air being bigger and stronger this year, that's a bit of a headwind. Now when we move over fully to the new technology platform on air packages, et cetera, we hope to get those businesses growing again.

And you'll see us go in -- to some extent, sometimes fits and starts in terms of our property additions, just depending on how our -- the demand side of our business is doing and whether we're feeling like we're particularly supply-constraint given the demand we've had. We did have a period over the course of the last few years where we've been pretty aggressive in building up our inventory position, helped in part by the agency product that we brought on with the near. And so we've had some time then array to really have demand catch-up. And I think we'll see what happened through 2012 but our focus is going to be primarily on really sort of optimizing what we've got and adding tactically as opposed to a massive acquisition effort. Just with respect to the specific question you had on eLong, that was actually a reference to all of our Asia Pacific business, which includes the Air Astana joint venture, Hotels.com, our EAN private label business, the powers July, for example, which is the leading OTA in Japan. So it's not just eLong. And then you had another question with respect to ADRs and revenue margin trends. I would say that we have seen a fairly consistent patterns. What we've seen in the last few quarters, we've seen some strength in the U.S. and some pockets of ADR weakness in parts of Europe, where they've had particular economic troubles.

As far as Expedia and Priceline and the markets. Listen, I go back to what Mark said before. This is travel is an enormous market. We are the biggest online player in the U.S. and we're only 5% of the room night share. I think that Priceline has been executing for many, many years, and they've been executing quite effectively. And we are starting to execute more effectively as a team and across our brands and across our geographies.

25915843,184400163,290591,"Expedia Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. Expedia is off to a solid start this year, with $102 million of adjusted EBITDA generated in the first quarter, exceeding our own expectations.

Expedia is off to a solid start this year, with $102 million of adjusted EBITDA generated in the first quarter, exceeding our own expectations. On the top line, gross bookings and revenue growth were again driven by strength in our hotel business, with global room nights growing 24%, a nice acceleration from the 19% we saw for Q4. Including the room nights from Expedia's joint venture with AirAsia, room nights would have grown by 27%. 
As we mentioned last quarter, all of our major brands, other than Expedia, continues to perform well, with combined revenue growth of 27%. Results for the Expedia brand are still not where we want them to be, but they did show improvement. Standalone room night growth has improved over the last few quarters from a slight decline year-over-year in the third quarter last year prior to the launch of the new platform, to mid-single-digit growth in the first quarter. 
While it's clearly too soon to declare any type of victory, the Expedia brand team is starting to execute effectively, and we're beginning to see tangible evidence that our focused product led game plan is working. It's also important to note that the technology projects on the Expedia brand remain on track. We're pushing a significant percentage of U.S. traffic through the new air platform and testing its performance. Optimizations are being implemented, and we'll continue the rollout of the new platform in the second quarter. 
The work on packages is ongoing, and we expect it to be substantially complete by year end. We continue to innovate on the new hotel platform, and those of you that visit the site regularly can undoubtedly see some of these improvements. Having the capability to test quickly and broadly deploy new features are keys to success, and we've already run more tests on our new platform so far in 2012 than we did all of last year.  We expect the most pronounced overall benefits come and consumers can enjoy the best shopping experience in online travels seamlessly across all of our product lines. 
International revenue growth accelerated in the quarter versus the prior quarter, and we continue to aggressively scale our international businesses, most notably with our recent acquisition or recent announcement that we intend to acquire VIA Travel acquire VIA Travel, a leading corporate travel company in the Nordic region of Europe. As of today, the deal hasn't closed, so our comments will be limited. But suffice it to say that this transaction is almost entirely complementary to our existing corporate travel business and gives us a strong position in that region. We're committed to driving scale for Egencia, and are pleased to be able to use our international cash for this purpose.
Also in regard to international travel, we've recently partnered with Brand USA, promoting travel to America by matching advertising dollars for any travel brands that promote their destination or products to an international audience. We're also featuring participating brand partners on the Discover America landing page. Brand USA is a terrific public-private marketing organization that works with the travel industry to promote travel to the U.S., creating jobs in our domestic travel sector.
Lastly, in terms of capital allocation, we've repurchased 8.8 million shares so far in 2012 for $291 million, exhausting our previous share repurchase authorization. Since our spin-off from IAC, we've allocated $2.7 billion towards the repurchase of our company's stock, returning approximately 36% of our share capital. And we've returned another 168 million to our shareholders through dividends since initiating that program a couple of years ago. We'll continue to look to add value for our shareholders through strong operational execution, as well as smart capital allocation.
In summary, I'm encouraged with our progress and brand Expedia and with the continuing results of our other brands. Our strategy is on track, and our efforts are beginning to show signs of payback. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to talk about the financials."

From a financial perspective, the first quarter came in better than we had expected, driven by underlying strength in our global hotel business. Of course, we did have some tailwinds this quarter with the favorable comps on airline ticket volumes and extra day from leap year and FX improving slightly since the last conference call. 
As Dara mentioned, room night growth was robust at 24%, 27% including the results from the AirAsia joint venture, and accelerated from Q4 growth rates across all major geographies. Of particular note, total room nights in the United States were up 18%, accelerating versus Q4, solid evidence of our ability to grow our direct volumes and share.
Hotels.com, our largest hotel business as measured by room nights, led the charge with room night growth of 37% and sequential acceleration, again, across all major regions. Revenue per room night was down 6% on flat ADRs. The gap between the 2 metrics was driven by similar trends as last quarter. Also, keep in mind that growth in our APAC hotel business continues to outpace the other regions, and APAC represented the high teens percentage of global room nights in the first quarter. Since ADRs and revenue per room night are much lower in APAC, this will put downward pressure on per-room metrics for the foreseeable future. 
With that said, we believe APAC represents a great long-term growth opportunity for us, which we're targeting with our diversified set of key assets including eLong, the AirAsia-Expedia joint venture, Hotels.com, Egencia and our growing affiliate business. Revenue from our air business represented 11% of our total revenue for the quarter, and although we grew ticket volume 5%, revenue per ticket was down 20% due primarily to reduced ticket economics combined with lower volume-based incentives. We expect revenue per ticket to continue to be down year-over-year for the duration of 2012, with the impacted easing as we move through the year. 
Other revenue grew 15% for the quarter on a combination of nice growth across car rental, ad and media, and corporate travel fees. Running through key expense categories, cost of revenue grew just a touch faster than revenue this quarter, as credit card fees grew along with the growth in our merchant gross bookings and as we added headcount to support our growth. This was partially offset by lower debit card fees and an increase in credit card rebates.
Selling and marketing grew at a rate quite a bit slower than revenue growth, driven by decreased online spending for our Expedia brand. We have been systematically pulling out inefficient spend at Expedia and have been generally less aggressive on the marketing front for that brand given where we are in the technology migration projects. Excluding the Expedia brand, selling and marketing grew more in line with revenue. For Expedia, Inc., we do not expect to see the type of leverage that we saw in Q1 as we move forward in 2012. And we are forecasting full year selling and marketing to go broadly in line with revenue.
Technology and content grew 26% for the quarter, and though a bit lighter than we had expected, we continue to see the year-on-year impact of the prior period build-up of headcount needed to complete our key technology projects. While we expect year-over-year growth of our cash spending on technology and content to decrease as we move through 2012, we expect that the recorded growth rate in future quarters will be broadly similar to what we saw in Q1 due to the relative levels of the capitalization of these costs and related depreciation. 
G&A grew 10% for the quarter, largely due to headcount costs to support the overall growth in the business. From a capital allocation perspective, as Dara mentioned, we've repurchased 8.8 million shares for $291 million so far this year, and the board has authorized an additional tranche of 20 million shares for repurchase. We also paid our $0.09 per share quarterly dividend. Lastly, we announced the VIA acquisitions, which we expect to close imminently. And assuming it does, you'll see its impact on our Q2 cash flow statement.
In terms of our financial expectations for full year 2012, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-single-digit range. Remember that Q1 represents our lowest adjusted EBITDA quarter for the year. So while we're happy with the outperformance in the first quarter, it does not have a large impact on full year adjusted EBITDA. Consistent with prior practice, we are not giving guidance for Q2, but we do want to note the top line comps get tougher and that current rates, foreign currency translation, is a bigger headwind. 
While we're quite pleased with Q1 performance and are incrementally confident about our ability to deliver these full year results, note that the majority of our annual adjusted EBITDA growth is expected to build in the back half of the year. And as such, the real story of our full year results is very much yet to be told.
With that, let's turn to questions. Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question?"

So again, the trends that we saw and the delta between ADR and revenue per room night were similar to what we've seen on prior quarters.

So again, the trends that we saw and the delta between ADR and revenue per room night were similar to what we've seen on prior quarters. Those were the impact of our loyalty programs, primarily of the Expedia brand. This time last year, Expedia did not have a loyalty program; they do this year. And so there's really a tough comp there. In addition, the Hotels.com loyalty program expanded internationally during the last quarter. And so again, we've got a tough comp on that front. The second impact that we mentioned on the last call, which was also happening this quarter as well is competitive pricing actions. Primarily that is Hotwire, where Hotwire is having some pretty nice success, pushing volumes through taking lower margins essentially. The third item was the impact of foreign exchange. That, again, was a factor this quarter. And then we also continues to see just mix shift in our hotel business, the chains to and to otherwise less, less margin accretive products. So those were by and large the big delta drivers between ADR and revenue per room night. If you look across those 4 things, on the loyalty front, you will start to hit clean comps as we move throughout this year. I think the Expedia program was launched through the end of Q1 and through Q2. So Q3, that gets to be a clean comp. Hotels.com, it's probably not going to be until Q1 of 2013 until you clean that comp. On the Hotwire actions, they've been doing that for a number of quarters now. So I suspect Q2, Q3, you might get a clean comp on that. And then -- it's always hard to say with FX. And the mix shift issue on Hotel is just something that's really hard to predict. I think your second was in terms of ADRs in various regions. We continue to see decent strength in ADRs. I think if you look at how our hotel partners, the ones that have reported the trends that they're seeing, broadly, ours were consistent with what they've reported. There is some pockets of ADR weakness in Europe that we have seen, and the rest of the world is by and large looking fairly healthy."

The Expedia Hotel path is -- has been on the new technology platform for the past couple of quarters. And while we won't share specific metrics, our room night volumes -- standalone room night volume on Expedia accelerated nicely in the first quarter over Q4 of last year, which was faster than Q3 of last year. So on a sequential basis, our standalone room night volume is improving. We think that we're just getting started here. And the key here is just translating the new platform into actually new product to consumers that converts better and then marketing more aggressively against that product. So we are, I would say, early in that program, but we're already starting to see benefits of that program, and we expect to see further benefits in the back half of the year. Again, similar to what we saw in Hotels.com, although Expedia is somewhat disadvantaged because of its multi-product nature. We are also right in the middle of rolling over from our old air platform to our new air platform, and are actively testing single tickets, different types of transactions on the new platform versus the old platform. And we're actively right -- we're in the middle of that testing. We expect to see good results from that testing. We will then start rolling over all of our air ticketing on a worldwide basis to the new platform, which will then enable us to start really testing out new feature functionality and, hopefully, driving conversions. So the platform upgrade is happening as planned, and then hopefully, the feature functionality will follow soon just as you've seen in Hotels. And on package, that's going to happen really in the back half of the year. It's going to happen some time in the fourth quarter. All of the work being done is on schedule, and you will see benefits of that, hopefully, next year."

As far as our mobile strategy goes, it is  really moving along all fronts with Hotels.com really leading the charge there on the mobile side. One of the feature sets that we have are exclusive kind of same day-only-type booking functionality for Hotels.com on a worldwide basis. And then we're also tying in the WelcomeRewards loyalty program into our mobile products as well, which is a very popular program for Hotels.com on a worldwide basis. On Expedia, we have rolled out the Expedia Hotels App, which has been built by a combination of our teams and the Mobiata teams. And later in this year, we are going to launch an air product that we're very excited about. And then Hotwire, of course, we've relaunched on a mobile basis as well. So I think mobile right now is at the stage of kind of consistent execution across all of the brands. It is starting to become a channel that we're quite focused on, and it's clearly one of our fastest-growing channels.

First, I would say on the hotel conversions that you've seen, I think you noted on the fourth quarter that conversions, you start to see some improvement, and you saw a -- probably a little bit more in that testing. Can you kind of give us an update on how that has progressed in terms of better conversion rates and potential for increased marketing on just that hotel platform specifically? And then second is on some of your chain hotels. I know that some of the contract negotiations sort of gave a little bit of margins. But a little bit more brands are now -- the Expedia brands are now working with some of the chain hotels. Wondering if you saw an increased volume as part of that change? And I have a very quick follow up."

As far as hotel improvement, we are seeing continuing strong conversion on the hotel side. I think that we will see more, and we are -- when I talk about the acceleration of kind of the A/B testing that we're seeing in Expedia, has significantly accelerated in the first quarter versus where we were in the fourth quarter or third quarter last year. So while some of the improvement that we're seeing in the Expedia hotel volume is because of stronger conversion, along with better strength on the variable marketing side, I'm certainly expecting more. The more test you do, usually, the more tests succeed, and then you pick the successful ones and you roll them out worldwide. And we're kind of right in the middle of that part process. I know you can obviously see from the strength of the Hotels.com brand is that -- that's a -- that's kind of a flywheel that you can continue with for some period of time. So Hotels.com conversion, in particular, now that it's rolled over kind of the one year anniversary of the platform continues to get better as we roll out more and more products and as we optimize the sites better, get rid of bugs, et cetera. So we're hoping to see that conversion clock continue, and I think Expedia's early in the path, and the Hotels.com team and the EAN teams, et cetera, are kind of well down the path and I think are -- proven that, hopefully, this is something that we can keep going for some period, of time. As far as the chain negotiations go, we are seeing very healthy volumes with the chains. Our relationships continue to be quite good, and we have and will have some pretty significant negotiations coming up this year. We're confident that we'll continue to work with our major chain partners. But other than that, we're not going to get into the specific details of the relationships one way or the other."

And they also need to be able to balance those short-term bookings with the book of business, kind of a long-term book of business, which, for example, on the Expedia side, it's really the packages business that we offer to those hotels. So the more they can balance that short and long term, the better off they are. But they do have to, I would say, revenue manage more aggressively and also take advantage of different consumer channels kind of more appropriately. The parity pricing everywhere, I think it's going to be tough to pull off when you've got mobile channels, you've got maybe Facebook channels, when you can market specifically to consumers, let's say, in Japan and Germany, differently from consumers in other countries. So I think that, that there is going to be a real change in how hoteliers and our partners revenue manage. And, hopefully, we will help them with a balanced book of business, leisure, corporate, package, standalone, desktop and mobile. And also deliver to them lots of intelligence on where the demand is coming from or where the demand is weak on a relative basis. As far as the rental fleets go, the volumes that we saw in the first quarter were healthy, but pricing was somewhat less healthy. Pricing was a little weak. But we have seen the fleets get tighter, and we are expecting pricing to tighten up a bit. Although I can't give you specifics on kind of the result in pricing. I think we'll see those results coming in Q2 more than we saw in Q1."

So I'll take -- actually take the second question first. I think if you look at our domestic room night growth this quarter at 18%, accelerated from the prior quarters, I think, it's decent evidence of the fact that we can continue to grow even our domestic market. We are the largest in the U.S. We sell about 1 out of every 20 room nights that's sold on any channel in the U.S. And we're the biggest. So there's lots of headroom in the U.S. market. I think we've said it in the past, the -- that the global travel market is a very big opportunity. I think there's room for both ourselves and our competitor, our primary global competitor to grow on into the future before we really start bumping into each other. So with respect to the growth expectations for Expedia relative to what we've seen with Hotels.com, it's really hard to predict. I would just say that we were pleasantly surprised with what we saw with Hotels.com, and we are encouraged with what we've seen with Expedia. And I guess it is possible that we could see Expedia hit those growth rates. I do remind you though that Expedia is just a little bit more of a complicated business with it being multiproduct. And so there's a little bit more complexity to it. And it's a little bit larger in some markets like the U.S. But theoretically, if we get this right, again, it's a huge market with lots of opportunity, and there's lots of room for growth for Hotels.com and Expedia.

And when  -- then when you look at Expedia on an overall basis, that's a relative disadvantage versus Hotels.com. A fair amount of Expedia's hotel volume also comes from upsells from the air path, et cetera. And again, with air being weaker than stronger this year, that's a bit of a headwind. Now when we move over fully to the new technology platform on air packages, et cetera, we hope to get those businesses growing again.

We did have the period over the course of the last few years where we've been pretty aggressive in building up our inventory position, helped in part by the agency product that we brought on with Venere. And so we've had some time to really have demand catch-up. And I think we'll see what happens through 2012, but our focus is going to be primarily on really sort of optimizing what we've got and adding tactically as opposed to a massive acquisition effort. Just with respect to the specific question you had on eLong, that was actually a reference to all of our Asia Pacific business, which includes the AirAsia joint venture, Hotels.com, our EAN private label business that powers J-Lon [ph], for example, which is the leading OTA in Japan. So it's not just eLong. And then you had another question with respect to ADRs and revenue margin trends.

That was -- it's really something they've been focused on. I would consider that, to some extent, an anomaly for the quarter. Part of that again is just the systematic process they've been going through. Part of it is they've been working on the technology platform, and so been a little bit less aggressive. But I think the way I would think about it going forward is that on a full year basis, for Expedia, Inc., we expect sales and marketing to be growing broadly in line with revenue for the full year."

And to put it another way, if the European Commission laid-off Google tomorrow, how much -- how differently would they behave in Europe? That's the first one. The second one is, if you look at Expedia and Priceline as the market, I know that's not realistic, but the numbers we get on hotels room nights only come from Expedia and Priceline. If you look at -- if you add those 2 together, the hotel room nights you've sold, Q1 last year was an outstanding quarter. It was very -- it was such a very difficult comp that accelerated over Q4 and Q3. Going into this quarter, I was a little nervous, and you put up a great number. And assuming a normal share shift, the number that Priceline and Expedia put up together will be another acceleration on an extremely difficult comp. So my question is, what do you think is behind that? Is this just Asia starting to matter in the numbers, or have we hit an inflection point? Have we got -- have we reached a steeper point on the S-curve where offline travel agents are really dying and people are really starting to embrace online travel booking?"

I say as far as Google and the EU, it's just impossible to speculate on what their behavior would be based on different circumstances.

And we've made that -- those concerns apparent to the EU to -- and it's something that we're working on actively. But it's very difficult to say how would Google behave one way or the other. The fact is, we've got a good working relationship with them on a day-to-day basis. We're very big clients of theirs, and we'll see how that relationship progresses on a go-forward basis. As far as Expedia and Priceline and the markets, listen, I go back to what Mark said before. This is -- travel is an enormous market. We are the biggest online player in the U.S., and we're only 5% of the room night share. I think that Priceline has been executing for many, many years, and they've been executing quite effectively. And we are starting to execute more effectively as a team and across our brands and across our geographies. I really can't make a statement as to whether this is  a -- signifies a change in the industry one way or the other, or offline to online share, I will say though that the increasing share of Asia Pacific as a percentage of our overall volumes is something that we're quite excited about. And hopefully, something that we can build going forward."

Expedia is off to a solid start this year, with $102 million of adjusted EBITDA generated in the first quarter, exceeding our own expectations.

Expedia is off to a solid start this year, with $102 million of adjusted EBITDA generated in the first quarter, exceeding our own expectations. On the top line, gross bookings and revenue growth were again driven by strength in our hotel business, with global room nights growing 24%, a nice acceleration from the 19% we saw for Q4. Including the room nights from Expedia's joint venture with AirAsia, room nights would have grown by 27%. 
As we mentioned last quarter, all of our major brands other than Expedia, continues to perform well, with combined revenue growth of 27%. Results for the Expedia brand are still not where we want them to be, but they did show improvement. Standalone room night growth has improved over the last few quarters from a slight decline year-over-year in the third quarter last year prior to the launch of the new platform, to mid-single-digit growth in the first quarter. 
While it's clearly too soon to declare any type of victory, the Expedia brand team is starting to execute effectively, and we're beginning to see tangible evidence that our focused product-led game plan is working. It's also important to note that the technology projects on the Expedia brand remain on track. We're pushing a significant percentage of U.S. traffic through the new air platform and testing its performance. Optimizations are being implemented, and we'll continue the rollout of the new platform in the second quarter. 
The work on packages is ongoing, and we expect it to be substantially complete by year end. We continue to innovate on the new hotel platform, and those of you that visit the site regularly can undoubtedly see some of these improvements. Having the capability to test quickly and broadly deploy new features are keys to success, and we've already run more tests on our new platform so far in 2012 than we did all of last year.  We expect the most pronounced overall benefits come when consumers can enjoy the best shopping experience in online travel seamlessly across all of our product lines. 
International revenue growth accelerated in the quarter versus the prior quarter, and we continue to aggressively scale our international businesses, most notably with our recent acquisition or recent announcement that we intend to acquire VIA Travel, a leading corporate travel company in the Nordic region of Europe. As of today, the deal hasn't closed, so our comments will be limited. But suffice it to say that this transaction is almost entirely complementary to our existing corporate travel business and gives us a strong position in that region. We're committed to driving scale for Egencia, and are pleased to be able to use our international cash for this purpose.
Also in regard to international travel, we've recently partnered with Brand USA, promoting travel to America by matching advertising dollars for any travel brands that promote their destination or products to an international audience. We're also featuring participating brand partners on the Discover America landing page. Brand USA is a terrific public-private marketing organization that works with the travel industry to promote travel to the U.S., creating jobs in our domestic travel sector.
Lastly, in terms of capital allocation, we've repurchased 8.8 million shares so far in 2012 for $291 million, exhausting our previous share repurchase authorization. Since our spin-off from IAC, we've allocated $2.7 billion towards the repurchase of our company's stock, returning approximately 36% of our share capital. And we've returned another 168 million to our shareholders through dividends since initiating that program a couple of years ago. We'll continue to look to add value for our shareholders through strong operational execution, as well as smart capital allocation.
In summary, I'm encouraged with our progress in brand Expedia and with the continuing results of our other brands. Our strategy is on track, and our efforts are beginning to show signs of payback. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to talk about the financials."
25915843,184400163,290736,"Expedia Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dara.

From a financial perspective, the first quarter came in better than we had expected, driven by underlying strength in our global hotel business. Of course, we did have some tailwinds this quarter with the favorable comps on airline ticket volumes and extra day from leap year and FX improving slightly since the last conference call. 
As Dara mentioned, room night growth was robust at 24%, 27% including the results from the AirAsia joint venture, and accelerated from Q4 growth rates across all major geographies. Of particular note, total room nights in the United States were up 18%, accelerating versus Q4, solid evidence of our ability to grow our domestic volumes and share.
Hotels.com, our largest hotel business as measured by room nights, led the charge with room night growth of 37% and sequential acceleration, again, across all major regions. Revenue per room night was down 6% on flat ADRs. The gap between the 2 metrics was driven by similar trends as last quarter. Also, keep in mind that growth in our APAC hotel business continues to outpace the other regions, and APAC represented a high teens percentage of global room nights in the first quarter. Since ADRs and revenue per room night are much lower in APAC, this will put downward pressure on per-room metrics for the foreseeable future. 
With that said, we believe APAC represents a great long-term growth opportunity for us, which we're targeting with our diversified set of key assets including eLong, the AirAsia-Expedia joint venture, Hotels.com, Egencia and our growing affiliate business. Revenue from our air business represented 11% of our total revenue for the quarter, and although we grew ticket volume 5%, revenue per ticket was down 20% due primarily to reduced ticket economics combined with lower volume-based incentives. We expect revenue per ticket to continue to be down year-over-year for the duration of 2012, with the impact easing as we move through the year. 
Other revenue grew 15% for the quarter on a combination of nice growth across car rental, ad and media, and corporate travel fees. Running through key expense categories, cost of revenue grew just a touch faster than revenue this quarter, as credit card fees grew along with the growth in our merchant gross bookings and as we added headcount to support our growth. This was partially offset by lower debit card fees and an increase in credit card rebates.
Selling and marketing grew at a rate quite a bit slower than revenue growth, driven by decreased online spending for our Expedia brand. We have been systematically pulling out inefficient spend at Expedia and have been generally less aggressive on the marketing front for that brand given where we are in the technology migration projects. Excluding the Expedia brand, selling and marketing grew more in line with revenue. For Expedia, Inc., we do not expect to see the type of leverage that we saw in Q1 as we move forward in 2012. And we are forecasting full year selling and marketing to go broadly in line with revenue.
Technology and content grew 26% for the quarter, and though a bit lighter than we had expected, we continue to see the year-on-year impact of the prior period build-up of headcount needed to complete our key technology projects. While we expect year-over-year growth of our cash spending on technology and content to decrease as we move through 2012, we expect that the recorded growth rate in future quarters will be broadly similar to what we saw in Q1 due to the relative levels of the capitalization of these costs and related depreciation. 
G&A grew 10% for the quarter, largely due to headcount costs to support the overall growth in the business. From a capital allocation perspective, as Dara mentioned, we've repurchased 8.8 million shares for $291 million so far this year, and the board has authorized an additional tranche of 20 million shares for repurchase. We also paid our $0.09 per share quarterly dividend. Lastly, we announced the VIA acquisition, which we expect to close imminently. And assuming it does, you'll see its impact on our Q2 cash flow statement.
In terms of our financial expectations for full year 2012, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-single-digit range. Remember that Q1 represents our lowest adjusted EBITDA quarter for the year. So while we're happy with the out-performance in the first quarter, it does not have a large impact on full year adjusted EBITDA. Consistent with prior practice, we are not giving guidance for Q2, but we do want to note that top line comps get tougher and at current rates, foreign currency translation, is a bigger headwind. 
While we're quite pleased with Q1 performance and are incrementally confident about our ability to deliver these full year results, note that the majority of our annual adjusted EBITDA growth is expected to build in the back half of the year. And as such, the real story of our full year results is very much yet to be told.
With that, let's turn to questions. Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question?"

So again, the trends that we saw and the delta between ADR and revenue per room night were similar to what we've seen on prior quarters. Those were the impact of our loyalty programs, primarily of the Expedia brand. This time last year, Expedia did not have a loyalty program; they do this year. And so there's really a tough comp there. In addition, the Hotels.com loyalty program expanded internationally during the last quarter. And so again, we've got a tough comp on that front. The second impact that we mentioned on the last call, which was also happening this quarter as well, is competitive pricing actions. Primarily that is Hotwire, where Hotwire is having some pretty nice success, pushing volumes through, taking lower margins essentially. The third item was the impact of foreign exchange. That, again, was a factor this quarter. And then we also continued to see just mix shift in our hotel business, the chains, and otherwise less margin-accretive products. So those were by and large the big delta drivers between ADR and revenue per room night. If you look across those 4 things, on the loyalty front, you will start to hit clean comps as we move throughout this year. I think the Expedia program was launched through the end of Q1 and through Q2. So Q3, that gets to be a clean comp. Hotels.com, it's probably not going to be until Q1 of 2013 until you clean that comp. On the Hotwire actions, they've been doing that for a number of quarters now. So I suspect Q2, Q3, you might get a clean comp on that. And then -- it's always hard to say with FX. And the mix shift issue on Hotel is just something that's really hard to predict. I think your second was in terms of ADRs in various regions. We continue to see decent strength in ADRs. I think if you look at how our hotel partners, the ones that have reported the trends that they're seeing, broadly, ours were consistent with what they've reported. There is some pockets of ADR weakness in Europe that we have seen, and the rest of the world is by and large looking fairly healthy."

The Expedia Hotel path is -- has been on the new technology platform for the past couple of quarters. And while we won't share specific metrics, our room night volume -- standalone room night volume on Expedia accelerated nicely in the first quarter over Q4 of last year, which was faster than Q3 of last year. So on a sequential basis, our standalone room night volume is improving. We think that we're just getting started here. And the key here is just translating the new platform into actually new product to consumers that converts better and then marketing more aggressively against that product. So we are, I would say, early in that program, but we're already starting to see benefits of that program, and we expect to see further benefits in the back half of the year. Again, similar to what we saw in Hotels.com, although Expedia is somewhat disadvantaged because of its multi-product nature. We are also right in the middle of rolling over from our old air platform to our new air platform, and are actively testing single tickets, different types of transactions on the new platform versus the old platform. And we're actively right -- we're in the middle of that testing. We expect to see good results from that testing. We will then start rolling over all of our air ticketing on a worldwide basis to the new platform, which will then enable us to start really testing out new feature functionality and, hopefully, driving conversions. So the platform upgrade is happening as planned, and then hopefully, the feature functionality will follow suit just as you've seen in Hotels.

The demand profile and the supply profile of the business are so global now that particular Olympics and a particular price isn't going to really move the needle too much. But the market management team is prepared, and we've got good inventory in London during those times. As far as our mobile strategy goes, it is  really moving along all fronts with Hotels.com really leading the charge there on the mobile side. One of the feature sets that we have are exclusive kind of same day-only-type booking functionality for Hotels.com on a worldwide basis. And then we're also tying in the WelcomeRewards loyalty program into our mobile products as well, which is a very popular program for Hotels.com on a worldwide basis. On Expedia, we have rolled out the Expedia Hotels App, which has been built by a combination of our teams and the Mobiata teams. And later in this year, we are going to launch an air product that we're very excited about. And then Hotwire, of course, we've relaunched on a mobile basis as well. So I think mobile right now is at the stage of kind of consistent execution across all of the brands. It is starting to become a channel that we're quite focused on, and it's clearly one of our fastest-growing channels. And we're very hopeful that the volumes are going to increase and the kind of volumes that we're seeing are incremental to our base business."

As far as hotel improvement, we are seeing continuing strong conversion on the hotel side. I think that we will see more, and we are -- when I talk about the acceleration of kind of the A/B testing that we're seeing in Expedia, has significantly accelerated in the first quarter versus where we were in the fourth quarter or third quarter last year. So while some of the improvement that we're seeing in the Expedia hotel volume is because of stronger conversion, along with better strength on the variable marketing side, I'm certainly expecting more. The more tests you do, usually, the more tests succeed, and then you pick the successful ones and you roll them out worldwide. And we're kind of right in the middle of that process. I know you can obviously see from the strength of the Hotels.com brand is that -- that's a -- that's kind of a flywheel that you can continue with for some period of time. So Hotels.com conversion, in particular, now that it's rolled over kind of the one year anniversary of the platform continues to get better as we roll out more and more products and as we optimize the sites better, get rid of bugs, et cetera. So we're hoping to see that conversion clock continue, and I think Expedia's early in the path, and the Hotels.com team and the EAN teams, et cetera, are kind of well down the path and I think are -- proven that, hopefully, this is something that we can keep going for some period, of time. As far as the chain negotiations go, we are seeing very healthy volumes with the chains. Our relationships continue to be quite good, and we have and will have some pretty significant negotiations coming up this year. We're confident that we'll continue to work with our major chain partners. But other than that, we're not going to get into the specific details of the relationships one way or the other."

And they also need to be able to balance those short-term bookings with the book of business, kind of a long-term book of business, which, for example, on the Expedia side, it's really the packages business that we offer to those hotels. So the more they can balance that short and long term, the better off they are. But they do have to, I would say, revenue manage more aggressively and also take advantage of different consumer channels kind of more appropriately. The parity pricing everywhere, I think is going to be tough to pull off when you've got mobile channels, you've got maybe Facebook channels, when you can market specifically to consumers, let's say, in Japan and Germany, differently from consumers in other countries. So I think that, that there is going to be a real change in how hoteliers and our partners revenue manage. And, hopefully, we will help them with a balanced book of business, leisure, corporate, package, standalone, desktop and mobile and also deliver to them lots of intelligence on where the demand is coming from or where the demand is weak on a relative basis. As far as the rental fleets go, the volumes that we saw in the first quarter were healthy, but pricing was somewhat less healthy. Pricing was a little weak. But we have seen the fleets get tighter, and we are expecting pricing to tighten up a bit, although I can't give you specifics on kind of the result in pricing. I think we'll see those results coming in Q2 more than we saw in Q1."

So I'll take -- actually take the second question first. I think if you look at our domestic room night growth this quarter at 18%, accelerated from prior quarters, I think, it's decent evidence of the fact that we can continue to grow even our domestic market. We are the largest in the U.S. We sell about 1 out of every 20 room nights that's sold on any channel in the U.S. And we're the biggest. So there's lots of headroom in the U.S. market. I think we've said it in the past, the -- that the global travel market is a very big opportunity. I think there's room for both ourselves and our competitor, our primary global competitor to grow on into the future before we really start bumping into each other. So with respect to the growth expectations for Expedia relative to what we've seen with Hotels.com, it's really hard to predict. I would just say that we were pleasantly surprised with what we saw with Hotels.com, and we are encouraged with what we've seen with Expedia. And I guess it is possible that we could see Expedia hit those growth rates. I do remind you, though, that Expedia is just a little bit more of a complicated business with it being multiproduct. And so there's a little bit more complexity to it. And it's a little bit larger in some markets like the U.S. But theoretically, if we get this right, again, it's a huge market with lots of opportunity, and there's lots of room for growth for Hotels.com and Expedia.

And when  -- then when you look at Expedia on an overall basis, that's a relative disadvantage versus Hotels.com. A fair amount of Expedia's hotel volume also comes from up-sells from the air path, et cetera. And again, with air being weaker than stronger this year, that's a bit of a headwind. Now when we move over fully to the new technology platform on air packages, et cetera, we hope to get those businesses growing again.

We are constantly looking at the balance between the bookings that we can deliver to a hotel and the number of hotels that we have. And you'll see us go in -- to some extent, sometimes fits and starts in terms of our property additions just depending on our -- the demand side of our business is doing, and whether we're feeling like we're particularly supply-constraint given the demand we've had. We did have a period over the course of the last few years where we've been pretty aggressive in building up our inventory position, helped in part by the agency product that we brought on with Venere. And so we've had some time to really have demand catch-up. And I think we'll see what happens throughout 2012, but our focus is going to be primarily on really sort of optimizing what we've got and adding tactically as opposed to a massive acquisition effort. Just with respect to the specific question you had on eLong, that was actually a reference to all of our Asia Pacific business, which includes the AirAsia joint venture, Hotels.com, our EAN private label business that powers J-Lon [ph], for example, which is the leading OTA in Japan. So it's not just eLong. And then you had another question with respect to ADRs and revenue margin trends. I would say that we have seen fairly consistent patterns, what we've seen in the last few quarters, we've seen some strength in the U.S. and some pockets of ADR weakness in parts of Europe, where they've had particular economic troubles. But no real sort of broader trends than I would -- that are worth commenting on."

It was very -- it was such a very difficult comp that accelerated over Q4 and Q3. Going into this quarter, I was a little nervous, and you put up a great number. And assuming a normal share shift, the number that Priceline and Expedia put up together will be another acceleration on an extremely difficult comp. So my question is, what do you think is behind that? Is this just Asia starting to matter in the numbers, or have we hit an inflection point? Have we got -- have we reached a steeper point on the S-curve where offline travel agents are really dying and people are really starting to embrace online travel booking?"

I say as far as Google and the EU, it's just impossible to speculate on what their behavior would be based on different circumstances.

And we've made that -- those concerns apparent to the EU to -- and it's something that we're working on actively. But it's very difficult to say how would Google behave one way or the other. The fact is, we've got a good working relationship with them on a day-to-day basis. We're very big clients of theirs, and we'll see how that relationship progresses on a go-forward basis. As far as Expedia and Priceline and the markets, listen, I go back to what Mark said before. This is -- travel is an enormous market. We are the biggest online player in the U.S., and we're only 5% of the room night share. I think that Priceline has been executing for many, many years, and they've been executing quite effectively. And we are starting to execute more effectively as a team and across our brands and across our geographies. I really can't make a statement as to whether this is  a -- signifies a change in the industry one way or the other, or offline to online share, I will say though that the increasing share of Asia Pacific as a percentage of our overall volumes is something that we're quite excited about. And hopefully, something that we can build going forward."

Expedia is off to a solid start this year, with $102 million of adjusted EBITDA generated in the first quarter, exceeding our own expectations.

Expedia is off to a solid start this year, with $102 million of adjusted EBITDA generated in the first quarter, exceeding our own expectations. On the top line, gross bookings and revenue growth were again driven by strength in our hotel business, with global room nights growing 24%, a nice acceleration from the 19% we saw for Q4. Including the room nights from Expedia's joint venture with AirAsia, room nights would have grown by 27%. 
As we mentioned last quarter, all of our major brands other than Expedia, continues to perform well, with combined revenue growth of 27%. Results for the Expedia brand are still not where we want them to be, but they did show improvement. Standalone room night growth has improved over the last few quarters from a slight decline year-over-year in the third quarter last year prior to the launch of the new platform, to mid-single-digit growth in the first quarter. 
While it's clearly too soon to declare any type of victory, the Expedia brand team is starting to execute effectively, and we're beginning to see tangible evidence that our focused product-led game plan is working. It's also important to note that the technology projects on the Expedia brand remain on track. We're pushing a significant percentage of U.S. traffic through the new air platform and testing its performance. Optimizations are being implemented, and we'll continue the rollout of the new platform in the second quarter. 
The work on packages is ongoing, and we expect it to be substantially complete by year end. We continue to innovate on the new hotel platform, and those of you that visit the site regularly can undoubtedly see some of these improvements. Having the capability to test quickly and broadly deploy new features are keys to success, and we've already run more tests on our new platform so far in 2012 than we did all of last year.  We expect the most pronounced overall benefits come when consumers can enjoy the best shopping experience in online travel seamlessly across all of our product lines. 
International revenue growth accelerated in the quarter versus the prior quarter, and we continue to aggressively scale our international businesses, most notably with our recent acquisition or recent announcement that we intend to acquire VIA Travel, a leading corporate travel company in the Nordic region of Europe. As of today, the deal hasn't closed, so our comments will be limited. But suffice it to say that this transaction is almost entirely complementary to our existing corporate travel business and gives us a strong position in that region. We're committed to driving scale for Egencia, and are pleased to be able to use our international cash for this purpose.
Also in regard to international travel, we've recently partnered with Brand USA, promoting travel to America by matching advertising dollars for any travel brands that promote their destination or products to an international audience. We're also featuring participating brand partners on the Discover America landing page. Brand USA is a terrific public-private marketing organization that works with the travel industry to promote travel to the U.S., creating jobs in our domestic travel sector.
Lastly, in terms of capital allocation, we've repurchased 8.8 million shares so far in 2012 for $291 million, exhausting our previous share repurchase authorization. Since our spin-off from IAC, we've allocated $2.7 billion towards the repurchase of our company's stock, returning approximately 36% of our share capital. And we've returned another 168 million to our shareholders through dividends since initiating that program a couple of years ago. We'll continue to look to add value for our shareholders through strong operational execution, as well as smart capital allocation.
In summary, I'm encouraged with our progress in brand Expedia and with the continuing results of our other brands. Our strategy is on track, and our efforts are beginning to show signs of payback. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to talk about the financials."
25915843,184400163,290820,"Expedia Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dara.

From a financial perspective, the first quarter came in better than we had expected, driven by underlying strength in our global hotel business. Of course, we did have some tailwinds this quarter with the favorable comps on airline ticket volumes and extra day from leap year and FX improving slightly since the last conference call. 
As Dara mentioned, room night growth was robust at 24%, 27% including the results from the AirAsia joint venture, and accelerated from Q4 growth rates across all major geographies. Of particular note, total room nights in the United States were up 18%, accelerating versus Q4, solid evidence of our ability to grow our domestic volumes and share.
Hotels.com, our largest hotel business as measured by room nights, led the charge with room night growth of 37% and sequential acceleration, again, across all major regions. Revenue per room night was down 6% on flat ADRs. The gap between the 2 metrics was driven by similar trends as last quarter. Also, keep in mind that growth in our APAC hotel business continues to outpace the other regions, and APAC represented a high teens percentage of global room nights in the first quarter. Since ADRs and revenue per room night are much lower in APAC, this will put downward pressure on per-room metrics for the foreseeable future. 
With that said, we believe APAC represents a great long-term growth opportunity for us, which we're targeting with our diversified set of key assets including eLong, the AirAsia-Expedia joint venture, Hotels.com, Egencia and our growing affiliate business. Revenue from our air business represented 11% of our total revenue for the quarter, and although we grew ticket volume 5%, revenue per ticket was down 20% due primarily to reduced ticket economics combined with lower volume-based incentives. We expect revenue per ticket to continue to be down year-over-year for the duration of 2012, with the impact easing as we move through the year. 
Other revenue grew 15% for the quarter on a combination of nice growth across car rental, ad and media, and corporate travel fees. Running through key expense categories, cost of revenue grew just a touch faster than revenue this quarter, as credit card fees grew along with the growth in our merchant gross bookings and as we added headcount to support our growth. This was partially offset by lower debit card fees and an increase in credit card rebates.
Selling and marketing grew at a rate quite a bit slower than revenue growth, driven by decreased online spending for our Expedia brand. We have been systematically pulling out inefficient spend at Expedia and have been generally less aggressive on the marketing front for that brand given where we are in the technology migration projects. Excluding the Expedia brand, selling and marketing grew more in line with revenue. For Expedia, Inc., we do not expect to see the type of leverage that we saw in Q1 as we move forward in 2012. And we are forecasting full year selling and marketing to go broadly in line with revenue.
Technology and content grew 26% for the quarter, and though a bit lighter than we had expected, we continue to see the year-on-year impact of the prior period build-up of headcount needed to complete our key technology projects. While we expect year-over-year growth of our cash spending on technology and content to decrease as we move through 2012, we expect that the recorded growth rate in future quarters will be broadly similar to what we saw in Q1 due to the relative levels of the capitalization of these costs and related depreciation. 
G&A grew 10% for the quarter, largely due to headcount costs to support the overall growth in the business. From a capital allocation perspective, as Dara mentioned, we've repurchased 8.8 million shares for $291 million so far this year, and the board has authorized an additional tranche of 20 million shares for repurchase. We also paid our $0.09 per share quarterly dividend. Lastly, we announced the VIA acquisition, which we expect to close imminently. And assuming it does, you'll see its impact on our Q2 cash flow statement.
In terms of our financial expectations for full year 2012, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-single-digit range. Remember that Q1 represents our lowest adjusted EBITDA quarter for the year. So while we're happy with the out-performance in the first quarter, it does not have a large impact on full year adjusted EBITDA. Consistent with prior practice, we are not giving guidance for Q2, but we do want to note that top line comps get tougher and at current rates, foreign currency translation, is a bigger headwind. 
While we're quite pleased with Q1 performance and are incrementally confident about our ability to deliver these full year results, note that the majority of our annual adjusted EBITDA growth is expected to build in the back half of the year. And as such, the real story of our full year results is very much yet to be told.
With that, let's turn to questions. Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question?"

Those were the impact of our loyalty programs, primarily of the Expedia brand. This time last year, Expedia did not have a loyalty program; they do this year. And so there's really a tough comp there. In addition, the Hotels.com loyalty program expanded internationally during the last quarter. And so again, we've got a tough comp on that front. The second impact that we mentioned on the last call, which was also happening this quarter as well, is competitive pricing actions. Primarily that is Hotwire, where Hotwire is having some pretty nice success, pushing volumes through, taking lower margins essentially. The third item was the impact of foreign exchange. That, again, was a factor this quarter. And then we also continued to see just mix shift in our hotel business, the chains, and otherwise less margin-accretive products. So those were by and large the big delta drivers between ADR and revenue per room night. If you look across those 4 things, on the loyalty front, you will start to hit clean comps as we move throughout this year. I think the Expedia program was launched through the end of Q1 and through Q2. So Q3, that gets to be a clean comp. Hotels.com, it's probably not going to be until Q1 of 2013 until you clean that comp. On the Hotwire actions, they've been doing that for a number of quarters now. So I suspect Q2, Q3, you might get a clean comp on that. And then -- it's always hard to say with FX. And the mix shift issue on Hotel is just something that's really hard to predict. I think your second was in terms of ADRs in various regions. We continue to see decent strength in ADRs. I think if you look at how our hotel partners, the ones that have reported the trends that they're seeing, broadly, ours were consistent with what they've reported. There is some pockets of ADR weakness in Europe that we have seen, and the rest of the world is by and large looking fairly healthy."

The Expedia Hotel path is -- has been on the new technology platform for the past couple of quarters. And while we won't share specific metrics, our room night volume -- standalone room night volume on Expedia accelerated nicely in the first quarter over Q4 of last year, which was faster than Q3 of last year. So on a sequential basis, our standalone room night volume is improving. We think that we're just getting started here. And the key here is just translating the new platform into actually new product to consumers that converts better and then marketing more aggressively against that product. So we are, I would say, early in that program, but we're already starting to see benefits of that program, and we expect to see further benefits in the back half of the year. Again, similar to what we saw in Hotels.com, although Expedia is somewhat disadvantaged because of its multi-product nature. We are also right in the middle of rolling over from our old air platform to our new air platform, and are actively testing single tickets, different types of transactions on the new platform versus the old platform. And we're actively right -- we're in the middle of that testing. We expect to see good results from that testing. We will then start rolling over all of our air ticketing on a worldwide basis to the new platform, which will then enable us to start really testing out new feature functionality and, hopefully, driving conversions. So the platform upgrade is happening as planned, and then hopefully, the feature functionality will follow suit just as you've seen in Hotels. And on package, that's going to happen really in the back half of the year. It's going to happen sometime in the fourth quarter. All of the work being done is on schedule, and you will see benefits of that, hopefully, next year."

The demand profile and the supply profile of the business are so global now that particular Olympics and a particular price isn't going to really move the needle too much. But the market management team is prepared, and we've got good inventory in London during those times. As far as our mobile strategy goes, it is  really moving along all fronts with Hotels.com really leading the charge there on the mobile side. One of the feature sets that we have are exclusive kind of same day-only-type booking functionality for Hotels.com on a worldwide basis. And then we're also tying in the WelcomeRewards loyalty program into our mobile products as well, which is a very popular program for Hotels.com on a worldwide basis. On Expedia, we have rolled out the Expedia Hotels App, which has been built by a combination of our teams and the Mobiata teams. And later in this year, we are going to launch an air product that we're very excited about. And then Hotwire, of course, we've relaunched on a mobile basis as well. So I think mobile right now is at the stage of kind of consistent execution across all of the brands. It is starting to become a channel that we're quite focused on, and it's clearly one of our fastest-growing channels. And we're very hopeful that the volumes are going to increase and the kind of volumes that we're seeing are incremental to our base business."

As far as hotel improvement, we are seeing continuing strong conversion on the hotel side. I think that we will see more, and we are -- when I talk about the acceleration of kind of the A/B testing that we're seeing in Expedia, has significantly accelerated in the first quarter versus where we were in the fourth quarter or third quarter last year. So while some of the improvement that we're seeing in the Expedia hotel volume is because of stronger conversion, along with better strength on the variable marketing side, I'm certainly expecting more. The more tests you do, usually, the more tests succeed, and then you pick the successful ones and you roll them out worldwide. And we're kind of right in the middle of that process. I know you can obviously see from the strength of the Hotels.com brand is that -- that's a -- that's kind of a flywheel that you can continue with for some period of time. So Hotels.com conversion, in particular, now that it's rolled over kind of the one year anniversary of the platform continues to get better as we roll out more and more products and as we optimize the sites better, get rid of bugs, et cetera. So we're hoping to see that conversion clock continue, and I think Expedia's early in the path, and the Hotels.com team and the EAN teams, et cetera, are kind of well down the path and I think are -- proven that, hopefully, this is something that we can keep going for some period, of time. As far as the chain negotiations go, we are seeing very healthy volumes with the chains. Our relationships continue to be quite good, and we have and will have some pretty significant negotiations coming up this year. We're confident that we'll continue to work with our major chain partners. But other than that, we're not going to get into the specific details of the relationships one way or the other."

And they also need to be able to balance those short-term bookings with the book of business, kind of a long-term book of business, which, for example, on the Expedia side, it's really the packages business that we offer to those hotels. So the more they can balance that short and long term, the better off they are. But they do have to, I would say, revenue manage more aggressively and also take advantage of different consumer channels kind of more appropriately. The parity pricing everywhere, I think is going to be tough to pull off when you've got mobile channels, you've got maybe Facebook channels, when you can market specifically to consumers, let's say, in Japan and Germany, differently from consumers in other countries. So I think that, that there is going to be a real change in how hoteliers and our partners revenue manage. And, hopefully, we will help them with a balanced book of business, leisure, corporate, package, standalone, desktop and mobile and also deliver to them lots of intelligence on where the demand is coming from or where the demand is weak on a relative basis. As far as the rental fleets go, the volumes that we saw in the first quarter were healthy, but pricing was somewhat less healthy. Pricing was a little weak. But we have seen the fleets get tighter, and we are expecting pricing to tighten up a bit, although I can't give you specifics on kind of the result in pricing. I think we'll see those results coming in Q2 more than we saw in Q1."

I think if you look at our domestic room night growth this quarter at 18%, accelerated from prior quarters, I think, it's decent evidence of the fact that we can continue to grow even our domestic market.

I think there's room for both ourselves and our competitor, our primary global competitor to grow on into the future before we really start bumping into each other. So with respect to the growth expectations for Expedia relative to what we've seen with Hotels.com, it's really hard to predict. I would just say that we were pleasantly surprised with what we saw with Hotels.com, and we are encouraged with what we've seen with Expedia. And I guess it is possible that we could see Expedia hit those growth rates. I do remind you, though, that Expedia is just a little bit more of a complicated business with it being multiproduct. And so there's a little bit more complexity to it. And it's a little bit larger in some markets like the U.S. But theoretically, if we get this right, again, it's a huge market with lots of opportunity, and there's lots of room for growth for Hotels.com and Expedia.

And when  -- then when you look at Expedia on an overall basis, that's a relative disadvantage versus Hotels.com. A fair amount of Expedia's hotel volume also comes from up-sells from the air path, et cetera. And again, with air being weaker than stronger this year, that's a bit of a headwind. Now when we move over fully to the new technology platform on air packages, et cetera, we hope to get those businesses growing again.

We did add some properties in the quarter -- over the course of the quarter. And what I'd say on that is, this is a game of balancing supply and demand.

And you'll see us go in -- to some extent, sometimes fits and starts in terms of our property additions just depending on our -- the demand side of our business is doing, and whether we're feeling like we're particularly supply-constraint given the demand we've had. We did have a period over the course of the last few years where we've been pretty aggressive in building up our inventory position, helped in part by the agency product that we brought on with Venere. And so we've had some time to really have demand catch-up. And I think we'll see what happens throughout 2012, but our focus is going to be primarily on really sort of optimizing what we've got and adding tactically as opposed to a massive acquisition effort. Just with respect to the specific question you had on eLong, that was actually a reference to all of our Asia Pacific business, which includes the AirAsia joint venture, Hotels.com, our EAN private label business that powers J-Lon [ph], for example, which is the leading OTA in Japan. So it's not just eLong. And then you had another question with respect to ADRs and revenue margin trends. I would say that we have seen fairly consistent patterns, what we've seen in the last few quarters, we've seen some strength in the U.S. and some pockets of ADR weakness in parts of Europe, where they've had particular economic troubles.

If you look at -- if you add those 2 together, the hotel room nights you've sold, Q1 last year was an outstanding quarter. It was very -- it was such a very difficult comp that accelerated over Q4 and Q3. Going into this quarter, I was a little nervous, and you put up a great number. And assuming a normal share shift, the number that Priceline and Expedia put up together will be another acceleration on an extremely difficult comp. So my question is, what do you think is behind that? Is this just Asia starting to matter in the numbers, or have we hit an inflection point? Have we got -- have we reached a steeper point on the S-curve where offline travel agents are really dying and people are really starting to embrace online travel booking?"

I say as far as Google and the EU, it's just impossible to speculate on what their behavior would be based on different circumstances. Obviously, we are worried about Google's power, which we consider monopolistic and which we think potentially could result in difficult circumstances for businesses working with Google as well as consumers. And we've made that -- those concerns apparent to the EU to -- and it's something that we're working on actively. But it's very difficult to say how would Google behave one way or the other. The fact is, we've got a good working relationship with them on a day-to-day basis. We're very big clients of theirs, and we'll see how that relationship progresses on a go-forward basis. As far as Expedia and Priceline and the markets, listen, I go back to what Mark said before. This is -- travel is an enormous market. We are the biggest online player in the U.S., and we're only 5% of the room night share. I think that Priceline has been executing for many, many years, and they've been executing quite effectively. And we are starting to execute more effectively as a team and across our brands and across our geographies. I really can't make a statement as to whether this is  a -- signifies a change in the industry one way or the other, or offline to online share, I will say though that the increasing share of Asia Pacific as a percentage of our overall volumes is something that we're quite excited about. And hopefully, something that we can build going forward."

Expedia's second quarter continues to be another good one, common unit of our expectations. Well the top line gross bookings grew 9% and revenue growth of 14% were driven primarily by strength in our hotel business with global room nights growing in robust 22%, 24% including the AirAsia-Expedia joint venture. Adjusted EBITDA grew 18% to $223 million, aided by better-than-expected top line and lower-than-expected expenses. It's worth noting that second quarter results were helped by the acquisition of VIA Travel, which we completed in late April and contributed roughly 2 percentage points of growth in gross bookings and revenue, and 3 points of adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter. VIA Travel is the leading travel management company in the Nordics, and we're happy to have them as part of the Egencia team. In addition, we had another period adjustment of $8 million to help both revenue and adjusted EBITDA that Mark will describe in his remarks.
We continue to be healthy results across virtually all of our brands, with brand Expedia also improving sequentially but still down year-on-year. Our technology migration remains on track and stand-alone hotel room nights for brand Expedia accelerated again and were faster than 10% on a book basis for Q2 compared to mid-single-digit growth in Q1. The air product has been moved to the new platform as planned and we're continuous on the back to its path, which should be substantially complete by year-end. You'll see more product innovation from us in the hotel and aircraft in the second half of the year, and we'll be ready to rollout packages as we move into 2013. As previously indicated, we plan to increase selling and marketing for Brand Expedia as we move further along the technology migration, and just recently launched a brand marketing campaign in the U.S. called Find Yours, featuring 100% user generated content from consumers, explaining how travel has transformed them. It's very early for the campaign but initial responses has been quite good. But to be clear, Brand Expedia continues to face certain environmental challenges outside of our control. Airline factors, and air ticket prices continue to grow year-over-year which is not good for the leisure travel. Hotel continues to report tighter occupancies and higher rates, which make it more difficult for us to grow our Package business. These factors are likely to remain as headwinds for air and package products for the foreseeable future.
Over the past few years, we've talked about our key brand replatforming efforts. In addition to these efforts, we're also actively improving our entire technology stack from front end, to middleware to supply services, to customer service as well as our financial systems. Part of these efforts will allow us to introduce new technology to our hotel supply partners, which will enable much closer integration with the agency hotel product with our core merchant offering. Specifically, for participating hotels, we'll be able to offer customers the choice of whether to pay Expedia in advance or pay at the hotel at the time of the stay. So far the reaction from our suppliers has been positive, and our initial testing indicate that customers really like this flexibility. We believe that these innovation if and when rolled out on a broad basis would be likely to jump back the growth within our agency hotel business, which could result in our blended hotel margins as well as our merchant hotel flow trending down over time. With that said, we remind you that in general, our suppliers pay us based on the considerable scale and breadth of our distribution platform and not based on a specific model under which we do business. As we introduce further innovation into the global hotel business, you would expect the current pipeline between agency model and the merchant model to blur over time. Before handing it over to Mark, a bit about what we're seeing in Europe. We can see incremental weakness in southern Europe relative to what we saw last quarter. But it, we see Europeans traveling to the U.S. less and traveling to European destinations more. We see some evidence of shortening length of stay and in some markets, shorter booking window. All of which could be attributed to market conditions. We'll keep a close eye on these trends, but for now, our growth rate in Europe is still healthy and we can continue to grow in this economic environment. Mark?"

In total, we estimate that foreign currency cost to us 300 to 400 basis points of growth in gross bookings, revenue and adjusted EBITDA. This was 100 to 200 basis points worse than we expected when we talked to you last quarter.
Hotel revenue represented 74% of total revenue for the quarter and grew 16%. Room night growth continued to be healthy at 22% for the quarter, 24% including the results from the AirAsia-Expedia joint venture. Domestic room night growth remained strong at 16%, while international room nights grew 29% or 35% including the AirAsia-Expedia joint venture. ADRs were down 1% for the quarter while revenue per room night was down 5%. The decrease in revenue per room night was again driven by hotel product mix, the impact from foreign currency, discounting at Hotwire, and the loyalty program accrual comparables. As we noted last quarter, we have a very fast-growing hotel business in the Asia Pacific region, where ADRs and revenue per room night are much slower than in other geographies, of course, we're happy to take the lower per unit economics in APAC given the share volume growth prospects for that region. Consistent with Q1, Asia Pacific represented a high teens percentage share of the global room night mix in the second quarter.
Revenue from our air business represented 9% of our total revenue for the quarter and was down 8% year-over-year. Ticket volume grew 3% for the quarter, helped by the VIA Travel acquisition. Revenue per ticket was down 11% due primarily to lower net supplier economics. We continue to expect revenue per ticket to be down year-over-year for the duration of 2012, with the impact easing as we move through the year. Other revenue grew 17% for the quarter on growth and corporate travel fees and advertising revenue.
Running through key expense categories cost of revenue grew faster than revenue in the quarter due almost entirely to the addition of VIA Travel. Excluding that business, cost of revenue grew largely in line with revenue on higher credit card costs associated with the growth of our merchant hotel business, and additional headcount to support our global customer operations. These were partially offset by lower debit card fees and higher credit card rebates. Leverage in selling and marketing expense was driven by a combination of factors, including the addition of VIA Travel as they have very low selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue, as well as some deferred spend for both brand Expedia and Hotels.com.
Looking forward, we expect selling and marketing to grow quite a bit faster and deleverage significantly in Q3 and to a slightly lesser extent in Q4, as Expedia and Hotels.com increase their spending and as we invest more in Asia Pacific and emerging markets. Technology and content grew 24%, which was a bit lighter than our expectations. Looking forward, including the addition of VIA Travel, we now expect Q3 and Q4 growth rates to accelerate compared to the first half of the year.
General and administrative expenses grew 13%. As we have said in the past, will continue to look for leverage in G&A over the long term. Lastly, in terms of capital allocation, on a year-to-date basis, we have deployed over $520 million against the combination of share repurchases, M&A and our dividend. I'm pleased to say that we've decided to increase our dividend to $0.13 per share for the next quarterly payout as a sign of our continued confidence in the long-term prospects for our business.
In terms of our financial expectations for the full year 2012, we are now expecting adjusted EBITDA growth in the high-single-digits with the possibility of low double-digit growth. Key changes since last quarter include the addition of VIA Travel and the second quarter outperformance, partially offset by a much larger headwind from foreign currency, from additional marketing spend we have decided to deploy in Asia Pacific and some slowdown in certain European markets just to the global environment. With that, let's turn to questions. Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question."

First, on the merchant, what we're doing is responding to the marketplace and responding to consumer behavior. Obviously, the European markets are very important to us. They are quite fragmented, the European travel markets are actually larger than that of the U.S. and we have seen that in Europe, the agency model is quite popular, which is what led us to the acquisition of venerated a few years ago. And we have been working in and integrating agency inventory, along with our merchant inventory, but what we really wanted to come up with is a product that was better. There are certain consumers who like to buy merchant, they want to pay upfront, they want to pay in their local currency, they don't want to leave their credit card with a small hotel et cetera, of the front desk, and there are some consumers who do like to pay at the hotel. And we are just simply following that consumer behavior. We think that giving consumers the flexibility to choose is a good thing. We've tested it, and the consumers seems to like it. And what we'll do is carefully rollout this program on a worldwide basis. And this is a rollout that we can measure, and we will -- our intention is to roll it out pretty quickly but we can pull back on the rollout et cetera, based on the results that we see.

It is -- it's much more of a traditional corporate travel business than certainly Egencia is. And traditional corporate travel businesses generally charge higher fees to consumers and take more phone calls off-line and certainly, Egencia does. So that resulted in essentially a different P&L structure from that which you see at Egencia, which is higher growth. Egencia is doing the corporate travel. What the Expedia business took the leisure traveler -- travel back in the late 90s, as they are higher growth business, higher spend on technology but a much lower cost business from the perspective of the clients and that they don't have to pay fees and are able to transact online. So over time, I would expect that, that combined business and the Egencia business as we build it to continue to scale and to continue to drive meaningful growth to our business. But the P&L will start to emerge to be a combination of essentially those 2 P&Ls."

Q3 should be largely a clean comp on the Hotwire piece so that impact should lessen. And then we will also start in Q3 to comp over the Expedia loyalty launch.

In terms of fleet, et cetera, we are seeing the car rental companies compressing their fleets this summer. Fleet sizes are tight. But we're not seeing retail pricing increase quite as much as we expected. So that's good for the leisure customer. But in general, availability is a bit lower than what we wanted to be. And when the fleet inventories gets high, the percentage of transaction that we processed through opaque tends to be lower, and our retail partner of the business tends to grow faster.

The numbers have been quite healthy and they -- the occupancy rates are starting to hit peak season, kind of the 70% range, which is pretty high from a historical standpoint. And listen, I think our model is modeled that performs quite well and up-and-down markets. We tend to be a little bit countercyclical but the market in a kind of a poor economy, poor market, we tend to gain share pretty quickly. We get hit by an ADR weakness. And in up markets, we tend to get the benefit of ADRs and some of the suppliers who can fill up the rooms directly kind of do so more aggressively. As far as where the market is and where we think it can go forward, we do think that supply generally does seem to be tightening up. And at this point, we're not kind of -- we're not feeling like we're getting a ceiling one way or the other. Within our inventory quality in the U.S. is really good. The deals that we have signed with our strategic partners provide very strong inventory for us, and we think as well so lost inventories out there, we've been able to sell it, and we've got products that can sell of inventory in very long lead times might packages. And then we've got products that can tell inventory at short lead times such as the opaque model with Hotwire and also the mode mobile channel as well. So we're pretty comfortable with our product, and we think some of the technology investments that we made are going to give us returns above market, which is certainly what we're look going forward and hopefully we can keep showing those result returns going forward.

Expedia's second quarter proves to be another good one, coming in ahead of our expectations. On the top line, gross bookings grew up to 13% and revenue growth up 14% were driven primarily by strength in our hotel business with global room nights growing a robust 22%, 24% including the AirAsia-Expedia joint venture. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 18% to $223 million, aided by a better-than-expected top line and lower-than-expected expenses. It's worth noting that second quarter results were helped by that acquisition of VIA Travel, which we completed in late April and contributed roughly 2 percentage points of growth in gross bookings and revenue, and 3 points of adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter. VIA Travel is the leading travel management company in the Nordics, and we're happy to have them as part of the Egencia team. In addition, we had an out-of-period adjustment of $8 million to help both revenue and adjusted EBITDA that Mark will explain in his remarks.
We continue to see healthy results across virtually all of our brands, with brand Expedia also improving sequentially, but still down year-on-year. Our technology migration remains on track and stand-alone hotel room nights for brand Expedia accelerated again and grew faster than 10% on a book basis for Q2, compared to mid-single-digit growth in Q1. The air product has been moved to the new platform as planned and work continues on the packages' path, which should be substantially complete by year-end. 
You'll see more product innovation from us in the hotel and aircraft in the second half of the year, and we'll be ready to rollout packages as we move into 2013. As previously indicated, we plan to increase selling and marketing for brand Expedia as we move further along the technology migration, and just recently launched a brand marketing campaign in the U.S. called Find Yours, featuring 100% user-generated content from consumers explaining how travel has transformed them. Though very early for the campaign but initial responses has been quite good. But to be clear, brand Expedia continues to face certain environmental challenges outside of our control. Airline load factors and air ticket prices continue to grow year-over-year which is not good for the leisure traveler. Hotels continue to report tighter occupancies and higher rates, which make it more difficult for us to grow our package business. These factors are likely to remain as headwinds for air and package products for the foreseeable future.
Over the past few years, we've talked about our key brand re-platforming efforts. In addition to these efforts, we're also actively improving our entire technology stack from front-end, to middle works to supply services, to customer service, as well as our financial systems. Part of these efforts will allow us to introduce new technology to our hotel supply partners, which will enable much closer integration of the agency hotel product with our core merchant offering. 
Specifically, for participating hotels, we'll be able to offer customers the choice of whether to pay Expedia in advance or pay at the hotel at the time of the stay. So far the reaction from our suppliers has been positive, and our initial testing indicate that customers really like this flexibility. We believe that these innovations, if and when rolled out on a broad basis, would be likely to drive back the growth in our agency hotel business, which could result in a blended hotel margin as well as our merchant hotel flow trending down over time. 
With that said, we remind you that, in general, our suppliers pay us based on the considerable scale and breadth of our distribution platform and not based on a specific model under which we do business. As we introduce further innovation into the global hotel business, you would expect the current bright line between agency model and the merchant model to blur over time. 
Before handing it over to Mark, a bit about what we're seeing in Europe. We can see incremental weakness in southern Europe relative to what we saw last quarter. For all [indiscernible], we see Europeans traveling to the U.S. less and traveling to European destinations more. We see some evidence of shortening length of stay and, in some markets, shorter booking windows. All of which could be attributed to market conditions. We'll keep a close eye on these trends, but for now, our growth rate in Europe is still healthy and we believe we can continue to grow in this economic environment. Mark?"

From a financial perspective, the second quarter came in better than we expected, and was driven by the underlying strength in our global hotel business. As Dara mentioned, we're helped by the addition of VIA Travel, as well as an $8 million out-of-period hotel revenue adjustment that we made in the quarter related to the reversal of an over-accrual for certain local taxes. Excluding the VIA acquisition and this adjustment, adjusted EBITDA grew 11% for the quarter. 
As expected, foreign exchange was a headwind this quarter and hit us harder than anticipated, given the strength of the dollar relative to the euro. In total, we estimate that foreign currency costs to us 300 to 400 basis points of growth in gross bookings, revenue and adjusted EBITDA. This was 100 to 200 basis points worse than we expected when we talked to you last quarter.
Hotel revenue represented 74% of total revenue for the quarter and grew 16%. Room night growth continued to be healthy at 22% for the quarter, 24% including the results from the AirAsia-Expedia joint venture. Domestic room night growth remained strong at 16%, while international room nights grew 29%, or 35% including the AirAsia-Expedia joint venture. ADRs were down 1% for the quarter while revenue per room night was down 5%. The decrease in revenue per room night was again driven by hotel product mix, the impact from foreign currency, discounting at Hotwire, and the loyalty program accrual comparables. As we noted last quarter, we have a very fast-growing hotel business in the Asia Pacific region, where ADRs and revenue per room night are much lower than in other geographies. Of course, we're happy to take the lower per unit economics in APAC given the sheer volume growth prospects for that region.  Consistent with Q1, Asia Pacific represented a high teens percentage share of the global room night mix in the second quarter.
Revenue from our air business represented 9% of our total revenue for the quarter and was down 8% year-over-year. Ticket volume grew 3% for the quarter, helped by the VIA Travel acquisition. Revenue per ticket was down 11% due primarily to lower net supplier economics. We continue to expect revenue per ticket to be down year-over-year for the duration of 2012, with the impact easing as we move through the year. Other revenue grew 17% for the quarter on growth and corporate travel fees and advertising revenue.
Running through key expense categories, cost of revenue grew faster than revenue in the quarter due almost entirely to the addition of VIA Travel. Excluding that business, cost of revenue grew largely in line with revenue on higher credit card costs associated with the growth of our merchant hotel business and additional headcount to support our global customer operations. These were partially offset by lower debit card fees and higher credit card rebates. 
Leverage in selling and marketing expense was driven by a combination of factors, including the addition of VIA Travel, as they have very low selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue, as well as some deferred spend for both brand Expedia and Hotels.com.
Looking forward, we expect selling and marketing to grow quite a bit faster and deleverage significantly in Q3 and, to a slightly lesser extent, in Q4, as Expedia and Hotels.com increase their spending and as we invest more in Asia Pacific and emerging markets. 
Technology and content grew 24%, which was a bit lighter than our expectations. Looking forward, including the addition of VIA Travel, we now expect Q3 and Q4 growth rates to accelerate compared to the first half of the year.
General and administrative expenses grew 13%. As we have said in the past, will continue to look for leverage in G&A over the long term. 
Lastly, in terms of capital allocation, on a year-to-date basis, we have deployed over $520 million against the combination of share repurchases, M&A and our dividend. I'm pleased to say that we've decided to increase our dividend to $0.13 per share for the next quarterly payout as a sign of our continued confidence in the long-term prospects for our business.
In terms of our financial expectations for the full year 2012, we are now expecting adjusted EBITDA growth in the high-single digits with the possibility of low double-digit growth. Key changes since last quarter include the addition of VIA Travel and the second quarter outperformance, partially offset by a much larger headwind from foreign currency, from additional marketing spend we have decided to deploy in Asia Pacific and some slowdown in certain European markets, due to the tenuous global economic environment. With that, let's turn to questions. Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question."

On the first, on agency and merchant, what we're doing is responding to the marketplace and responding to consumer behavior. Obviously, the European markets are very important to us. They are quite fragmented, the European travel markets are actually larger than that of the U.S. and we have seen that, in Europe, the agency model's is quite popular, which is what led us to the acquisition of Venere a few years ago. And we have been working in and integrating agency inventory along with our merchant inventory, but what we really wanted to come up with is a product that was better. There are certain consumers who like to buy merchant, they like pay upfront, they want to pay in their local currency, they don't want to leave their credit card with a small hotel et cetera, at the front desk, and there are some consumers who do like to pay at the hotel. And we are just simply following that consumer behavior. We think that giving consumers the flexibility to choose is a good thing. We've tested it, and consumers seem to like it. And what we'll do is carefully rollout this program on a worldwide basis. And this is a rollout that we can measure, and we will -- our intention is to roll it out pretty quickly but we can pull back on the rollout et cetera, based on the results that we see.

It is -- it's much more of a traditional corporate travel business, than certainly Egencia is. And traditional corporate travel businesses generally charge higher fees to consumers and take more phone calls off-line than certainly Egencia does. So that results in essentially a different P&L structure from that which you see at Egencia, which is higher growth. Egencia is doing the corporate travel, what? The Expedia business took the leisure traveler -- travel back in the late 90s, as they are a higher growth business, higher spend on technology but a much lower cost business from the perspective of the clients and that they don't have to pay fees and they  able to transact online. So over time, I would expect that, that combined business and the Egencia business, as we build it, to continue to scale and to continue to drive meaningful growth to our business. But the P&L will start to merge to be a combination of essentially those 2 P&Ls."

Broadly consistent with what you'd see in the larger domestic market. With respect to the delta between ADRs and revenue per room night, we did see a little bit of moderating this quarter. As I said last quarter, we are -- we did start to comp over the competitive pricing actions or discounting, that Hotwire was doing. So that's what you're starting to see in those numbers. Q3 should be largely a clean comp on the Hotwire piece so that impact should lessen. And then we will also start in Q3 to comp over the Expedia Loyalty launch. And there is a little bit of help from that this quarter but not much. You'll see that a bit more so in Q3.

Tablet is starting to become a big player in mobile transactions and in traffic as well. So the traffic is broadening a bit. The handset business tends to be short-window, 70 or so percent of the transactions are within a day. The tablet transactions look more like desktop behavior, they're not necessarily short-window. And as far as marketing goes, we are still at the point where we're trying to establish and install base for mobile and, typically, when we market for an app download, it takes 6 to 12 months for the download of that app to essentially pay for itself and transactions over that app. So as long as the app downloads are growing for us and they're growing very quickly, you tend to pay more in marketing upfront and then you tend to get that marketing money back over time. And we're at that growth stage right now, where we're really not seeing any marketing efficiency as a result of mobile. But I think we're going to be in that stage for a couple of years.

We -- this quarter, posted 16% year-on-year room night growth domestically, which was pretty strong, 18% last quarter. The delta between those could be explained entirely by leap year. So we continue to see strong growth domestically. As we've mentioned, we had a little bit of softness in Europe, and APAC continues to be strong. So across-the-board, we're feeling pretty good about what we're seeing globally."

In terms of fleet, et cetera, we are seeing the car rental companies compressing their fleets this summer. Fleet sizes are tight. But we're not seeing retail pricing increase quite as much as we expected. So that's good for the leisure customer. But in general, availability is a bit lower than what we wanted to be. And when the fleet inventories gets tight, the percentage of transactions that we process through Opaque tends to be lower, and our retail partner of the business tends to grow faster. So we're certainly watching the retail versus Opaque balance as well."

And in a couple of weeks to a month, hopefully, you will see a new -- a pretty new user interface for our air products. It's going to look pretty different from what it looked like historically. We think it's absolutely great, but we'll let our users decide. We roll out the stuff, we test it with users and then based on user reactions, we'll rollout the things that work globally. But I think by the end of the year, you're going to see a pretty different air product for Expedia than what you have now. And I think it'll be pretty different and much better. As far as the package pass goes, it's hard to predict. Our package business and the package technology, in general, is more complex than any other technology that we have on the site. So while we are getting better at these rollouts, we learn from our mistakes. And in general, the speed of integration of the business is increasing. I never underestimate the complexity of the packaged product. And so what I would count on is what you see now, which is gradual improvement every quarter, getting better. And if we keep that going, I think we'll have some pretty good results for 2013."

And in up-markets, we tend to get the benefit of ADRs and some of the suppliers who can fill up that room directly kind of do so more aggressively. As far as where the market is and where we think it can go forward, we do think that supply generally does seem to be tightening up. And at this point, we're not kind of -- we're not feeling like we're getting a ceiling one way or the other. We think our inventory quality in the U.S. is really good. The deals that we have signed with our strategic partners provide very strong inventory for us. And we think as well so lost inventories out there, we've been able to sell it, and we've got products that can sell the inventory in very long lead times, light packages. And then we've got products that can sell inventory at short lead times, such as the Opaque model and with Hotwire and also the mobile channel as well. So we're pretty comfortable with our product, and we think some of the technology investments that we made are going to give us kind of returns above market, which is certainly what we're gunning for and hopefully we can keep showing those returns going forward.

Expedia's second quarter proved to be another good one, coming in ahead of our expectations. On the top line, gross bookings grew up to 13% and revenue growth up 14% were driven primarily by strength in our hotel business with global room nights growing a robust 22%, 24% including the AirAsia-Expedia joint venture. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 18% to $223 million, aided by a better-than-expected top line and lower-than-expected expenses. It's worth noting that second quarter results were helped by that acquisition of VIA Travel, which we completed in late April and contributed roughly 2 percentage points of growth in gross bookings and revenue, and 3 points of adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter. VIA Travel is the leading travel management company in the Nordics, and we're happy  to have them as part of the Egencia team. In addition, we had an out-of-period adjustment of $8 million to help both revenue and adjusted EBITDA that Mark will explain in his remarks.
We continue to see healthy results across virtually all of our brands, with brand Expedia also improving sequentially, but still down year-on-year. Our technology migration remains on track and stand-alone hotel room nights for brand Expedia accelerated again and grew faster than 10% on a book basis for Q2, compared to mid-single-digit growth in Q1. The air product has been moved to the new platform as planned and work continues on the packages' path, which should be substantially complete by year-end. 
You'll see more product innovation from us in the hotel and aircraft in the second half of the year, and we'll be ready to rollout packages as we move into 2013. As previously indicated, we plan to increase selling and marketing for brand Expedia as we move further along the technology migration, and just recently launched a brand marketing campaign in the U.S. called Find Yours, featuring 100% user-generated content from consumers explaining how travel has transformed them. Though very early for the campaign but initial response has been quite good. Now to be clear, brand Expedia continues to face certain environmental challenges outside of our control. Airline load factors and air ticket prices continue to grow year-over-year which is not good for the leisure traveler. Hotels continue to report tighter occupancies and higher rates, which make it more difficult for us to grow our package business. These factors are likely to remain as headwinds for air and package products for the foreseeable future.
Over the past few years, we've talked about our key brand re-platforming efforts. In addition to these efforts, we're also actively improving our entire technology stack from front-end, to middle works to supply services, to customer service, as well as our financial systems. Part of these efforts will allow us to introduce new technology to our hotel supply partners, which will enable much closer integration of the agency hotel product with our core merchant offering. 
Specifically, for participating hotels, we'll be able to offer customers the choice of whether to pay Expedia in advance or pay at the hotel at the time of the stay. So far the reaction from our suppliers has been positive, and our initial testing indicates that customers really like this flexibility. We believe that these innovations, if and when rolled out on a broad basis, would be likely to drive back the growth in our agency hotel business, which could result in a blended hotel margins as well as our merchant hotel flow trending down over time. 
With that said, we remind you that, in general, our suppliers pay us based on the considerable scale and breadth of our distribution platform and not based on a specific model under which we do business. As we introduce further innovation into the global hotel business, you would expect the current bright line between agency model and the merchant model to blur over time. 
Before handing it over to Mark, a bit about what we're seeing in Europe. We can see incremental weakness in southern Europe relative to what we saw last quarter. For all day, we see Europeans traveling to the U.S. less and traveling to European destinations more. We see some evidence of shortening length of stay and, in some markets, shorter booking windows, all of which could be attributed to market conditions. We'll keep a close eye on these trends, but for now, our growth rate in Europe is still healthy, and we believe we can continue to grow in this economic environment. Mark?"

From a financial perspective, the second quarter came in better than we expected and was driven by the underlying strength in our global hotel business.

From a financial perspective, the second quarter came in better than we expected and was driven by the underlying strength in our global hotel business. As Dara mentioned, we were helped by the addition of VIA Travel, as well as an $8 million out-of-period hotel revenue adjustment that we made in the quarter related to the reversal of an over-accrual for certain local taxes. Excluding the VIA acquisition and this adjustment, adjusted EBITDA grew 11% for the quarter. 
As expected, foreign exchange was a headwind this quarter and hit us harder than anticipated given the strength of the dollar relative to the euro. In total, we estimate that foreign currency costs us 300 to 400 basis points of growth in gross bookings, revenue and adjusted EBITDA. This was 100 to 200 basis points worse than we expected when we talked to you last quarter.
Hotel revenue represented 74% of total revenue for the quarter and grew 16%. Room night growth continued to be healthy at 22% for the quarter, 24% including the results from the AirAsia-Expedia joint venture. Domestic room night growth remained strong at 16%, while international room nights grew 29%, or 35% including the AirAsia-Expedia joint venture. ADRs were down 1% for the quarter while revenue per room night was down 5%. The decrease in revenue per room night was again driven by hotel product mix, the impact from foreign currency, discounting at Hotwire, and the loyalty program accrual comparables. As we noted last quarter, we have a very fast-growing hotel business in the Asia Pacific region, where ADRs and revenue per room night are much lower than in other geographies. Of course, we're happy to take the lower per unit economics in APAC given the sheer volume growth prospects for that region.  Consistent with Q1, Asia Pacific represented a high teens percentage share of the global room night mix in the second quarter.
Revenue from our air business represented 9% of our total revenue for the quarter and was down 8% year-over-year. Ticket volume grew 3% for the quarter, helped by the VIA Travel acquisition. Revenue per ticket was down 11% due primarily to lower net supplier economics. We continue to expect revenue per ticket to be down year-over-year for the duration of 2012, with the impact easing as we move through the year. Other revenue grew 17% for the quarter on growth and corporate travel fees and advertising revenue.
Running through key expense categories, cost of revenue grew faster than revenue in the quarter due almost entirely to the addition of VIA Travel. Excluding that business, cost of revenue grew largely in line with revenue on higher credit card costs associated with the growth of our merchant hotel business and additional headcount to support our global customer operations. These were partially offset by lower debit card fees and higher credit card rebates. 
Leverage in selling and marketing expense was driven by a combination of factors, including the addition of VIA Travel, as they have very low selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue, as well as some deferred spend for both brand Expedia and Hotels.com.
Looking forward, we expect selling and marketing to grow quite a bit faster and deleverage significantly in Q3 and, to a slightly lesser extent, in Q4, as Expedia and Hotels.com increase their spending, and as we invest more in Asia Pacific and emerging markets. 
Technology and content grew 24%, which was a bit lighter than our expectations. Looking forward, including the addition of VIA Travel, we now expect Q3 and Q4 growth rates to accelerate compared to the first half of the year.
General and administrative expenses grew 13%. As we have said in the past, we will continue to look for leverage in G&A over the long term. 
Lastly, in terms of capital allocation, on a year-to-date basis, we have deployed over $520 million against a combination of share repurchases, M&A and our dividend. I'm pleased to say that we've decided to increase our dividend to $0.13 per share for the next quarterly payout as a sign of our continued confidence in the long-term prospects for our business.
In terms of our financial expectations for full year 2012, we are now expecting adjusted EBITDA growth in the high-single digits with the possibility of low double-digit growth. Key changes since last quarter include the addition of VIA Travel and the second quarter outperformance, partially offset by a much larger headwind from foreign currency, from additional marketing spend we have decided to deploy in Asia Pacific and some slowdown in certain European markets, due to the tenuous global economic environment. With that, let's turn to questions. Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question."

Is that kind of in response to stuff you were hearing from your suppliers? Or is that in response to any sort of competitive dynamics that you're experiencing or expect to experience? And then just maybe a little bit more color on VIA Travel. If you can give us any color as to kind of what that business is growing at? It looks like the revenue take rate might be a little bit higher than Egencia, is that sustainable? Any color you can give there, as well as were there any contribution to the hotel room night growth from VIA in the quarter?"

On the first, on agency and merchant, what we're doing is responding to the marketplace and responding to consumer behavior. Obviously, the European markets are very important to us. They are quite fragmented, the European travel markets are actually larger than that of the U.S. and we have seen that, in Europe, the agency model is quite popular, which is what led us to the acquisition of Venere a few years ago. And we have been working in and integrating agency inventory along with our merchant inventory, but what we really wanted to come up with is a product that was better. There are certain consumers who like to buy merchant, they like to pay upfront, they want to pay in their local currency, they don't want to leave their credit card with a small hotel et cetera, at the front desk, and there are some consumers who do like to pay at the hotel. And we are just simply following that consumer behavior. We think that giving consumers the flexibility to choose is a good thing. We've tested it, and consumers seem to like it. And what we'll do is carefully rollout this program on a worldwide basis. And this is a rollout that we can measure, and we will -- our intention is to roll it out pretty quickly but we can pull back on the rollout et cetera, based on the results that we see. Mark, you want to talk about the second question, VIA?"

It is -- it's much more of a traditional corporate travel business, than certainly Egencia is. And traditional corporate travel businesses generally charge higher fees to consumers and take more phone calls off-line than certainly Egencia does. So that results in essentially a different P&L structure from that which you see at Egencia, which is higher growth. Egencia is doing the corporate travel, what? The Expedia business took the leisure traveler -- travel back in the late 90s, as they're a higher growth business, higher spend on technology but a much lower cost business from the perspective of the clients and that they don't have to pay fees and they're  able to transact online. So over time, I would expect that, that combined business and the Egencia business, as we build it, to continue to scale and to continue to drive meaningful growth to our business. But the P&L will start to merge to be a combination of essentially those 2 P&Ls."

The biggest one is -- the biggest 2 are probably eLong/the Asia business and foreign exchange. Domestic ADRs continue to be healthy, and I think that our ADRs would be consistent with, what? Broadly consistent with what you'd see in the larger domestic market. With respect to the delta between ADRs and revenue per room night, we did see a little bit of moderating this quarter. As I said last quarter, we are -- we did start to comp over the competitive pricing actions or discounting that Hotwire was doing. So that's what you're starting to see in those numbers. Q3 should be largely a clean comp on the Hotwire piece so that impact should lessen. And then we will also start in Q3 to comp over the Expedia Loyalty launch. And there is a little bit of help from that this quarter but not much. You'll see that a bit more so in Q3.
And then you had a second question. Yes?"

The mobile transactions are starting to become a bit more diversified. They used to be essentially iPhone only, iOS only. We're seeing significant iOS, we're seeing significant mobile web. Tablet is starting to become a big player in mobile transactions and in traffic as well. So the traffic is broadening a bit. The handset business tends to be short-window, 70 or so percent of the transactions are within a day. The tablet transactions look more like desktop behavior, they're not necessarily short-window. And as far as marketing goes, we are still at the point where we're trying to establish and install base for mobile and, typically, when we market for an app download, it takes 6 to 12 months for the download of that app to essentially pay for itself and transactions over that app. So as long as the app downloads are growing for us and they're growing very quickly, you tend to pay more in marketing upfront and then you tend to get that marketing money back over time. And we're at that growth stage right now, where we're really not seeing any marketing efficiency as a result of mobile. But I think we're going to be in that stage for a couple of years. I think we're going to be net investors in mobile over a period of time. We want to establish a user base in mobile, in loyalty, so that we get users coming direct to us as well as through indirect channels like Google, TripAdvisor, metasearch as well."

We -- this quarter, posted 16% year-on-year room night growth domestically, which was pretty strong, 18% last quarter. The delta between those could be explained entirely by leap year.

In terms of fleet, et cetera, we are seeing the car rental companies compressing their fleets this summer. Fleet sizes are tight. But we're not seeing retail pricing increase quite as much as we expected. So that's good for the leisure customer. But in general, availability is a bit lower than what we wanted to be. And when fleet inventories get tight, the percentage of transactions that we process through Opaque tends to be lower, and our retail part of the business tends to grow faster. So we're certainly watching the retail versus Opaque balance as well."

And in a couple of weeks to a month, hopefully, you will see a new -- a pretty new user interface for our air products. It's going to look pretty different from what it looked like historically. We think it's absolutely great, but we'll let our users decide. We roll out the stuff, we test it with users and then based on user reactions, we'll rollout the things that work globally. But I think by the end of the year, you're going to see a pretty different air product for Expedia than what you have now. And I think it'll be pretty different and much better. As far as the package pass goes, it's hard to predict. Our package business and the package technology, in general, is more complex than any other technology that we have on the site. So while we are getting better at these rollouts, we learn from our mistakes. And in general, the speed of integration of the business is increasing. I never underestimate the complexity of the packaged product. And so what I would count on is what you see now, which is gradual improvement every quarter, getting better. And if we keep that going, I think we'll have some pretty good results for 2013."

The numbers have been quite healthy and they -- the occupancy rates are starting to hit peak season, kind of the 70% range, which is pretty high from a historical standpoint. And listen, I think our model is a model that performs quite well in up-and-down markets. We tend to be a little bit more countercyclical than the market. In a kind of a poor economy, poor market, we tend to gain share pretty quickly. We get hit by ADR weakness. And in up-markets, we tend to get the benefit of ADRs and some of the suppliers who can fill up their rooms directly kind of do so more aggressively. As far as where the market is and where we think it can go forward, we do think that supply generally does seem to be tightening up. And at this point, we're not kind of -- we're not feeling like we're hitting a ceiling one way or the other. We think our inventory quality in the U.S. is really good. The deals that we have signed with our strategic partners provide very strong inventory for us. And we think as long as the inventory's out there, we'll be able to sell it, and we've got products that can sell the inventory in very long lead times, light packages. And then we've got products that can sell inventory at short lead times, such as the Opaque model and with Hotwire and also the mobile channel as well. So we're pretty comfortable with our product, and we think some of the technology investments that we made are going to give us kind of returns above market, which is certainly what we're gunning for and hopefully we can keep showing those returns going forward. Long-winded answer, I apologize."

Expedia's third quarter results continue to build on in shaping up to be quite a good year. We saw ongoing strength in our hotel business, with room night growth accelerating across all major regions, especially in the Asia Pacific regions and Europe. In fact, for the first time in our history, our international point-of-sale delivered an impressive 50% of our total room nights for the quarter. Global room night growth of 27% was faster than Q2, the brand Expedia's growth continues to accelerate nicely, with hotels.com and the rest of our brands continuing to grow at very healthy rate and executing well. Our technology projects remain on track with rapid innovation on brand Expedia's stand-alone hotel path and more fundamental changes coming on our standalone aircraft.
At this point, we can tell you 2 things: one, that we're delivering predictively on our technology roadmaps; and two, that Expedia Hotels end-to-end program has been a success. Expedia standalone room night are growing again at materially faster pace. What we don't know yet is specifically how we will performed in air packages, both of which are battling macro headwinds. At this point though, we're very optimistic with our teams ability to deliver a great platform and hopefully, sustainable growth as a result. Separately, we've been really pleased with the new Expedia FIND YOURS advertising campaign, which is much more inspirational than you typically see in the category. Toning in on the transformational nature of travel as told by real-life actors -- real-life travelers, not real-life actors. No characters, no actors. The campaign is extremely powerful and if you haven't seen any of the ads yet, I'd encourage you to take a look. In fact, the reason video of ours, Find Your Understanding, exceeded a record 2 million views in about 1 week.
Last quarter, we introduced you to an innovative new program called Expedia Travelers Preference or ETP. As a reminder, we built a technology that allows us, along with participating hotels, to offer consumers a choice of whether to pay Expedia in advance or pay at the hotel at the time of their stay, which we believe meaningfully increases the likelihood that customers will book. While it's very early in the roll out, we're pleased with the progress to date, and we can see already witty that participating hotels are outperforming hotels who have not yet signed up for the program. Not surprisingly, European customers are favoring Hotel Collect while U.S. consumers seem to be favoring Expedia Collect.
From an international perspective, we recently signed a new agreement with eLong that improves core operation between the company's and allows us to bring more of our assets to bare as we compete aggressively in that growing market. focus right for China is close to $100 billion, at which only 13% is online. With eLong's consistent share gains, we believe that we're one of the few global e-commerce companies that have established a significant and lasting position in China. As the Chinese middle-class gross and those consumers continue to travel more and those consumers continue to travel more and increasingly book that travel online.
We continue to make significant progress in mobile. We just launched its new iPhone app and is now getting about 20% of its hotel transactions through mobile including tablet. In addition Hotels.com released an updated version of its app for Android and iPad tablets, and they'll have surpassed the 10 million mobile app download milestone across all mobile platforms. We continue to view mobile as an opportunity to access new market segments as well as potentially drive a higher percentage of our bookings directly to our sites, especially through app downloads.
Lastly, from a macro global economic perspective, the environment doesn't appear to have changed significantly since we spoke to you last quarter. Obviously, we don't know what will happen with the so-called fiscal cliff, or with the elections in the U.S. and we can't predict the outcome of sovereign debt and other global economic issues. While we do see clear signs of cautions surrounding managed corporate travel spent in the U.S. we have felt any incremental effects on the rest of our brands. Our focus will continue -- will be to continue executing on our play book, with a goal of innovating and making continuous improvements across our products and businesses that will drive growth in all geographies over the long term.

Hotel revenue grew 20% year-over-year on room night growth of 27%, with domestic room night up 17% and international growing 38%. Revenue per room night was down 6%, while average daily room rates were down just under 3%. The decrease in revenue per room night was again driven by mix shift. The impact from foreign currency and the loyalty programs. We talked to you in the past about the impact of an increasingly larger and fast-growing hotel business in the Asia Pacific region. In fact, if you exclude the APAC region, as well as foreign currency headwinds, we estimate that revenue per room night would have been flat year-over-year on ADR growth of 2%. Our hotel business represents a large, strategic global growth opportunity and we will be happy to take volume growth even at lower unit economics to continue to drive the size and scale of this business.
Revenue from our air business represented 7% of total revenue for the quarter and was down 10% year-over-year. Ticket volume grew 11%, largely due to the VIA Travel acquisition, without which, tickets would've grown in the low to mid-single-digit range. Revenue per ticket was down 19%, due primarily to significantly lower net supplier economics arising from new carrier deals negotiated over the course of last year. We think that revenue per ticket trends will start to normalize next year after we have lapped most of our newer supplier agreements.
Other revenue representing 16% of the mix, grew 23% for the quarter on growth in corporate travel fees and advertising revenue. Note that we did benefit in Q3 on the top line from lapping the AirAsia joint venture, which launched in Q3 2011, and had been a headwind until now, as well as the inclusion of VIA Travel in our results.
Running through key expense categories, cost of revenue grew faster than revenue in the quarter due to the addition of VIA Travel. Excluding that new business, cost of revenue would've levered significantly. As expected, selling and marketing grew faster than revenue due to 3 main factors: firstly, as we mentioned on prior calls, as brand Expedia has been rolling out its platform enhancements, it's been quite conservative in its overall marketing spend with significant product enhancements now in production, Expedia's becoming increasingly more aggressive in its marketing efforts; secondly, we have also made discrete decisions to increase our marketing investment in APAC and other emerging markets, so that we continue to position the business for the excellent long-term growth opportunities we see in those regions. And lastly, as we mentioned last quarter, we did have some delayed spending that moved from Q2 to Q3.
Looking ahead to Q4, we continue to expect deleverage in selling and marketing expense.
Technology and content grew 27%, which was actually lighter than we had anticipated. Given a variety of factors including the addition of VIA Travel, along with some difficult comps for capitalized labor and bonuses, we expect full year tech and content expense to grow at a rate just North of what we saw in Q3. General and administrative expenses grew 8% primarily on increase personnel costs.
Shifting gears, I also want to mention briefly that our effective tax rate was quite low this quarter, primarily as a result of the release of some previous valuation allowances and as was the case in last year's third quarter, some adjustments arising from our annual provision to return reconciliation.
Lastly, in terms of capital allocation, since our Q2 call, we repurchased an additional 1.9 million shares and on a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased 10.7 million shares for $397 million, representing an average price of just over $37 per share. In total, so far this year, we have deployed almost $640 million against the combination of share repurchases, M&A and our dividend.
In terms of our financial expectations for full-year 2012, we are now expecting adjusted EBITDA growth to be in the low double-digit range. We are currently in the process of planning for 2013, and as usual, would expect to get some insight on our expectations for next year on our fourth quarter earnings call. With that, let's turn to questions. Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question."

As far as the reason why now -- to some extent, we've taken our time in observing the agency model that we acquired Venere a couple of years ago in Europe, where the agency model is strongest. And we have seen the consumer preference, especially Europe -- in Europe for agency. And I think I told you for a long time that we are a marketer of hotel rooms, whether it's a merchant hotel rooms or agency transactions, we don't particularly care. We want to market rooms to our global audience in whichever way they want to consume them. The challenge for us was -- was a pretty significant technology project that would allow us to have the flexibility to allow hotels who signed up for the ETP program to transact either in a merchant model or in agency model. The technology there is not simple. No one really has done it at scale before and we wanted to do it in a way that could scale on a global basis, and kind of scale global technology projects like this or by no means simple. So to some extent, the timing was driven by the platform and by the technology and once we thought it was ready, once we had discussions with partners and hotels who are quite interested in it, we thought we were ready to rollout. This comes with a model -- comes with lots of other stuff. Your customer service has to change. Your collections for -- collections for commissions is completely different for agency versus merchant. So a lot went into this effort, which isn't -- which is really invisible to the customer and invisible to the hotellier, but a lot of work had to go to the back -- kind of the back end in order to make this -- make this available on a scale basis. Mark, you want to talk about the cash flow?"

It will depend on the adoption rates of the hotel collector agency model versus the merchant model. And what we've seen so far is that in -- as Dara mentioned in the domestic market, we've seen people continue to prefer the merchant model. And outside of the U.S. a preference for the agency model. And we also have a pretty strong or pretty large packages business that we hope will become even stronger if you rollout the packages end-to-end product on Expedia. So again, it's difficult to predict. I would just say that the merchant model, we believe is going to continue to have a pretty material role for our business going forward. But to the extent that we do shift more to the agency product, of course, that will have a negative impact on our working capital. But of course, we've got a strong balance sheet, we've got significant liquidity, we have been obviously, working on this as Dara mentioned for a long time, and we think this is a great investment to the extent that we have to make an investment of our cash flow and balance sheet to make this possible."

We see more of our traffic across all of our brands coming mobile. The most significant and popular use case for mobile is for last-minute type booking, 60% to 70% of our bookings are for hotels, 24 hours out. Mobile is a truly a global phenomenon for us. The Expedia Hotels App is -- was downloaded around 5 million times in 220 different countries, so we're building very, very global solutions on the mobile space. In general, our mobile conversion tends to be a little bit lower than our desktop conversions. But that's to be expected. But I think that the delta that you hear with media company monetization between mobile and desktop is not nearly as much of a delta for us. Now we think the other benefit of mobile for us is it's a different use case. These are -- we were not highly penetrated in the ""walk-in traffic"" in last-minute type business. This allows us to penetrate into that business and kind of a new market that we hadn't been in previously. I think the other factor that's pretty interesting for us is that tablet behavior is pretty different from iPhone or phone behavior. So when we talk about mobile, we're kind of putting tablet into its own category, and I think the challenge that it gives to us is it creates lots and lots of different form factors that we essentially have to build designs around. So while it is a great kind of a business opportunity to us, we do think that it provides some challenges on the development and the design side. And it's going to be a challenge for everybody."

So there -- there are a few things going on with the room night numbers in Q3. I would say the only one timer that I would call out was we did lap over the AirAsia joint venture being excluded from our results, which we have been disclosing separately. But that's probably 200 to 300 bip impact on the room nights. But even with that, when you take that out, you still have an accelerating case. And I would say that one of the big drivers of that is in indeed, the acceleration of the Expedia business. We have been in the period for a fairly long time where we had all of the businesses led by Hotels.com putting in pretty consistent room night growth and really, the big delta here is Brand Expedia. And listen, to parse it out between conversion and marketing, it is a difficult thing to do.
Generally, what I'd tell you is in the variable marketing channel such as search engine marketing, conversion allows you to drive more volume. It allows you essentially to spend more money on marketing and produce bookings. And if you look at our marketing spend this quarter and in fact the acceleration of our marketing spend this quarter and look at the growth rate compared to our merchant gross bookings, you'll see a pretty tight -- a pretty tight correlation. And that's driven by a combination really of great performance of the product, backed up by good marketing spend to drive more growth. In terms of the APAC mix, it is under 10% of gross bookings and revenue, and it's mid- to high teens percent of room nights."

Kind of relating to what Mark talked about, to the extent that you build a better product that can convert better and the Hotels.com team has been doing that pretty consistently, the Expedia team is a little newer to it but is clearly doing it as well. You can then go out in the variable channels especially where you can get instant reaction with the googles of the world, with the medicine players of the world, and you can essentially afford to bid more for a transaction that all that last quarter or last year you could bid as much. And you can still make the same amount for that transaction. So it's not an issue of accepting a lower profit margin for that transaction. You can still get a similar efficiency. You can just get a higher position. So we -- what you're seeing with us right now is a shift into some of the more expensive channels because we can afford to pay for some of those expensive channels than last year, rather than call it a macro shift in competitiveness one-way or the other. And the other factor that Mark talked about is the timing factor, which is we obviously, pay for the marketing cost up front and we recognize the rooms days later. So to the extent that you got a business that's accelerating as you see ours is, you might see a heavier marketing load up front before you start recognizing all the revenue."

And again, that is great volume. The opportunity is very significant in those markets, and it's something that we believe very strongly and we need to invest in, but it can result in mix shift impacts on our P&L.

About 9,000 of those are hotels that we would classify as chain hotels or strategic accounts, with the remaining being independents. We had a great reception from our chain partners and we're pretty excited to be working with them on this. In terms of the rollout plan, we've got about 3,000 of those hotels actually live right now. It takes some time to actually get them trained up and converted over to the new platform. And we will plan, by the end of the year, to have significantly more live. We have the functionality essentially rolled out on the majority of Hotels.com websites now, either with 100% of traffic or 50-50 in testing. And I would say the same for Expedia, there a little bit behind in rolling it out just because of the technology. And by the end of the year, we expect to have the functionality live on both brand Expedia and Hotels.com globally. In terms of Brand Expedia the how fast will roll out new properties, again, we kind of get the flexibility here to see some of the trends that we see and accelerate or decelerate. But so far, we like what we see and we're going to continue to rollout according to our plan. We have not done any special promotion of participating hotels. But we have seen that hotels that are participating are generally getting significantly more volume than those that don't. And really, that's driven by the fact that consumers really like this product. And so they're just more likely to book with those hotels if they've got the choice versus those they don't. And the other thing we're seeing is that hotels the participate are generally get bookings on average of longer lengths of stay, which is a great results for our hotel partners. More volume, bookings with longer length of stay is a good thing. And then the last thing I would note is that again, it's early, but so far, we're seeing this model be significantly more attractive to consumers outside of the U.S. than it is in the U.S. European consumers really like that and we that'll be a great thing for our hotel partners driving more International business into the U.S. hotels. And I think it'll be a great thing for our business in terms of giving us more opportunity to expand internationally. But again, it's very early to tell. We're excited with what we see.

So we're striving to basically give you guys metrics that we use to understand the business and help you understand the business and transactions was increasingly becoming less so that type of number. With respect to what we're seeing in car, we did see some compression in the summer. And that, of course, made opaque inventory a little bit more scarce. We are not expecting a meaningful change in that situation as we move into Q4. We are expecting still some compression. And for our business, there wasn't anything materially that changed in the quarter. Again, we did have some weakness in our opaque inventory. But that ultimately got offset for us anyways in terms of some uplift that we saw from some Brand Expedia improvement in the car product."

So listen, given the best way to model marketing efficiencies is by brand, by geography. But of course, you don't have that. So the next closest thing you probably got in quarter is specifically merchant gross bookings and our hotel spend. Of course, Expedia Traveler Preference could make that a little bit more difficult to track over time, so it may be a temporary fix. But that's probably the closest. It is not perfect though, of course. We've got multiple products that are in merchant and multiple things that we spend our marketing money on, including brand marketing, which can generally move the numbers because its less tied to specifically in-quarter activity. But hopefully, that gives you a little bit of guidance. In terms of trends for room nights for Hotels.com, I would say that the Hotels.com and the rest of the brand, the trend has been pretty consistent. They continue to perform at a healthy level, healthy growth rates. We haven't seen anything materially change in that. And as Dara said, a lot of the changes that we've made in the hotel platform and really the way that we're executing on the business playbook should be things that we believe give continued growth in that business.

Expedia's third quarter results continue to build on while shaping up to be quite a good year. We saw ongoing strength in our hotel business, with room night growth accelerating across all major regions, especially in the Asia-Pacific region",738,"Thanks, Alan. Expedia's third quarter results continue to build on while shaping up to be quite a good year. We saw ongoing strength in our hotel business, with room night growth accelerating across all major regions, especially in the Asia-Pacific regions and Europe. In fact, for the first time in our history, our international points of sale delivered an impressive 50% of our total room nights for the quarter. 
Global room night growth of 27% was faster than Q2 as Brand Expedia's growth continues to accelerate nicely, with Hotels.com and the rest of our brands continuing to grow at very healthy rates and executing well. Our technology projects remain on track, with rapid innovation on Brand Expedia's standalone hotel path and more fundamental changes coming on our standalone air path.
At this point, we can tell you 2 things: one, that we're delivering predictively on our technology roadmaps; and two, that Expedia hotels' end-to-end program has been a success. Expedia standalone room nights are growing again at a materially faster pace. What we don't know yet is specifically how we will perform in air and packages, both of which are battling macro headwinds. 
At this point though, we're optimistic about our team's ability to deliver a great platform and hopefully, sustainable growth as a result. Separately, we've been really pleased with the new Expedia FIND YOURS advertising campaign, which is much more inspirational than you typically see in the category. Toning in on the transformational nature of travel as told by real-life actors -- real-life travelers, not real-life actors, no characters, no actors, the campaign is extremely powerful. And if you haven't seen any of the ads yet, I'd encourage you to take a look. In fact, the recent viral video of ours, Find Your Understanding, exceeded a record 2 million views in about 1 week.
Last quarter, we introduced you to an innovative new program called Expedia Travelers Preference or ETP. As a reminder, we built a technology that allows us, along with participating hotels, to offer consumers a choice of whether to pay Expedia in advance or pay at the hotel at the time of their stay, which, we believe, meaningfully increases the likelihood that customers will book. While it's very early in the rollout, we're pleased with the progress to date, and we can see already that participating hotels are outperforming hotels who have not yet signed up for the program. Not surprisingly, European customers are favoring Hotel Collect, while U.S. consumers seem to be favoring Expedia Collect.
From an international perspective, we recently signed a new agreement with eLong that improves core operation between the companies and allows us to bring more of our assets to bear as we compete aggressively in that growing market. We're focused right [ph] . The annual travel market in China is close to $100 billion, of which only 13% is online. With eLong's consistent share gains, we believe that we're one of the few global e-commerce companies that have established a significant and lasting position in China, as the Chinese middle class grows and those consumers continue to travel more and increasingly boo their that travel online.
We continued to make significant progress in mobile. Hotwire just launched its new iPhone app and is now getting about 20% of its hotel transactions through mobile, including tablet. In addition Hotels.com released an updated version of its app for Android and iPad tablets and now have surpassed the 10 million mobile app download milestone across all mobile platforms. We continue to view mobile as an opportunity to access new market segments as well as potentially drive a higher percentage of our bookings directly to our sites, especially through app downloads.
Lastly, from a macro global economic perspective, the environment doesn't appear to have changed significantly since we spoke to you last quarter. Obviously, we don't know what will happen with the so-called fiscal cliff or the elections in the U.S. and we can't predict the outcome of sovereign debt and other global economic issues. While we do see clear signs of caution surrounding managed corporate travel spend in the U.S., we haven't felt any incremental effects on the rest of our brands. Our focus will continue -- will be to continue executing on our playbook, with a goal of innovating and making continuous improvements across our products and businesses that'll drive growth in all geographies over the long term.

25915843,222838881,370741,"Expedia Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dara. The third quarter came in slightly ahead of our expectations. Hotel revenue grew 20% year-over-year on room night growth of 27%, with domestic room nights up 17% and international growing 38%. Revenue per room night was down 6%, while ave",722,"Thank you, Dara. The third quarter came in slightly ahead of our expectations. Hotel revenue grew 20% year-over-year on room night growth of 27%, with domestic room nights up 17% and international growing 38%. Revenue per room night was down 6%, while average daily room rates were down just under 3%. The decrease in revenue per room night was, again, driven by mix shift, the impact from foreign currency and the loyalty programs. 
We talked to you in the past about the impact of an increasingly larger and fast-growing hotel business in the Asia-Pacific region. In fact, if you exclude the APAC region, as well as foreign currency headwinds, we estimate that revenue per room night would have been flat year-over-year on ADR growth of 2%. Our hotel business represents a large, strategic global growth opportunity, and we will be happy to take volume growth even at lower unit economics to continue to drive the size and scale of this business.
Revenue from our air business represented 7% of total revenue for the quarter and was down 10% year-over-year. Ticket volume grew 11%, largely due to the VIA Travel acquisition, without which tickets would've grown in the low- to mid-single digit range. Revenue per ticket was down 19% due primarily to significantly lower net supplier economics arising from new carrier deals negotiated over the course of last year. We think that revenue-per-ticket trends will start to normalize next year after we have lapped most of our newer supplier agreements.
Other revenue, representing 16% of the mix, grew 23% for the quarter on growth in corporate travel fees and advertising revenue. Note that we did benefit in Q3 on the top line from lapping the AirAsia joint venture, which launched in Q3 2011, and had been a headwind until now, as well as the inclusion of VIA Travel in our results.
Running through key expense categories. Cost of revenue grew faster than revenue in the quarter due to the addition of VIA Travel. Excluding that new business, cost of revenue would have levered significantly. As expected, selling and marketing grew faster than revenue due to 3 main factors. Firstly, as we've mentioned on prior calls, as Brand Expedia has been rolling out its platform enhancements, it's been quite conservative in its overall marketing spend. With significant product enhancements now in production, Expedia is becoming increasingly more aggressive in its marketing efforts. 
Secondly, we have also made discrete decisions to increase our marketing investment in APAC and other emerging markets so that we continue to position the business for the excellent long-term growth opportunities we see in those regions. And lastly, as we mentioned last quarter, we did have some delayed spending that moved from Q2 to Q3. Looking ahead to Q4, we continue to expect deleverage in selling and marketing expense.
Technology and content grew 27%, which was actually lighter than we had anticipated. Given a variety of factors, including the addition of VIA Travel, along with some difficult comps for capitalized labor and bonuses, we expect full year tech and content expense to grow at a rate just north of what we saw in Q3. General and administrative expenses grew 8%, primarily on increased personnel costs.
Shifting gears. I also want to mention briefly that our effective tax rate was quite low this quarter, primarily as a result of the release of some previous valuation allowances and as was the case in last year's third quarter, some adjustments arising from our annual provision to return reconciliation. Lastly, in terms of capital allocation, since our Q2 call, we have repurchased an additional 1.9 million shares, and on a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased 10.7 million shares for $397 million, representing an average price of just over $37 per share. In total, so far this year, we have deployed almost $640 million against the combination of share repurchases, M&A and our dividend.
In terms of our financial expectations for full year 2012, we are now expecting adjusted EBITDA growth to be in the low-double digit range. We are currently in the process of planning for 2013 and as usual, would expect to give some insight on our expectations for next year on our fourth quarter earnings call. 
With that, let's turn to questions. Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question."

As far as the reason why now, to some extent, we've taken our time in observing the agency model. You know that we acquired Venere a couple of years ago in Europe, where the agency model is strongest, and we have seen the consumer preference, especially Europe -- in Europe for agency. And I think we've told you for a long time that we are a marketer of hotel rooms, whether it's merchant hotel rooms or agency transactions, we don't particularly care. We want to market rooms to our global audience in whichever way that they want to consume them. The challenge for us was a pretty significant technology project that would allow us to have the flexibility to allow hotels who signed up for the ETP program to transact either in a merchant model or an agency model. The technology there is not simple. No one really has done it at scale before, and we wanted to do it in a way that could scale on a global basis, and kind of scale global technology projects like this are by no means simple. So to some extent, the timing was driven by the platform and by the technology. And once we thought it was ready, once we had discussions with partners and hotels who are quite interested in it, we thought we were ready to roll out. This comes with -- the model comes with lots of other stuff. Your customer service has to change. Your collections for commissions is completely different for agency versus merchant. So a lot went into this effort, which isn't -- which is really invisible to the customer and invisible to the hotelier, but a lot of work had to go into the back -- kind of the back end in order to make this available on a scale basis. Mark, you want to talk about the cash flow?"

It will depend on the adoption rates of the hotel collector agency model versus the merchant model. And what we've seen so far is that in -- as Dara mentioned, in the domestic market, we've seen people continue to prefer the merchant model and outside of the U.S., a preference for the agency model. And we also have a pretty strong -- or pretty large packages business that we hope will become even stronger if we roll out the packages' end-to-end product on Expedia. So again, it's difficult to predict. I would just say that the merchant model, we believe is going to continue to have a pretty material role for our business going forward. But to the extent that we do shift more to the agency product, of course, that will have a negative impact on our working capital. But of course, we've got a strong balance sheet. We've got significant liquidity. We have been, obviously, working on this, as Dara mentioned, for a long time, and we think this is a great investment to the extent that we have to make an investment of our cash flow and balance sheet to make this possible."

We see more of our traffic across all of our brands coming mobile. The most significant and popular use case for mobile is for last-minute type booking. 60% to 70% of our bookings are for hotels 24 hours out. Mobile is truly a global phenomenon for us. The Expedia Hotels app is -- was downloaded around 5 million times in 220 different countries, so we're building very, very global solutions on the mobile space. In general, our mobile conversion tends to be a little bit lower than our desktop conversion, but that's to be expected. But I think that the delta that you hear with media company monetization between mobile and desktop is not nearly as much of a delta for us. And we think the other benefit of mobile for us is it's a different use case. These are -- we were not highly penetrated in the ""walk-in traffic"" and last-minute type business. This allows us to penetrate into that business and kind of a new market that we hadn't been in previously. I think the other factor that's pretty interesting for us is that tablet behavior is pretty different from iPhone or phone behavior. So when we talk about mobile, we're kind of putting tablet into its own category, and I think the challenge that it gives to us is it creates lots and lots of different form factors that we essentially have to build designs around. So while it is a great kind of a business opportunity to us, we do think that it provides some challenges on the development and the design side. And it's going to be a challenge for everybody."

So there are a few things going on with the room night numbers in Q3. I would say the only one-timer that I would call out was we did lap over the AirAsia joint venture, been excluded from our results, which we have been disclosing separately. But that's probably a 200- to 300-bp impact on the room nights. But even with that, when you take that out, you still have an accelerating case. And I would say that one of the big drivers of that is in indeed, the acceleration of the Expedia business. We have been in a period for a fairly long time where we had all of the businesses led by Hotels.com putting in pretty consistent room night growth and really, the big delta here is Brand Expedia. And listen, to parse it out between conversion and marketing, it is a difficult thing to do. Generally, what I'd tell you is that in the variable marketing channels, such as search engine marketing, conversion allows you to drive more volume. It allows you essentially to spend more money on marketing and produce bookings. And if you look at our marketing spend this quarter and in fact, the acceleration of our marketing spend this quarter and look at the growth rate compared to our merchant gross bookings, you'll see a pretty tight  correlation. And that's driven by a combination, really, of great performance of the product, backed up by good marketing spend to drive more growth. In terms of the APAC mix, it is under 10% of gross bookings and revenue, and it's mid- to high-teens percent of room nights."

Kind of relating to what Mark talked about, to the extent that you build a better product that can convert better, and the Hotels.com team has been doing that pretty consistently, the Expedia team is a little newer to it, but it's clearly doing it as well. You can then go out in the variable channels, especially where you can get instant reaction with the Googles of the world, with the metasearch players of the world, and you can essentially afford to bid more for a transaction that, call it, the last quarter or last year, you couldn't bid as much for. And you can still make the same amount for that transaction. So it's not an issue of accepting a lower profit margin for that transaction. You can still get a similar efficiency, you can just get a higher position. So we -- what you're seeing with us right now is a shift into some of the more expensive channels because we can afford to pay for some of those expensive channels, when last year we couldn't, rather than call it a macro shift in competitiveness one way or the other. And the other factor that Mark talked about is the timing factor, which is we obviously pay for the marketing cost up front, and we recognize the room stays later. So to the extent that you've got a business that's accelerating, as you see ours is, you might see a heavier marketing load up front before you start recognizing all the revenue."

The opportunity is very significant in those markets, and it's something that, we believe very strongly, we need to invest in, but it can result in mix shift impacts on our P&L. That makes our sales and marketing look a little bit less efficient than actually on a like-for-like basis it may actually be."

About 9,000 of those are hotels that we would classify as chain hotels or strategic accounts, with the remaining being independents. We've had a great reception from our chain partners, and we're pretty excited to be working with them on this. In terms of the rollout plan, we've got about 3,000 of those hotels actually live right now. It takes some time to actually get them trained up and converted over to the new platform. And we will plan, by the end of the year, to have significantly more live. We have the functionality essentially rolled out on the majority of Hotels.com websites now, either with 100% of traffic or 50-50 in testing. And I would say the same for Expedia. They're a little bit behind in rolling it out just because of the technology. And by the end of the year, we expect to have the functionality live on both Brand Expedia and Hotels.com globally. In terms of the how fast we'll roll out new properties, again, we kind of get the flexibility here to see some of the trends that we see and accelerate or decelerate. But so far, we like what we see, and we're going to continue to roll out according to our plan. We have not done any special promotion of participating hotels. But we have seen that hotels that are participating are generally getting significantly more volume than those that don't. And really, that's driven by the fact that consumers really like this product. And so they're just more likely to book with those hotels if they've got the choice versus those they don't. And the other thing we're seeing is that hotels that participate are -- generally get bookings on average of longer lengths of stay, which is a great result for our hotel partners. More volume, bookings with longer length of stay is a good thing. And then the last thing I would note is that the -- again, it's early, but so far, we're seeing this model be significantly more attractive to consumers outside of the U.S. than it is in the U.S. European consumers really like that, and then we think that'll be a great thing for our hotel partners, driving more international business into the U.S. hotels. And then we think it'll be a great thing for our business in terms of giving us more opportunity to expand internationally. But again, it's very early to tell. We're excited with what we see.

So as we've rolled out the new platforms and been executing on our playbooks, we have considerable headroom to grow in Europe. And so to some extent, we end up being less hit by macro conditions, at least less hit than we can see because we are in a share-gain mode. Now if the economy there was really booming, perhaps it would be higher. But again, that's very difficult for us to tell."

But as far as platforms go -- listen, I think it's a great question. The challenge for us now as we build out technology and as we build out designs for our various sites is to build those designs in an adaptive way. That means that they can adapt to the form factor that the user chooses. So the user is on a PC, the site adapts to the size of that PC. If they are on an iPad mini, the site also adapts to that iPad mini. It creates more upfront work as far as the kind of design, that you do decisions on what's really important to present on a page versus what's not important to present on the page. In general, our sites are not adaptive at this point, in general. And as we're building out new feature sets, as we're redesigning pages, we'll look to design them in an adaptive way so that they can adapt freely to the various devices that you -- that the user wants to use. And listen, we think this is an opportunity for technology companies out there, for technology leaders out there. This is -- it's going to be a challenge to build out adaptive designs in general. It's something that we think can differentiate us, but it is an upfront cost.  Just the fragmentation of the devices on a worldwide basis is going to make our jobs more complex, but I think that, that allows us to differentiate ourselves and to add value in the general travel value chain.

So we're striving to basically give you guys metrics that we use to understand the business and help you understand the business, and transactions was increasingly becoming less so that type of number.

We are not expecting a meaningful change in that situation as we move into Q4. We are expecting still some compression.

So listen, given the best way to model marketing efficiency is by brand, by geography, but of course, you don't have that, so the next closest thing you probably got in quarter is specifically merchant gross bookings and our hotel spend. Of course, Expedia Traveler Preference could make that a little bit more difficult to track over time, so it may be a temporary fix. But that's probably the closest. It is not perfect though, of course. We've got multiple products that are in merchant and multiple things that we spend our marketing money on, including brand marketing, which can generally move the numbers because its less tied to, specifically, in-quarter activity. But hopefully, that gives you a little bit of guidance. In terms of trends for room nights for Hotels.com, I would say that the Hotels.com and the rest of the brands, the trend has been pretty consistent. They continue to perform at a healthy level, healthy growth rates. We haven't seen anything materially change in that. And as Dara said, a lot of the changes that we've made in the hotel platform and really the way that we're executing on this playbook should be things that we believe give continued growth in that business.

Expedia's third quarter results continue to build on what's shaping up to be quite a good year. We saw ongoing strength in our hotel business, with room night growth accelerating across all major regions, especially in the Asia-Pacific regio",738,"Thanks, Alan. Expedia's third quarter results continue to build on what's shaping up to be quite a good year. We saw ongoing strength in our hotel business, with room night growth accelerating across all major regions, especially in the Asia-Pacific regions and Europe. In fact, for the first time in our history, our international points of sale delivered an impressive 50% of our total room nights for the quarter. 
Global room night growth of 27% was faster than Q2 as Brand Expedia's growth continues to accelerate nicely, with Hotels.com and the rest of our brands continuing to grow at very healthy rates and executing well. Our technology projects remain on track, with rapid innovation on Brand Expedia's standalone hotel path and more fundamental changes coming on our standalone air path.
At this point, we can tell you 2 things: one, that we're delivering predictively on our technology road maps; and two, that the Expedia hotels' end-to-end program has been a success. Expedia standalone room nights are growing again at a materially faster pace. What we don't know yet is specifically how we will perform in air and packages, both of which are battling macro headwinds. At this point though, we're optimistic about our team's ability to deliver a great platform and hopefully, sustainable growth as a result.
Separately, we've been really pleased with the new Expedia FIND YOURS advertising campaign, which is much more inspirational than you typically see in the category. Honing in on the transformational nature of travel as told by real-life actors -- real-life travelers, not real-life actors, no characters, no actors, the campaign is extremely powerful. And if you haven't seen any of the ads yet, I'd encourage you to take a look. In fact, a recent viral video of ours, Find Your Understanding, exceeded a record 2 million views in about 1 week.
Last quarter, we introduced you to an innovative new program called Expedia Travelers Preference or ETP. As a reminder, we built a technology that allows us, along with participating hotels, to offer consumers a choice of whether to pay Expedia in advance or pay at the hotel at the time of their stay, which, we believe, meaningfully increases the likelihood that customers will book. While it's very early in the rollout, we're pleased with the progress to date, and we can see already that participating hotels are outperforming hotels who have not yet signed up for the program. Not surprisingly, European customers are favoring Hotel Collect, while U.S. consumers seem to be favoring Expedia Collect.
From an international perspective, we recently signed a new agreement with eLong that improves cooperation between the companies and allows us to bring more of our assets to bear as we compete aggressively in that growing market. According to focus right [ph], the annual travel market in China is close to $100 billion, of which only 13% is online. With eLong's consistent share gains, we believe that we're one of the few global e-commerce companies that have established a significant and lasting position in China, as the Chinese middle class grows and those consumers continue to travel more and increasingly book that travel online.
We continued to make significant progress in mobile. Hotwire just launched its new iPhone app and is now getting about 20% of its hotel transactions through mobile, including tablet. In addition, Hotels.com released an updated version of its app for Android and iPad tablets and now has surpassed the 10 million mobile app download milestone across all mobile platforms. We continue to view mobile as an opportunity to access new market segments as well as potentially drive a higher percentage of our bookings directly to our sites, especially through app downloads.
Lastly, from a macro global economic perspective, the environment doesn't appear to have changed significantly since we spoke to you last quarter. Obviously, we don't know what will happen with the so-called fiscal cliff or the elections in the U.S. and we can't predict the outcome of sovereign debt and other global economic issues. While we do see clear signs of caution surrounding managed corporate travel spend in the U.S., we haven't felt any incremental effects on the rest of our brands. Our focus will continue -- will be to continue executing on our playbook, with a goal of innovating and making continuous improvements across our products and businesses that'll drive growth in all geographies over the long term.

25915843,222838881,370851,"Expedia Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dara. The third quarter came in slightly ahead of our expectations. Hotel revenue grew 20% year-over-year on room night growth of 27%, with domestic room nights up 17% and international growing 38%. Revenue per room night was down 6%, while ave",722,"Thank you, Dara. The third quarter came in slightly ahead of our expectations. Hotel revenue grew 20% year-over-year on room night growth of 27%, with domestic room nights up 17% and international growing 38%. Revenue per room night was down 6%, while average daily room rates were down just under 3%. The decrease in revenue per room night was, again, driven by mix shift, the impact from foreign currency and the loyalty programs. 
We talked to you in the past about the impact of an increasingly larger and fast-growing hotel business in the Asia-Pacific region. In fact, if you exclude the APAC region, as well as foreign currency headwinds, we estimate that revenue per room night would have been flat year-over-year on ADR growth of 2%. Our hotel business represents a large, strategic global growth opportunity, and we will be happy to take volume growth even at lower unit economics to continue to drive the size and scale of this business.
Revenue from our air business represented 7% of total revenue for the quarter and was down 10% year-over-year. Ticket volume grew 11%, largely due to the VIA Travel acquisition, without which tickets would've grown in the low to mid-single digit range. Revenue per ticket was down 19% due primarily to significantly lower net supplier economics arising from new carrier deals negotiated over the course of last year. We think that revenue-per-ticket trends will start to normalize next year after we have lapped most of our newer supplier agreements.
Other revenue, representing 16% of the mix, grew 23% for the quarter on growth in corporate travel fees and advertising revenue. Note that we did benefit in Q3 on the top line from lapping the AirAsia joint venture, which launched in Q3 2011, and had been a headwind until now, as well as the inclusion of VIA Travel in our results.
Running through key expense categories. Cost of revenue grew faster than revenue in the quarter due to the addition of VIA Travel. Excluding that new business, cost of revenue would have levered significantly. As expected, selling and marketing grew faster than revenue due to 3 main factors. Firstly, as we've mentioned on prior calls, as Brand Expedia has been rolling out its platform enhancements, it's been quite conservative in its overall marketing spend. With significant product enhancements now in production, Expedia is becoming increasingly more aggressive in its marketing efforts. 
Secondly, we have also made discrete decisions to increase our marketing investment in APAC and other emerging markets so that we continue to position the business for the excellent long-term growth opportunities we see in those regions. And lastly, as we mentioned last quarter, we did have some delayed spending that moved from Q2 to Q3. Looking ahead to Q4, we continue to expect deleverage in selling and marketing expense.
Technology and content grew 27%, which was actually lighter than we had anticipated. Given a variety of factors, including the addition of VIA Travel, along with some difficult comps for capitalized labor and bonuses, we expect full year tech and content expense to grow at a rate just north of what we saw in Q3. General and administrative expenses grew 8%, primarily on increased personnel costs.
Shifting gears, I also want to mention briefly that our effective tax rate was quite low this quarter, primarily as a result of the release of some previous valuation allowances and, as was the case in last year's third quarter, some adjustments arising from our annual provision to return reconciliation. Lastly, in terms of capital allocation, since our Q2 call, we have repurchased an additional 1.9 million shares, and on a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased 10.7 million shares for $397 million, representing an average price of just over $37 per share. In total, so far this year, we have deployed almost $640 million against a combination of share repurchases, M&A and our dividend.
In terms of our financial expectations for full year 2012, we are now expecting adjusted EBITDA growth to be in the low double-digit range. We are currently in the process of planning for 2013 and as usual, would expect to give some insight on our expectations for next year on our fourth quarter earnings call. 
With that, let's turn to questions. Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question?"

As far as the reason why now, to some extent, we've taken our time in observing the agency model. You know that we acquired Venere a couple of years ago in Europe, where the agency model is strongest, and we have seen the consumer preference, especially Europe -- in Europe, for agency. And I think we've told you for a long time that we are a marketer of hotel rooms. Whether it's merchant hotel rooms or agency transactions, we don't particularly care. We want to market rooms to our global audience in whichever way that they want to consume them. The challenge for us was a pretty significant technology project that would allow us to have the flexibility to allow hotels who signed up for the ETP program to transact either in a merchant model or an agency model. The technology there is not simple. No one really has done it at scale before, and we wanted to do it in a way that could scale on a global basis, and kind of scale global technology projects like this are by no means simple. So to some extent, the timing was driven by the platform and by the technology. And once we thought it was ready, once we had discussions with partners and hotels who are quite interested in it, we thought we were ready to roll out. This comes with -- the model comes with lots of other stuff. Your customer service has to change. Your collections for commissions is completely different for agency versus merchant. So a lot went into this effort, which isn't -- which is really invisible to the customer and invisible to the hotelier, but a lot of work had to go into the back -- kind of the back end in order to make this available on a scale basis. Mark, do you want to talk about the cash flow?"

It will depend on the adoption rates of the hotel collector agency model versus the merchant model. And what we've seen so far is that in -- as Dara mentioned, in the domestic market, we've seen people continue to prefer the merchant model, and outside of the U.S., a preference for the agency model. And we also have a pretty strong -- or pretty large packages business that we hope will become even stronger as we roll out the packages' end-to-end product on Expedia. So again, it's difficult to predict. I would just say that the merchant model, we believe, is going to continue to have a pretty material role for our business going forward. But to the extent that we do shift more to the agency product, of course, that will have a negative impact on our working capital. But of course, we've got a strong balance sheet. We've got significant liquidity. We have been, obviously, working on this, as Dara mentioned, for a long time, and we think this is a great investment to the extent that we have to make an investment of our cash flow and balance sheet to make this possible."

We see more of our traffic across all of our brands coming mobile. The most significant and popular use case for mobile is for last-minute type booking. 60% to 70% of our bookings are for hotels 24 hours out. Mobile is truly a global phenomenon for us. The Expedia Hotels app is -- was downloaded around 5 million times in 220 different countries, so we're building very, very global solutions on the mobile space. In general, our mobile conversion tends to be a little bit lower than our desktop conversion, but that's to be expected. But I think that the delta that you hear with media company monetization between mobile and desktop is not nearly as much of a delta for us. And we think the other benefit of mobile for us is it's a different use case. These are -- we were not highly penetrated in the ""walk-in traffic"" and last-minute type business. This allows us to penetrate into that business and kind of a new market that we hadn't been in previously. I think the other factor that's pretty interesting for us is that tablet behavior is pretty different from iPhone or phone behavior. So when we talk about mobile, we're kind of putting tablet into its own category, and I think the challenge that it gives to us is it creates lots and lots of different form factors that we essentially have to build designs around. So while it is a great kind of a business opportunity to us, we do think that it provides some challenges on the development and the design side. And it's going to be a challenge for everybody."

So there are a few things going on with the room night numbers in Q3. I would say the only one-timer that I would call out was we did lap over the AirAsia joint venture being excluded from our results, which we have been disclosing separately. But that's probably a 200- to 300-bp impact on the room nights. But even with that, when you take that out, you still have an accelerating case. And I would say that one of the big drivers of that is indeed the acceleration of the Expedia business. We have been in a period for a fairly long time where we had all of the businesses, led by Hotels.com, putting in pretty consistent room night growth and really, the big delta here is Brand Expedia. And listen, to parse it out between conversion and marketing, it is a difficult thing to do. Generally, what I'd tell you is that in the variable marketing channels, such as search engine marketing, conversion allows you to drive more volume. It allows you essentially to spend more money on marketing and produce bookings. And if you look at our marketing spend this quarter and, in fact, the acceleration of our marketing spend this quarter and look at the growth rate compared to our merchant gross bookings, you'll see a pretty tight correlation. And that's driven by a combination, really, of great performance of the product, backed up by good marketing spend to drive more growth. In terms of the APAC mix, it is under 10% of gross bookings and revenue, and it's mid to high-teens percent of room nights."

Kind of relating to what Mark talked about, to the extent that you build a better product that can convert better -- and the Hotels.com team has been doing that pretty consistently. The Expedia team is a little newer to it, but is clearly doing it as well. You can then go out in the variable channels, especially where you can get instant reaction with the Googles of the world, with the metasearch players of the world, and you can essentially afford to bid more for a transaction that, call it, the last quarter or last year, you couldn't bid as much for. And you can still make the same amount for that transaction. So it's not an issue of accepting a lower profit margin for that transaction. You can still get a similar efficiency; you can just get a higher position. So we -- what you're seeing with us right now is a shift into some of the more expensive channels because we can afford to pay for some of those expensive channels, when last year we couldn't, rather than call it a macro shift in competitiveness one way or the other. And the other factor that Mark talked about is the timing factor, which is we obviously pay for the marketing cost up front, and we recognize the room stays later. So to the extent that you've got a business that's accelerating, as you see ours is, you might see a heavier marketing load up front before you start recognizing all the revenue."

We've had a great reception from our chain partners, and we're pretty excited to be working with them on this. In terms of the rollout plan, we've got about 3,000 of those hotels actually live right now. It takes some time to actually get them trained up and converted over to the new platform. And we will plan, by the end of the year, to have significantly more live. We have the functionality essentially rolled out on the majority of Hotels.com websites now, either with 100% of traffic or 50-50 in testing. And I would say the same for Expedia. They're a little bit behind in rolling it out just because of the technology. And by the end of the year, we expect to have the functionality live on both Brand Expedia and Hotels.com globally. In terms of the how fast we'll roll out new properties, again, we've kind of got the flexibility here to see some of the trends that we see and accelerate or decelerate. But so far, we like what we see, and we're going to continue to roll out according to our plan. We have not done any special promotion of participating hotels. But we have seen that hotels that are participating are generally getting significantly more volume than those that don't. And really, that's driven by the fact that consumers really like this product. And so they're just more likely to book with those hotels if they've got the choice of versus those that they don't. And the other thing we're seeing is that hotels that participate are -- generally get bookings on average of longer lengths of stay, which is a great result for our hotel partners. More volume, bookings with longer length of stay is a good thing. And then the last thing I would note is that the -- again, it's early, but so far, we're seeing this model be significantly more attractive to consumers outside of the U.S. than it is in the U.S. European consumers really like that, and then we think that'll be a great thing for our hotel partners, driving more international business into the U.S. hotels.

The challenge for us now as we build out technology and as we build out designs for our various sites is to build those designs in an adaptive way.

If they are on an iPad mini, the site also adapts to that iPad mini. It creates more upfront work as far as the kind of design, that you do decisions on what's really important to present on a page versus what's not important to present on a page. In general, our sites are not adaptive at this point, in general. And as we're building out new feature sets, as we're redesigning pages, we'll look to design them in an adaptive way so that they can adapt freely to the various devices that you -- that the user wants to use.

But hopefully, that gives you a little bit of guidance. In terms of trends for room nights for Hotels.com, I would say that the Hotels.com and the rest of the brands, the trend has been pretty consistent. They continue to perform at a healthy level, healthy growth rates. We haven't seen anything materially change in that.

They're a long-term partner and we do a lot of business with Google, and that business, in general, is increasing. The Hotel Finder product hasn't been a significant producer for us. We participate in Hotel Finder, but I think, at this point, Google is doing lots of experimentation. On the air side, initially, when they launched the air product, it hurt our free traffic to our sites. And Google, obviously, has huge market power, and to the extent that they're sending traffic to their own sites, that really hurts any third parties and it hurts kind of the general environment. But over the last quarter, I think that trends haven't changed significantly one way or the other."
