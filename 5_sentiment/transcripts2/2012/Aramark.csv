Here with me today is Fred Sutherland, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Fred and I will present an overview of our first quarter results and business operations, after which there will be an opportunity for phone-in participants to ask questions.
I'd like to remind you that any recording or other use or transmission of this audio may not be done without the prior written consent of ARAMARK. As we discuss the results, you may want to refer to the Form 10-Q we filed earlier today, which contains our first quarter results for fiscal 2012. This Form 10-Q can be found on our website at www.aramark.com.
In today's discussion of results, we mention certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Form 10-Q, as well as schedules we posted to our website earlier today, include reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures as required by SEC rules.
Our discussion of operating income during today's call will, in each instance, exclude the incremental intangibles amortization and property and equipment depreciation expense resulting from the going private transaction and the impact of stock option expense. These items are detailed in the schedules posted to our website before the call. In addition, the prior-year period results have been recasted to present the results of the Galls business as a discontinued operation as we sold it in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
Various remarks that we make in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts, including remarks about future expectations, anticipation, beliefs, estimates, plans and prospects, constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors, MD&A and other sections of our Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q filed earlier today. We disclaim any duty to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future events or otherwise.
Now I'd like to turn the program over to Fred."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2012 results call. I'd like to review our business and operating results and then have Chris cover a few additional details on our performance for this quarter.
Overall, we're pleased with our start in fiscal 2012, which has been consistent with our expectations. While the economic environment remains somewhat uncertain, we remain focused on initiatives and investments that positions ARAMARK for balanced long-term growth and success. Our less cyclical businesses have continued to deliver the positive financial results we saw in 2011. While our more economically sensitive businesses have shown stable performance with pockets of strength.
we continue to manage the impact of higher commodity costs and we believe that our ongoing efforts to drive operating efficiencies will positively support our financial results as we move through fiscal 2012. Our balanced portfolio of sectors, clients and geographies also continues to be a source of strength and stability for us and provides us with the solid growth platform for the future.
Now let me turn it to our consolidated results for the quarter. We achieved sales of $3.4 billion, which was up 4% from the prior-year quarter and up 3% on an organic basis. Growth for the quarter was reduced by about 1 percentage point as a result of the NBA lockout this quarter and the fact that we serve the Asian Games in Shanghai in last year's first quarter.
Operating income, again adjusted to exclude the items that Chris mentioned earlier, increased 3% to $211 million from $200 million in the first quarter. Operating income growth was negatively affected by approximately $4 million of planned acquisition-related transition and integration expenses being absorbed in the quarter relative to Masterplan and Filterfresh. As well as the recognition last year of approximately $8 million of income related to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service, you may remember that we discussed this in the first quarter last year.
Without these 2 particular items, year-over-year growth on a more comparable basis would've been in the high single digits. In our North American Food and Support Services segment, first quarter sales of $2.4 billion were up 6% on a reported basis and up 3% organically but primarily by growth in Higher Education and Healthcare. As I mentioned, segment sales in growth were reduced due to the NBA lockout in the quarter.
our Business & Industry sector reported a high single-digit sales growth in the quarter, reflecting the positive impact of the Filterfresh office coffee services acquisition, which closed in October, as well as solid base business growth in our facility services business and mid single-digit growth in our legacy refreshment services business.
The Education sector had mid single-digit sales growth, led by strong base business growth in the Higher Education food business and the benefit of new business won in the prior year.
In Healthcare sector, sales grew in the high single digits, driven by the acquisition of Masterplan within our Clinical Technology Services business in March of 2011, as well as solid base business growth across the sector.
Our Sports and Entertainment sector had the sales decline at a low single-digit rate and this is primarily due to the impact of the NBA lockout and fewer major league playoff games for us this October versus last year in those stadiums we provide our services.
Now absent these 2 factors, the sector would have shown positive growth in the quarter, supported by solid attendance growth and very good per capita spending at our NFL and NHL venues compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment of $155 million was about flat for the quarter. Strong profit growth and Higher Education and Healthcare was offset by a decline in Business & Industry sector profits by about approximately $4 million of planned transition and integration expenses from the Filterfresh acquisition.
In addition, results for the first quarter of 2011 as I mentioned before included approximately $8 million of other income related to a compensation agreement with the National Park Service, under which they paid down a portion of our possessory interest in one of our concession contracts.
Again, excluding these 2 particular items, the segment would have shown high single-digit profit growth in the quarter.
Now let's turn to the International Food and Support Services segment. First quarter sales of $685 million were up 2% on a reported basis and up 5% organically. Results were led by very strong sales growth in South America and solid growth in Germany and Ireland. China had a reported sales decline in the quarter due to last year's results having benefited as I mentioned before from our serving the Asian Games in Shanghai. Excluding this particular large event, we continued to see excellent sales growth in China, primarily driven by a robust performance in our Healthcare facility services business.
First quarter adjusted operating income was $23.3 million compared to $15.4 million in the prior year, with Germany, South America and the U.K. delivering solid profit growth in the quarter. You may recall that last year's results included expenses related to efficiency and cost reduction initiatives, including severance charges across several of our countries. While a smaller amount of expenses was recorded this year for further cost reduction and efficiency initiatives in the U.K. Without this expenses in both years, the segment would still have shown very good profit growth overall.
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, first quarter sales of $341 million were down 1% from the year-ago quarter on a reported and organic basis. Organic sales growth in Uniform rental was offset by a decline in our direct sales business as a result of certain large customer direct sales programs which were launched in last year's first quarter. We are continuing to invest in additional rental sales personnel resources to support accelerated new sales growth, while maintaining a disciplined approach the contract pricing.
We are gaining improved traction in our new sales efforts. And during the first quarter, we were very pleased with the volume of new sales delivered by our sales force, which significantly exceeded both the prior quarter's results and the prior year's first quarter results. And this was driven both by higher sales headcount and by higher sales rep productivity.
The increased sales cost which include upfront installation costs associated with the substantially higher levels of new business are essentially being offset by the successful efficiency initiatives that we've talked about in previous calls. While higher rates of new sales were continued to the first profit growth over the next few quarters as the ramp up continues, we believe these efforts will lead to both improving rental sales and profit growth as we move through 2012.
Uniform segment adjusted operating income was $40 million, down from $42 million in the year-ago quarter. Profit growth -- profit results in the quarter were reduced by costs including severance expense associated with additional organizational efficiency initiatives, following the successful integration of our rental and direct sales operations. And as we mentioned last quarter, the completion of the Galls divestiture, as well as incremental expense from our investment and growing the sales force and the impact of higher energy costs.
Overall, the segment's profit performance was consistent with our expectations as we ramp up our new sales efforts and continue our operating efficiency initiatives. And as I mentioned, we expect that to reestablish profit growth and increasing sales growth as the new sales start to drop profits to the bottom line.
Corporate expenses adjusted to include items Chris mentioned earlier were $7.1 million in the quarter, compared to $8.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Now at this point, let me turn it back to Chris for some additional details."

I'd like to comment on our capital structure and cash flow. We're pleased that for the trailing 12 months ending December 30, our adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.129 billion, up from $1.10 billion at September 30, 2011, and up from $1.051 billion at December 31, 2010.
Interest and other financing costs were $109 million for the first quarter, just slightly below the prior year's first quarter expense. Approximately 45% of our debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates and our overall weighted average cost of debt at quarter end was approximately 6.3%.
Total reported debt at the end of the quarter was $5.908 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.831 billion which included a term loan balance of $3.288 billion and the revolver balance of $249 million. Our $250 million accounts receivable securitization facility was also fully utilized as of quarter end.
We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position. And as of quarter end, we had approximately $395 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. We are pleased that based on our solid growth and trailing EBITDA compared to the same quarter last year, our secured debt ratio improved further to 3.3x as of December 30 compared to 3.47x in the year-ago quarter.
Consistent with our plan, net capital expenditures for the quarter were $74 million compared to $54 million in the prior-year quarter, reflecting growth in both client-related investments as well as investments in our systems and physical infrastructure to support future growth and efficiencies.
In managing our capital budget, we continue to maintain disciplined approach as we evaluate and invest in our opportunities.
For the full year, we do expect that net capital expenditures would be somewhat higher than prior-year levels. Consistent with our historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash for us during the first quarter and was in line with our expectations. For the full year of fiscal 2012, we anticipate net working capital will be a relatively modest use of cash for us overall.
Finally, we spent $150 million on acquisitions in the first quarter primarily related to the previously mentioned purchase of Filterfresh in October. And we funded these acquisitions through a combination of excess cash and revolver borrowings. Now let me turn the call back to Fred"

Overall, we're pleased with our start to fiscal 2012, which has been consistent with our expectations. As we moved throughout this year, our teams are focused on driving a number of business wide initiatives aimed at delivering improved organic growth and continued margin improvement over time. We believe through these initiatives, we can break greater efficiencies and improve the effectiveness of how we serve our clients and customers and how we generate new sales.
We believe our efforts towards process standardization across our businesses and countries will help drive strong financial performance in the coming years. And finally, despite a persistently uncertain economic environment, we continue to be excited about the growth opportunities that we see across the company. Even though certain businesses and geographies may remain more challenged than others, the diversity of our portfolio provides us with a very good balance to continue to mitigate challenges and to grow ARAMARK.

Again, that's a 50-50 joint venture with Mitsui going back now more than 30 years. The business was down somewhat from the prior year, obviously because of the ongoing impact and the aftermath of the earthquake and the tsunami. It is certainly stable though. It's just that the level of activity in giving some of the conservation requirements that the government has imposed on businesses is just frankly reducing the availability of mealtimes and population in some of the accounts. But the business is stable and generated very solid profits for us in the quarter. And so I don't see that changing as we look out through the rest of this fiscal year, at least. But again, very solid business, it's $1.8 billion business for us on the top line. And again, good balance between Healthcare and business and some good growth in areas like corrections and Sports and Entertainment. Acquisition opportunities, otherwise again, I think Masterplan and Filterfresh were good examples of the kinds of things we're thinking about. We also continue to be focused on continued to broaden and deepen our facility services capability, the acquisition we made in Ireland a couple of years ago I think is a good example of that. And as Fred said, that balance in Ireland actually held us in good stead this quarter with solid growth coming from the facilities business. So things like that in certain countries around the world and in North America are certainly things that fit with what we're looking for strategically. And then in the Uniform business, there's certainly will continue to be over time opportunities likely more regional in nature or local in nature. But as that business has improved and the economy's improved, I would expect that you will over time see some are activity on the Uniform side as well."

In today's discussion of results, we mention certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Form 10-Q, as well as schedules we posted to our website earlier today, include reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, as required by SEC rules.
Our discussion of operating income during today's call will, in each instance, exclude the incremental intangibles amortization and property and equipment depreciation expense resulting from the going private transaction and the impact of stock option expense. These items are detailed in the schedules posted to our website before the call.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2012 results call.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2012 results call. I'd like to review our business and operating results and then have Chris cover a few additional details on our performance for this quarter.
Overall, we're pleased with our start in fiscal 2012, which has been consistent with our expectations. While the economic environment remains somewhat uncertain, we remain focused on initiatives and investments that position ARAMARK for balanced long-term growth and success. Our less cyclical businesses have continued to deliver the positive financial results we saw in 2011, while our more economically sensitive businesses have shown stable performance with pockets of strength.
We continue to manage the impact of higher commodity costs, and we believe that our ongoing efforts to drive operating efficiencies will positively support our financial results as we move through fiscal 2012. Our balanced portfolio of sectors, clients and geographies also continues to be a source of strength and stability for us and provides us with a solid growth platform for the future.
Now let me turn to our consolidated results for the quarter. We achieved sales of $3.4 billion, which was up 4% from the prior year quarter and up 3% on an organic basis. Growth for the quarter was reduced by about 1 percentage point as a result of the NBA lockout this quarter and the fact that we served the Asian Games in Shanghai in last year's first quarter.
Operating income, again adjusted to exclude the items that Chris mentioned earlier, increased 3% to $211 million from $200 million in the first quarter. Operating income growth was negatively affected by approximately $4 million of planned acquisition-related transition and integration expenses being absorbed in the quarter relative to Masterplan and Filterfresh, as well as the recognition last year of approximately $8 million of income related to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service. You may remember that we discussed this in the first quarter call last year. Without these 2 particular items, year-over-year growth on more a comparable basis would have been in the high single digits. 
In our North American Food and Support Services segment, first quarter sales of $2.4 billion were up 6% on a reported basis and up 3% organically, led primarily by growth in Higher Education and Healthcare. As I mentioned, segment sales in growth were reduced due to the NBA lockout in the quarter.
Our Business & Industry sector reported a high single-digit sales growth in the quarter, reflecting the positive impact of the Filterfresh office coffee services acquisition, which closed in October, as well as solid base business growth in our facility services business and mid-single-digit growth in our legacy refreshment services business.
The Education sector had mid-single-digit sales growth, led by strong base business growth in the Higher Education food business and the benefit of new business won in the prior year.
In Healthcare sector, sales grew in the high single digits, driven by the acquisition of Masterplan within our Clinical Technology Services business in March of 2011, as well as solid base business growth across the sector.
Our Sports & Entertainment sector had a sales decline at a low single-digit rate. This is primarily due to the impact of the NBA lockout and fewer major league playoff games for us this October versus last year in those stadiums where we provide our services. Now absent these 2 factors, the sector would have shown positive growth in the quarter supported by solid attendance growth and very good per capita spending at our NFL and NHL venues compared to the prior year. 
Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment of $155 million was about flat for the quarter. Strong profit growth in Higher Education and Healthcare was offset by a decline in Business & Industry sector profits by about approximately $4 million of planned transition and integration expenses from the Filterfresh acquisition.
In addition, results for the first quarter of 2011, as I mentioned before, included approximately $8 million of other income related to a compensation agreement with the National Park Service, under which they paid down a portion of our possessory interest in one of our concession contracts. Again, excluding these 2 particular items, the segment would have shown high single-digit profit growth in the quarter.
Now let's turn to the International Food and Support Services segment. First quarter sales of $685 million were up 2% on a reported basis and up 5% organically. Results were led by very strong sales growth in South America and solid growth in Germany and Ireland. China had a reported sales decline in the quarter due to last year's results having benefited, as I mentioned before, from our serving the Asian Games in Shanghai. Excluding this particular large event, we continued to see excellent sales growth in China, primarily driven by a robust performance in our Healthcare facility services business.
First quarter adjusted operating income was $23.3 million compared to $15.4 million in the prior year with Germany, South America and the U.K. delivering solid profit growth in the quarter. You may recall that last year's results included expenses related to efficiency and cost reduction initiatives, including severance charges across several of our countries, while a smaller amount of expense was recorded this year for further cost reduction and efficiency initiatives in the U.K. Without these expenses in both years, the segment would still have shown very good profit growth overall.
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, first quarter sales of $341 million were down 1% from the year-ago quarter on a reported and organic basis. Organic sales growth in uniform rental was offset by a decline in our direct sales business as a result of certain large customer direct sale programs, which were launched in last year's first quarter. We are continuing to invest in additional rental sales personnel resources to support accelerated new sales growth while maintaining a disciplined approach to contract pricing.
We are gaining improved traction in our new sales efforts. And during the first quarter, we were very pleased with the volume of new sales delivered by our sales force, which significantly exceeded both the prior quarter's results and the prior year's first quarter results. And this was driven both by higher sales headcount and by higher sales rep productivity.
The increased sales cost, which include upfront installation costs associated with the substantially higher levels of new business, are essentially being offset by the successful efficiency initiatives that we've talked about in previous calls. While higher rates of new sales were continued to the first profit growth over the next few quarters as the ramp-up continues, we believe these efforts will lead to both improving rental sales and profit growth as we move through 2012.
Uniform segment adjusted operating income was $40 million, down from $42 million in the year-ago quarter. Profit growth -- profit results in the quarter were reduced by costs, including severance expense associated with additional organizational efficiency initiatives, following the successful integration of our rental and direct sales operations, and as we mentioned last quarter, the completion of the Galls divestiture, as well as incremental expense from our investment and growing the sales force and the impact of higher energy cost.
Overall, the segment's profit performance was consistent with our expectations as we ramp up our new sales efforts and continue our operating efficiency initiatives. And as I mentioned, we expect that to re-establish profit growth and increasing sales growth as the new sales start to drop profits to the bottom line.
Corporate expenses adjusted to include the items Chris mentioned earlier were $7.1 million in the quarter compared to $8.2 million in the year-ago quarter. 
Now at this point, let me turn it back to Chris for some additional details."

I'd like to comment on our capital structure and cash flow. We are pleased that for the trailing 12 months ending December 30, our adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.129 billion, up from $1.10 billion at September 30, 2011, and up from $1.051 billion at December 31, 2010.
Interest and other financing costs were $109 million for the first quarter, just slightly below the prior year's first quarter expense. Approximately 45% of our debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates and our overall weighted average cost of debt at quarter end was approximately 6.3%.
Total reported debt at the end of the quarter was $5.908 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.831 billion, which included a term loan balance of $3.288 billion and a revolver balance of $249 million. Our $250 million accounts receivable securitization facility was also fully utilized as of quarter end.
We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position. And as of quarter end, we had approximately $395 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. We are pleased that based on our solid growth and trailing EBITDA compared to the same quarter last year, our secured debt ratio improved further to 3.3x as of December 30 compared to 3.47x in the year-ago quarter.
Consistent with our plan, net capital expenditures for the quarter were $74 million compared to $54 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting growth in both client-related investments, as well as investments in our systems and physical infrastructure to support future growth and efficiencies.
In managing our capital budget, we continue to maintain a disciplined approach as we evaluate and invest in opportunities.
For the full year, we do expect that net capital expenditures would be somewhat higher than prior year levels. Consistent with the historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash for us during the first quarter and was in line with our expectations. For the full year of fiscal 2012, we anticipate net working capital will be a relatively modest use of cash for us overall.
Finally, we spent $150 million on acquisitions in the first quarter primarily related to the previously mentioned purchase of Filterfresh in October. And we funded these acquisitions with a combination of excess cash and revolver borrowings. 
Now let me turn the call back to Fred."

Overall, we are pleased with our start to fiscal 2012, which has been consistent with our expectations. As we move throughout this year, our teams are focused on driving a number of business-wide initiatives aimed at delivering improved organic growth and continued margin improvement over time. We believe through these initiatives, we can break greater efficiencies and improve effectiveness of how we serve our clients and customers and how we generate new sales.
We believe our efforts towards process standardization across our businesses and countries will help drive strong financial performance in the coming years. And finally, despite a persistently uncertain economic environment, we continue to be excited about the growth opportunities that we see across the company. Even though certain businesses and geographies may remain more challenged than others, the diversity of our portfolio provides us with a very good balance to continue to mitigate challenges and to grow ARAMARK.

Starting with Japan, again, that's a 50-50 joint venture with Mitsui going back now more than 30 years. The business was down somewhat from the prior year, obviously, because of the ongoing impact and the aftermath of the earthquake and the tsunami. It is certainly stable though. It's just that the level of activity in giving some of the conservation requirements that the government has imposed on businesses is just frankly reducing the availability of meal times and the population in some of the accounts. But the business is stable and generated very solid profits for us in the quarter. And so I don't see that changing as we look out through the rest of this fiscal year, at least. But again, very solid business. It's $1.8 billion business for us on the top line. And again, good balance between Healthcare and -- business and some good growth in areas like corrections and Sports & Entertainment. Acquisition opportunities, otherwise, again, I think Masterplan and Filterfresh were good examples of the kinds of things we're thinking about. We also continue to be focused on continuing to broaden and deepen our facility services capability. The acquisition we made in Ireland a couple of years ago, I think, is a good example of that. And as Fred said, that balance in Ireland actually held us in good stead this quarter with solid growth coming from the facilities business. So things like that in certain countries around the world and in North America are certainly things that fit with what we're looking for strategically. And then in the Uniform business, there certainly will continue to be, over time, opportunities, likely more regional in nature or local in nature. But as that business has improved and the economy's improved, I would expect that you will, over time, see some are activity on the Uniform side as well."

And as I mentioned, our retention rates have continued to track with historical levels. So I think there continues to be more opportunity on the new business front, and we're continuing to make investments in new sales resources.

I'd like to remind you that any recording or other use or transmission of this audio may not be done without the prior written consent of ARAMARK. As we discuss the results, you may want to refer to the Form 10-Q we filed earlier today, which contains our first quarter results for fiscal 2012. This Form 10-Q can be found on our website at www.aramark.com.
In today's discussion of results, we mention certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Form 10-Q, as well as schedules we posted to our website earlier today, include reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, as required by SEC rules.
Our discussion of operating income during today's call will, in each instance, exclude the incremental intangibles amortization and property and equipment depreciation expense resulting from the going private transaction and the impact of stock option expense. These items are detailed in the schedules posted to our website before the call. In addition, the prior year period results had been recasted to present the results of the Galls business as a discontinued operation as we sold it in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
Various remarks that we make in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts, including remarks about future expectations, anticipation, beliefs, estimates, plans and prospects, constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors, MD&A and other sections of our Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q filed earlier today. We disclaim any duty to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future events or otherwise.
Now I'd like to turn the program over to Fred."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2012 results call. I'd like to review our business and operating results and then have Chris cover a few additional details on our performance for this quarter.
Overall, we're pleased with our start in fiscal 2012, which has been consistent with our expectations. While the economic environment remains somewhat uncertain, we remain focused on initiatives and investments that position ARAMARK for balanced long-term growth and success. Our less cyclical businesses have continued to deliver the positive financial results we saw in 2011, while our more economically sensitive businesses have shown stable performance with pockets of strength.
We continue to manage the impact of higher commodity costs, and we believe that our ongoing efforts to drive operating efficiencies will positively support our financial results as we move through fiscal 2012. Our balanced portfolio of sectors, clients and geographies also continues to be a source of strength and stability for us and provides us with a solid growth platform for the future.
Now let me turn to our consolidated results for the quarter. We achieved sales of $3.4 billion, which was up 4% from the prior year quarter and up 3% on an organic basis. Growth for the quarter was reduced by about 1 percentage point as a result of the NBA lockout this quarter and the fact that we served the Asian Games in Shanghai in last year's first quarter.
Operating income, again adjusted to exclude the items that Chris mentioned earlier, increased 3% to $211 million from $200 million in the first quarter. Operating income growth was negatively affected by approximately $4 million of planned acquisition-related transition and integration expenses being absorbed in the quarter relative to Masterplan and Filterfresh, as well as the recognition last year of approximately $8 million of income related to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service. You may remember that we discussed this in the first quarter call last year. Without these 2 particular items, year-over-year growth on more a comparable basis would have been in the high single digits. 
In our North American Food and Support Services segment, first quarter sales of $2.4 billion were up 6% on a reported basis and up 3% organically, led primarily by growth in Higher Education and Healthcare. As I mentioned, segment sales in growth were reduced due to the NBA lockout in the quarter.
Our Business & Industry sector reported a high single-digit sales growth in the quarter, reflecting the positive impact of the Filterfresh office coffee services acquisition, which closed in October, as well as solid base business growth in our facility services business and mid-single-digit growth in our legacy refreshment services business.
The Education sector had mid-single-digit sales growth, led by strong base business growth in the Higher Education food business and the benefit of new business won in the prior year.
In Healthcare sector, sales grew in the high single digits, driven by the acquisition of Masterplan within our Clinical Technology Services business in March of 2011, as well as solid base business growth across the sector.
Our Sports & Entertainment sector had a sales decline at a low single-digit rate. This is primarily due to the impact of the NBA lockout and fewer major league playoff games for us this October versus last year in those stadiums where we provide our services. Now absent these 2 factors, the sector would have shown positive growth in the quarter supported by solid attendance growth and very good per capita spending at our NFL and NHL venues compared to the prior year. 
Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment of $155 million was about flat for the quarter. Strong profit growth in Higher Education and Healthcare was offset by a decline in Business & Industry sector profits by about approximately $4 million of planned transition and integration expenses from the Filterfresh acquisition.
In addition, results for the first quarter of 2011, as I mentioned before, included approximately $8 million of other income related to a compensation agreement with the National Park Service, under which they paid down a portion of our possessory interest in one of our concession contracts. Again, excluding these 2 particular items, the segment would have shown high single-digit profit growth in the quarter.
Now let's turn to the International Food and Support Services segment. First quarter sales of $685 million were up 2% on a reported basis and up 5% organically. Results were led by very strong sales growth in South America and solid growth in Germany and Ireland. China had a reported sales decline in the quarter due to last year's results having benefited, as I mentioned before, from our serving the Asian Games in Shanghai. Excluding this particular large event, we continued to see excellent sales growth in China, primarily driven by a robust performance in our Healthcare facility services business.
First quarter adjusted operating income was $23.3 million compared to $15.4 million in the prior year with Germany, South America and the U.K. delivering solid profit growth in the quarter. You may recall that last year's results included expenses related to efficiency and cost reduction initiatives, including severance charges across several of our countries, while a smaller amount of expense was recorded this year for further cost reduction and efficiency initiatives in the U.K. Without these expenses in both years, the segment would still have shown very good profit growth overall.
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, first quarter sales of $341 million were down 1% from the year-ago quarter on a reported and organic basis. Organic sales growth in uniform rental was offset by a decline in our direct sales business as a result of certain large customer direct sale programs, which were launched in last year's first quarter. We are continuing to invest in additional rental sales personnel resources to support accelerated new sales growth while maintaining a disciplined approach to contract pricing.
We are gaining improved traction in our new sales efforts. And during the first quarter, we were very pleased with the volume of new sales delivered by our sales force, which significantly exceeded both the prior quarter's results and the prior year's first quarter results. And this was driven both by higher sales headcount and by higher sales rep productivity.
The increased sales cost, which include upfront installation costs associated with the substantially higher levels of new business, are essentially being offset by the successful efficiency initiatives that we've talked about in previous calls. While higher rates of new sales will continued to press profit growth over the next few quarters as the ramp-up continues, we believe these efforts will lead to both improving rental sales and profit growth as we move through 2012.
Uniform segment adjusted operating income was $40 million, down from $42 million in the year-ago quarter. Profit growth -- profit results in the quarter were reduced by costs, including severance expense associated with additional organizational efficiency initiatives, following the successful integration of our rental and direct sales operations, and as we mentioned last quarter, the completion of the Galls divestiture, as well as incremental expense from our investment and growing the sales force and the impact of higher energy cost.
Overall, the segment's profit performance was consistent with our expectations as we ramp up our new sales efforts and continue our operating efficiency initiatives. And as I mentioned, we expect to re-establish profit growth and increasing sales growth as the new sales start to drop profits to the bottom line.
Corporate expenses adjusted to include the items Chris mentioned earlier were $7.1 million in the quarter compared to $8.2 million in the year-ago quarter. 
Now at this point, let me turn it back to Chris for some additional details."

Interest and other financing costs were $109 million for the first quarter, just slightly below the prior year's first quarter expense. Approximately 45% of our debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates and our overall weighted average cost of debt at quarter end was approximately 6.3%.
Total reported debt at the end of the quarter was $5.908 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.831 billion, which included a term loan balance of $3.288 billion and a revolver balance of $249 million. Our $250 million accounts receivable securitization facility was also fully utilized as of quarter end.
We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position. And as of quarter end, we had approximately $395 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. We are pleased that based on our solid growth and trailing EBITDA compared to the same quarter last year, our secured debt ratio improved further to 3.3x as of December 30 compared to 3.47x in the year-ago quarter.
Consistent with our plan, net capital expenditures for the quarter were $74 million compared to $54 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting growth in both client-related investments, as well as investments in our systems and physical infrastructure to support future growth and efficiencies.
In managing our capital budget, we continue to maintain a disciplined approach as we evaluate and invest in opportunities.
For the full year, we do expect that net capital expenditures would be somewhat higher than prior year levels. Consistent with the historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash for us during the first quarter and was in line with our expectations. For the full year of fiscal 2012, we anticipate that working capital will be a relatively modest use of cash for us overall.
Finally, we spent $150 million on acquisitions in the first quarter primarily related to the previously mentioned purchase of Filterfresh in October. And we funded these acquisitions with a combination of excess cash and revolver borrowings. 
Now let me turn the call back to Fred."

Starting with Japan, again, that's a 50-50 joint venture with Mitsui going back now more than 30 years. The business was down somewhat from the prior year, obviously, because of the ongoing impact and the aftermath of the earthquake and the tsunami. It is certainly stable though. It's just that the level of activity in giving some of the conservation requirements that the government has imposed on businesses is just frankly reducing the availability of meal times and the populations in some of the accounts. But the business is stable and generated very solid profits for us in the quarter. And so I don't see that changing as we look out through the rest of this fiscal year, at least. But again, very solid business. It's $1.8 billion business for us on the top line. And again, good balance between Healthcare and -- business and some good growth in areas like corrections and Sports & Entertainment. Acquisition opportunities, otherwise, again, I think Masterplan and Filterfresh were good examples of the kinds of things we're thinking about. We also continue to be focused on continuing to broaden and deepen our facility services capability. The acquisition we made in Ireland a couple of years ago, I think, is a good example of that. And as Fred said, that balance in Ireland actually held us in good stead this quarter with solid growth coming from the facilities business. So things like that in certain countries around the world and in North America are certainly things that fit with what we're looking for strategically. And then in the Uniform business, there certainly will continue to be, over time, opportunities, likely more regional in nature or local in nature. But as that business has improved and the economy's improved, I would expect that you will, over time, see some are activity on the Uniform side as well."

Here with me today is Fred Sutherland, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Fred and I will present an overview of our first quarter results and business operations, after which there will be an opportunity for phone-in participants to ask questions.
I'd like to remind you that any recording or other use or transmission of this audio may not be done without the prior written consent of ARAMARK. As we discuss the results, you may want to refer to the Form 10-Q we filed earlier today, which contains our first quarter results for fiscal 2012. This Form 10-Q can be found on our website at www.aramark.com.
In today's discussion of results, we mention certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Form 10-Q, as well as schedules we posted to our website earlier today, include reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, as required by SEC rules.
Our discussion of operating income during today's call will, in each instance, exclude the incremental intangibles amortization and property and equipment depreciation expense resulting from the going private transaction and the impact of stock option expense. These items are detailed in the schedules posted to our website before the call. In addition, the prior year period results had been recasted to present the results of the Galls business as a discontinued operation as we sold it in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
Various remarks that we make in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts, including remarks about future expectations, anticipation, beliefs, estimates, plans and prospects, constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors, MD&A and other sections of our Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q filed earlier today. We disclaim any duty to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future events or otherwise.
Now I'd like to turn the program over to Fred."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2012 results call. I'd like to review our business and operating results and then have Chris cover a few additional details on our performance for this quarter.
Overall, we're pleased with our start in fiscal 2012, which has been consistent with our expectations. While the economic environment remains somewhat uncertain, we remain focused on initiatives and investments that position ARAMARK for balanced long-term growth and success. Our less cyclical businesses have continued to deliver the positive financial results we saw in 2011, while our more economically sensitive businesses have shown stable performance with pockets of strength.
We continue to manage the impact of higher commodity costs, and we believe that our ongoing efforts to drive operating efficiencies will positively support our financial results as we move through fiscal 2012. Our balanced portfolio of sectors, clients and geographies also continues to be a source of strength and stability for us and provides us with a solid growth platform for the future.
Now let me turn to our consolidated results for the quarter. We achieved sales of $3.4 billion, which was up 4% from the prior year quarter and up 3% on an organic basis. Growth for the quarter was reduced by about 1 percentage point as a result of the NBA lockout this quarter and the fact that we served the Asian Games in Shanghai in last year's first quarter.
Operating income, again adjusted to exclude the items that Chris mentioned earlier, increased 3% to $211 million from $200 million in the first quarter. Operating income growth was negatively affected by approximately $4 million of planned acquisition-related transition and integration expenses being absorbed in the quarter relative to Masterplan and Filterfresh, as well as the recognition last year of approximately $8 million of income related to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service. You may remember that we discussed this in the first quarter call last year. Without these 2 particular items, year-over-year growth on more a comparable basis would have been in the high single digits. 
In our North American Food and Support Services segment, first quarter sales of $2.4 billion were up 6% on a reported basis and up 3% organically, led primarily by growth in Higher Education and Healthcare. As I mentioned, segment sales in growth were reduced due to the NBA lockout in the quarter.
Our Business & Industry sector reported a high single-digit sales growth in the quarter, reflecting the positive impact of the Filterfresh office coffee services acquisition, which closed in October, as well as solid base business growth in our facility services business and mid-single-digit growth in our legacy refreshment services business.
The Education sector had mid-single-digit sales growth, led by strong base business growth in the Higher Education food business and the benefit of new business won in the prior year.
In Healthcare sector, sales grew in the high single digits, driven by the acquisition of Masterplan within our Clinical Technology Services business in March of 2011, as well as solid base business growth across the sector.
Our Sports & Entertainment sector had a sales decline at a low single-digit rate. This is primarily due to the impact of the NBA lockout and fewer major league playoff games for us this October versus last year in those stadiums where we provide our services. Now absent these 2 factors, the sector would have shown positive growth in the quarter supported by solid attendance growth and very good per capita spending at our NFL and NHL venues compared to the prior year. 
Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment of $155 million was about flat for the quarter. Strong profit growth in Higher Education and Healthcare was offset by a decline in Business & Industry sector profits by about approximately $4 million of planned transition and integration expenses from the Filterfresh acquisition.
In addition, results for the first quarter of 2011, as I mentioned before, included approximately $8 million of other income related to a compensation agreement with the National Park Service, under which they paid down a portion of our possessory interest in one of our concession contracts. Again, excluding these 2 particular items, the segment would have shown high single-digit profit growth in the quarter.
Now let's turn to the International Food and Support Services segment. First quarter sales of $685 million were up 2% on a reported basis and up 5% organically. Results were led by very strong sales growth in South America and solid growth in Germany and Ireland. China had a reported sales decline in the quarter due to last year's results having benefited, as I mentioned before, from our serving the Asian Games in Shanghai. Excluding this particular large event, we continued to see excellent sales growth in China, primarily driven by a robust performance in our Healthcare facility services business.
First quarter adjusted operating income was $23.3 million compared to $15.4 million in the prior year with Germany, South America and the U.K. delivering solid profit growth in the quarter. You may recall that last year's results included expenses related to efficiency and cost reduction initiatives, including severance charges across several of our countries, while a smaller amount of expense was recorded this year for further cost reduction and efficiency initiatives in the U.K. Without these expenses in both years, the segment would still have shown very good profit growth overall.
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, first quarter sales of $341 million were down 1% from the year-ago quarter on a reported and organic basis. Organic sales growth in uniform rental was offset by a decline in our direct sales business as a result of certain large customer direct sale programs, which were launched in last year's first quarter. We are continuing to invest in additional rental sales personnel resources to support accelerated new sales growth while maintaining a disciplined approach to contract pricing.
We are gaining improved traction in our new sales efforts. And during the first quarter, we were very pleased with the volume of new sales delivered by our sales force, which significantly exceeded both the prior quarter's results and the prior year's first quarter results. And this was driven both by higher sales headcount and by higher sales rep productivity.
The increased sales cost, which include upfront installation costs associated with the substantially higher levels of new business, are essentially being offset by the successful efficiency initiatives that we've talked about in previous calls. While higher rates of new sales will continued to press profit growth over the next few quarters as the ramp-up continues, we believe these efforts will lead to both improving rental sales and profit growth as we move through 2012.
Uniform segment adjusted operating income was $40 million, down from $42 million in the year-ago quarter. Profit growth -- profit results in the quarter were reduced by costs, including severance expense associated with additional organizational efficiency initiatives, following the successful integration of our rental and direct sales operations, and as we mentioned last quarter, the completion of the Galls divestiture, as well as incremental expense from our investment and growing the sales force and the impact of higher energy cost.
Overall, the segment's profit performance was consistent with our expectations as we ramp up our new sales efforts and continue our operating efficiency initiatives. And as I mentioned, we expect to re-establish profit growth and increasing sales growth as the new sales start to drop profits to the bottom line.
Corporate expenses adjusted to include the items Chris mentioned earlier were $7.1 million in the quarter compared to $8.2 million in the year-ago quarter. 
Now at this point, let me turn it back to Chris for some additional details."

I'd like to comment on our capital structure and cash flow. We are pleased that for the trailing 12 months ending December 30, our adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.129 billion, up from $1.10 billion at September 30, 2011, and up from $1.051 billion at December 31, 2010.
Interest and other financing costs were $109 million for the first quarter, just slightly below the prior year's first quarter expense. Approximately 45% of our debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates and our overall weighted average cost of debt at quarter end was approximately 6.3%.
Total reported debt at the end of the quarter was $5.908 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.831 billion, which included a term loan balance of $3.288 billion and a revolver balance of $249 million. Our $250 million accounts receivable securitization facility was also fully utilized as of quarter end.
We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position. And as of quarter end, we had approximately $395 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. We are pleased that based on our solid growth and trailing EBITDA compared to the same quarter last year, our secured debt ratio improved further to 3.3x as of December 30 compared to 3.47x in the year-ago quarter.
Consistent with our plan, net capital expenditures for the quarter were $74 million compared to $54 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting growth in both client-related investments, as well as investments in our systems and physical infrastructure to support future growth and efficiencies.
In managing our capital budget, we continue to maintain a disciplined approach as we evaluate and invest in opportunities.
For the full year, we do expect that net capital expenditures would be somewhat higher than prior year levels. Consistent with the historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash for us during the first quarter and was in line with our expectations. For the full year of fiscal 2012, we anticipate that working capital will be a relatively modest use of cash for us overall.
Finally, we spent $150 million on acquisitions in the first quarter primarily related to the previously mentioned purchase of Filterfresh in October. And we funded these acquisitions with a combination of excess cash and revolver borrowings. 
Now let me turn the call back to Fred."

Overall, we are pleased with our start to fiscal 2012, which has been consistent with our expectations.

We believe through these initiatives, we can break greater efficiencies and improved effectiveness of how we serve our clients and customers and how we generate new sales.
We believe our efforts towards process standardization across our businesses and countries will help drive strong financial performance in the coming years. And finally, despite a persistently uncertain economic environment, we continue to be excited about the growth opportunities that we see across the company. Even though certain businesses and geographies may remain more challenged than others, the diversity of our portfolio provides us with a very good balance to continue to mitigate challenges and to grow ARAMARK.

Starting with Japan, again, that's a 50-50 joint venture with Mitsui going back now more than 30 years. The business was down somewhat from the prior year, obviously, because of the ongoing impact and the aftermath of the earthquake and the tsunami. It is certainly stable though. It's just that the level of activity in giving some of the conservation requirements that the government has imposed on businesses is just frankly reducing the availability of meal times and the populations in some of the accounts. But the business is stable and generated very solid profits for us in the quarter. And so I don't see that changing as we look out through the rest of this fiscal year, at least. But again, very solid business. It's $1.8 billion business for us on the top line. And again, good balance between Healthcare and -- business and some good growth in areas like corrections and Sports & Entertainment. Acquisition opportunities, otherwise, again, I think Masterplan and Filterfresh were good examples of the kinds of things we're thinking about. We also continue to be focused on continuing to broaden and deepen our facility services capability. The acquisition we made in Ireland a couple of years ago, I think, is a good example of that. And as Fred said, that balance in Ireland actually held us in good stead this quarter with solid growth coming from the facilities business. So things like that in certain countries around the world and in North America are certainly things that fit with what we're looking for strategically. And then in the Uniform business, there certainly will continue to be, over time, opportunities, likely more regional in nature or local in nature. But as that business has improved and the economy's improved, I would expect that you will, over time, see some are activity on the Uniform side as well."

I'd like to review our business and operating results and then have Chris cover a few additional details on our performance.I'm pleased to report results for our seco",1638,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2012 results call. I'd like to review our business and operating results and then have Chris cover a few additional details on our performance.
I'm pleased to report results for our second fiscal quarter that further extends this trend of solid operating performance that we have seen in recent quarters. While the economic environment remains a bit uncertain, we believe that our focus on initiatives and investments that position ARAMARK for long-term growth contributed to our strong results for the quarter of continuing to build a solid foundation for the future.
Overall, our performance in the quarter was balanced as our less cyclical businesses delivered another quarter of solid results, and our more economically sensitive businesses continued to show signs of improvement. While higher commodity cost remained a headwind for us for the quarter, the impact on a year-over-year basis has been moderating. Our ongoing efforts to improve our operating efficiencies continue to allow us to leverage our top line sales growth into solid performance earnings performance.
Now turning to our overall results for the second quarter. We reported sales of $3.3 billion, up 4% on a reported basis and an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $177 million was up 8% from the prior year level. For the first half of 2012, sales grew by 4% to $6.8 billion or up 3% organically. As we discussed in our first quarter results, sales in the half was reduced somewhat by the impact of the first quarter -- in the first quarter of the NBA lockout and by our serving of the Asian Games in last year's first quarter. The first half adjusted operating income increased by 5% to $388 million. Also, as we discussed last quarter, operating income growth was negatively affected by approximately $4 million planned acquisition-related transition and integration expenses that were absorbed in the first quarter, as well as the recognition last year of approximately $8 million of income related to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service, under which they paid down a portion of our possessory interest in one of our concession contracts. And without these 2 particular items, year-over-year profit growth for the first half would've been in the high single digits.
In our North American food and support service services segment, second quarter sales of $2.3 million were up 6% on a reported basis and 4% on an organic basis and primarily by strong growth in our Higher Education business and health care and S&E sectors. The first half reported sales of $4.7 billion were up 6% versus the prior year and up 4% organically. Overall sales performance for the first half was led by solid growth in higher education and health care.
The Business & Industry sector reported a mid single-digit sales increase in the quarter. The single-digit increase for the half, reflecting the positive impact from the Filterfresh Office Coffee Services acquisition, which closed in October 2011. The sector also benefited from solid-based and new business growth in our new Facilities Services Business and our Refreshment Services business. 
Sales in our Education sector were up mid-single digits for the quarter and for the year-to-date, led primarily by continued strong base and new business growth in our higher education food business, as well as solid growth in our K-12 food business.
In the Healthcare sector, sales grew in the high single digits for the quarter and for the year-to-date, due primarily by the acquisition of Masterplan within our health care technologies business in March 2011, as well as solid base business growth. Sports & Entertainment sales grew in the mid-single digits in the quarter led by solid attendance and positive per capita spending trends in both our NHL and NBA venues. For the year-to-date, sales growth was limited to the low single digits, as a result as I mentioned of the NBA lockout during the first quarter, as well as the impact of fewer major league baseball playoff games in October, versus last year in those regions where we provide our services.
Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment was up 11% in the quarter to $130 million. Nearly all segments contributed to profit growth in the quarter, led by strong contributions from higher education and health care. In the first half, segment adjusted operating income grew by 4% to $285 million.
Previously noted, results in the first quarter were negatively affected by approximately $4 million of planned transition and integration expenses for the Filterfresh acquisition. In addition, results for the first quarter of 2011 included approximately eight $8 million of other income related to the compensation agreement with the National Park Service as I mentioned earlier. Including these 2 particular items, growth for the first half would've been in the high single digits.
Turning to the international Food and Support Services segment. Second quarter reported sales of $672 million were down slightly on a reported basis but up 4% organically versus the year-ago quarter. Organic growth in the quarter was led by strong performance in Germany, South America and China. For the first half, reported sales in international were up 1% and up 5% organically. The first half sales growth also was driven by strong results in Germany, Spain, South America and also Ireland.
Second quarter adjusted operating income for international of $25 million was up 10% versus the prior year. Results in the second quarter of 2011, you may recall, benefited from a gain from the sale of a small noncore subsidiary in Chile and the receipt of the AT income in the U.K, partially offset by severance charges in Chile related to the divestiture and a write-down of goodwill in India. Excluding these items from the prior year, profit growth would've been even stronger in the quarter, led by solid performance in Germany, Spain and Chile, partially offset by profit decline in our AIM joint venture in Japan. The first half adjusted operating income was $48 million, up from $38 million in the prior year. 
In addition to the items I just mentioned, 2011 results also included expenses related to efficiency and cost reduction initiatives including severance charges across several of our countries in the first quarter of 2011. While smaller amount of expenses recorded in the first half of 2012 further caused reduction in efficiency.
Excluding these expenses in both years, the segment would've still experienced strong income growth in the first half. 
In our Uniform and Career Apparel business, second quarter sales of $337 million were up 2% on a reported and organic basis. Improving organic growth rates in the uniform rental business for the quarter were offset by softness in direct sales, partly reflecting large customer direct sale programs that were launched in the first half of 2011 and that has not been repeated in 2012. For the year-to-date, sales of $678 million were about flat as compared to the same period in the prior year on both an as reported and organic basis. We're continuing to invest in additional rental sales personnel resources to support accelerated sales growth, while maintaining a disciplined approach to contract pricing. We are gaining improved traction in our new sales efforts. During the second quarter and in the first half, volume of new sales delivered by our sales force significantly exceeded the prior year's results, driven both by higher sales force headcount and higher sales rep productivity.
The increased cost, including installation costs associated with substantially higher levels of new business are largely being offset by the successful efficiency initiatives that we have discussed in previous calls. A higher cost related to the increased rates of new sales will continue to repress profit growth over the next few quarters. We believe these efforts will lead to both improving rental sales and profit growth as we move through 2012 and into 2013.
The segment's second quarter adjusted operating income was $30.3 million, down from $32.7 million the prior quarter, primarily reflecting the incremental expense from our investment in growing sales force garment and isolation cost from the acceleration of the business and the impact of higher energy costs.
In the first half, adjusted operating income was $70 million, down from $74.8 million in the prior year's first half, reflecting all of the items that I just mentioned, as well as severance expense incurred in the first quarter associated with some additional organizational efficiency initiatives following the successful integration of our rental and direct sales operations and the completion of the Galls divestiture.
Corporate expenses, excluding the items Chris mentioned earlier, were $7.5 million in the quarter compared to $8.2 million in the year-ago quarter. First half expenses were $14.6 million compared to $16.5 million in the prior year.
Finally, on a personal note, I'd like to thank Chris Holland for his 8 years of dedicated service as a key member of our finance team. While we all hate to see him go, we recognize the terrific opportunity to be CFO of a very highly respected Fortune 500 company, particularly one located in the same geographical area. It's just too good an opportunity to turn down. We at ARAMARK share in his success. We feel that Chris represented very good, solid raw material when we brought him here and he was trained well, and so we're very proud of him. We're also pleased to elevate Karen Wallace to VP and Treasure. I know many of you in the call know Karen. Karen's worked side-by-side with Chris for the last 7 years on all of our financing. She's well-positioned to fill some pretty big shoes that were worn by Chris. At this point, let me turn it back over to Chris for some additional details on the quarter and on the half."

I greatly appreciate it. I'd like to now spend a few minutes on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending March 30 was $1.136 billion, up from $1.129 bill",553,"Thanks very much, Fred, for that comment. I greatly appreciate it. I'd like to now spend a few minutes on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending March 30 was $1.136 billion, up from $1.129 billion at December 30, 2011, and up from $1.1 billion even at September 30, 2011. Interest and other financing costs were $119 million for the second quarter compared to $93 million in the prior year. Results for the quarter included approximately $11 million of expenses related to the term loan extension we completed in March. We are very appreciative of the broad support that the extension transaction received from many of you, our investors, and we believe that the success of the extension further enhances our financial and capital structure flexibility.
Also contributing to the year-over-year variance was the recognition in the second quarter of 2011 of interest income of approximately $14 million related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims in prior years. In the first half, interest and other financing costs were $227 million compared to $202 million in the prior-year, primarily reflecting the 2 items just mentioned. Including the impact of interest rate hedges, approximately 50% of our debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates, and our overall weighted average cost of debt is approximately 5.2%.
Total reported debt at the end of the second quarter was $5.817 billion as compared to $5.739 billion at the end of last year's second quarter. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.733 billion, including the term loan balance of $3.291 billion and a revolver balance of $173 million. Our accounts receivable securitization facility had $224 million utilized at the quarter's end.
We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position overall and at quarter end, had approximately $473 million of available borrowing capacity under our $665 million revolving credit facility and $101 million of balance sheet cash. Based on a trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio improved to 3.22x as of March 30 as compared to 3.33x as of December 30, 2011, and also 3.33x as of April 1, 2011.
Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $71 million compared to $66 million in the prior-year quarter. For the year-to-date, net capital expenditures totaled $145 million, up from $120 million last year as we make appropriate and prudent investments in our physical system and infrastructure and in support of growth. As expected and consistent with historical patterns, working capital was the use of cash flows during the first half of our fiscal year. While some reinvestment in working capital is required in certain sectors and countries in particular improved levels of sales growth, we will continue to maintain a sharp focus on working capital management as we move through the balance of fiscal 2012. For the year-to-date, we've spend a total of $150 million on acquisitions compared to $155 million in the prior-year period. This year's spending, as you know, relates primarily to the acquisition of Filterfresh on the first day of the fiscal year. We do continue to evaluate strategic investment opportunities in certain sectors and geographies, and as we do so, we'll maintain a prudent and disciplined approach in pursuit of these opportunities. Now let me turn the call over to Joe Neubauer."

As you heard from Fred and Chris, we're coming off a very solid quarter and truly gaining both top line and bottom line momentum in our businesses. A systematic focus on growth and our key operational processes is beginning to pay off and we look for study and continuing progress over the next several years. In the way of transition, I'm sure you've all heard aware by now that after nearly 30 years of CEO of ARAMARK, I'll be turning these responsibilities over, actually, I have turned them over, to Eric Foss. I will remain as Chairman involved in the business and clearly continue to be a significant investor in Aramark as I have been since our original going private transaction way back in 1984. Eric is an outstanding leader with a solid track record of performance in global enterprises. Most recently, Eric was CEO of Pepsi Beverages Company, a $20 billion division of PepsiCo with over 80,000 employees operating in various countries, a private acquisition of Pepsi Bottling Group by PepsiCo. This was one of the 2 acquisitions that they had eight of the bottling business, Eric was the Chairman and CEO of the larger one, Pepsi Bottling Group, an independent publicly owned company with revenues of about $13 billion and operating in about 25 countries.
I'm very proud of the solid management team that we have built here at ARAMARK. Under Eric's leadership, along with Fred and Lynn Mckey, our EVP of Human Resources and the rest of our talented executive team, I'm sure I'm certain that ARAMARK will continue to achieved very high levels of success. I want to personally thank you for your continued support of ARAMARK and assure you that our team will continue to work diligently to earn your confidence and to make this great company even more successful.

I'd like to review our business and operating results and then have Chris cover a few additional details on our performance.I'm pleased to report results for our seco",1643,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2012 results call. I'd like to review our business and operating results and then have Chris cover a few additional details on our performance.
I'm pleased to report results for our second fiscal quarter that further extends this trend of solid operating performance that we have seen in recent quarters. While the economic environment remains a bit uncertain, we believe that our focus on initiatives and investments that position ARAMARK for long-term growth contributed to our strong results for the quarter, continuing to build a solid foundation for the future.
Overall, our performance in the quarter was balanced as our less cyclical businesses delivered another quarter of solid results and our more economically-sensitive businesses continued to show signs of improvement. While higher commodity cost remained a headwind for us in the quarter, the impact on a year-over-year basis has been moderating. Our ongoing efforts to improve our operating efficiencies continue to allow us to leverage our top line sales growth into solid earnings performance.
Now turning to our overall results for the second quarter. We reported sales of $3.3 billion, up 4% on a reported basis and an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $177 million was up 8% from the prior year level. For the first half of 2012, sales grew by 4% to $6.8 billion or up 3% organically. As we discussed in our first quarter results, sales in the half was reduced somewhat by the impact of the first quarter -- in the first quarter of the NBA lockout and by our serving of the Asian Games in last year's first quarter. The first half adjusted operating income increased by 5% to $388 million. Also, as we discussed last quarter, operating income growth was negatively affected by approximately $4 million planned acquisition-related transition and integration expenses that were absorbed in the first quarter, as well as the recognition last year of approximately $8 million of income related to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service, under which, they paid down a portion of our possessory interest in one of our concession contracts. Without these 2 particular items, year-over-year profit growth for the first half would have been in the high single digits.
In our North American Food and Support Services segment, second quarter sales of $2.3 million were up 6% on a reported basis and 4% on an organic basis and primarily by strong growth in our Higher Education business and Health Care and S&E sectors. The first half reported sales of $4.7 billion were up 6% versus the prior year and up 4% organically. Overall sales performance for the first half was led by solid growth in Higher Education and Health Care.
The Business & Industry sector reported a mid single-digit sales increase in the quarter, a single-digit sales increase for the half, reflecting the positive impact from the Filterfresh Office Coffee Services acquisition, which closed in October 2011. The sector also benefited from solid-based and new business growth in our new Facilities Services Business and in our Refreshment Services business. 
Sales in our Education sector were up mid-single digits for the quarter and for the year-to-date, led primarily by continued strong base and new business growth in our Higher Education Food business, as well as solid growth in our K-12 food business.
In the Healthcare sector, sales grew in the high single digits for the quarter and for the year-to-date, driven primarily by the acquisition of Masterplan within our Health Care Technologies business in March 2011, as well as solid base business growth. Sports & Entertainment sales grew in the mid-single digits in the quarter led by solid attendance and positive per capita spending trends in both our NHL and NBA venues. For the year-to-date, sales growth was limited to the low single digits, as a result as I mentioned, of the NBA lockout during the first quarter, as well as the impact of fewer major league baseball playoff games in October versus last year in those stadiums where we provide our services.
Adjusted operating income in the North America Food and Support Services segment was up 11% in the quarter to $130 million. Nearly all segments contributed to profit growth in the quarter, led by strong contributions from higher education and health care. In the first half, segment adjusted operating income grew by 4% to $285 million.
Previously noted, results in the first quarter were negatively affected by approximately $4 million of planned transition and integration expenses for the Filterfresh acquisition. In addition, results for the first quarter of 2011 included approximately eight $8 million of other income related to the compensation agreement with the National Park Service as I mentioned earlier. Excluding these 2 particular items, growth for the first half would've been in the high single digits.
Turning to the International Food and Support Services segment, second quarter reported sales of $672 million were down slightly on a reported basis but up 4% organically versus the year-ago quarter. Organic growth in the quarter was led by strong performance in Germany, South America and China. For the first half, reported sales in International were up 1% and up 5% organically. The first half sales growth also was driven by strong results in Germany, Spain, South America and also, Ireland.
Second quarter adjusted operating income for International of $25 million was up 10% versus the prior year. Results in the second quarter of 2011, you may recall, benefited from a gain from the sale of a small non-core subsidiary in Chile and the receipt of the VAT income in the U.K., partially offset by severance charges in Chile related to the divestiture and a write-down of goodwill in India. Excluding these items from the prior year, profit growth would've been even stronger in the quarter, led by solid performance in Germany, Spain and Chile, partially offset by a profit decline in our AIM joint venture in Japan. The first half adjusted operating income was $48 million, up from $38 million in the prior year. 
In addition to the items I just mentioned, 2011 results also included expenses related to efficiency and cost reduction initiatives including severance charges across several of our countries in the first quarter of 2011 while a smaller amount of expense was recorded in the first half of 2012 further caused reduction and efficiency.
Excluding these expenses in both years, the segment would've still experienced strong income growth in the first half. 
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, second quarter sales of $337 million were up 2% on a reported and organic basis. Improving organic growth rates in the Uniform Rental business for the quarter were offset by softness in direct sales, partly reflecting large customer direct sale programs that were launched in the first half of 2011 and that has not been repeated in 2012. For the year-to-date, sales of $678 million were about flat as compared to the same period as in the prior year on both as reported and organic basis. We're continuing to invest in additional rental sales personnel resources to support accelerated sales growth, while maintaining a disciplined approach to contract pricing. We are gaining improved traction in our new sales efforts. During the second quarter and in the first half, volume of new sales delivered by our sales force significantly exceeded the prior year's results, driven both by higher sales force headcount and higher sales rep productivity.
The increased cost, including installation costs associated with substantially higher levels of new business are largely being offset by the successful efficiency initiatives that we have discussed in previous calls. A higher cost related to the increased rates of new sales will continue to depress profit growth over the next few quarters. We believe these efforts will lead to both improving rental sales and profit growth as we move through 2012 and into 2013.
The segment's second quarter adjusted operating income was $30.3 million, down from $32.7 million the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting the incremental expense from our investment in growing the sales force, our garment and isolation cost from the acceleration of new business and the impact of higher energy costs.
In the first half, adjusted operating income was $70 million, down from $74.8 million in the prior year's first half, reflecting all of the items that I just mentioned, as well as severance expense incurred in the first quarter associated with some additional organizational efficiency initiatives following the successful integration of our rental and direct sales operations and the completion of the Galls divestiture.
Corporate expenses, excluding the items Chris mentioned earlier, were $7.5 million in the quarter compared to $8.2 million in the year-ago quarter. First half expenses were $14.6 million compared to $16.5 million in the prior year.
Finally, on a personal note, I'd like to thank Chris Holland for his 8 years of dedicated service as a key member of our finance team. While we all hate to see him go, we recognize the terrific opportunity to be CFO of a very highly respected Fortune 500 company, particularly one located in the same geographical area. It's just too good an opportunity to turn down. We at ARAMARK share in his success. We feel that Chris represent a very good, solid raw material when they brought him here and he was trained well. And so, we're very proud of him. We're also pleased to elevate Karen Wallace to VP and Treasurer. I know many of you on the call know Karen. Karen's worked side-by-side with Chris for the last 7 years on all of our financing. She's well-positioned to fill some pretty big shoes that were worn by Chris. At this point, let me turn it back over to Chris for some additional details on the quarter and on the half."

Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending March 30 was $1.136 billion, up from $1.129 bill",553,"Thanks very much, Fred, for that comment. I greatly appreciate it. I'd like to now spend a few minutes on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending March 30 was $1.136 billion, up from $1.129 billion at December 30, 2011, and up from $1.1 billion even at September 30, 2011. Interest and other financing costs were $119 million for the second quarter compared to $93 million in the prior year. Results for the quarter included approximately $11 million of expenses related to the term loan extension we completed in March. We are very appreciative of the broad support that the extension transaction received from many of you, our investors, and we believe that the success of the extension further enhances our financial and capital structure flexibility.
Also contributing to the year-over-year variance was the recognition in the second quarter of 2011 of interest income of approximately $14 million related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims from prior years. In the first half, interest and other financing costs were $227 million compared to $202 million in the prior-year, primarily reflecting the 2 items just mentioned. Including the impact of interest rate hedges, approximately 50% of our debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates, and our overall weighted average cost of debt is approximately 5.2%.
Total reported debt at the end of the second quarter was $5.817 billion as compared to $5.739 billion at the end of last year's second quarter. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.733 billion, including the term loan balance of $3.291 billion and a revolver balance of $173 million. Our accounts receivable securitization facility had $224 million utilized at the quarter's end.
We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position overall and at quarter end, had approximately $473 million of available borrowing capacity under our $665 million revolving credit facility and $101 million of balance sheet cash. Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio improved to 3.22x as of March 30 as compared to 3.33x as of December 30, 2011, and also 3.33x as of April 1, 2011.
Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $71 million compared to $66 million in the prior-year quarter. For the year-to-date, net capital expenditures totaled $145 million, up from $120 million last year as we make appropriate and prudent investments in our physical and system infrastructure and in support of growth. As expected and consistent with historical patterns, working capital was the use of cash flows during the first half of our fiscal year. While some reinvestment in working capital is required at certain sectors and countries in particular improved levels of sales growth, we will continue to maintain a sharp focus on working capital management as we move through the balance of fiscal 2012. For the year-to-date, we've spent a total of $150 million on acquisitions compared to $155 million in the prior-year period. This year's spending, as you know, relates primarily to the acquisition of Filterfresh on the first day of the fiscal year. We do continue to evaluate strategic investment opportunities in certain sectors and geographies, and as we do so, we'll maintain a prudent and disciplined approach in pursuit of these opportunities. Now let me turn the call over to Joe Neubauer."

As you heard from Fred and Chris, we're coming off a very solid quarter and clearly gaining both top line and bottom line momentum in our businesses. A systematic focus on growth in our key operational processes is beginning to pay off and we look for steady and continuing progress over the next several years. In the way of transition, I'm sure you've all heard, aware by now that after nearly 30 years as CEO of ARAMARK, I'll be turning these responsibilities over, actually, I have turned them over to Eric Foss. I will remain as Chairman, involved in the business and clearly, continue to be a significant investor in Aramark as I have been since our original going private transaction way back in 1984. Eric is an outstanding leader with a solid track record of performance in global enterprises. Most recently, Eric was CEO of Pepsi Beverages Company, a $20 billion division of PepsiCo with over 80,000 employees operating in various countries. A private acquisition of Pepsi Bottling Group by PepsiCo, this was one of the 2 acquisitions that they had made of the bottling business, Eric was the Chairman and CEO of the larger one, Pepsi Bottling Group, an independent publicly-owned company with revenues of about $13 billion and operating in about 25 countries.
I'm very proud of the solid management team that we have built here at ARAMARK. Under Eric's leadership, along with Fred and Lynn Mckee, our EVP of Human Resources and the rest of our talented executive team, I'm certain that ARAMARK will continue to achieve very high levels of success. I want to personally thank you for your continued support of ARAMARK and assure you that our team will continue to work diligently to earn your confidence and to make this great company even more successful. Thank you."

And we continue to get traction through those initiatives, particularly in the uniform business that you saw our earnings were down slightly year-over-year but that's in the face of significantly, as I mentioned, significantly a higher cost of installation, amortization associated with new merchandise being put in service and higher the fuel costs, which were up pretty significantly year-over-year.

I'd like to review our business and operating results and then have Chris cover a few additional details on our performance.I'm pleased to report results for our seco",1643,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2012 results call. I'd like to review our business and operating results and then have Chris cover a few additional details on our performance.
I'm pleased to report results for our second fiscal quarter that further extends this trend of solid operating performance that we have seen in recent quarters. While the economic environment remains a bit uncertain, we believe that our focus on initiatives and investments that position ARAMARK for long-term growth contributed to our strong results for the quarter, continuing to build a solid foundation for the future.
Overall, our performance in the quarter was balanced as our less cyclical businesses delivered another quarter of solid results and our more economically-sensitive businesses continued to show signs of improvement. While higher commodity cost remained a headwind for us in the quarter, the impact on a year-over-year basis has been moderating. Our ongoing efforts to improve our operating efficiencies continue to allow us to leverage our top line sales growth into solid earnings performance.
Now turning to our overall results for the second quarter. We reported sales of $3.3 billion, up 4% on a reported basis and an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $177 million was up 8% from the prior year level. For the first half of 2012, sales grew by 4% to $6.8 billion or up 3% organically. As we discussed in our first quarter results, sales in the half was reduced somewhat by the impact of the first quarter -- in the first quarter of the NBA lockout and by our serving of the Asian Games in last year's first quarter. The first half adjusted operating income increased by 5% to $388 million. Also, as we discussed last quarter, operating income growth was negatively affected by approximately $4 million planned acquisition-related transition and integration expenses that were absorbed in the first quarter, as well as the recognition last year of approximately $8 million of income related to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service, under which they paid down a portion of our possessory interest in one of our concession contracts. Without these 2 particular items, year-over-year profit growth for the first half would have been in the high single digits.
In our North American Food and Support Services segment, second quarter sales of $2.3 million were up 6% on a reported basis and 4% on an organic basis and primarily by strong growth in our Higher Education business and Health Care and S&E sectors. The first half reported sales of $4.7 billion were up 6% versus the prior year and up 4% organically. Overall sales performance for the first half was led by solid growth in Higher Education and Health Care.
The Business & Industry sector reported a mid single-digit sales increase in the quarter, a single-digit sales increase for the half, reflecting the positive impact from the Filterfresh Office Coffee Services acquisition, which closed in October 2011. The sector also benefited from solid-based and new business growth in our new Facilities Services Business and in our Refreshment Services business. 
Sales in our Education sector were up mid-single digits for the quarter and for the year-to-date, led primarily by continued strong base and new business growth in our Higher Education Food business, as well as solid growth in our K-12 food business.
In the Healthcare sector, sales grew in the high single digits for the quarter and for the year-to-date, driven primarily by the acquisition of Masterplan within our Health Care Technologies business in March 2011, as well as solid base business growth. Sports & Entertainment sales grew in the mid-single digits in the quarter, led by solid attendance and positive per capita spending trends in both our NHL and NBA venues. For the year-to-date, sales growth was limited to the low single digits, as a result as I mentioned, of the NBA lockout during the first quarter, as well as the impact of fewer major league baseball playoff games in October versus last year in those stadiums where we provide our services.
Adjusted operating income in the North America Food and Support Services segment was up 11% in the quarter to $130 million. Nearly all segments contributed to profit growth in the quarter, led by strong contributions from higher education and health care. In the first half, segment adjusted operating income grew by 4% to $285 million.
Previously noted, results in the first quarter were negatively affected by approximately $4 million of planned transition and integration expenses for the Filterfresh acquisition. In addition, results for the first quarter of 2011 included approximately $8 million of other income related to the compensation agreement with the National Park Service, as I mentioned earlier. Excluding these 2 particular items, growth for the first half would've been in the high single digits.
Turning to the International Food and Support Services segment, second quarter reported sales of $672 million were down slightly on a reported basis but up 4% organically versus the year-ago quarter. Organic growth in the quarter was led by strong performance in Germany, South America and China. For the first half, reported sales in International were up 1% and up 5% organically. The first half sales growth also was driven by strong results in Germany, Spain, South America and also, Ireland.
Second quarter adjusted operating income for International of $25 million was up 10% versus the prior year. Results in the second quarter of 2011, you may recall, benefited from a gain from the sale of a small non-core subsidiary in Chile and the receipt of the VAT income in the U.K., partially offset by severance charges in Chile related to the divestiture and a write-down of goodwill in India. Excluding these items from the prior year, profit growth would've been even stronger in the quarter, led by solid performance in Germany, Spain and Chile, partially offset by a profit decline in our AIM joint venture in Japan. The first half adjusted operating income was $48 million, up from $38 million in the prior year. 
In addition to the items I just mentioned, 2011 results also included expenses related to efficiency and cost reduction initiatives, including severance charges across several of our countries in the first quarter of 2011, while a smaller amount of expense was recorded in the first half of 2012 further caused reduction and efficiency.
Excluding these expenses in both years, the segment would've still experienced strong income growth in the first half. 
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, second quarter sales of $337 million were up 2% on a reported and organic basis. Improving organic growth rates in the Uniform Rental business for the quarter were offset by softness in direct sales, partly reflecting large customer direct sale programs that were launched in the first half of 2011 and that has not been repeated in 2012. For the year-to-date, sales of $678 million were about flat as compared to the same period as in the prior year on both as reported and organic basis. We're continuing to invest in additional rental sales personnel resources to support accelerated new sales growth, while maintaining a disciplined approach to contract pricing. We are gaining improved traction in our new sales efforts. During the second quarter and in the first half, volume of new sales delivered by our sales force significantly exceeded the prior year's results, driven both by higher sales force headcount and higher sales rep productivity.
The increased cost, including installation costs associated with substantially higher levels of new business, are largely being offset by the successful efficiency initiatives that we have discussed in previous calls. A higher cost related to the increased rates of new sales will continue to depress profit growth over the next few quarters. We believe these efforts will lead to both improving rental sales and profit growth as we move through 2012 and into 2013.
The segment's second quarter adjusted operating income was $30.3 million, down from $32.7 million the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting the incremental expense from our investment in growing the sales force, our garment and insulation costs from the acceleration of new business and the impact of higher energy costs.
In the first half, adjusted operating income was $70 million, down from $74.8 million in the prior year's first half, reflecting all of the items that I just mentioned, as well as severance expense incurred in the first quarter associated with some additional organizational efficiency initiatives, following the successful integration of our rental and direct sales operations and the completion of the Galls divestiture.
Corporate expenses, excluding the items Chris mentioned earlier, were $7.5 million in the quarter compared to $8.2 million in the year-ago quarter. First half expenses were $14.6 million compared to $16.5 million in the prior year.
Finally, on a personal note, I'd like to thank Chris Holland for his 8 years of dedicated service as a key member of our finance team. While we all hate to see him go, we recognize the terrific opportunity to be CFO of a very highly respected Fortune 500 company, particularly one located in the same geographical area. It's just too good an opportunity to turn down. We at ARAMARK share in his success. We feel that Chris represented a very good, solid raw material when they brought him here and he was trained well. And so, we're very proud of him. We're also pleased to elevate Karen Wallace to VP and Treasurer. I know many of you on the call know Karen. Karen's worked side-by-side with Chris for the last 7 years on all of our financing. She's well-positioned to fill some pretty big shoes that were worn by Chris. At this point, let me turn it back over to Chris for some additional details on the quarter and on the half."

I'd like to now spend a few minutes on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending March 30 was $1.136 billion, up from $1.129 billion at December 30, 2011, and up from $1.1 billion even at September 30, 2011. Interest and other financing costs were $119 million for the second quarter compared to $93 million in the prior year. Results for the quarter included approximately $11 million of expenses related to the term loan extension we completed in March. We are very appreciative of the broad support that the extension transaction received from many of you, our investors, and we believe that the success of the extension further enhances our financial and capital structure flexibility.
Also contributing to the year-over-year variance was the recognition in the second quarter of 2011 of interest income of approximately $14 million related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims from prior years. In the first half, interest and other financing costs were $227 million compared to $202 million in the prior-year, primarily reflecting the 2 items just mentioned. Including the impact of interest rate hedges, approximately 50% of our debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates, and our overall weighted average cost of debt is approximately 5.2%.
Total reported debt at the end of the second quarter was $5.817 billion as compared to $5.739 billion at the end of last year's second quarter. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.733 billion, including the term loan balance of $3.291 billion and a revolver balance of $173 million. Our accounts receivable securitization facility had $224 million utilized at the quarter's end.
We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position overall and at quarter end, had approximately $473 million of available borrowing capacity under our $665 million revolving credit facility and $101 million of balance sheet cash. Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio improved to 3.22x as of March 30 as compared to 3.33x as of December 30, 2011, and also 3.33x as of April 1, 2011.
Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $71 million compared to $66 million in the prior-year quarter. For the year-to-date, net capital expenditures totaled $145 million, up from $120 million last year as we make appropriate and prudent investments in our physical and system infrastructure and in support of growth. As expected and consistent with historical patterns, working capital was the use of cash flows during the first half of our fiscal year. While some reinvestment in working capital is required at certain sectors and countries in particular improved levels of sales growth, we will continue to maintain a sharp focus on working capital management as we move through the balance of fiscal 2012. For the year-to-date, we've spent a total of $150 million on acquisitions compared to $155 million in the prior-year period. This year's spending, as you know, relates primarily to the acquisition of Filterfresh on the first day of the fiscal year. We do continue to evaluate strategic investment opportunities in certain sectors and geographies, and as we do so, we'll maintain a prudent and disciplined approach in pursuit of these opportunities. Now let me turn the call over to Joe Neubauer."

As you heard from Fred and Chris, we're coming off a very solid quarter and clearly gaining both top line and bottom line momentum in our businesses. A systematic focus on growth in our key operational processes is beginning to pay off and we look for steady and continuing progress over the next several years. In the way of transition, I'm sure you've all heard -- aware by now that after nearly 30 years as CEO of ARAMARK, I'll be turning these responsibilities over, actually, I have turned them over, to Eric Foss. I will remain as Chairman, involved in the business and clearly, continue to be a significant investor in Aramark as I have been since our original going private transaction, way back in 1984. Eric is an outstanding leader with a solid track record of performance in global enterprises. Most recently, Eric was CEO of Pepsi Beverages Company, a $20 billion division of PepsiCo with over 80,000 employees operating in various countries. A private acquisition of Pepsi Bottling Group by PepsiCo, this was one of the 2 acquisitions that they had made of the bottling business, Eric was the Chairman and CEO of the larger one, Pepsi Bottling Group, an independent publicly-owned company with revenues of about $13 billion and operating in about 25 countries.
I'm very proud of the solid management team that we have built here at ARAMARK. Under Eric's leadership, along with Fred and Lynn Mckee, our EVP of Human Resources and the rest of our talented executive team, I'm certain that ARAMARK will continue to achieve very high levels of success. I want to personally thank you for your continued support of ARAMARK and assure you that our team will continue to work diligently to earn your confidence and to make this great company even more successful. Thank you."

I'd like to review our business and operating results and then have Chris cover a few additional details on our performance.I'm pleased to report results for our seco",1643,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2012 results call. I'd like to review our business and operating results and then have Chris cover a few additional details on our performance.
I'm pleased to report results for our second fiscal quarter that further extends this trend of solid operating performance that we have seen in recent quarters. While the economic environment remains a bit uncertain, we believe that our focus on initiatives and investments that position ARAMARK for long-term growth contributed to our strong results for the quarter, continuing to build a solid foundation for the future.
Overall, our performance in the quarter was balanced as our less cyclical businesses delivered another quarter of solid results and our more economically-sensitive businesses continued to show signs of improvement. While higher commodity cost remained a headwind for us in the quarter, the impact on a year-over-year basis has been moderating. Our ongoing efforts to improve our operating efficiencies continue to allow us to leverage our top line sales growth into solid earnings performance.
Now turning to our overall results for the second quarter. We reported sales of $3.3 billion, up 4% on a reported basis and an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $177 million was up 8% from the prior year level. For the first half of 2012, sales grew by 4% to $6.8 billion or up 3% organically. As we discussed in our first quarter results, sales in the half was reduced somewhat by the impact of the first quarter -- in the first quarter of the NBA lockout and by our serving of the Asian Games in last year's first quarter. The first half adjusted operating income increased by 5% to $388 million. Also, as we discussed last quarter, operating income growth was negatively affected by approximately $4 million planned acquisition-related transition and integration expenses that were absorbed in the first quarter, as well as the recognition last year of approximately $8 million of income related to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service, under which they paid down a portion of our possessory interest in one of our concession contracts. Without these 2 particular items, year-over-year profit growth for the first half would have been in the high single digits.
In our North American Food and Support Services segment, second quarter sales of $2.3 million were up 6% on a reported basis and 4% on an organic basis and primarily by strong growth in our Higher Education business and Health Care and S&E sectors. The first half reported sales of $4.7 billion were up 6% versus the prior year and up 4% organically. Overall sales performance for the first half was led by solid growth in Higher Education and Health Care.
The Business & Industry sector reported a mid single-digit sales increase in the quarter, a single-digit sales increase for the half, reflecting the positive impact from the Filterfresh Office Coffee Services acquisition, which closed in October 2011. The sector also benefited from solid-based and new business growth in our new Facilities Services Business and in our Refreshment Services business. 
Sales in our Education sector were up mid-single digits for the quarter and for the year-to-date, led primarily by continued strong base and new business growth in our Higher Education Food business, as well as solid growth in our K-12 food business.
In the Healthcare sector, sales grew in the high single digits for the quarter and for the year-to-date, driven primarily by the acquisition of Masterplan within our Health Care Technologies business in March 2011, as well as solid base business growth. Sports & Entertainment sales grew in the mid-single digits in the quarter, led by solid attendance and positive per capita spending trends in both our NHL and NBA venues. For the year-to-date, sales growth was limited to the low single digits, as a result as I mentioned, of the NBA lockout during the first quarter, as well as the impact of fewer major league baseball playoff games in October versus last year in those stadiums where we provide our services.
Adjusted operating income in the North America Food and Support Services segment was up 11% in the quarter to $130 million. Nearly all segments contributed to profit growth in the quarter, led by strong contributions from higher education and health care. In the first half, segment adjusted operating income grew by 4% to $285 million.
Previously noted, results in the first quarter were negatively affected by approximately $4 million of planned transition and integration expenses for the Filterfresh acquisition. In addition, results for the first quarter of 2011 included approximately $8 million of other income related to the compensation agreement with the National Park Service, as I mentioned earlier. Excluding these 2 particular items, growth for the first half would've been in the high single digits.
Turning to the International Food and Support Services segment, second quarter reported sales of $672 million were down slightly on a reported basis but up 4% organically versus the year-ago quarter. Organic growth in the quarter was led by strong performance in Germany, South America and China. For the first half, reported sales in International were up 1% and up 5% organically. The first half sales growth also was driven by strong results in Germany, Spain, South America and also, Ireland.
Second quarter adjusted operating income for International of $25 million was up 10% versus the prior year. Results in the second quarter of 2011, you may recall, benefited from a gain from the sale of a small non-core subsidiary in Chile and the receipt of the VAT income in the U.K., partially offset by severance charges in Chile related to the divestiture and a write-down of goodwill in India. Excluding these items from the prior year, profit growth would've been even stronger in the quarter, led by solid performance in Germany, Spain and Chile, partially offset by a profit decline in our AIM joint venture in Japan. The first half adjusted operating income was $48 million, up from $38 million in the prior year. 
In addition to the items I just mentioned, 2011 results also included expenses related to efficiency and cost reduction initiatives, including severance charges across several of our countries in the first quarter of 2011, while a smaller amount of expense was recorded in the first half of 2012 further caused reduction and efficiency.
Excluding these expenses in both years, the segment would've still experienced strong income growth in the first half. 
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, second quarter sales of $337 million were up 2% on a reported and organic basis. Improving organic growth rates in the Uniform Rental business for the quarter were offset by softness in direct sales, partly reflecting large customer direct sale programs that were launched in the first half of 2011 and that has not been repeated in 2012. For the year-to-date, sales of $678 million were about flat as compared to the same period as in the prior year on both as reported and organic basis. We're continuing to invest in additional rental sales personnel resources to support accelerated new sales growth, while maintaining a disciplined approach to contract pricing. We are gaining improved traction in our new sales efforts. During the second quarter and in the first half, volume of new sales delivered by our sales force significantly exceeded the prior year's results, driven both by higher sales force headcount and higher sales rep productivity.
The increased cost, including installation costs associated with substantially higher levels of new business, are largely being offset by the successful efficiency initiatives that we have discussed in previous calls. A higher cost related to the increased rates of new sales will continue to depress profit growth over the next few quarters. We believe these efforts will lead to both improving rental sales and profit growth as we move through 2012 and into 2013.
The segment's second quarter adjusted operating income was $30.3 million, down from $32.7 million the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting the incremental expense from our investment in growing the sales force, our garment and insulation costs from the acceleration of new business and the impact of higher energy costs.
In the first half, adjusted operating income was $70 million, down from $74.8 million in the prior year's first half, reflecting all of the items that I just mentioned, as well as severance expense incurred in the first quarter associated with some additional organizational efficiency initiatives, following the successful integration of our rental and direct sales operations and the completion of the Galls divestiture.
Corporate expenses, excluding the items Chris mentioned earlier, were $7.5 million in the quarter compared to $8.2 million in the year-ago quarter. First half expenses were $14.6 million compared to $16.5 million in the prior year.
Finally, on a personal note, I'd like to thank Chris Holland for his 8 years of dedicated service as a key member of our finance team. While we all hate to see him go, we recognize the terrific opportunity to be CFO of a very highly respected Fortune 500 company, particularly one located in the same geographical area. It's just too good an opportunity to turn down. We at ARAMARK share in his success. We feel that Chris represented a very good, solid raw material when they brought him here and he was trained well. And so, we're very proud of him. We're also pleased to elevate Karen Wallace to VP and Treasurer. I know many of you on the call know Karen. Karen's worked side-by-side with Chris for the last 7 years on all of our financing. She's well-positioned to fill some pretty big shoes that were worn by Chris. At this point, let me turn it back over to Chris for some additional details on the quarter and on the half."

I greatly appreciate it. I'd like to now spend a few minutes on our financing capital structure and cash flow.

I'd like to now spend a few minutes on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending March 30 was $1.136 billion, up from $1.129 billion at December 30, 2011, and up from $1.1 billion even at September 30, 2011. Interest and other financing costs were $119 million for the second quarter compared to $93 million in the prior year. Results for the quarter included approximately $11 million of expenses related to the term loan extension we completed in March. We are very appreciative of the broad support that the extension transaction received from many of you, our investors, and we believe that the success of the extension further enhances our financial and capital structure flexibility.
Also contributing to the year-over-year variance was the recognition in the second quarter of 2011 of interest income of approximately $14 million related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims from prior years. In the first half, interest and other financing costs were $227 million compared to $202 million in the prior-year, primarily reflecting the 2 items just mentioned. Including the impact of interest rate hedges, approximately 50% of our debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates, and our overall weighted average cost of debt is approximately 5.2%.
Total reported debt at the end of the second quarter was $5.817 billion as compared to $5.739 billion at the end of last year's second quarter. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.733 billion, including the term loan balance of $3.291 billion and a revolver balance of $173 million. Our accounts receivable securitization facility had $224 million utilized at the quarter's end.
We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position overall and at quarter end, had approximately $473 million of available borrowing capacity under our $665 million revolving credit facility and $101 million of balance sheet cash. Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio improved to 3.22x as of March 30 as compared to 3.33x as of December 30, 2011, and also 3.33x as of April 1, 2011.
Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $71 million compared to $66 million in the prior-year quarter. For the year-to-date, net capital expenditures totaled $145 million, up from $120 million last year as we make appropriate and prudent investments in our physical and system infrastructure and in support of growth. As expected and consistent with historical patterns, working capital was the use of cash flows during the first half of our fiscal year. While some reinvestment in working capital is required at certain sectors and countries in particular improved levels of sales growth, we will continue to maintain a sharp focus on working capital management as we move through the balance of fiscal 2012. For the year-to-date, we've spent a total of $150 million on acquisitions compared to $155 million in the prior-year period. This year's spending, as you know, relates primarily to the acquisition of Filterfresh on the first day of the fiscal year. We do continue to evaluate strategic investment opportunities in certain sectors and geographies, and as we do so, we'll maintain a prudent and disciplined approach in pursuit of these opportunities. Now let me turn the call over to Joe Neubauer."

As you heard from Fred and Chris, we're coming off a very solid quarter and clearly gaining both top line and bottom line momentum in our businesses. A systematic focus on growth in our key operational processes is beginning to pay off and we look for steady and continuing progress over the next several years. In the way of transition, I'm sure you've all heard -- aware by now that after nearly 30 years as CEO of ARAMARK, I'll be turning these responsibilities over, actually, I have turned them over, to Eric Foss. I will remain as Chairman, involved in the business and clearly, continue to be a significant investor in Aramark as I have been since our original going private transaction, way back in 1984. Eric is an outstanding leader with a solid track record of performance in global enterprises. Most recently, Eric was CEO of Pepsi Beverages Company, a $20 billion division of PepsiCo with over 80,000 employees operating in various countries. A private acquisition of Pepsi Bottling Group by PepsiCo, this was one of the 2 acquisitions that they had made of the bottling business, Eric was the Chairman and CEO of the larger one, Pepsi Bottling Group, an independent publicly-owned company with revenues of about $13 billion and operating in about 25 countries.

In today's discussion of results, we mention certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Form 10-Q, as well as schedules we posted to our website prior to the call, include reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures as required by SEC rules. Our discussion of operating income during today's call will, in each instance, exclude the incremental intangibles amortization and property and equipment depreciation expense resulting from the going private transaction, the impact of stock option expense and the impact on the change in fair value related to our gasoline and diesel fuel agreements. All of these items are detailed in the schedules posted to our website before the call. In addition, the prior year period results have been restated to present the results of the Galls business as a discontinued operation, as we sold it in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
Various remarks that we make in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts, including remarks about future expectations, anticipation, beliefs, estimates, plans and prospects, constitute forward-looking statements.

As we've done in prior quarters, I'd like to review our business and operating results, and then Karen will cover a few additional details on our performance focused on cash flow and the balance sheet.
During the quarter, we saw significant slowing in U.S. job growth and continued economic uncertainty in Europe. Our organic growth rate declined slightly in part due to the normal seasonal mix shift between our higher growing education business and our slower growing business in Sports & Entertainment sectors. We continue to see positive growth trend in certain of our sectors as a result of contributions from both base business and new business wins. Year-to-date, our new customer sales are growing in the double digits and net new business results are also quite strong. Our client retention rates have been consistent with our expectations and better than prior year's results. But with the economic and environment weakening as the year progresses, we remain cautious and continue to maintain a very tight focus on efficiently managing our operations and our cost structure.
So now turning to our overall results for the third quarter, we achieved sales of $3.3 billion, which was up 2% as reported from the prior-year quarter. Organic sales growth, which I mentioned earlier, and excludes the impact of currency translations and acquisitions and divestitures, was up 3% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $157 million, up 2% versus the prior year. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2012, sales were $10.1 billion, up 3% over the prior year period on both a reported and on a nonorganic growth basis. Our adjusted operating income of $544 million was up 4% from the prior year.
Now turning to our North American Food and Support Services segment, third quarter reported sales are up 2% of $2.3 billion, primarily by growth rate in the Higher Education business and Business & Industry and Sports & Entertainment sectors. Organic sales growth was 3% in the quarter. For the 9 months, reported sales were up 5% to $7.1 billion an organic growth of 3%. Year-to-date performance was also led by solid growth in most sectors and particularly strong growth in higher education.
Turning now to the sectors within North America, our Business & Industry sector had a mid-single digit sales increase for the quarter and high single-digit sales increase for the 9 months. This reflects the positive impact from the Filterfresh acquisition, which closed on 2011, October 2011. Our B&I facilities business also contributed to the increase in the quarter with our remote services growth primarily in Canada and our business dine-in operations during the year was pretty much flat year-over-year.
The Education sector had low single-digit sales growth for the quarter and mid-single-digit sales growth for the 9 months, with growth in our Higher Education Food business resulting from a good combination of base business growth and strong new sales from contract wins in prior periods.
In our Health Care sector, we saw a slight decline in the quarter and mid-single-digit sales growth for the 9 months. The sales declined in the quarter was a result of modest base business growth that was offset by lower net new business. The growth for the 9-month period was primarily a result of the acquisition in March 2011 of Masterplan within our Health Care Technologies business.
Our Sports & Entertainment sector had low single-digit sales growth for the quarter and for the 9 months. But for the quarter, we've seen pretty solid performance in our Major League Baseball venues, with growth in both the tenants and per capita spending and good growth in our amphitheater future business, with a significant increase in the number of shows and attendance growth. Our growth over the nine-month period was negatively in impacted by the NDA strike in the first quarter but that was offset more or less by solid results during the NHL season and recent strength in NOV performance as I mentioned. Adjusted operating income in the North American Food services segment 5% in the quarter to $130 million, led by profit growth in our Higher Education business. For the 9 months, segment adjusted operating income grew 5% to $388 million, again led by strong profit growth in Higher Education business and Health Care sector, offset by profit decline in our Business & Industry sector. Our results for the 9 months were reduced by approximately $4 million of planned acquisition-related transition and integration cost absorbed in the first quarter, as well as the recognition as we mentioned last year -- during last year of approximately $8 million of income related to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service under which they paid down a portion of our possessed reinterest in light of our concession contracts. Without these 2 particular items, year-over-year profit growth for the 9 months would have been in the high single digits.
Now turning to the International Food and Support Services segment, third quarter reported sales of $674 million were down 3% from the prior year period, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Organic sales growth for the quarter was actually 4% due to positive growth in Ireland, South America and China that was partially offset by sales declines in the U.K. and Spain. For the 9 months, reported sales of $2 billion decreased 1% compared to the prior year, also primarily due to the stronger dollar. Organic growth was 4%, again led primarily by growth in Germany, Ireland, South America and China, which more than offset a sales decline in U.K. and Belgium.
Third quarter adjusted operating income was $25 million, which was about even when compared to the prior-year quarter. But currency translation negatively affected profit growth by approximately 8 percentage points. Results in the quarter primarily reflects improving profit performance in the U.K, Ireland in Chile, offsetting a profit decline in Continental Europe. For the 9 months, adjusted operating income was $74 million, up from $64 million in the prior year. Growth was driven by the U.K, Ireland, Germany, Spain, Chile and China, partially offset by Belgium and by our AIM joint venture in Japan. Currency translation also negatively affected profit growth by approximately 3 percentage points.
You may recall there are a number of unusual items last year and a couple this year in the International segment. In 2012, we recorded 7 related charges in VAT income in the U.K. and in 2011, the results included a gain of the sale of a noncore subsidiary in Chile, through the receipt of the VAT income in the U.K, gain on the sale of land in Chile, severance related charges and the write-down on that of the goodwill and other intangible assets relating to our operations in India. Adjusting for currency translation and these unusual items in both years, adjusted operating income would've grown by double digits versus last year.
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, third quarter sales were $343 million were up 3% from the year-ago quarter on both a reported and organic basis. Improving organic growth rates in the uniform rental business, which were in the mid-single digits for the quarter, were offset by softness in our direct sale business, partially reflecting large customer direct sale programs, which were launched in the first half of 2011 that have not been repeated in 2012. And for the 9 months, segment sales of $1 billion were up 1% for the prior year on a reported and organic basis. We continue to invest in additional rental sales personnel resources to support accelerated new sales growth while maintaining a disciplined approach to contract pricing. We are gaining improved traction in our new sales efforts and continue to gain momentum as the volume of new sales in the third quarter and for the 9 months delivered by our sales force significantly exceeded the prior year results, driven by both higher sales headcount and higher sales productivity. The segment's third quarter adjusted operating income was $37 million, which was about even with the same period last year and for the 9 months. Adjusted operating income was $107 million, down from $112 million for the same period last year. As we have discussed in previous quarters, the increased sales costs, including installation costs associated with substantially higher levels of new business and higher merchandise amortization will continue to press profit growth in the near term. But we of course, believe these efforts will lead to both improving rental sales and profit growth as we move forward.
Corporate expenses, excluding the items that Karen mentioned earlier, were $9 million in the quarter compared to $7.2 million a year ago. And for the 9 months, expenses were $24.9 million compared to $23.7 million in the prior year. To this point, let me turn it back to Karen for some additional details on the quarter and our year-to-date performance."

I'd like to comment on our financing, capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending June 29 was $1.136 billion, which was about equal to the $1.136 billion we reported as of March 31, 2012, and up from $1.1 billion at September 30, 2011. Interest and other financing costs were $88 million for the third quarter compared to $113 million in the prior year. Our interest expense in the quarter was lower primarily as a result of a number of interest rate swaps that matured at the end of March, 2012. For the 9 months, interest and other financing costs were $315 million, equal to the prior year's expense.
In the second quarter of 2012, we recorded approximately $11 million of expenses related to the term loan extension we completed that quarter. In 2011, we had interest income of approximately $14 million recorded related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims from prior period. Including the impact of interest rate hedges, approximately 50% of our total debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates and our overall weighted average cost of debt is approximately 5.1%.
Total reported debt at the end of the third quarter was $5.782 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.953 billion, including a term loan balance of $3.281 billion and a revolver balance of $375 million. In June 2012, we amended our accounts receivable securitization facility, increasing the maximum amount from $250 million to $300 million and extending the maturity date to January 2015. The facility had $253 million utilized at quarter-end. During the quarter, our $250 million, 5% note matured and were repaid with revolver borrowings, which did not increase our total debt. We had approximately $273 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility as of quarter-end. Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio was 3.41x as of June 29, up modestly from 3.22x as of March 30, 2012, and equal to the 3.41x reported as  of July 1, 2011. This slight increase in the ratio from March 30, reflects a utilization of the revolver to fund the 5% note redemption. Overall, we are pleased with our EBITDA growth and our ratio momentum and we anticipate further ratio improvement over time. Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $74 million compared to $60 million in the prior-year quarter. For the year-to-date, net capital expenditures totaled $219 million compared to $180 million in the same period last year as we focused on making prudent investments in growth opportunities and in our infrastructure.
As expected and consistent with historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash flows during the first 9 months of our fiscal year. We are continuing to maintain a focused on working capital management as we move through the fourth quarter, which is our strongest seasonal period from a working capital and free cash flow standpoint. For the year-to-date, we have spent a total of $151 million on acquisitions compared to $157 million in the prior year period. This year's spending related primarily to the acquisition of Filterfresh within our North American refreshment services business in October of 2011. We continue to evaluate and seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies but will be prudent and disciplined in the pursuit of these opportunities. Now let me turn the call back over to Fred."

So summing up our performance so far this year, for Global Food and Support Services business has delivered solid organic growth with strong profit growth. The Uniform Rental business is gaining traction from the significant investment we've made over the past several quarters and accelerating new sales and now is performing at the mid-single-digit growth levels. As we look forward, while we will be working to deliver improving organic growth rates and continued margin improvement, slowing economic growth will clearly pose a challenge to certain sectors and countries. We believe that there are many attractive growth opportunities in front of us despite the economic climate as many of our sectors remain significantly under penetrated. We remain excited about pursuing these opportunities.
Overall, we continue to benefit from our portfolio of sectors, geographies and clients, which we feel provide us with good balance.

So our base U.K. business is the only some negative effect from the Olympics, as you know, there was quite a bit of controversy about the traffic and the setup of the special dedicated traffic lanes for VIPs and the like. And our sense is that many people, particularly focused on taking vacation at this time. On the other hand, we will clearly have sales associated with what's going to be a incredibly successful performance by us in feeding athletes at the Olympic Games. If not, as you know really very much in the way of profit for us but it does -- it creates a fair amount of sales, which I'm sure from a sales point of view would more than offset the weakness in our base U.K. operations."

I think next year, our forecast is to have price increases more in the 4%, 4.5% range overall of our basket. And as you know we have tremendous flexibility on our operations to manage against this, since we have pretty much in most of our operations outside of the corrections business, which is relatively small, significant control over the menus, how those menus are in engineered -- the items are engineered, the mix of items on the menus. So we're focused on it. I think we'll probably make even a greater, more focused effort as we move into next year in both our retail and our contract pricing. And we'll be on top of it from a mix perspective."

We're strong in education, particularly K-12, and that's been solid. But we also have a pretty decent sized business in health care, in some portion of that or public health care institutions. And those are typically funded at the state levels. And as you know in Spain, there's quite a bit of back and forth between the space and the Federal Government with respect to funding. So that's clearly put some pressure on our Health Care clients. So, yes, I'd say in Spain, it's a challenge. Now fortunately for us, Spain is not a huge operation."

So I think generally, in North America, which is of course, the bulk of our overall sales, frequently you can include uniform. I don't think it's primarily a matter of exiting certain businesses, I think it's more of a matter of internal resource allocation, capital allocation, sales resource and those sorts of things. And I think you'll find its probably more discriminating in that sense in that regard than we have been. Overall, outside of the U.S. in our base countries, our big countries, even though a couple of them are struggling because of the economy, we see those as long-term -- generally, as long-term plays in countries which at least over the intermediate term, we think we can add value we want to stay in.

In today's discussion of results, we mention certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Form 10-Q, as well as schedules we posted to our website prior to the call, include reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures as required by SEC rules. Our discussion of operating income during today's call will, in each instance, exclude the incremental intangibles amortization and property and equipment depreciation expense resulting from the going private transaction, the impact of stock option expense and the impact on the change in fair value related to our gasoline and diesel fuel agreements. All of these items are detailed in the schedules posted to our website before this call. In addition, the prior year period results have been restated to present the results of the Galls business as a discontinued operation, as we sold it in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
Various remarks that we make in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts, including remarks about future expectations, anticipation, belief, estimates, plans and prospects, constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors, MD&A and other sections of our Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q filed earlier today.

As we've done in prior quarters, I'd like to review our business and operating results, and then Karen will cover a few additional details on our performance focused on cash flow and the balance sheet.
During the quarter, we saw significant slowing in U.S. job growth and continued economic uncertainty in Europe. Our organic growth rate declined slightly in part due to the normal seasonal mix shift between our higher growing Education business and our slower growing business in Sports & Entertainment sectors. We continue to see positive growth trends in certain of our sectors as a result of contributions from both base business and new business wins. Year-to-date, our new customer sales are growing in the double digits and net new business results are also quite strong. Our client retention rates have been consistent with our expectations and better than prior year's results. But with the economic and environment weakening as the year progresses, we remain cautious and continue to maintain a very tight focus on efficiently managing our operations and our cost structure.
So now turning to our overall results for the third quarter, we achieved sales of $3.3 billion, which was up 2% as reported from the prior year quarter. Organic sales growth, which I mentioned earlier, and excludes the impact of currency translations and acquisitions and divestitures, was up 3% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $157 million, up 2% versus the prior year. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2012, sales were $10.1 billion, up 3% over the prior year period on both a reported and an organic growth basis. Our adjusted operating income of $544 million was up 4% from the prior year.
Now turning to our North America Food and Support Services segment, third quarter reported sales were up 3% to $2.3 billion, led primarily by growth in the Higher Education business and Business & Industry and Sports & Entertainment sectors. Organic sales growth was 3% in the quarter. For the 9 months, reported sales were up 5% to $7.1 billion on organic growth of 3%. Year-to-date performance was also led by solid growth in most sectors and particularly strong growth in Higher Education.
Turning now to the sectors within North America, our Business & Industry sector had a mid-single digit sales increase for the quarter and a high single-digit sales increase for the 9 months. This reflects the positive impact from the Filterfresh acquisition, which closed on 2011, October of 2011. Our B&I facilities business also contributed to the increase in the quarter with our remote services growth primarily in Canada, and our business dining operations during the year were pretty much flat year-over-year.
The Education sector had low single-digit sales growth for the quarter and mid-single-digit sales growth for the 9 months, with growth in our Higher Education food business resulting from a good combination of base business growth and strong new sales from contract wins in prior periods.
In our Healthcare sector, we saw a slight decline in the quarter and mid-single-digit sales growth for the 9 months. The sales decline in the quarter was a result of modest base business growth that was offset by lower net new business. The growth for the 9-month period was primarily a result of the acquisition in March 2011 of Masterplan within our Healthcare Technologies business.
Our Sports & Entertainment sector had low single-digit sales growth for the quarter and for the 9 months. But for the quarter, we've seen pretty solid performance in our Major League Baseball venues, with growth in both the tenants and per capita spending and good growth in our amphitheater business, with a significant increase in the number of shows and attendance growth. Our growth for the 9-month period was negatively affected by the NBA strike in our first quarter, but that was offset more or less by solid results during the NHL season and recent strength in MLB performance as I mentioned. Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment increased by 5% in the quarter to $103 million, led by profit growth in our Higher Education business. For the 9 months, segment adjusted operating income grew 5% to $388 million, again led by strong profit growth in Higher Education business and the Healthcare sector, offset by profit decline in our Business & Industry sector. Our results for the 9 months were reduced by approximately $4 million of planned acquisition-related transition and integration cost absorbed in the first quarter, as well as the recognition as we mentioned last year -- during last year of approximately $8 million of income related to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service under which they paid down a portion of our possessed reinterest in one of our concession contracts. Without these 2 particular items, year-over-year profit growth for the 9 months would have been in the high single digits.
Now turning to the International Food and Support Services segment, third quarter reported sales of $674 million were down 3% from the prior year period, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Organic sales growth for the quarter was actually 4% due to positive growth in Ireland, South America and China, that was partially offset by sales declines in the U.K. and Spain. For the 9 months, reported sales of $2 billion decreased 1% compared to the prior year, also primarily due to the stronger dollar. Organic growth was 4%, again led primarily by growth in Germany, Ireland, South America and China, which more than offset a sales decline in the U.K. and Belgium.
Third quarter adjusted operating income was $25 million, which was about even when compared to the prior year quarter. But currency translation negatively affected profit growth by approximately 8 percentage points. Results in the quarter primarily reflect the improving profit performance in the U.K, Ireland and Chile, offsetting a profit decline in continental Europe. For the 9 months, adjusted operating income was $74 million, up from $64 million in the prior year. Growth was driven by the U.K, Ireland, Germany, Spain, Chile and China, partially offset by Belgium and by our AIM joint venture in Japan. Currency translation also negatively affected profit growth by approximately 3 percentage points.
You may recall, there are a number of unusual items last year and a couple this year in the International segment. In 2012, we recorded severance-related charges and VAT income in the U.K. and in 2011, the results included a gain on the sale of a non-core subsidiary in Chile, the receipt of VAT income in the U.K, a gain on the sale of land in Chile, severance-related charges and the write-down of the goodwill and other intangible assets relating to our operations in India. Adjusting for currency translation and these unusual items in both years, adjusted operating income would've grown by double digits versus last year.
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, third quarter sales of $343 million were up 3% from the year ago quarter on both a reported and organic basis. Improving organic growth rates in the uniform rental business, which were in the mid-single digits for the quarter, were offset by softness in our direct sale business, partially reflecting large customer direct sale programs, which were launched in the first half of 2011 that have not been repeated in 2012. And for the 9 months, segment sales of $1 billion were up 1% from the prior year on a reported and organic basis. We continue to invest in additional rental sales personnel resources to support accelerated new sales growth, while maintaining a disciplined approach to contract pricing. We are gaining improved traction in our new sales efforts and continue to gain momentum as the volume of new sales in the third quarter and for the 9 months delivered by our sales force significantly exceeded the prior year results, driven by both higher sales headcount and higher sales rep productivity. The segment's third quarter adjusted operating income was $37 million, which was about even with the same period last year and for the 9 months. Adjusted operating income was $107 million, down from $112 million for the same period last year. As we have discussed in previous quarters, the increased sales costs, including installation costs associated with substantially higher levels of new business and higher merchandise amortization will continue to depress profit growth in the near term. But we, of course, believe these efforts will lead to both improving rental sales and profit growth as we move forward.
Corporate expenses, excluding the items that Karen mentioned earlier, were $9 million in the quarter compared to $7.2 million a year ago. And for the 9 months, expenses were $24.9 million compared to $23.7 million in the prior year.
So at this point, let me turn it back to Karen for some additional details in the quarter and our year-to-date performance."

I'd like to comment on our financing, capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending June 29 was $1.136 billion, which was about equal to the $1.136 billion we reported as of March 30, 2012, and up fro",574,"Thanks, Fred. I'd like to comment on our financing, capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending June 29 was $1.136 billion, which was about equal to the $1.136 billion we reported as of March 30, 2012, and up from $1.1 billion at September 30, 2011. Interest and other financing costs were $88 million for the third quarter compared to $113 million in the prior year. Our interest expense in the quarter was lower, primarily as a result of a number of interest rate swaps that matured at the end of March 2012. For the 9 months, interest and other financing costs were $315 million, equal to the prior year's expense.
In the second quarter of 2012, we recorded approximately $11 million of expenses related to the term loan extension we completed that quarter. In 2011, we had interest income of approximately $14 million recorded related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims from prior periods. Including the impact of interest rate hedges, approximately 50% of our total debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates, and our overall weighted average cost of debt is approximately 5.1%.
Total reported debt at the end of the third quarter was $5.782 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.953 billion, including a term loan balance of $3.281 billion and a revolver balance of $375 million. In June 2012, we amended our accounts receivable securitization facility, increasing the maximum amount from $250 million to $300 million and extending the maturity date to January 2015. The facility had $253 million utilized at quarter end. During the quarter, our $250 million, 5% notes matured and were repaid with revolver borrowings, which did not increase our total debt. We had approximately $273 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility as of quarter end. Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio was 3.41x as of June 29, up modestly from 3.22x as of March 30, 2012, and equal to the 3.41x reported as of July 1, 2011. This slight increase in the ratio from March 30 reflects our utilization of the revolver to fund the 5% note redemption. Overall, we are pleased with our EBITDA growth and our ratio momentum, and we anticipate further ratio improvement over time. Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $74 million compared to $60 million in the prior year quarter. For the year-to-date, net capital expenditures total $219 million compared to $180 million in the same period last year as we focused on making prudent investments in growth opportunities and in our infrastructure.
As expected and consistent with historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash for us during the first 9 months of our fiscal year. We are continuing to maintain our focus on working capital management as we move through the fourth quarter, which is our strongest seasonal period from a working capital and free cash flow standpoint. For the year-to-date, we have spent a total of $151 million on acquisitions compared to $157 million in the prior year period. This year's spending related primarily to the acquisition of Filterfresh within our North American refreshment services business in October of 2011. We continue to evaluate and seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies, but will be prudent and disciplined in the pursuit of these opportunities.
Now let me turn the call back over to Fred."

So summing up our performance so far this year, our global Food and Support Services business has delivered solid organic growth with strong profit growth. The uniform rental business is gaining traction from the significant investment we have made over the past several quarters in accelerating new sales and now is performing at the mid-single-digit growth levels. As we look forward, while we will be working to deliver improving organic growth rates and continued margin improvement, slowing economic growth will clearly pose a challenge to certain sectors and countries. We believe that there are many attractive growth opportunities in front of us despite the economic climate as many of our sectors remain significantly underpenetrated. We remain excited about pursuing these opportunities.
Overall, we continue to benefit from our portfolio of sectors, geographies and clients, which we feel provide us with good balance. We plan to invest appropriately in the pursuit of these many opportunities in the months and years ahead, while still managing our cost structure and cash flow in a very disciplined manner.

So our base U.K. business is feeling some negative effect from the Olympics. As you know, there was quite a bit of controversy about the traffic and the setup of the special dedicated traffic lanes for VIPs and the like. And our sense is that many people, particularly focused on taking vacation at this time. On the other hand, we will clearly have sales associated with what's proving to be a incredibly successful performance by us in feeding athletes at the Olympic Games. It's not, as you know, really very much in the way of profit for us, but it does -- it create a fair amount of sales, which I'm sure just from a sales point of view would more than offset the weakness in our base U.K. operations."

Here with me today is Fred Sutherland, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Fred and I will present an overview of our third quarter and year-to-date results and business operations, after which, there will be an opportunity for phone-in participants to ask questions.
I would like to remind you that any recording or other use or transmission of this audio may not be done without the prior written consent of ARAMARK. As we discuss the results, you may want to refer to the Form 10-Q we filed earlier today, which contains our third quarter results for fiscal 2012. This Form 10-Q can be found on our website at www.aramark.com.
In today's discussion of results, we mention certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Form 10-Q, as well as schedules we posted to our website prior to this call, include reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures as required by SEC rules. Our discussion of operating income during today's call will in each instance, exclude the incremental intangibles amortization and property and equipment depreciation expense resulting from the going private transaction, the impact of stock option expense and the impact on the change in fair value related to our gasoline and diesel fuel agreements. All of these items are detailed in the schedules posted to our website before this call. In addition, the prior year period results have been restated to present the results of the Galls business as a discontinued operation, as we sold it in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
Various remarks that we make in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts, including remarks about future expectations, anticipation, belief, estimates, plans and prospects, constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors, MD&A and other sections of our Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q filed earlier today. We disclaim any duty to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future events or otherwise.
I will now turn the program over to Fred."

As we've done in prior quarters, I'd like to review our business and operating results, and then Karen will cover a few additional details on our performance focu",1496,"Good afternoon, everybody and thanks for joining us for our third quarter 2012 results call. As we've done in prior quarters, I'd like to review our business and operating results, and then Karen will cover a few additional details on our performance focused on cash flow and the balance sheet.
During the quarter, we saw significant slowing in U.S. job growth and continued economic uncertainty in Europe. Our organic growth rate declined slightly in part due to the normal seasonal mix shift between our higher growing Education business and our slower growing business in Sports & Entertainment sectors. We continue to see positive growth trends in certain of our sectors as a result of contributions from both base business and new business wins. Year-to-date, our new customer sales are growing in the double digits and net new business results are also quite strong. Our client retention rates have been consistent with our expectations and better than prior year's results. But with the economic environment weakening as the year progresses, we remain cautious and continue to maintain a very tight focus on efficiently managing our operations and our cost structure.
So now turning to our overall results for the third quarter, we achieved sales of $3.3 billion, which was up 2% as reported from the prior year quarter. Organic sales growth, which I mentioned earlier, and excludes the impact of currency translations and acquisitions and divestitures, was up 3% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $157 million, up 2% versus the prior year. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2012, sales were $10.1 billion, up 3% over the prior year period on both a reported and an organic growth basis. Our adjusted operating income of $544 million was up 4% from the prior year.
Now turning to our North America Food and Support Services segment, third quarter reported sales were up 3% to $2.3 billion, led primarily by growth in the Higher Education business and Business & Industry and Sports & Entertainment sectors. Organic sales growth was 3% in the quarter. For the 9 months, reported sales were up 5% to $7.1 billion on organic growth of 3%. Year-to-date performance was also led by solid growth in most sectors and particularly strong growth in Higher Education.
Turning now to the sectors within North America, our Business & Industry sector had a mid-single digit sales increase for the quarter and a high single-digit sales increase for the 9 months. This reflects the positive impact from the Filterfresh acquisition, which closed on 2011, October of 2011. Our B&I facilities business also contributed to the increase in the quarter with our remote services growth primarily in Canada, and our business dining operations during the year were pretty much flat year-over-year.
The Education sector had low single-digit sales growth for the quarter and mid-single-digit sales growth for the 9 months, with growth in our Higher Education food business resulting from a good combination of base business growth and strong new sales from contract wins in prior periods.
In our Healthcare sector, we saw a slight decline in the quarter and mid-single-digit sales growth for the 9 months. The sales decline in the quarter was a result of modest base business growth that was offset by lower net new business. The growth for the 9-month period was primarily a result of the acquisition in March 2011 of Masterplan within our Healthcare Technologies business.
Our Sports & Entertainment sector had low single-digit sales growth for the quarter and for the 9 months. But for the quarter, we've seen pretty solid performance in our Major League Baseball venues, with growth in both the tenants and per capita spending and good growth in our amphitheater business, with a significant increase in the number of shows and attendance growth. Our growth for the 9-month period was negatively affected by the NBA strike in our first quarter, but that was offset more or less by solid results during the NHL season and recent strength in MLB performance as I mentioned. Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment increased by 5% in the quarter to $103 million, led by profit growth in our Higher Education business. For the 9 months, segment adjusted operating income grew 5% to $388 million, again led by strong profit growth in Higher Education business and the Healthcare sector, offset by profit decline in our Business & Industry sector. Our results for the 9 months were reduced by approximately $4 million of planned acquisition-related transition and integration cost absorbed in the first quarter, as well as the recognition as we mentioned last year -- during last year of approximately $8 million of income related to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service under which they paid down a portion of our possessed reinterest in one of our concession contracts. Without these 2 particular items, year-over-year profit growth for the 9 months would have been in the high single digits.
Now turning to the International Food and Support Services segment, third quarter reported sales of $674 million were down 3% from the prior year period, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Organic sales growth for the quarter was actually 4% due to positive growth in Ireland, South America and China, that was partially offset by sales declines in the U.K. and Spain. For the 9 months, reported sales of $2 billion decreased 1% compared to the prior year, also primarily due to the stronger dollar. Organic growth was 4%, again led primarily by growth in Germany, Ireland, South America and China, which more than offset a sales decline in the U.K. and Belgium.
Third quarter adjusted operating income was $25 million, which was about even when compared to the prior year quarter. But currency translation negatively affected profit growth by approximately 8 percentage points. Results in the quarter primarily reflect improving profit performance in the U.K, Ireland and Chile, offsetting a profit decline in continental Europe. For the 9 months, adjusted operating income was $74 million, up from $64 million in the prior year. Growth was driven by the U.K, Ireland, Germany, Spain, Chile and China, partially offset by Belgium and by our AIM joint venture in Japan. Currency translation also negatively affected profit growth by approximately 3 percentage points.
You may recall, there are a number of unusual items last year and a couple this year in the International segment. In 2012, we recorded severance-related charges and VAT income in the U.K. and in 2011, the results included a gain on the sale of a non-core subsidiary in Chile, the receipt of VAT income in the U.K, a gain on the sale of land in Chile, severance-related charges and the write-down of the goodwill and other intangible assets relating to our operations in India. Adjusting for currency translation and these unusual items in both years, adjusted operating income would've grown by double digits versus last year.
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, third quarter sales of $343 million were up 3% from the year ago quarter on both a reported and organic basis. Improving organic growth rates in the uniform rental business, which were in the mid-single digits for the quarter, were offset by softness in our direct sale business, partially reflecting large customer direct sale programs, which were launched in the first half of 2011 that have not been repeated in 2012. And for the 9 months, segment sales of $1 billion were up 1% from the prior year on a reported and organic basis. We continue to invest in additional rental sales personnel resources to support accelerated new sales growth, while maintaining a disciplined approach to contract pricing. We are gaining improved traction in our new sales efforts and continue to gain momentum as the volume of new sales in the third quarter and for the 9 months delivered by our sales force significantly exceeded the prior year results, driven by both higher sales headcount and higher sales rep productivity. The segment's third quarter adjusted operating income was $37 million, which was about even with the same period last year and for the 9 months. Adjusted operating income was $107 million, down from $112 million for the same period last year. As we have discussed in previous quarters, the increased sales costs, including installation costs associated with substantially higher levels of new business and higher merchandise amortization will continue to press profit growth in the near term. But we, of course, believe these efforts will lead to both improving rental sales and profit growth as we move forward.
Corporate expenses, excluding the items that Karen mentioned earlier, were $9 million in the quarter compared to $7.2 million a year ago. And for the 9 months, expenses were $24.9 million compared to $23.7 million in the prior year.
So at this point, let me turn it back to Karen for some additional details in the quarter and our year-to-date performance."

I'd like to comment on our financing, capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12-months ending June 29 was $1.136 billion, which was about equal to the $1.136 billion we reported as of March 30, 2012, and up from $1.1 billion at September 30, 2011. Interest and other financing costs were $88 million for the third quarter compared to $113 million in the prior year. Our interest expense in the quarter was lower, primarily as a result of a number of interest rate swaps that matured at the end of March 2012. For the 9 months, interest and other financing costs were $315 million, equal to the prior year's expense.
In the second quarter of 2012, we recorded approximately $11 million of expenses related to the term loan extension we completed that quarter. In 2011, we had interest income of approximately $14 million recorded related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims from prior periods. Including the impact of interest rate hedges, approximately 50% of our total debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates, and our overall weighted average cost of debt is approximately 5.1%.
Total reported debt at the end of the third quarter was $5.782 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.953 billion, including a term loan balance of $3.281 billion and a revolver balance of $375 million. In June 2012, we amended our accounts receivable securitization facility, increasing the maximum amount from $250 million to $300 million and extending the maturity date to January 2015. The facility had $253 million utilized at quarter end. During the quarter, our $250 million, 5% note matured and were repaid with revolver borrowings, which did not increase our total debt. We had approximately $273 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility as of quarter end. Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio was 3.41x as of June 29, up modestly from 3.22x as of March 30, 2012, and equal to the 3.41x reported as of July 1, 2011. This slight increase in the ratio from March 30 reflects our utilization of the revolver to fund the 5% note redemption. Overall, we are pleased with our EBITDA growth and our ratio momentum, and we anticipate further ratio improvement over time. Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $74 million compared to $60 million in the prior year quarter. For the year-to-date, net capital expenditures total $219 million compared to $180 million in the same period last year as we focused on making prudent investments in growth opportunities and in our infrastructure.
As expected and consistent with historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash for us during the first 9 months of our fiscal year. We are continuing to maintain a focus on working capital management as we move through the fourth quarter, which is our strongest seasonal period from a working capital and free cash flow standpoint. For the year-to-date, we have spent a total of $151 million on acquisitions compared to $157 million in the prior year period. This year's spending related primarily to the acquisition of Filterfresh within our North American refreshment services business in October of 2011. We continue to evaluate and seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies, but will be prudent and disciplined in the pursuit of these opportunities.
Now let me turn the call back over to Fred."

So summing up our performance so far this year, our global Food and Support Services business has delivered solid organic growth with strong profit growth. The uniform rental business is gaining traction from the significant investment we have made over the past several quarters in accelerating new sales and now is performing at the mid-single-digit growth levels. As we look forward, while we will be working to deliver improving organic growth rates and continued margin improvement, slowing economic growth will clearly pose a challenge to certain sectors and countries. We believe that there are many attractive growth opportunities in front of us despite the economic climate as many of our sectors remain significantly underpenetrated. We remain excited about pursuing these opportunities.
Overall, we continue to benefit from our portfolio of sectors, geographies and clients, which we feel provide us with good balance. We plan to invest appropriately in the pursuit of these many opportunities in the months and years ahead, while still managing our cost structure and cash flow in a very disciplined manner.

So our base U.K. business is feeling some negative effect from the Olympics. As you know, there was quite a bit of controversy about the traffic and the setup of the special dedicated traffic lanes for VIPs and the like. And our sense is that many people, particularly focused on taking vacation at this time. On the other hand, we will clearly have sales associated with what's proving to be an incredibly successful performance by us in feeding the athletes at the Olympic Games. It's not, as you know, really very much in the way of profit for us, but it does -- it create a fair amount of sales, which I'm sure just from a sales point of view would more than offset the weakness in our base U.K. operations."

We have a benefit -- we have an advantage and a bit of a disadvantage. The advantage in Spain is we're not really very strong at all in the -- in the B&I market. We're strong in education, particularly K-12, and that's been solid. But we also have a pretty decent size business in health care, and some portion of that are public health care institutions. And those are typically funded at the state levels. And as you know, may know in Spain, there's quite a bit of back and forth between the states and the federal government with respect to funding. So that's clearly put some pressure on our health care clients. So yes, I'd say in Spain, it's a challenge. Now fortunately for us, Spain is not a huge operation."

I think it's more of a matter of internal resource allocation, capital allocation, sales resources and those sorts of things. And I think you'll find us probably be more discriminating in that sense -- in that regard than we have been.

As in prior quarters, I'd like to review our business and operating results and then ask Karen to cover a few additional details on our performance. Overall, our results for fiscal 2012 were in line with the economic conditions in the countries in which we operate. Our operations in China and South America are continuing to grow at significantly higher rates than our total portfolio of businesses. And we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for these regions. As you would expect, Continental Europe results were more mixed as our operations in Spain and Belgium struggled, while Germany continued to deliver solid performance. Our U.K. and Ireland operations realize the benefit of substantial cost reduction efforts in prior years. In North America, our Higher Education business continues to lead our overall growth.
2012 was a record year for us in terms of new sales across our food facilities and uniform businesses. With the new sales contracted our installed up over 30% over the prior year, providing us with a strong carrying rate of business for 2013. If you see -- SEC in the financial statement released earlier today, our free cash flow for the year was also very strong led by our continued emphasis on working capital and earnings growth for the year.
One of our proudest accomplish this year was our success -- is the exclusive catering provider to more than 15,000 athletes, officials and staff in the Athletes' Village over the duration of duration of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London this summer. During the games, our staff of over 3,500 underground in London served over 1.5 million meals peaking at 65,000 meals per day. London was ARAMARK's 16 Olympic Games.
We were also proud to have posted delegates and other attendees at the Republican national convention in Tampa Bay September, serving nearly 15,000 meals over the span of 5 days. And earlier in the summer, we served baseball fans attending the major league baseball All-Star game in Kansas City. We deeply appreciate the trust our clients place in us to serve at these very important events.
Now turning to the details of our results for the year, I'd like to first take you through our overall financial performance and then I'll discuss our business. We reported fiscal 2012 fourth quarter sales of $3.4 billion, up 3% from the prior-year quarter. Organic sales growth, which as you know, excludes the impact of currency translation and acquisitions and divestitures was 4% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income 2012 was $206 million, up 5% versus the prior fourth year. For the full fiscal year 2012, sales were $13.5 billion, up 3% over the prior period on a reported basis and 4% on an organic growth basis. Our adjusted operating income of $750 million was up 4% the prior year.
Now turning to our North America Food and Support Services segment, fourth quarter reported sales were up 3% to $2.4 billion led primarily by growth in the Higher Education business and our Business & Industry sector. Organic sales growth was 3% in the quarter. For the full-year 2012, reported sales were up 4% to $9.4 billion with organic growth of 3%. Year-to-date performance was led by solid growth in all sectors and particularly, strong growth in our Higher Education sector. Now taking a closer look at the sectors within North America, our Business & Industry sector has a high single-digit sales increase for the quarter and for the full-year, reflecting the positive impact sectors from the Filterfresh acquisition, which, as you may recall, close in early October of 2011. So the very beginning of the business of business of fiscal year 2012.
Growth in the quarter was port about improved base business growth in our Refreshment Services business, while our B&I facilities business also contributed to the increase at both the quarter and for the full year, primarily due to strong growth in our remote services operations in Canada. Our business operations dining divisions experienced a slight sales declined 2012 versus the prior year for both the quarter and the full fiscal year. Our by the Education sector had low single-digit sales growth for the quarter and mid-single-digit sales growth of the fiscal year, primarily driven by higher growth in average in our higher education food business, resulting from a combination of these business growth and very solid new sales from contract wins in prior periods.
In our Healthcare sector, we experienced low single-digit sales growth in the quarter and for the full year. The sales growth in the quarter was a result of base business within our health care technologies business, as well as new business with that health care hospitality. The growth of the full-year fiscal 2012 was primarily a result of base business growth and the acquisition and March of 2011 of Masterplan within our health care technologies business.
Powersports and Entertainment Center had a low single-digit sales increase in the quarter and for the full year. For the quarter, we reported growth in our amphitheater business, somewhat offset by timing of Major League Baseball gains in the early effects of the NHL lockout, which the defect September. Our growth for fiscal 2012 was negatively affected by the NBA strike earlier in the year but that impact was offset by solid results during the NHL season last year and the strength of Major League Baseball.
Adjusted operating income in the North America Food and Support Services segment increased by 7% in the quarter to $153 million, led by profit growth in our Business & Industry and sports event payment sectors. Profit for the fourth quarter included recognition of approximately $7 million of income related to a compensation agreement with the National Park Service, bridge they paid down a portion of our interest at one of our terminated life locations.
For fiscal 2012, segment adjusted operating income grew 5% to $541 million, led by strong profit growth in our Higher Education business and the Healthcare sector. Results for fiscal 2011 included the recognition of approximately $8 million of income in the first quarter, also related similarly to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service, under which they paid down a portion of our recessionary inter- support of our concession contracts.
Turning to the international Food and Support Services segment, fourth quarter reported sales of $699 million were up 3% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic basis. Sales growth in the quarter was due to positive growth in Ireland, South America and China, as well as the sales impact from our role as exclusive food service provider in the Athletes' Village  for the London Olympics games. This growth was partially offset by sales declines in the U.K.-based business and Spain. But fiscal year 2012, our reported sales of $2.7 million reflect compared to the prior year on a reported basis primarily due to the impact a the stronger dollar.
Organic growth was 6%, again led primarily by the Olympic Games but also due to growth in Germany, Ireland, South America and China, which more than offset the sales decline in the U.K.-based business in Spain and in Belgium.
Fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $27 million, which was down about 3% when compared to the prior-year quarter, with currency translation negatively affecting profit growth by approximately 4 percentage points. Results in the quarter primarily reflects improving profit performance in the U.K. and in Ireland, of which I think is particularly admirable in a very difficult economic environment, which was offset by a profit decline in Continental Europe.
For the first -- for the full fiscal year 2012, adjusted operating income was $100 million, up from $91 million in the prior year. Growth was driven by the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Chili in China and partially offset by Belgium and our AIF joint venture in Japan. Currency translation also negatively affected profit growth by about 4 percentage points.
 
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, fourth quarter sales of $342 million were up 3% from the year-ago quarter on both a reported and an organic basis. Improving organic growth rates in the uniform rental business, which in the fourth quarter were in the mid-single digits, were offset by softness in our direct sale business. For the fiscal year 2012, segment sales of $1.4 billion were up 2% from the prior year on both a reported and organic basis. We're continuing to invest in additional rental sales personnel resources to support accelerated new sales growth. We're gaining improved traction in our new sales efforts as where accounts continue to grow. Our new business installed in 2012 was up over 20% for the full year as a result of both a larger sales force and increased sales productivity. And of course, we're paying the price that the bids on both our sales expense and our merchandise amortization.
The segments fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $38 million. This compares to fourth quarter 2011 adjusted operating income of $34 million. Results from 2011 included restructuring expenses following our divestiture of our call subsidiary in September of 2011. Excluding these costs from the prior year, adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2012 would've been up invincible digits, which is an improvement from recent quarters. For the full fiscal year, adjusted operating income was $145 million, down slightly from the $146 million in the prior year. And as I mentioned, increased sales cost of the expansion of the sales force and a significant increase in our merchandise amortization cost associated with substantially higher levels of new business have had a negative impact on profit growth in the year. But we firmly believe that over the intermediate term, these efforts are leading to both improving rental sales and profit growth as we look further into 2013.
Corporate expenses, which excludes the items Karen mentioned earlier were $11.5 million in the quarter compared to $8.5 million a rental. And for the fiscal year 2012, expenses were $36.4 million compared to $32.2 million in the prior year. Now let me turn it back over to Karen from some additional details in the quarter and the fiscal year."

Interest and other financial costs were $87 million from the fourth quarter compared to $111 million in the prior year. Our interest expense in the quarter was lower financing primarily as a result of the number of interest rate swaps swaps that matured at the end of March 2012. For the fiscal year 2012, interest and other financing costs were $402 million, down from the prior year's expense of $426 million. In the second quarter of 2012, we reported approximately $11 million of expenses related to the term loan extension we  during the quarter. In 2011, we had interest income of approximately $14 million recorded that was related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims from prior periods. Including the impact of interest rate hedges, approximately 50% of our total debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates in our overall weighted average cost of that is approximately 5.1%.
Total reported debt at the end of fiscal year 2012 was $5.413 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.602 billion, including a term loan balance of $3.29 billion and a revolver balance that was 0. In June 2012, we amended our accounts receivable securitization facility, increasing the maximum amount from $250 million to $300 million and extended the maturity date to January of 2015. That facility had $264 million utilized at year-end. We also had approximately $649 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility as of year-end.
Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio was 3.11 ask as of September 28, which is down from the 3.41x group reported as of June 29, 2012, and that 3.17x we reported that the end of September 30, 2011.
During 2012, we utilized $250 million of free cash flow to fund the repayment of our 5% notes. And without this maturity, we would've utilized free cash flow to pay down secured debt, and we would've seen a more substantial improvement in our secured debt ratio, consistent with our strong cash flow performance of the year. Our ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA the end of fiscal 2012 was 4.76x, and this compares to 5.09x at the end of the third quarter and 5.13x as of the end of fiscal 2011.
Overall, we're pleased with our EBITDA growth and our ratio momentum, and we anticipate for the Rachel improvement over time.
Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $124 million compared to $92 million in the prior-year quarter. For the fiscal year, net capital expenditures totaled $343 million compared to $272 million in the same period last year. This higher level of spending reflects planned investment in our infrastructure, as well as our sales growth objectives.
Consistent with our historical patterns, working capital was a source of cash restaurant the fourth quarter. Individual good working capital as a relatively moderate stores of cash over and over the years. We would anticipate that we will potentially more typical pattern in fiscal 2013, with working capital requiring a modest bump level of investments.
For the year, we're very pleased with our free cash flow performance before acquisitions and divestitures. As we generated approximately $403 million of free cash flow in fiscal 2012, a total debt exceeded our plan and reflects our growth in operating income and continued strong focus on working capital this plan.
For the fiscal year, we spent a total of $152 million on acquisitions compared to $167 million in the prior year period. This year's spending related primarily to the acquisition of Filterfresh and our North American Refreshment Services business, which closed in October of 2011. We continue to evaluate in seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies but we plan to be prudent and disciplined in the pursuit of these opportunities. Now let me turn the call back over to Fred."

We have strong positions and attractive sectors, great people with the pride and passion, strong valleys and desire to do the right thing and a focus on client service. We believe there are many attractive growth opportunities in front of us despite economic client decline -- economic climate as many of our factors remain significantly underpenetrated. Remain excited about pursuing those opportunities. We need to create growth really positions as we start to become the most valued part to our plant and consumers. And on the cost side, we see additional opportunities to prove our performance. In late 2011, we initiatives aimed at delivering or improved organic growth and continued margin improvement in the company in the coming years. These activities have already delivered benefit for 2012, but we are committed to continue to improve our standards processes and systems, bringing efficiency and improve effectiveness to how we serve our clients a customer 70 around the world. During 2013, we're planning to further accelerate this process standardization, which we believe will help us not ongoing margin improvement.

And because we had particularly let's say in Sports & Entertainment and our higher education operations, we have lots and lots of seasonal workers and apply so we had some concern about that on average the work less than 30 hours a you a week but we don't work less than 30 hours of the company. That's just the regulations that up just on that and it appears that our concern about having a huge increase in eligibility as a result of seasonal workers who average over below 30 hours a week be eligible is not found. So we're heartened by that. And as a result, the impact on us is less significant than we feared that it would be might be. So we're still working through all the details. As you know there's still regulations, clarifications coming out as we speak. There are -- clearly other actions that we can take in some other companies have started to do or talked about which is changing the mix between part-time and full-time workers. So it's difficult to quantify the impact. I guess I would say it's not -- it's not insignificant but it doesn't rise to the level of potentially a major EB I impact as we had in a little bit concerned about it as looked at it a year ago.

Now those are not nationals are reflected in our P&L over time as contract actually come out or as contracts are at it and we start to operate them. And for 2012, as I mentioned briefly in my opening remarks, we had a pretty strong performance overall, and this is -- both the North American food service business, the food facilities business, and the International business in the uniform business and the annualized value -- in the annualized sales value of new contracts that we were awarded sometime during the year was up around 20% or so. And that of course is something that will grow into the financial statements as those contracts are started off. And our -- the dollar value of the contracts that we lost during the year was down I think about between 5% and 10%. So the net new business as a result since the new business was up, loss business was down, the net new business was up a fair amount. And so we were fairly -- fairly pleased on that. We've been more focused particularly on adding new business.

As in prior quarters, I'd like to review our business and operating results and then ask Karen to cover a few additional details on",1734,"Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining us as we review our fiscal 2012 fourth quarter and our full-year results. As in prior quarters, I'd like to review our business and operating results and then ask Karen to cover a few additional details on our performance. Overall, our results for fiscal 2012 were in line with the economic conditions in the countries in which we operate. Our operations in China and South America are continuing to grow at significantly higher rates than our total portfolio of businesses. And we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for these regions. As you would expect, Continental Europe results were more mixed as our operations in Spain and Belgium struggled, while Germany continued to deliver solid performance. Our U.K. and Ireland operations realize the benefit of substantial cost reduction efforts in prior years. In North America, our Higher Education business continues to lead our overall growth.
2012 was a record year for us in terms of new sales across our food facilities and uniform businesses. With the new sales contracted or installed up over 30% over the prior year, providing us with a strong carrying rate of business for 2013. If you see -- as you've seen in the financial statement released earlier today, our free cash flow for the year was also very strong led by our continued emphasis on working capital and earnings growth for the year.
One of our proudest accomplishments this year was our success -- is the exclusive catering provider to more than 15,000 athletes, officials and staff in the Athletes' Village over the duration of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London this summer. During the games, our staff of over 3,500 on the ground in London served over 1.5 million meals peaking at 65,000 meals per day. London was ARAMARK's 16the Olympic Games.
We were also proud to have hosted delegates and other attendees at the Republican National Convention in Tampa Bay in September, serving nearly 15,000 meals over the span of 5 days. And earlier in the summer, we served baseball fans attending the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Kansas City. We deeply appreciate the trust our clients place in us to serve at these very important events.
Now turning to the details of our results for the year, I'd like to first take you through our overall financial performance and then I'll discuss our business segments. We reported fiscal 2012 fourth quarter sales of $3.4 billion, up 3% from the prior year quarter. Organic sales growth, which as you know excludes the impact of currency translation and acquisitions and divestitures, was 4% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $206 million, up 5% versus the prior year. For the full fiscal year 2012, sales were $13.5 billion, up 3% over the prior period on a reported basis and 4% on an organic growth basis. Our adjusted operating income of $750 million was up 4% for the prior year.
Now turning to our North American Food and Support Services segment, fourth quarter reported sales were up 3% to $2.4 billion led primarily by growth in the Higher Education business and our Business & Industry sector. Organic sales growth was 3% in the quarter. For the full-year 2012, reported sales were up 4% to $9.4 billion with organic growth of 3%. Year-to-date performance was led by solid growth in all sectors and particularly strong growth in our Higher Education sector. 
Now taking a closer look at the sectors within North America, our Business & Industry sector had a high single-digit sales increase for the quarter and for the full-year, reflecting the positive impact from the Filterfresh acquisition which, as you may recall, closed in early October of 2011, so the very beginning of this -- of fiscal year 2012.
Growth in the quarter was supported by improved base business growth in our Refreshment Services business, while our B&I facilities business also contributed to the increase in both the quarter and for the full year, primarily due to strong growth in our remote services operations in Canada. Our business operations Dining divisions experienced a slight sales decline versus the prior year for both the quarter and the full fiscal year. The Education sector had low single-digit sales growth for the quarter and mid-single digit sales growth for the fiscal year, primarily driven by higher growth in the average -- in our Higher Education food business, resulting from a combination of base business growth and very solid new sales from contract wins in prior periods.
In our Healthcare sector, we experienced low single-digit sales growth in the quarter and for the full year. The sales growth in the quarter was a result of base business growth and our Healthcare Technologies business, as well as new business growth in Healthcare Hospitality. The growth of the full-year fiscal 2012 was primarily a result of base business growth and the acquisition in March of 2011 of Masterplan within our health care technologies business.
Our Sports & Entertainment sector had a low single-digit sales increase for the quarter and for the full year. For the quarter, we reported good growth in our amphitheater business, somewhat offset by the timing of Major League Baseball gains in the early effects of the NHL lockout, which the defect September. Our growth for fiscal 2012 was negatively affected by the NBA strike earlier in the year, but that impact was offset by solid results during the NHL season last year and the strength in Major League Baseball.
Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment increased by 7% in the quarter to $153 million, led by profit growth in our Business & Industry and Sports & Entertainment sectors. Profit for the fourth quarter included recognition of approximately $7 million of income related to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service, under which they paid down a portion of our possessed reinterest of one of our terminated client locations.
For fiscal 2012, segment adjusted operating income grew 5% to $541 million, led by strong profit growth in our Higher Education business and the Healthcare sector. Results for fiscal 2011 included the recognition of approximately $8 million of income in the first quarter, also related similarly to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service, under which they paid down a portion of our possessed reinterest at one of our concession contracts.
Turning to the International Food and Support Services segment, fourth quarter reported sales of $699 million were up 3% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic basis. Sales growth for the quarter was due to positive growth in Ireland, South America and China, as well as the sales impact from our role as the exclusive food service provider in the Athletes' Village for the London Olympics games. This growth was partially offset by sales decline in the U.K.-based business and Spain. 
For the fiscal year 2012, our reported sales of $2.7 billion were flat compared to the prior year on a reported basis primarily due to the impact a the stronger dollar. Organic growth was 6%, again led primarily by the Olympic Games, but also due to growth in Germany, Ireland, South America and China, which more than offset the sales decline in the U.K.-based business, in Spain and in Belgium.
Fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $27 million, which was down about 3% when compared to the prior year quarter, with currency translation negatively affecting profit growth by approximately 4 percentage points. Results in the quarter primarily reflect improving profit performance in the U.K. and in Ireland, of which I think is particularly admirable in a very difficult economic environment, which was offset by a profit decline in Continental Europe.
For the first -- for the full fiscal year of 2012, adjusted operating income was $100 million, up from $91 million in the prior year. Growth was driven by the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Chile and China, and partially offset by Belgium and our AIM joint venture in Japan. Currency translation also negatively affected profit growth by about 4 percentage points.
 
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, fourth quarter sales of $342 million were up 3% from the year-ago quarter on both a reported and an organic basis. Improving organic growth rates in the uniform rental business, which in the fourth quarter were in the mid-single digits, were offset by softness in our direct sale business. For the fiscal year 2012, segment sales of $1.4 billion were up 2% from the prior year on both a reported and organic basis. 
We're continuing to invest in additional rental sales personnel resources to support accelerated new sales growth. We're gaining improved traction in our new sales efforts as wear [ph] accounts continue to grow. Our new business installed in 2012 was up over 20% for the full year as a result of both a larger sales force and increased sales productivity. And, of course, we're paying the price of that a bit on both our sales expense and our merchandise amortization.
The segment's fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $38 million. This compares to fourth quarter of 2011 adjusted operating income of $34 million. Results from 2011 included restructuring expenses following our divestiture of our Galls subsidiary in September of 2011. Excluding these costs from the prior year, adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2012 would've been up in the mid-single digits, which is an improvement from recent quarters. 
For the full fiscal year, adjusted operating income was $145 million, down slightly from the $146 million of the prior year. And as I mentioned, increased sales cost of the expansion of the sales force and a significant increase in our merchandise amortization cost associated with substantially higher levels of new business have had a negative impact on profit growth in the year. But we firmly believe that over the intermediate term, these efforts are leading to both improving rental sales and profit growth as we look further into 2013.
Corporate expenses, which exclude the items Karen mentioned earlier, were $11.5 million in the quarter compared to $8.5 million a year ago. And for the fiscal year 2012, expenses were $36.4 million compared to $32.2 million in the prior year. Now let me turn it back over to Karen from some additional details in the quarter and the fiscal year."

I'd like to comment on our financing, capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending September 28 was $1.136 billion, equal to the figure we reported as of June 29, 2012, and up from the $1.1 billion as of September 30, 2011. Interest and other financing costs were $87 million for the fourth quarter compared to $111 million in the prior year. Our interest expense in the quarter was lower primarily as a result of a number of interest rate swaps that matured at the end of March 2012. 
For the fiscal year 2012, interest and other financing costs were $402 million, down from the prior year's expense of $426 million. In the second quarter of 2012, we reported approximately $11 million of expenses related to the term loan extension we completed during the quarter. In 2011, we had interest income of approximately $14 million recorded that was related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims from prior periods. Including the impact of interest rate hedges, approximately 50% of our total debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates, and our overall weighted average cost of debt is approximately 5.1%.
Total reported debt at the end of fiscal year 2012 was $5.413 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.602 billion, including a term loan balance of $3.289 billion and a revolver balance that was 0. In June 2012, we amended our accounts receivable securitization facility, increasing the maximum amount from $250 million to $300 million and extending the maturity date to January of 2015. That facility had $264 million utilized at year end. We also had approximately $649 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility as of year end. Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio was 3.11x as of September 28, which is down from the 3.41x we reported as of June 29, 2012, and that 3.17x we reported that the end of September 30, 2011.
During 2012, we utilized $250 million of free cash flow to fund the repayment of our 5% notes. Without this maturity, we would've utilized free cash flow to pay down secured debt, and we would've seen a more substantial improvement in our secured debt ratio, consistent with our strong cash flow performance for the year. Our ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA at end of fiscal 2012 was 4.76x, and this compares to 5.09x at the end of the third quarter and 5.13x as of the end of fiscal 2011. Overall, we're pleased with our EBITDA growth and our ratio momentum, and we anticipate further ratio improvement over time. 
Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $124 million compared to $92 million in the prior year quarter. For the fiscal year, net capital expenditures totaled $343 million compared to $272 million in the same period last year. This higher level of spending reflects planned investment in our infrastructure, as well as our sales growth objectives.
Consistent with our expectations and historical patterns, working capital was a significant source of cash for us during the fourth quarter. We ended the year with working capital as a relatively moderate source of cash overall for the year. We would anticipate that we will return to a more typical pattern in fiscal 2013, with working capital requiring a modest level of investments.
For the year, we're very pleased with our free cash flow performance before acquisitions and divestitures as we generated approximately $403 million of free cash flow in fiscal 2012, a total that exceeded our plan and reflects our growth in operating income and continued strong focus on working capital this plan.
For the fiscal year, we spent a total of $152 million on acquisitions compared to $167 million in the prior year period. This year's spending, related primarily to the acquisition of Filterfresh and our North American Refreshment Services business, which closed in October of 2011. We continue to evaluate and seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies, but we plan to be prudent and disciplined in the pursuit of these opportunities. 
Now let me turn the call back over to Fred."

So summing up our performance for this fiscal year, our global Food and Support Services business has delivered solid organic growth, with slightly stronger profit growth. Our uniform rental business is gaining traction from the significant investments we've made over the past several quarters and accelerating new sales. 
As we look forward, we have strengths that we need to leverage. We have strong positions and attractive sectors, great people with pride and passion, strong values and the desire to do the right thing and a focus on client service. We believe there are many attractive growth opportunities in front of us despite the economic clients -- the economic climate, as many of our sectors remained significantly under-penetrated. We remain excited about pursuing those opportunities. We need to create growth-relating [ph] positions as we strive to become the most valued partner to our clients and consumers.
And on the cost side, we see additional opportunities to improve our performance. In late 2011, we embarked on a number of internal initiatives aimed at delivering improved organic growth and continued margin improvement in the coming years. These activities have already delivered benefits in 2012, but we are committed to continue to improve our standards, processes and systems, bringing efficiencies and improved effectiveness to how we serve our clients and customers everyday around the world. During 2013, we're planning to further accelerate this process standardization, which we believe will help us drive ongoing margin improvement.

We were, as we looked at the legislation as it stood, one of our concerns was whether this -- the requirement of at least 30 hours a week to qualify for health care benefits, how that would apply to seasonal workers. And because we have, particularly let's say in Sports & Entertainment and our Higher Education operations, we have lots and lots of seasonal workers, and so we had some concern about that. On average, they work less than 30 hours a week, but they don't work less than 30 hours every week. There's new regulations that have just come out on that and it appears that our concern about having a huge increase in eligibility as a result of seasonal workers who average over below 30 hours a week being eligible is not found -- or is not founded, so we're heartened by that. And as a result, the impact on us is less significant than we feared that it might be. So we're still working through all the details. As you know, there's still regulations, clarifications coming out as we speak. There are clearly other actions that we can take that some other companies have started to do or talked about, which is changing the mix between part-time and full-time workers. So it's difficult to quantify the impact. I guess, I would say, it's not insignificant but it doesn't rise to the level of potentially a major EBIT impact, as we had been a little bit concerned about it as looked at it a year ago. So we're looking at something that's in the tens of millions before mitigation."

Now those are not -- those are reflected in our P&L over time as the contracts are actually come out or as contracts are added and we start to operate them. And for 2012, as I mentioned briefly in my opening remarks, we had a pretty strong performance overall, and this is both the North American food service business -- food facilities business, the International business and the Uniform business, and the annualized value -- the annualized sales value of new contracts that we were awarded sometime during the year was up around 20% or so. And that of course is something that will roll into the financial statements as those contracts are started off. And our -- the dollar value of the contracts that we lost during the year was down I think about between 5% and 10%. So the net new business, as a result since the new business was up and the loss business was down, the net new business was up a fair amount. And so we were fairly pleased on that.

Our food costs generally run in the low 30% of our sales. Our labor costs run in the 40% range of our sales. And we're looking to, over time, over a multiyear period, have a meaningful impact on those costs. So we view it as something that's meaningful in the context of our overall P&L, I mean, given that we're essentially in a 5.5% to 6% margin business. The costs associated with it, there are really 2 buckets of costs. One is we're, as Karen alluded to, we need to increase our IT and infrastructure spending. So some of it is systems, there's a capital expenditure that's got some P&L applications and depreciation. It's not something that just drastically changes our overall capital budget, so it's not of that order of magnitude. And then there's an ongoing P&L component as well as we standardize and centralize some of these processes, you just need people to be able to execute that and roll that out across literally thousands of units, so there are period costs associated with that. It's a net positive. It's meaningful for 2013 and we expect to continue to reap benefit from it year-after-year for at least the next 2 to 3 years."

We don't target a particular debt ratio, but we look to improve our debt ratio over time. But we've also been very clear that if we have the right acquisition that we think strategically is important, these are moved into a fast-growing region of the world or to expand our service capability to make us a stronger player in the market, we will do that.

As in prior quarters, I'd like to review our business and operating results and then ask Karen to cover a few additional details on",1740,"Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining us as we review our fiscal 2012 fourth quarter and our full-year results. As in prior quarters, I'd like to review our business and operating results and then ask Karen to cover a few additional details on our performance. Overall, our results for fiscal 2012 were in line with the economic conditions in the countries in which we operate. Our operations in China and South America are continuing to grow at significantly higher rates than our total portfolio of businesses. And we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for these regions. As you would expect, Continental Europe results were more mixed as our operations in Spain and Belgium struggled, while Germany continued to deliver solid performance. Our U.K. and Ireland operations realized the benefit of substantial cost reduction efforts in prior years. In North America, our Higher Education business continues to lead our overall growth.
2012 was a record year for us in terms of new sales across our food facilities and uniform businesses. With the new sales contracted or installed up over 30% over the prior year, providing us with a strong carry-in rate of business for 2013. If you see -- as you've seen in the financial statement released earlier today, our free cash flow for the year was also very strong led by our continued emphasis on working capital and earnings growth for the year.
One of our proudest accomplishments this year was our success  as the exclusive catering provider to more than 15,000 athletes, officials and staff in the Athletes' Village over the duration of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London this summer. During the games, our staff of over 3,500 on the ground in London served over 1.5 million meals peaking at 65,000 meals per day. London was ARAMARK's sixteenth Olympic Games.
We were also proud to have hosted delegates and other attendees at the Republican National Convention in Tampa Bay in September, serving nearly 15,000 meals over the span of 5 days. And earlier in the summer, we served baseball fans attending the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Kansas City. We deeply appreciate the trust our clients place in us to serve at these very important events.
Now turning to the details of our results for the year, I'd like to first take you through our overall financial performance and then I'll discuss our business segments. We reported fiscal 2012 fourth quarter sales of $3.4 billion, up 3% from the prior year quarter. Organic sales growth, which as you know excludes the impact of currency translation and acquisitions and divestitures, was 4% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $206 million, up 5% versus the prior year. For the full fiscal year 2012 sales were $13.5 billion, up 3% over the prior period on a reported basis and 4% on an organic growth basis. Our adjusted operating income of $750 million was up 4% for the prior year.
Now turning to our North American Food and Support Services segment, fourth quarter reported sales were up 3% to $2.4 billion led primarily by growth in the Higher Education business and our Business & Industry sector. Organic sales growth was 3% in the quarter. For the full-year 2012, reported sales were up 4% to $9.4 billion with organic growth of 3%. Year-to-date performance was led by solid growth in all sectors and particularly strong growth in our Higher Education sector. 
Now taking a closer look at the sectors within North America, our Business & Industry sector had a high single-digit sales increase for the quarter and for the full-year, reflecting the positive impact from the Filterfresh acquisition which, as you may recall closed in early October of 2011, so the very beginning of this -- of fiscal year 2012.
Growth in the quarter was supported by improved base business growth in our Refreshment Services business, while our B&I facilities business also contributed to the increase in both the quarter and for the full year, primarily due to strong growth in our remote services operations in Canada. Our business operations Dining divisions experienced a slight sales decline versus the prior year for both the quarter and the full fiscal year. The Education sector had low single-digit sales growth for the quarter and mid-single digit sales growth for the fiscal year, primarily driven by higher growth in the average -- in our Higher Education food business, resulting from a combination of base business growth and very solid new sales from contract wins in prior periods.
In our Healthcare sector, we experienced low single-digit sales growth for the quarter and for the full year. The sales growth in the quarter was a result of base business growth in our Healthcare Technologies business, as well as new business growth in Healthcare Hospitality. The growth for the full-year fiscal 2012 was primarily a result of base business growth and the acquisition in March of 2011 of Masterplan within our health care technologies business.
Our Sports & Entertainment sector had a low single-digit sales increase for the quarter and for the full year. For the quarter, we reported good growth in our amphitheater business, somewhat offset by the timing of Major League Baseball games and the early effects of the NHL lockout which did affect September. Our growth for fiscal 2012 was negatively affected by the NBA strike earlier in the year, but that impact was offset by solid results during the NHL season last year and the strength in Major League Baseball.
Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment increased by 7% in the quarter to $153 million, led by profit growth in our Business & Industry and Sports & Entertainment sectors. Profit for the fourth quarter included recognition of approximately $7 million of income related to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service, under which they paid down a portion of our possessed reinterest at one of our terminated client locations.
For fiscal 2012, segment adjusted operating income grew 5% to $541 million, led by strong profit growth in our Higher Education business and the Healthcare sector. Results for fiscal 2011 included the recognition of approximately $8 million of income in the first quarter, also related similarly to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service, under which they paid down a portion of our possessed reinterest at one of our concession contracts.
Turning to the International Food and Support Services segment, fourth quarter reported sales of $699 million were up 3% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic basis. Sales growth for the quarter was due to positive growth in Ireland, South America and China, as well as the sales impact from our role as the exclusive food service provider in the Athletes' Village for the London Olympics games. This growth was partially offset by a sales decline in the U.K.-based business and Spain. 
For the fiscal year 2012, our reported sales of $2.7 billion were flat compared to the prior year on a reported basis primarily due to the impact of a stronger dollar. Organic growth was 6%, again led primarily by the Olympic Games, but also due to growth in Germany, Ireland, South America and China, which more than offset a sales decline in the U.K.-based business in Spain and in Belgium.
Fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $27 million, which was down about 3% when compared to the prior year quarter, with currency translation negatively affecting profit growth by approximately 4 percentage points. Results in the quarter primarily reflect improving profit performance in the U.K. and in Ireland, of which I think is particularly admirable in a very difficult economic environment, which was offset by a profit decline in Continental Europe.
For the first -- for the full fiscal year 2012, adjusted operating income was $100 million, up from $91 million in the prior year. Growth was driven by the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Chile and China, and partially offset by Belgium and our AIM joint venture in Japan. Currency translation also negatively affected profit growth by about 4 percentage points.
 
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, fourth quarter sales of $342 million were up 3% from the year-ago quarter on both a reported and an organic basis. Improving organic growth rates in the uniform rental business, which in the fourth quarter were in the mid-single digits, were offset by softness in our direct sale business. For the fiscal year 2012, segment sales of $1.4 billion were up 2% from the prior year on both a reported and an organic basis. 
We are continuing to invest in additional rental sales personnel resources to support accelerated new sales growth. We are gaining improved traction in our new sales efforts as wear [ph] accounts continue to grow. Our new business installed in 2012 was up over 20% for the full year as a result of both a larger sales force and increased sales productivity. And, of course, we're paying the price of that a bit on both our sales expense and our merchandise amortization.
The segment's fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $38 million. This compares to fourth quarter of 2011 adjusted operating income of $34 million. Results from 2011 included restructuring expenses following our divestiture of our Galls subsidiary in September of 2011. Excluding these costs from the prior year, adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2012 would've been up in the mid-single digits, which is an improvement from the recent quarters. 
For the full fiscal year, adjusted operating income was $145 million, down slightly from the $146 million of the prior year. And as I mentioned, increased sales cost of the expansion of the sales force and a significant increase in our merchandise amortization cost associated with the substantially higher levels of new business have had a negative impact on profit growth in the year. But we firmly believe that over the intermediate term, these efforts are leading to both improving rental sales and profit growth as we look further into 2013.
Corporate expenses, which exclude the items Karen mentioned earlier, were at $11.5 million in the quarter compared to $8.5 million a year ago. And for the fiscal year 2012, expenses were $36.4 million compared to $32.2 million in the prior year. Now let me turn it back over to Karen for some additional details in the quarter and the fiscal year."

I'd like to comment on our financing, capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending September 28 was $1.136 billion, equal to the figure we reported as of June 29, 2012 and up from the $1.1 billion as of September 30, 2011. Interest and other financing costs were $87 million for the fourth quarter compared to $111 million in the prior year. Our interest expense in the quarter was lower primarily as a result of a number of interest rate swaps that matured at the end of March 2012. 
For the fiscal year 2012, interest and other financing costs were $402 million, down from the prior year's expense of $426 million. In the second quarter of 2012, we recorded approximately $11 million of expenses related to the term loan extension we completed during the quarter. In 2011, we had interest income of approximately $14 million recorded that was related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims from prior periods. Including the impact of interest rate hedges, approximately 50% of our total debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates, and our overall weighted average cost of debt is approximately 5.1%.
Total reported debt at the end of fiscal year 2012 was $5.413 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.602 billion, including a term loan balance of $3.289 billion and a revolver balance that was 0. In June 2012, we amended our accounts receivable securitization facility, increasing the maximum amount from $250 million to $300 million and extending the maturity date to January of 2015. That facility had $264 million utilized at year end. We also had approximately $649 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility as of year end. Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio was 3.11x as of September 28, which is down from the 3.41x we reported as of June 29, 2012 and that 3.17x we reported at the end of September 30, 2011.
During 2012, we utilized $250 million of free cash flow to fund the repayment of our 5% notes. Without this maturity, we would've utilized free cash flow to pay down secured debt and we would've seen a more substantial improvement in our secured debt ratio, consistent with our strong cash flow performance for the year. Our ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of fiscal 2012 was 4.76x, and this compares to 5.09x at the end of the third quarter and 5.13x as of the end of fiscal 2011. Overall, we're pleased with our EBITDA growth and our ratio momentum, and we anticipate further ratio improvement over time. 
Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $124 million compared to $92 million in the prior year quarter. For the fiscal year, net capital expenditures totaled $343 million compared to $272 million in the same period last year. This higher level of spending reflects planned investment in our infrastructure, as well as our sales growth objectives.
Consistent with our expectations and historical patterns, working capital was a significant source of cash for us during the fourth quarter. We ended the year with working capital as a relatively moderate source of cash overall for the year. We would anticipate that we will return to a more typical pattern in fiscal 2013, with working capital requiring a modest level of investments.
For the year, we're very pleased with our free cash flow performance before acquisitions and divestitures as we've generated approximately $403 million of free cash flow in fiscal 2012, a total that exceeded our plan and reflects our growth in operating income and continued strong focus on working capital discipline.
For the fiscal year, we spent a total of $152 million on acquisitions compared to $157 million in the prior year period. This year's spending, related primarily to the acquisition of Filterfresh and our North American Refreshment Services business, which closed in October of 2011. We continue to evaluate and seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies, but we plan to be prudent and disciplined in the pursuit of these opportunities. 
Now let me turn the call back over to Fred."

So summing up our performance for this fiscal year, our global Food and Support Services business has delivered solid organic growth with slightly stronger profit growth. Our uniform rental business is gaining traction from the significant investment we've made over the past several quarters in accelerating new sales. 
As we look forward, we have strengths that we need to leverage. We have strong positions and attractive sectors, great people with pride and passion, strong values and a desire to do the right thing and a focus on client service. We believe there are many attractive growth opportunities in front of us despite the economic clients -- the economic climate, as many of our sectors remained significantly under-penetrated. And we remain excited about pursuing those opportunities. We need to create growth-relating [ph] positions as we strive to become the most valued partner to our clients and consumers.
And on the cost side, we see additional opportunities to improve our performance. In late 2011, we embarked on a number of internal initiatives aimed at delivering improved organic growth and continued margin improvement in the coming years. These activities have already delivered benefits in 2012, but we are committed to continue to improve our standards, processes and systems, bringing efficiencies and improved effectiveness to how we serve our clients and customers everyday around the world. During 2013, we are planning to further accelerate this process standardization, which we believe will help us drive ongoing margin improvement.

We were, as we looked at the legislation as it stood, one of our concerns was whether this -- the requirement of at least 30 hours a week to qualify for health care benefits, how that would apply to seasonal workers. And because we have, particularly let's say in Sports & Entertainment and our Higher Education operations, we have lots and lots of seasonal workers and so we had some concern about that. On average they work less than 30 hours a week, but they don't work less than 30 hours a week every week. There's some new regulations that are just come out on that and it appears that our concern about having a huge increase in eligibility as a result of seasonal workers who average below 30 hours a week being eligible is not -- is not founded. So we're heartened by that. And as a result the impact on us is less significant than we feared that it might be. So we're still working through all the details. As you know there's still regulations, clarifications coming out as we speak. There are clearly other actions that we can take. Some other companies have started to do or talked about, which is changing the mix between part-time and full-time workers. So it's difficult to quantify the impact. I guess, I would say, it's not insignificant but it doesn't rise to the level of potentially a major EBIT impact, as we had been a little bit concerned about it as we looked at it 1 year ago. So we're looking at something that's in the tens of millions before mitigation."

Now those are not -- those are reflected in our P&L over time as the contracts are actually come out or as contracts are added and we start to operate them. And for 2012 as I mentioned briefly in my opening remarks, we had a pretty strong performance overall, and this is both the North American food service  facilities business, the International business and the Uniform business. And the annualized value -- the annualized sales value of new contracts that we were awarded --  so at sometime during the year was up around 20% or so. And that of course is something that will roll into the financial statements as those contracts are started off. And our -- the dollar value of the contracts that we lost during the year was down I think about between 5% and 10%. So the net new business as a result since the new business was up, the lost business was down, the net new business was up a fair amount. And so we were fairly, fairly pleased on that. We've been --  more so focused particularly on adding new business.

As in prior quarters, I'd like to review our business and operating results and then ask Karen to cover a few additional details on",1740,"Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining us as we review our fiscal 2012 fourth quarter and our full-year results. As in prior quarters, I'd like to review our business and operating results and then ask Karen to cover a few additional details on our performance. Overall, our results for fiscal 2012 were in line with the economic conditions in the countries in which we operate. Our operations in China and South America are continuing to grow at significantly higher rates than our total portfolio of businesses. And we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for these regions. As you would expect, Continental Europe results were more mixed as our operations in Spain and Belgium struggled, while Germany continued to deliver solid performance. Our U.K. and Ireland operations realized the benefit of substantial cost reduction efforts in prior years. In North America, our Higher Education business continues to lead our overall growth.
2012 was a record year for us in terms of new sales across our food facilities and uniform businesses. With the new sales contracted or installed up over 30% over the prior year, providing us with a strong carry-in rate of business for 2013. If you see -- as you've seen in the financial statement released earlier today, our free cash flow for the year was also very strong led by our continued emphasis on working capital and earnings growth for the year.
One of our proudest accomplishments this year was our success  as the exclusive catering provider to more than 15,000 athletes, officials and staff in the Athletes' Village over the duration of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London this summer. During the games, our staff of over 3,500 on the ground in London served over 1.5 million meals peaking at 65,000 meals per day. London was ARAMARK's sixteenth Olympic Games.
We were also proud to have hosted delegates and other attendees at the Republican National Convention in Tampa Bay in September, serving nearly 15,000 meals over the span of 5 days. And earlier in the summer, we served baseball fans attending the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Kansas City. We deeply appreciate the trust our clients place in us to serve at these very important events.
Now turning to the details of our results for the year, I'd like to first take you through our overall financial performance and then I'll discuss our business segments. We reported fiscal 2012 fourth quarter sales of $3.4 billion, up 3% from the prior year quarter. Organic sales growth, which as you know excludes the impact of currency translation and acquisitions and divestitures, was 4% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $206 million, up 5% versus the prior year. For the full fiscal year 2012 sales were $13.5 billion, up 3% over the prior period on a reported basis and 4% on an organic growth basis. Our adjusted operating income of $750 million was up 4% for the prior year.
Now turning to our North American Food and Support Services segment, fourth quarter reported sales were up 3% to $2.4 billion led primarily by growth in the Higher Education business and our Business & Industry sector. Organic sales growth was 3% in the quarter. For the full-year 2012, reported sales were up 4% to $9.4 billion with organic growth of 3%. Year-to-date performance was led by solid growth in all sectors and particularly strong growth in our Higher Education sector. 
Now taking a closer look at the sectors within North America, our Business & Industry sector had a high single-digit sales increase for the quarter and for the full-year, reflecting the positive impact from the Filterfresh acquisition which, as you may recall closed in early October of 2011, so the very beginning of this -- of fiscal year 2012.
Growth in the quarter was supported by improved base business growth in our Refreshment Services business, while our B&I facilities business also contributed to the increase in both the quarter and for the full year, primarily due to strong growth in our remote services operations in Canada. Our business operations Dining divisions experienced a slight sales decline versus the prior year for both the quarter and the full fiscal year. The Education sector had low single-digit sales growth for the quarter and mid-single digit sales growth for the fiscal year, primarily driven by higher growth in the average -- in our Higher Education food business, resulting from a combination of base business growth and very solid new sales from contract wins in prior periods.
In our Healthcare sector, we experienced low single-digit sales growth for the quarter and for the full year. The sales growth in the quarter was a result of base business growth in our Healthcare Technologies business, as well as new business growth in Healthcare Hospitality. The growth for the full-year fiscal 2012 was primarily a result of base business growth and the acquisition in March of 2011 of Masterplan within our health care technologies business.
Our Sports & Entertainment sector had a low single-digit sales increase for the quarter and for the full year. For the quarter, we reported good growth in our amphitheater business, somewhat offset by the timing of Major League Baseball games and the early effects of the NHL lockout which did affect September. Our growth for fiscal 2012 was negatively affected by the NBA strike earlier in the year, but that impact was offset by solid results during the NHL season last year and the strength in Major League Baseball.
Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment increased by 7% in the quarter to $153 million, led by profit growth in our Business & Industry and Sports & Entertainment sectors. Profit for the fourth quarter included recognition of approximately $7 million of income related to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service, under which they paid down a portion of our possessed reinterest at one of our terminated client locations.
For fiscal 2012, segment adjusted operating income grew 5% to $541 million, led by strong profit growth in our Higher Education business and the Healthcare sector. Results for fiscal 2011 included the recognition of approximately $8 million of income in the first quarter, also related similarly to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service, under which they paid down a portion of our possessed reinterest at one of our concession contracts.
Turning to the International Food and Support Services segment, fourth quarter reported sales of $699 million were up 3% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic basis. Sales growth for the quarter was due to positive growth in Ireland, South America and China, as well as the sales impact from our role as the exclusive food service provider in the Athletes' Village for the London Olympics games. This growth was partially offset by a sales decline in the U.K.-based business and Spain. 
For the fiscal year 2012, our reported sales of $2.7 billion were flat compared to the prior year on a reported basis primarily due to the impact of a stronger dollar. Organic growth was 6%, again led primarily by the Olympic Games, but also due to growth in Germany, Ireland, South America and China, which more than offset a sales decline in the U.K.-based business in Spain and in Belgium.
Fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $27 million, which was down about 3% when compared to the prior year quarter, with currency translation negatively affecting profit growth by approximately 4 percentage points. Results in the quarter primarily reflect improving profit performance in the U.K. and in Ireland, of which I think is particularly admirable in a very difficult economic environment, which was offset by a profit decline in Continental Europe.
For the first -- for the full fiscal year 2012, adjusted operating income was $100 million, up from $91 million in the prior year. Growth was driven by the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Chile and China, and partially offset by Belgium and our AIM joint venture in Japan. Currency translation also negatively affected profit growth by about 4 percentage points.
 
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, fourth quarter sales of $342 million were up 3% from the year-ago quarter on both a reported and an organic basis. Improving organic growth rates in the uniform rental business, which in the fourth quarter were in the mid-single digits, were offset by softness in our direct sale business. For the fiscal year 2012, segment sales of $1.4 billion were up 2% from the prior year on both a reported and an organic basis. 
We are continuing to invest in additional rental sales personnel resources to support accelerated new sales growth. We are gaining improved traction in our new sales efforts as wear [ph] accounts continue to grow. Our new business installed in 2012 was up over 20% for the full year as a result of both a larger sales force and increased sales productivity. And, of course, we're paying the price of that a bit on both our sales expense and our merchandise amortization.
The segment's fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $38 million. This compares to fourth quarter of 2011 adjusted operating income of $34 million. Results from 2011 included restructuring expenses following our divestiture of our Galls subsidiary in September of 2011. Excluding these costs from the prior year, adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2012 would've been up in the mid-single digits, which is an improvement from the recent quarters. 
For the full fiscal year, adjusted operating income was $145 million, down slightly from the $146 million of the prior year. And as I mentioned, increased sales cost of the expansion of the sales force and a significant increase in our merchandise amortization cost associated with the substantially higher levels of new business have had a negative impact on profit growth in the year. But we firmly believe that over the intermediate term, these efforts are leading to both improving rental sales and profit growth as we look further into 2013.
Corporate expenses, which exclude the items Karen mentioned earlier, were at $11.5 million in the quarter compared to $8.5 million a year ago. And for the fiscal year 2012, expenses were $36.4 million compared to $32.2 million in the prior year. Now let me turn it back over to Karen for some additional details in the quarter and the fiscal year."

I'd like to comment on our financing, capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending September 28 was $1.136 billion, equal to the figure we reported as of June 29, 2012 and up from the $1.1 billion as",698,"Thanks, Fred. I'd like to comment on our financing, capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending September 28 was $1.136 billion, equal to the figure we reported as of June 29, 2012 and up from the $1.1 billion as of September 30, 2011. Interest and other financing costs were $87 million for the fourth quarter compared to $111 million in the prior year. Our interest expense in the quarter was lower primarily as a result of a number of interest rate swaps that matured at the end of March 2012. 
For the fiscal year 2012, interest and other financing costs were $402 million, down from the prior year's expense of $426 million. In the second quarter of 2012, we recorded approximately $11 million of expenses related to the term loan extension we completed during the quarter. In 2011, we had interest income of approximately $14 million recorded that was related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims from prior periods. Including the impact of interest rate hedges, approximately 50% of our total debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates, and our overall weighted average cost of debt is approximately 5.1%.
Total reported debt at the end of fiscal year 2012 was $5.413 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.602 billion, including a term loan balance of $3.289 billion and a revolver balance that was 0. In June 2012, we amended our accounts receivable securitization facility, increasing the maximum amount from $250 million to $300 million and extending the maturity date to January of 2015. That facility had $264 million utilized at year end. We also had approximately $649 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility as of year end. Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio was 3.11x as of September 28, which is down from the 3.41x we reported as of June 29, 2012 and that 3.17x we reported at the end of September 30, 2011.
During 2012, we utilized $250 million of free cash flow to fund the repayment of our 5% notes. Without this maturity, we would've utilized free cash flow to pay down secured debt and we would've seen a more substantial improvement in our secured debt ratio, consistent with our strong cash flow performance for the year. Our ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of fiscal 2012 was 4.76x, and this compares to 5.09x at the end of the third quarter and 5.13x as of the end of fiscal 2011. Overall, we're pleased with our EBITDA growth and our ratio momentum, and we anticipate further ratio improvement over time. 
Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $124 million compared to $92 million in the prior year quarter. For the fiscal year, net capital expenditures totaled $343 million compared to $272 million in the same period last year. This higher level of spending reflects planned investment in our infrastructure, as well as our sales growth objectives.
Consistent with our expectations and historical patterns, working capital was a significant source of cash for us during the fourth quarter. We ended the year with working capital as a relatively moderate source of cash overall for the year. We would anticipate that we will return to a more typical pattern in fiscal 2013, with working capital requiring a modest level of investments.
For the year, we're very pleased with our free cash flow performance before acquisitions and divestitures as we've generated approximately $403 million of free cash flow in fiscal 2012, a total that exceeded our plan and reflects our growth in operating income and continued strong focus on working capital discipline.
For the fiscal year, we spent a total of $152 million on acquisitions compared to $157 million in the prior year period. This year's spending, related primarily to the acquisition of Filterfresh and our North American Refreshment Services business, which closed in October of 2011. We continue to evaluate and seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies, but we plan to be prudent and disciplined in the pursuit of these opportunities. 
Now let me turn the call back over to Fred."

So summing up our performance for this fiscal year, our global Food and Support Services business has delivered solid organic growth with slightly stronger profit growth. Our uniform rental business is gaining traction from the significant investment we've made over the past several quarters in accelerating new sales. 
As we look forward, we have strengths that we need to leverage. We have strong positions and attractive sectors, great people with pride and passion, strong values and a desire to do the right thing and a focus on client service. We believe there are many attractive growth opportunities in front of us despite the economic clients -- the economic climate, as many of our sectors remained significantly under-penetrated. And we remain excited about pursuing those opportunities. We need to create growth-relating [ph] positions as we strive to become the most valued partner to our clients and consumers.
And on the cost side, we see additional opportunities to improve our performance. In late 2011, we embarked on a number of internal initiatives aimed at delivering improved organic growth and continued margin improvement in the coming years. These activities have already delivered benefits in 2012, but we are committed to continue to improve our standards, processes and systems, bringing efficiencies and improved effectiveness to how we serve our clients and customers everyday around the world. During 2013, we are planning to further accelerate this process standardization, which we believe will help us drive ongoing margin improvement.

We were, as we looked at the legislation as it stood, one of our concerns was whether this -- the requirement of at least 30 hours a week to qualify for health care benefits, how that would apply to seasonal workers. And because we have, particularly let's say in Sports & Entertainment and our Higher Education operations, we have lots and lots of seasonal workers and so we had some concern about that. On average they work less than 30 hours a week, but they don't work less than 30 hours a week every week. There's some new regulations that are just come out on that and it appears that our concern about having a huge increase in eligibility as a result of seasonal workers who average below 30 hours a week being eligible is not -- is not founded. So we're heartened by that. And as a result the impact on us is less significant than we feared that it might be. So we're still working through all the details. As you know there's still regulations, clarifications coming out as we speak. There are clearly other actions that we can take. Some other companies have started to do or talked about, which is changing the mix between part-time and full-time workers. So it's difficult to quantify the impact. I guess, I would say, it's not insignificant but it doesn't rise to the level of potentially a major EBIT impact, as we had been a little bit concerned about it as we looked at it 1 year ago. So we're looking at something that's in the tens of millions before mitigation."

On the acquisition side, I think we'll continue to look for bolt-on acquisitions. Those could be to expand our services. Not way off of where we are right now but in some adjacent areas in either food service or facility services. And the other -- the other opportunity I think for acquisitions is to look at some of the faster growing economies in the world. As I mentioned, when we started out, we're growing at mid-teens to high-teens rates in certain markets in Asia and South America. And certainly, we don't have full coverage in those regions of the world. So I think we'll selectively look there as well."

Now those are not -- those are reflected in our P&L over time as the contracts are actually come out or as contracts are added and we start to operate them. And for 2012 as I mentioned briefly in my opening remarks, we had a pretty strong performance overall, and this is both the North American food service  facilities business, the International business and the Uniform business. And the annualized value -- the annualized sales value of new contracts that we were awarded --  so at sometime during the year was up around 20% or so. And that of course is something that will roll into the financial statements as those contracts are started off. And our -- the dollar value of the contracts that we lost during the year was down I think about between 5% and 10%. So the net new business as a result since the new business was up, the lost business was down, the net new business was up a fair amount. And so we were fairly, fairly pleased on that. We've been --  more so focused particularly on adding new business. We've been adding sales resources, standardizing some of our sales processes and we were pretty encouraged by the results we saw in 2012.
