I would like to begin by providing some highlights for 2011, a year in which we endured a turbulent microenvironment but made significant progress in the company. Early in the year, we completed the transformation of LSI with the transition to a pure play storage and networking semiconductor company with the divestiture of our storage systems business. We ended the year with an announcement to acquire SandForce, positioning LSI to benefit from the growing adoption of solid-state drive and flash storage solutions. Throughout the year, we were successful in increasing design win momentum with industry leaders, such as Seagate, Ericsson, Cisco, IBM, HP, Dell and many others. Our revenues grew 9% year-over-year and 16% from the second half of 2010 through the second half of 2011 illustrating acceleration of revenue growth driven by the share gains and cycles. This is still the only first of several expected stages of new product ramps from design wins accumulated over the past 3 years. For the full year, we generated double-digit revenue growth in HDD, SSD, ServeRAID and networking investment areas, our growth which significantly outpaced our end markets in many of our theorists would have been even higher, particularly in hard disk drives, were not for the impact of the unfortunate flooding in Thailand which affected our fourth quarter 2011 revenues. Specifically for the fourth quarter, our revenues are $523 million, were in line with the midpoint of guidance, and I credit our team for their efforts in assessing market dynamics and flood-related constraints to enable us to correctly call the quarter back in October. We saw roughly $40 million of revenue impact in Q4 from Thailand-flood related issues. Our operations team has done an excellent job on recovery, including the qualification of new suppliers and we expect to have the capability to meet all customer demand in Q1. As we look forward to 2012, we are excited by the new product cycle ramps, accumulated share gains and new opportunities we have ahead of us in the areas such as SandForce flash storage processors, PCIe flash adapters, SAS for Romley and multicore processors and custom products for networking. The midpoint of our guidance for Q1 reflects 20% year-over-year growth and is composed of 16% growth in our organic business, plus the addition of SandForce revenues. In Q1, we're seeing outperformance driven by a snapback of and preamp shipments, new product ramps and the addition of SandForce revenues. We're excited to have closed the SandForce acquisition and have the team integrated into LSI as a new business unit. The acquisition greatly enhanced LSI's competitive position in the fast-growing PCIe flash adapter market segment and it catapults LSI into an industry-leading position for the rapidly growing high-volume flash storage processor for Ultrabooks, notebooks and enterprise SSD and flash solutions. We estimate that LSI's available market for PCIe flash-based adapters and flash storage processors is growing at an annual CAGR of nearly 40% over time and will represent a greater than $2 billion TAM expansion for LSI in the next several years. 
Going forward, we believe that LSI is well positioned in large exciting and fast-growing market with solid fundamentals. We expect to benefit from growth in the deployment of server, storage and networking equipment for data centers, commercial and private clouds, and mobile networks, as well as the rapid adoption of flash storage. 
Now I'm want to review additional business highlights for Q4. I will begin with our networking business where our products address the wireless mobile network, data center and enterprise market segments and where we expect revenue from new products to grow at a faster than market growth rates over the coming years as we gain share and displace competitors. Year-over-year, we saw double-digit growth in our investment areas networking driven by growth in standard and custom products for wireless infrastructure and enterprise applications. Investment area of revenues were $284 million in 2011 representing nearly 2/3 of our overall networking business. Over the past 5 years, our investment areas have seen a 5-year compound annual growth rate of 28% while participating in market segments that have rich gross margin. This is a strong proof point of a well executed strategy in networking and we are excited about the new product cycles we have in this business. We expect overall networking revenues to grow year-over-year in 2012 along with accelerated profitability. 
We continue to be successful in increasing LSI's footprint in base stations and wireless backhaul infrastructure through a combination of our Axxia, multicore communications processor and our customs silicon capability. With Axxia, and Ericsson and strong progress at other wireless customers, we have now set a goal to exceed 50% share of data plan and controlled content in base station segment. Our network processors are now Axxia , we are addressing a wireless data plane and controlled plane silicon TAM that is large and fast-growing with build outs of mobile networks. LSI solutions are increasingly being sought after based on superior performance and lower power consumption. 
In addition to Axxia, we are increasing our footprint in base stations with custom silicon wins-based stand function which sits alongside the data plane and controlled-plane devices and implement ESB functionality. We're currently participating in base band custom silicon business at 4 of the top 5 OEM vendors. In the enterprise market segment, we are pleased with our progress in expanding our business with the leading data networking company. We are now in production on the custom switch solution and continue to make strong progress on additional cost of opportunities. As it pertains to Ethernet PHYs, we are fully ramped on an integrated custom Gigabit Ethernet PHY for client applications at Intel and also expect to ramp a custom Gigabit Ethernet MacPHY solution for Romley server platform. We recently announced an expansion of our long-term strategic relationship with ARM, the agreement will new product solutions designed to address accelerate network performance as applications such as mobile video and cloud computing dramatically increase network traffic. LSI will gain access to the broad family of ARM processors, including the ARM Cortex a-15 processor and ARM on-chip interconnect technology for use in multicore applications. 
I'll now turn to server and storage which includes 5 businesses. Our new flash business, SAS, ServeRAID adapter and software, SAN and HDD. In flash, we are unique in offering standard product flash boards processors or SSP, as we call them, as well as custom SSP and PCIe flash adapters. SSP manage the underlying flash memory and improve the endurance, reliability and performance of flash storage. In standard product SSPs, SandForce generated approximately $65 million in revenue in 2011 prior to our acquisition. For 2012, we expect solid growth at or above market rates based upon a very strong design wind pipeline with industry leaders -- with leaders in the industry. The SSP industry has entered a rapid growth phase and LSI is strongly positioned to benefit from this multiyear growth cycle. We continue to make progress at key customers with standard and custom SSPs in both client and enterprise segments. In the client market segment, we are in final qualification with multiple flash manufacturers on our second generation of products and expect to start shipments on the first half of 2012. These customers target Tier 1 system OEMs in addition to expanding their footprint into the channel. 
In the enterprise market segment, our SSD OEMs are in qualification with multiple Tier 1 server and storage manufacturers to provide both high-volume SSD, as well as high-performance cashing and workload SSDs. In PCIe flash adapters, we offer our work family, we're expanding and increasing focus in storage and server application acceleration, bringing the performance advantage of the flash to enterprise servers, storage and networking applications. We are pleased to be participating in the EMC lightning program which we expect to begin ramping this quarter and a new program at Cisco in their custom blade products. We've also won multiple designs with our combined work drive and host-based CacheCade software, that's a Tier 1 server OEM and expect our solution to begin ramping next quarter. Beyond this, we continue to build momentum with new server and large scale web customers on the largest PCIe flash revenue opportunities based upon the superior architecture and our significant position in the server ecosystem. 
We are now near production on our second generation work drive PCIe products which use the latest generation SandForce FSP and integrate LSI CacheCade software for application acceleration. This second-generation work support LSC, CNLC and EMLC enabling flexibility to optimize performance, cost, high density and endurance. 
In our SAS business, we expect to be shipping 6-gig SAS silicon to all top 10 server OEMs this quarter with the rollout of the Intel Romley platform. The flexion question point in the SAS market will be the adoption of 12-gig SAS silicon. Server and external storage OEMs have already begun the evaluation and selection process. Our expectation is that the first use will occur in 2012, with production in 2013. LSI began to sample next-generation 12-gig SAS, controllers and expanders to major customers in July, at least 6 months ahead of our competition putting us in excellent position to grow shares at this next transition. 
We continue to make progress with External Storage Systems customers following the divestiture or systems business. We estimate that our share in SAS for external storage grew from 35% in 2010 to 40% in 2011. With our lead in 12-gig SAS, we expect to gain share in this upcoming transition. 
In hard disk drive, we saw unit TAM decline by approximately 30% from Q3 to Q4 as a result of the situation in Thailand. However, we continue to gain share in Seagate enterprise platforms and ramp new SSC in the client drives. We're confident in our ability to support sequential growth in Q1 at our HDD customers. 
Achieving a key milestone last year, LSI was the first supplier shipping SLCs for 1 terabyte hard drive to customers illustrating our technology leadership in this market segment. During the quarter, we also introduced the industry's first 20-nanometer re-channel featuring a new architecture enabling to achieve increased aerial density, higher yield and lower power consumption for HDD. This is now the third consecutive technology transition where LSI has been ahead of the competition. 
Customers specific SSC samples built on this technology will become available in the first half of this year that will support notebook, desktop and enterprise HDD. The enhanced low power management features in these SSDs are critical to expanding battery life in notebooks and to reduce some energy cost and data centers. 
To wrap ap up, we think it's time to take a new look at LSI.  We're seeing the results of a multi-year growth strategy and are well-positioned with share gain opportunities and new product cycles to enable us to outgrow the storage and networking markets we serve. Now let me turn the call over to Bryon who will take you through our results by guidance."

I'd like to begin by providing a few highlights and perspective on LSI's financial performance for the full year. As a reminder, we successfully announced and closed the sale of our External",1402,"Thanks, Abhi, and thanks,  everyone, for joining the call today. I'd like to begin by providing a few highlights and perspective on LSI's financial performance for the full year. As a reminder, we successfully announced and closed the sale of our External Systems business early in 2011. The financial results of the External Systems business have been classified as discontinued operations and financial statements. Our ongoing business is and has been referred to as continuing operations. The results we are covering to the full-year 2011 as well as for Q4 and going forward will be for continuing operations. 
We closed 2011 with annual revenues of $2.04 billion, representing 9.3% year-over-year growth. Gross margins for the full year excluding special items were 51.5%. Operating expenses excluding special items were $794 million for the year as we remained focused on expense controls throughout the year, growing revenues at a rate higher than expenses. Operating income excluding special items was $258 million or 12.6% of revenues for the full year. In addition, one of our key focus areas is consistently been to maintain and grow our net cash position while driving efficient working capital management. In 2011, we delivered $247 million in operating cash flows and closed the year with $935 million in cash and short-term investments and no debt. After having used approximately $499 million of cash to buy back stock. Finally, we successfully completed the SandForce acquisition in early January. Keep in m mind, SandForce's business will be included in our guidance and results going forward as we close on January 3. 
Now on to Q4 results and the Q1 outlook. LSI delivered a solid consistent with the guidance we provided in October despite the challenges associated with the floods in Thailand. Revenues were down sequentially by 4.3% to $523 million in line with our guidance range. Non-GAAP gross margins were 49.5%, lower than our guidance primarily due to inventory charges associated with the Thailand flood. We continue to carefully manage expenses with non-GAAP operating expenses of $203 million, just at the midpoint of guidance and we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.13. 
Now turning to a more detailed discussion of our financial results for the quarter beginning with revenues. Q4 revenues were $523 million, sequentially down 4.3% from $547 million. Our server and storage semiconductor revenues, which include products from our ServeRAID adapters and software, Flash, SAS, SAN and HDD businesses were sequentially down $14 million or 4% to $389 million. As we noted earlier, this decline was driven by the flooding in Thailand and the related impacted disk drive industry. Server and storage semiconductors represented 74% of total revenues in the fourth quarter. Q4 revenues in our networking business were $107 million or sequentially down 8% due primarily to softness in the wireless end market, and to a lesser extent, supply chain constraints generated by the flooding in Thailand. Networking represented 21% of total revenues for the fourth quarter. Revenues for the IP business were sequentially flat at $27 million. 
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's Q4 gross margin including special items was 49.5% and below the 51% guidance midpoint we provided in October. Included in our results is an inventory charge of approximately $7.5 million or 140 basis points of gross margin which relates specifically to inventory damaged at one of our subcontractors in Thailand during the flooding. In terms of operating expenses, R&D, together with SG&A expenses excluding special items, totaled $203 million in Q4, just at the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 10.7% or $56 million. Interest income and other net of interest expense excluding special items was $8 million for Q4, approximately 2/3 of this amount was related to income from transition services associated with the sale of the External Systems business. 
We expect to see these service arrangements continue into Q1 but to a lesser extent and to be completed by midyear. 
Now let me turn to the special items we recorded in the fourth quarter which netted to $62 million. Special items, primarily non-cash, included $29 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $12 million of stock-based compensation expense and $21 million of restructuring costs and other items. 
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. We experienced such events in Q4 including both the shift in our geographic profit mix and the expiration of certain statutes and limitations that resulted in a non-cash tax benefit for the period, versus the provision of $13 million we guided to in October. The tax benefit for Q4 was $8.8 million. 
On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter income from continuing operations was approximately $11 million or $0.02 per share. Fourth quarter GAAP net income, which includes income from discontinued operations, was a loss of $2 million or approximately neutral on a per share basis. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $73 million or $0.13 per share. The diluted weighted average share counts that appears for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was 573 million shares. This included -- this includes the weighted average benefit of purchasing approximately 5 million shares during the period under our share repurchase program. In 2011, we repurchased a total of 72 million shares and utilized approximately $499 million, our current $750 million buyback program. Our share buyback program remains in place with $251 million remaining in our authorization. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. Cash and short-term investments ended the 2011 fiscal year at approximately $935 million. We continue to operate with no debt on our balance sheet. Operating cash flows were $55 million in Q4 and $247 million for the full year. 
Finally with respect to Q4 results, depreciation of software amortization was $14 million for Q4 and $71 million for full-year while capital expenditures were $14 million in the quarter and $61 million for the full year. 
Next is a discussion of our guidance for continuing operations in Q1 2012. Q1 revenues in the range of $550 million to $590 million or sequentially up approximately 9% at midpoint. We expect our server and storage semiconductors revenues to be sequentially up in Q1. This includes approximately $20 million to $25 million of flash storage processor revenues associated with our recent acquisition, along with a snap back in HDD, SSC and preamp shipments following a soft Q4. In addition, we expect our server related revenues to be sequentially down due to expected seasonality. We expect our networking semiconductor revenues to be relatively flat to down. Gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be 51%, plus or minus 1%. As we experienced better absorption of fixed cost at higher revenues. Operating expenses excluding special items are expected to be in the range of $215 million to $225 million. Included in this guidance is approximately $15 million of operating expense associated with the acquisition. Interest income and other and interest expense excluding special items is expected to net to income of approximately $5 million, approximately 1/2 of which is related to transition services. Special items are expected to net to approximately $70 million to $90 million. This increase is primarily driven by an expected one-time charge of approximately $15 million in Q1 due to the purchase accounting effect on inventory assumed in the acquisition, along with expected increases in amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and other items primarily associated with the acquisition. 
The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $9 million for Q1. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 12% for 2012. We expect Q1 GAAP income per share from continuing operations in the range of negative $0.07 to a positive $0.03, and non-GAAP income from continuing operations in the range of $0.09 to $0.15 per share. The share count is expected to be approximately 575 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. In addition, we expect depreciation of software amortization of approximately $18 million for Q1 and $70 million for the full year, and capital expenditures of approximately $20 million in Q1 and $65 million for the full year. 
In closing, we delivered solid revenues in Q4 despite the difficult environment. We remain focused on driving operating leverage and are excited about 2012 and our business prospects going forward. Now let me turn the call to Sujal."

Early in the year, we completed the transformation",1854,"Thanks, Sujal. Good afternoon and welcome. I would like to begin by providing some highlights for 2011, a year in which we endured a turbulent microenvironment, but made significant progress as a company. Early in the year, we completed the transformation of LSI with the transition to a pure play storage and networking semiconductor company with the divestiture of our storage systems business. We ended the year with an announcement to acquire SandForce, positioning LSI to benefit from the growing adoption of solid-state drives and flash storage solutions. Throughout the year, we were successful in increasing design win momentum with industry leaders such as Seagate, Ericsson, Cisco, IBM, HP, Dell and many others. Our revenues grew 9% year-over-year and 16% from the second half of 2010 through the second half of 2011 ,illustrating acceleration of revenue growth driven by the share gains and [indiscernible] cycles. This is still the only first of several expected stages of new product ramps from design wins accumulated over the past 3 years. For the full year, we generated double-digit revenue growth in HDD/SSDs, ServeRAID and networking investment areas. Our growth, which significantly outpaced our end markets in many of our peers, would have been even higher, particularly in hard disk drives, were it not for the impact of the unfortunate flooding in Thailand which affected our fourth quarter 2011 revenues. Specifically for the fourth quarter, our revenues of $523 million were in line with the midpoint of guidance, and I credit our team for their efforts in assessing market dynamics and flood-related constraints to enable us to correctly call the quarter back in October. We saw roughly $40 million of revenue impact in Q4 from Thailand flood-related issues. Our operations team has done an excellent job on recovery, including the qualification of new suppliers, and we expect to have the capability to meet all customer demand in Q1. As we look forward to 2012, we are excited by the new product cycle ramps, accumulated share gains and new opportunities we have ahead of us in the areas such as SandForce flash storage processors, PCIe flash adapters, HDD/SSDs, SAS for Romley and multicore processors and custom products for networking. The midpoint of our guidance for Q1 reflects 20% year-over-year growth and is composed of 16% growth in our organic business, plus the addition of SandForce revenues. In Q1, we're seeing outperformance driven by a snapback of HDD/SSD and preamp shipments, new product ramps and the addition of SandForce revenues. We're excited to have closed the SandForce acquisition and have the team integrated into LSI as a new business unit. The acquisition greatly enhances LSI's competitive position in the fast-growing PCIe flash adapter market segment and it catapults LSI into an industry-leading position for the rapidly growing high-volume flash storage processor market for Ultrabooks, notebooks and enterprise SSD and flash solutions. We estimate that LSI's available market for PCIe flash-based adapters and flash storage processors is growing at an annual CAGR of nearly 40% over time and will represent a greater than $2 billion TAM expansion for LSI in the next several years. 
Going forward, we believe LSI is well positioned in large, exciting and fast-growing markets with solid fundamentals. We expect to benefit from growth in the deployment of server, storage and networking equipment for data centers, commercial and private clouds, and mobile networks, as well as the rapid adoption of flash storage. 
Now, I want to review additional business highlights for Q4. I will begin with our networking business, where our products address the wireless mobile network, data center and enterprise market segments. And where we expect revenue from new products to grow at a faster than market growth rates over the coming years as we gain share and displace competitors. Year-over-year, we saw double-digit growth in our investment areas in networking driven by growth in standard and custom products for wireless infrastructure and enterprise applications. Investment area of revenues were $284 million in 2011, representing nearly 2/3 of our overall networking business. Over the past 5 years, our investment areas have seen a 5-year compound annual growth rate of 28% while participating in market segments that have rich gross margins. This is a strong proof point of a well-executed strategy in networking, and we're excited about the new product cycles we have in this business. We expect overall networking revenues to grow year-over-year in 2012 along with accelerated profitability. 
We continue to be successful in increasing LSI's footprint in base stations and wireless backhaul infrastructure through a combination of our Axxia, multicore communications processor and our custom silicon capability. With Axxia wins at Ericsson and strong progress at other wireless customers, we have now set a goal to exceed 50% share of data plane and controlled plane content in base station segments. Our network processors and now, Axxia , we are addressing a wireless data plane and controlled plane silicon TAM that is large and fast-growing with build outs of mobile networks. LSI solutions are increasingly being sought after based on superior performance and lower power consumption. 
In addition to Axxia, we are increasing our footprint in base stations with custom silicon wins for the baseband function, which sits alongside the data plane and controlled-plane devices, and implement DSP functionality. We're currently participating in baseband custom silicon business at 4 of the top 5 OEM vendors. In the enterprise market segment, we are pleased with our progress in expanding our business with a leading data networking company. We are now in production on a custom switch solution and continue to make strong progress on additional custom opportunities. As it pertains to Ethernet PHYs, we are fully ramped on an integrated custom Gigabit Ethernet PHY for client applications at Intel and also expect to ramp a custom Gigabit Ethernet MAC PHY solution for Romley server platforms. We recently announced an expansion of our long-term strategic relationship with ARM. The agreement will lead to new product solutions designed to address needs to accelerate network performance as applications such as mobile video and cloud computing dramatically increase network traffic. LSI will gain access to the broad family of ARM processors, including the ARM Cortex-A15 processor and ARM on-chip interconnect technology for use in multi-core applications. 
I'll now turn to server and storage, which includes 5 businesses: Our new Flash business, SAS, ServeRAID adapter and software, SAN and HDD. In Flash, we are unique in offering standard product flash storage processors, or SSPs as we call them, as well as custom SSPs and PCIe flash adapters. SSPs manage the underlying flash memory and improve the endurance, reliability and performance of flash storage. In standard product SSPs, SandForce generated approximately $65 million in revenue in 2011 prior to our acquisition. For 2012, we expect solid growth at or above market rates based upon a very strong design win pipeline with industry leaders -- with leaders in the industry. The SSP industry has entered a rapid growth phase and LSI is strongly positioned to benefit from this multiyear growth cycle. We continue to make progress at key customers with standard and custom SSPs in both client and enterprise segments. In the client market segment, we are in the final qualification with multiple flash manufacturers on our second generation of products and expect to start shipments in the first half of 2012. These customers target Tier 1 system OEMs in addition to expanding their footprint into the channel. 
In the enterprise market segment, our SSD OEMs are in qualification with multiple Tier 1 server and storage manufacturers to provide both high-volume SSDs, as well as high-performance caching and workload SSDs. In PCIe flash adapters, we offer our WarpDrive family. We're expanding and increasing focus in storage and server application acceleration, bringing the performance advantage of the Flash to enterprise servers, storage and networking applications. We are pleased to be participating in the EMC Lightning program, which we expect to begin ramping this quarter, and a new program at Cisco in their custom blade products. We've also won multiple designs with our combined WarpDrive and host-based CacheCade software at a Tier 1 server OEM, and expect our solution to begin ramping next quarter. Beyond this, we continue to build momentum with new server and large scale web customers on the largest PCIe flash revenue opportunities based upon a superior architecture and our significant position in the server ecosystem. 
We are now near production on our second-generation WarpDrive PCIe products, which use the latest generation SandForce FSP and integrate LSI CacheCade software for application acceleration. This second-generation WarpDrive supports SLC, CMLC and EMLC, enabling flexibility to optimize for performance, cost, high density and endurance. 
In our SAS business, we expect to be shipping 6-gig SAS silicon to all top 10 server OEMs this quarter with the rollout of the Intel Romley platform. The next key inflection point in the SAS market will be the adoption of 12-gig SAS silicon. Server and external storage OEMs have already begun the evaluation and selection process. Our expectation is that the first usage will occur in 2012, with production in 2013. LSI began to sample next-generation 12-gig SAS ROCs, controllers and expanders to major customers in July, at least 6 months ahead of our competition, putting us in excellent position to grow share at this next transition. 
We continue to make progress with External Storage Systems customers following the divestiture of our systems business. We estimate that our share in SAS for External Storage grew from 35% in 2010 to 40% in 2011. With our lead in 12-gig SAS, we expect to gain share in this upcoming transition. 
In hard disk drives, we saw a unit TAM decline by approximately 30% from Q3 to Q4 as a result of the situation in Thailand. However, we continue to gain share in Seagate enterprise platforms and ramp new SSDs into client drives. We're confident in our ability to support sequential growth in Q1 at our HDD customers. 
Achieving a key milestone last year, LSI was the first supplier shipping SLCs for 1 terabyte per platter hard drives to customers, illustrating our technology leadership in this market segment. During the quarter, we also introduced the industry's first 20-nanometer rechannel featuring a new LDPC architecture, enabling HD manufacturers to achieve increased areal density, higher yield and lower power consumption for HDDs. This is now the third consecutive technology transition where LSI has been ahead of the competition. 
Customer-specific SSD samples built on this technology will become available in the first half of this year that will support notebook, desktop and enterprise HDD. The enhanced low power management features in these SSDs are critical to extending battery life in notebooks and to reduce some energy costs in data centers. 
To wrap up, we think it's time to take a new look at LSI.  We're seeing the results of our multiyear growth strategy, and are well positioned with share gain opportunities and new product cycles to enable us to outgrow the storage and networking markets we serve. Now let me turn the call over to Bryon who will take you through our results and provide guidance."

I'd like to begin by providing a few highlights and perspectives on LSI's financial performance for the full year. As a reminder, we successfully announced and closed the sale of our External",1406,"Thanks, Abhi, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. I'd like to begin by providing a few highlights and perspectives on LSI's financial performance for the full year. As a reminder, we successfully announced and closed the sale of our External Systems business early in 2011. The financial results of the External Systems business have been classified as discontinued operations in LSI's financial statements. Our ongoing business is and has been referred to as continuing operations. The results we are covering to the full-year 2011, as well as for Q4 and going forward, will be for continuing operations. 
We closed 2011 with annual revenues of $2.04 billion, representing 9.3% year-over-year growth. Gross margins for the full year, excluding special items, were 51.5%. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $794 million for the year as we remained focused on expense controls throughout the year, growing revenues at a rate higher than expenses. Operating income, excluding special items, was $258 million or 12.6% of revenues for the full year. In addition, one of our key focus areas has consistently been to maintain and grow our net cash position while driving efficient working capital management. In 2011, we delivered $247 million in operating cash flows and closed the year with $935 million in cash and short-term investments and no debt after having used approximately $499 million of cash to buy back stock. Finally, we successfully completed the SandForce acquisition in early January. Keep in mind, SandForce's business will be included in our guidance and results going forward as it closed on January 3. 
Now on to Q4 results and the Q1 outlook. LSI delivered a solid quarter consistent with the guidance we provided in October despite the challenges associated with the floods in Thailand. Revenues were down sequentially by 4.3% to $523 million, in line with our guidance range. Non-GAAP gross margins were 49.5%, lower than our guidance, primarily due to inventory charges associated with the Thailand flood. We continue to carefully manage expenses with non-GAAP operating expenses of $203 million, just at the midpoint of guidance. And we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.13. 
Now turning to a more detailed discussion of our financial results for the quarter beginning with revenues. Q4 revenues were $523 million, sequentially down 4.3% from $547 million. Our server and storage semiconductor revenues, which include products from our ServeRAID adapter and software, Flash, SAS, SAN and HDD businesses, were sequentially down $14 million or 4% to $389 million. As we noted earlier, this decline was driven by the flooding in Thailand and the related impact to the disk drive industry. Server and storage semiconductors represented 74% of total revenues in the fourth quarter. Q4 revenues in our networking business were $107 million were sequentially down 8% due primarily to softness in the wireless end market, and to a lesser extent, supply chain constraints generated by the flooding in Thailand. Networking represented 21% of total revenues for the fourth quarter. Revenues for the IP business were sequentially flat at $27 million. 
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's Q4 gross margin, excluding special items, was 49.5% and below the 51% guidance midpoint we provided in October. Included in our results is an inventory charge of approximately $7.5 million or 140 basis points of gross margin, which relates specifically to inventory damaged at one of our subcontractors in Thailand during the flooding. In terms of operating expenses, R&D, together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, totaled $203 million in Q4, just at the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 10.7% or $56 million. Interest income and other net of interest expense, excluding special items, was $8 million for Q4. Approximately 2/3 of this amount was related to income from transition services associated with the sale of the External Systems business. 
We expect to see these service arrangements continue into Q1, but to a lesser extent, and to be completed by midyear. 
Now let me turn to the special items we recorded in the fourth quarter which netted to $62 million. Special items, primarily noncash, included $29 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $12 million of stock-based compensation expense and $21 million of restructuring costs and other items. 
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. We experienced such events in Q4, including both a shift in our geographic profit mix and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations, that resulted in a noncash tax benefit for the period versus the provision of $13 million we guided to in October. The tax benefit for Q4 was $8.8 million. 
On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter income from continuing operations was approximately $11 million or $0.02 per share. Fourth quarter GAAP net income, which includes income from discontinued operations, was a loss of $2 million or approximately neutral on a per share basis. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $73 million or $0.13 per share. The diluted weighted average share counts for the periods for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was 573 million shares. This included -- this includes the weighted average benefit of purchasing approximately 5 million shares during the period under our share repurchase program. In 2011, we repurchased a total of 72 million shares and utilized approximately $499 million, our current $750 million buyback program. Our share buyback program remains in place with $251 million remaining in our authorization. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. Cash and short-term investments ended the 2011 fiscal year at approximately $935 million. We continue to operate with no debt on our balance sheet. Operating cash flows were $55 million in Q4 and $247 million for the full year. 
And finally with respect to Q4 results, depreciation of software amortization was $14 million for Q4 and $71 million for the full-year, while capital expenditures were $14 million in the quarter and $61 million for the full year. 
Next is a discussion of our guidance for continuing operations in Q1 2012. Q1 revenues in the range of $550 million to $590 million were sequentially up approximately 9% at midpoint. We expect our server and storage semiconductors revenues to be sequentially up in Q1. This includes approximately $20 million to $25 million of flash storage processor revenues associated with our recent acquisition, along with a snapback in HDD, SLC and preamp shipments following a soft Q4. In addition, we expect our server-related revenues to be sequentially down due to expected seasonality. We expect our networking semiconductor revenues to be relatively flat to down. Gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be 51%, plus or minus 1% as we experienced better absorption of fixed cost at higher revenues. Operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the range of $215 million to $225 million. Included in this guidance is approximately $15 million of operating expense associated with the acquisition. Interest income and other and interest expense, excluding special items, is expected to net to income of approximately $5 million, approximately half of which is related to transition services. Special items are expected to net to approximately $70 million to $90 million. This increase is primarily driven by an expected onetime charge of approximately $15 million in Q1 due to the purchase accounting effect on inventory assumed in the acquisition, along with expected increases in amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and other items primarily associated with the acquisition. 
The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $9 million for Q1. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 12% for 2012. We expect Q1 GAAP income per share from continuing operations in the range of negative $0.07 to a positive $0.03, and non-GAAP income from continuing operations in the range of $0.09 to $0.15 per share. The share count is expected to be approximately 575 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $18 million for Q1 and $70 million for the full year, and capital expenditures of approximately $20 million in Q1 and $65 million for the full year. 
In closing, we delivered solid revenues in Q4 despite the difficult environment. We remain focused on driving operating leverage and are excited about 2012 and our business prospects going forward. Now let me turn the call to Sujal."

And I think that's something that our competition doesn't have at least from our understanding, not to the extent of robustness and validation."

Early in the year, we completed the transformatio",1860,"Thanks, Sujal. Good afternoon, and welcome. I would like to begin by providing some highlights for 2011, a year in which we endured a turbulent macro environment but made significant progress as a company. Early in the year, we completed the transformation of LSI with the transition to a pure play storage and networking semiconductor company with the divestiture of our storage systems business. We ended the year with an announcement to acquire SandForce, positioning LSI to benefit from the growing adoption of solid-state drives and flash storage solutions. Throughout the year, we were successful in increasing design win momentum with industry leaders such as Seagate, Ericsson, Cisco, IBM, HP, Dell and many others. Our revenues grew 9% year-over-year and 16% from the second half of 2010 to the second half of 2011, illustrating acceleration of revenue growth driven by the share gains and [indiscernible] cycles. This is still the only first of several expected stages of new product ramps from design wins accumulated over the past 3 years. For the full year, we generated double-digit revenue growth in HDD SoCs, ServeRAID and networking investment areas. Our growth, which significantly outpaced our end markets and many of our peers’, would have been even higher, particularly in hard disk drives, were it not for the impact of the unfortunate flooding in Thailand which affected our fourth quarter 2011 revenues. Specifically for the fourth quarter, our revenues of $523 million were in line with the midpoint of guidance, and I credit our team for their efforts in assessing market dynamics and flood-related constraints to enable us to correctly call the quarter back in October. We saw roughly $40 million of revenue impact in Q4 from Thailand flood-related issues. Our operations team has done an excellent job on recovery, including the qualification of new suppliers, and we expect to have the capability to meet all customer demand in Q1. As we look forward to 2012, we are excited by the new product cycle ramps, accumulated share gains and new opportunities we have ahead of us in the areas such as SandForce flash storage processors, PCIe flash adapters, HDD SoCs, SAS for Romley and multicore processors and custom products for networking. The midpoint of our guidance for Q1 reflects 20% year-over-year growth and is composed of 16% growth in our organic business, plus the addition of SandForce revenues. In Q1, we are seeing outperformance driven by a snapback of HDD, SSD and preamp shipments, new product ramps and the addition of SandForce revenues. We're excited to have closed the SandForce acquisition and have the team integrated into LSI as a new business unit. The acquisition greatly enhances LSI's competitive position in the fast-growing PCIe flash adapter market segment and it catapults LSI into an industry-leading position for the rapidly growing high-volume flash storage processor market for Ultrabooks, notebooks and enterprise SSD and flash solutions. We estimate that LSI's available market for PCIe flash-based adapters and flash storage processors is growing at an annual CAGR of nearly 40% over time and will represent a greater than $2 billion TAM expansion for LSI in the next several years. 
Going forward, we believe LSI is well positioned in large, exciting and fast-growing markets with solid fundamentals. We expect to benefit from growth in the deployment of server, storage and networking equipment for data centers, commercial and private clouds, and mobile networks, as well as the rapid adoption of flash storage. 
Now, I want to review additional business highlights for Q4. I will begin with our networking business, where our products address the wireless mobile network, data center and enterprise market segments and where we expect revenue from new products to grow at a faster than market growth rates over the coming years as we gain share and displace competitors. Year-over-year, we saw double-digit growth in our investment areas in networking driven by growth in standard and custom products for wireless infrastructure and enterprise applications. Investment area revenues were $284 million in 2011, representing nearly 2/3 of our overall networking business. Over the past 5 years, our investment areas have seen a 5-year compound annual growth rate of 28% while participating in market segments that have rich gross margins. This is a strong proof point of a well-executed strategy in networking, and we're excited about the new product cycles we have in this business. We expect overall networking revenues to grow year-over-year in 2012 along with accelerated profitability. 
We continue to be successful in increasing LSI's footprint in base stations and wireless backhaul infrastructure through a combination of our Axxia multicore communications processor and our custom silicon capability. With Axxia wins at Ericsson and strong progress at other wireless customers, we have now set a goal to exceed 50% share of data plane and control plane content in base station segments. Our network processors and now, Axxia , we are addressing a wireless data plane and control plane silicon TAM that is large and fast-growing with build outs of mobile networks. LSI solutions are increasingly being sought after based on superior performance and lower power consumption. 
In addition to Axxia, we are increasing our footprint in base stations with custom silicon wins for the baseband function, which sits alongside the data plane and control plane devices, and implements DSP functionality. We're currently participating in baseband custom silicon business at 4 out of the top 5 OEM vendors. In the enterprise market segment, we are pleased with our progress in expanding our business with a leading data networking company. We are now in production on a custom switch solution and continue to make strong progress on additional custom opportunities. As it pertains to Ethernet PHYs, we are fully ramped on an integrated custom Gigabit Ethernet PHY for client applications at Intel and also expect to ramp a custom Gigabit Ethernet MAC PHY solution for Romley server platforms. We recently announced an expansion of our long-term strategic relationship with ARM. The agreement will lead to new product solutions designed to address needs to accelerate network performance as applications such as mobile video and cloud computing dramatically increase network traffic. LSI will gain access to the broad family of ARM processors, including the ARM Cortex-A15 processor and ARM on-chip interconnect technology for use in multi-core applications. 
I'll now turn to server and storage, which includes 5 businesses: our new Flash business, SAS, ServeRAID adapter and software, SAN and HDD. In Flash, we are unique in offering standard product flash storage processors, or FSPs as we call them, as well as custom FSPs and PCIe flash adapters. FSPs manage the underlying flash memory and improve the endurance, reliability and performance of flash storage. In standard product FSPs, SandForce generated approximately $65 million in revenue in 2011 prior to our acquisition. For 2012, we expect solid growth at or above market rates based upon a very strong design win pipeline with industry leaders -- with leaders in the industry. The FSP industry has entered a rapid growth phase, and LSI is strongly positioned to benefit from this multiyear growth cycle. We continue to make progress at key customers with standard and custom FSPs in both client and enterprise segments. In the client market segment, we are in the final qualification with multiple flash manufacturers on our second generation of products and expect to start shipments in the first half of 2012. These customers target Tier 1 system OEMs in addition to expanding their footprint into the channel. 
In the enterprise market segment, our SSD OEMs are in qualification with multiple Tier 1 server and storage manufacturers to provide both high-volume SSDs, as well as high-performance caching and workload SSDs. In PCIe flash adapters, we offer our WarpDrive family. We're expanding and increasing focus in storage and server application acceleration, bringing the performance advantage of the Flash to enterprise servers, storage and networking applications. We are pleased to be participating in the EMC Lightning program, which we expect to begin ramping this quarter, and a new program at Cisco in their custom blade products. We've also won multiple designs with our combined WarpDrive and host-based CacheCade software at a Tier 1 server OEM and expect our solution to begin ramping next quarter. Beyond this, we continue to build momentum with new server and large scale Web customers on the largest PCIe flash revenue opportunities based upon a superior architecture and our significant position in the server ecosystem. 
We are now near production on our second-generation WarpDrive PCIe products, which use the latest generation SandForce FSP and integrate LSI CacheCade software for application acceleration. This second-generation WarpDrive supports SLC, cMLC and EMLC, enabling flexibility to optimize for performance, cost, high density and endurance. 
In our SAS business, we expect to be shipping 6-gig SAS silicon to all top 10 server OEMs this quarter with the rollout of the Intel Romley platform. The next key inflection point in the SAS market will be the adoption of 12-gig SAS silicon. Server and external storage OEMs have already begun the evaluation and selection process. Our expectation is that the first usage will occur in 2012 with production in 2013. LSI began to sample next-generation 12-gig SAS ROCs, controllers and expanders to major customers in July, at least 6 months ahead of our competition, putting us in excellent position to grow share at this next transition. 
We continue to make progress with External Storage Systems customers following the divestiture of our systems business. We estimate that our share in SAS for External Storage grew from 35% in 2010 to 40% in 2011. With our lead in 12-gig SAS, we expect to gain share in this upcoming transition. 
In hard disk drives, we saw unit TAM decline by approximately 30% from Q3 to Q4 as a result of the situation in Thailand. However, we continue to gain share in Seagate’s enterprise platforms and ramp new SSCs into client drives. We're confident in our ability to support sequential growth in Q1 at our HDD customers. 
Achieving a key milestone last year, LSI was the first supplier shipping SSCs for 1 terabyte per platter hard drives to customers, illustrating our technology leadership in this market segment. During the quarter, we also introduced the industry's first 28-nanometer read channel featuring a new LDPC architecture, enabling HD manufacturers to achieve increased areal density, higher yield and lower power consumption for HDDs. This is now the third consecutive technology transition where LSI has been ahead of the competition. 
Customer-specific SSC samples built on this technology will become available in the first half of this year that will support notebook, desktop and enterprise HDDs. The enhanced low power management features in these SSCs are critical to extending battery life in notebooks and to reduce some energy costs in data centers. 
To wrap up, we think it's time to take a new look at LSI.  We're seeing the results of a multiyear growth strategy and are well positioned with share gain opportunities and new product cycles to enable us to outgrow the storage and networking markets we serve. Now let me turn the call over to Bryon who will take you through our results and provide guidance."

I'd like to begin by providing a few highlights and perspectives on LSI's financial performance for the full year. As a reminder, we successfully announced and closed the sale of our External",1409,"Thanks, Abhi, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. I'd like to begin by providing a few highlights and perspectives on LSI's financial performance for the full year. As a reminder, we successfully announced and closed the sale of our External Systems business early in 2011. The financial results of the External Systems business have been classified as discontinued operations in LSI's financial statements. Our ongoing business is and has been referred to as continuing operations. The results we are covering for the full year 2011, as well as for Q4 and going forward, will be for continuing operations. 
We closed 2011 with annual revenues of $2.04 billion, representing 9.3% year-over-year growth. Gross margins for the full year, excluding special items, were 51.5%. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $794 million for the year as we remained focused on expense controls throughout the year, growing revenues at a rate higher than expenses. Operating income, excluding special items, was $258 million or 12.6% of revenues for the full year. In addition, one of our key focus areas has consistently been to maintain and grow our net cash position while driving efficient working capital management. In 2011, we delivered $247 million in operating cash flows and closed the year with $935 million in cash and short-term investments and no debt after having used approximately $499 million of cash to buy back stock. Finally, we successfully completed the SandForce acquisition in early January. Keep in mind, SandForce's business will be included in our guidance and results going forward as it closed on January 3. 
Now on to Q4 results and the Q1 outlook. LSI delivered a solid quarter consistent with the guidance we provided in October despite the challenges associated with the floods in Thailand. Revenues were down sequentially by 4.3% to $523 million, in line with our guidance range. Non-GAAP gross margins were 49.5%, lower than our guidance, primarily due to inventory charges associated with the Thailand flood. We continued to carefully manage expenses with non-GAAP operating expenses of $203 million, just at the midpoint of guidance. And we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.13. 
Now turning to a more detailed discussion of our financial results for the quarter beginning with revenues. Q4 revenues were $523 million, sequentially down 4.3% from $547 million. Our server and storage semiconductor revenues, which include products from our ServeRAID adapter and software, Flash, SAS, SAN and HDD businesses, were sequentially down $14 million or 4% to $389 million. As we noted earlier, this decline was driven by the flooding in Thailand and the related impact to the disk drive industry. Server and storage semiconductors represented 74% of total revenues in the fourth quarter. Q4 revenues in our networking business were $107 million or sequentially down 8% due primarily to softness in the wireless end market and, to a lesser extent, supply chain constraints generated by the flooding in Thailand. Networking represented 21% of total revenues for the fourth quarter. Revenues for the IP business were sequentially flat at $27 million. 
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's Q4 gross margin, excluding special items, was 49.5% and below the 51% guidance midpoint we provided in October. Included in our results is an inventory charge of approximately $7.5 million or 140 basis points of gross margin, which relates specifically to inventory damaged at one of our subcontractors in Thailand during the flooding. In terms of operating expenses, R&D, together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, totaled $203 million in Q4, just at the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 10.7% or $56 million. Interest income and other, net of interest expense, excluding special items, was $8 million for Q4. Approximately 2/3 of this amount was related to income from transition services associated with the sale of the External Systems business. 
We expect to see these service arrangements continue into Q1, but to a lesser extent, and to be completed by midyear. 
Now let me turn to the special items we recorded in the fourth quarter which netted to $62 million. Special items, primarily noncash, included $29 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $12 million of stock-based compensation expense and $21 million of restructuring costs and other items. 
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. We experienced such events in Q4, including both a shift in our geographic profit mix and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations, that resulted in a noncash tax benefit for the period versus the provision of $13 million we guided to in October. The tax benefit for Q4 was $8.8 million. 
On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter income from continuing operations was approximately $11 million or $0.02 per share. Fourth quarter GAAP net income, which includes income from discontinued operations, was a loss of $2 million or approximately neutral on a per share basis. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $73 million or $0.13 per share. The diluted weighted average share count for the periods for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was 573 million shares. This included -- this includes the weighted average benefit of purchasing approximately 5 million shares during the period under our share repurchase program. In 2011, we repurchased a total of 72 million shares and utilized approximately $499 million of our current $750 million buyback program. Our share buyback program remains in place with $251 million remaining in our authorization. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. Cash and short-term investments ended the 2011 fiscal year at approximately $935 million. We continue to operate with no debt on our balance sheet. Operating cash flows were $55 million in Q4 and $247 million for the full year. 
And finally with respect to Q4 results, depreciation and software amortization was $14 million for Q4 and $71 million for the full year, while capital expenditures were $14 million in the quarter and $61 million for the full year. 
Next is a discussion of our guidance for continuing operations in Q1 2012. Q1 revenues in the range of $550 million to $590 million were sequentially up approximately 9% at midpoint. We expect our server and storage semiconductors revenues to be sequentially up in Q1. This includes approximately $20 million to $25 million of flash storage processor revenues associated with our recent acquisition, along with a snapback in HDD, SLC and preamp shipments following a soft Q4. In addition, we expect our server-related revenues to be sequentially down due to expected seasonality. We expect our networking semiconductor revenues to be relatively flat to down. Gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be 51%, plus or minus 1%, as we experienced better absorption of fixed costs at higher revenues. Operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the range of $215 million to $225 million. Included in this guidance is approximately $15 million of operating expense associated with the acquisition. Interest income and other and interest expense, excluding special items, is expected to net to income of approximately $5 million, approximately half of which is related to transition services. Special items are expected to net to approximately $70 million to $90 million. This increase is primarily driven by an expected onetime charge of approximately $15 million in Q1 due to the purchase accounting effect on inventory assumed in the acquisition, along with expected increases in amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and other items primarily associated with the acquisition. 
The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $9 million for Q1. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 12% for 2012. We expect Q1 GAAP income per share from continuing operations in the range of negative $0.07 to a positive $0.03 and non-GAAP income from continuing operations in the range of $0.09 to $0.15 per share. The share count is expected to be approximately 575 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $18 million for Q1 and $70 million for the full year and capital expenditures of approximately $20 million in Q1 and $65 million for the full year. 
In closing, we delivered solid revenues in Q4, despite the difficult environment. We remain focused on driving operating leverage and are excited about 2012 and our business prospects going forward. Now let me turn the call to Sujal."

And that's obviously both the recovery and growth in HDD SoCs, but also a pretty significant and strong recovery in preamps.

And our ability to do both, we are already seeing a competitive advantage in being able to have that conversation and engage at whatever level of engagement is appropriate for a customer and their product strategies. So that combination is a strong competitive advantage.

I would like to begin by providing some highlights for the first quarter. Our revenue of $ 622 million represented 19% sequential growth and over 30% year-over-year growth driven by 3 main components. A snap back in HDD business, better-than-expected strength in our newly acquired SandForce Flash business, and growth in networking investment areas. We are demonstrating strong operating margin expansion and retain over 16% on operating margins in Q1, showing progress towards our new business model target of 20% to 22%. We also continue to increase momentum with leaders in the industry with SandForce flash wordprocessor wins at Intel and SanDisk, PCIe flash adapters and software wins at Oracle and IBM, and Axxia multi-core processor wins at 2 top base station OEMs and 12 gig fast wins at 2 top server OEMs. At our Analyst Day event last month, we talked about our company being a new LSI. With all ingredients now in place to expending shareholder value. This is an exciting time for our industry and we have centered LSI within the key secular trends of data and traffic growth. We're effectively positioned and focused on large and exciting market segment including Datacenter cloud, mobile networks and Flash. Our increasingly connected world is generating data and traffic faster than the current IT investments can keep up, which we believe will generate increased demand for our solutions. These data and traffic generators include social platforms, the growth of the mobile Internet with the rise of smartphones and tablets, rapid proliferation of video, collection and real-time analysis of massive amount of data, and growth for cloud services. 
LSI is well-positioned to respond to these trends with a broad portfolio of storage and networking solutions  that uniquely leverage intelligence to help accelerate access to data, improve application performance and enable highly efficient network utilization. As we move through 2012, we're excited by new product cycles, accumulated share gains and new opportunities that we have ahead of us across our businesses. 
Now, I want to review additional business highlights for Q1. I will begin with our networking business where our products address the wireless mobile network, Datacenter and enterprise market segments, and where we expect revenue from new products to grow faster than market rates over the coming years as we gain share and displace competitors with designs we have won  in the last few years. We continue to make progress to increase our content in the stations to a combination of our Axxia multi-core communications processor and our custom silicon capability. Specifically, our solutions address an estimated $2 billion in the wireless SAN opportunity in 2015 that encompass data plane, control plane switch, base band and digital front end functions. LSI's already secured wins which we expect will enable greater than 50% share of data plane controlled plane functions and 40% share of base band functions. LSI solutions are strongly differentiated with superior performance and low-power consumption. The architecture integrates purpose built acceleration engines for functions such as traffic management, traffic classification and security, which offload these function for the main CPU, thereby boosting performance. In fact, one key customer demonstrated that Axxia has twice the performance per watt of a competing multi-core processor in wireless transport processing. Going forward, we are excited with our partnership with ARM that will be benefit of multicore ARM to our industry-leading Axxia architecture. 
We are now turning Axxia lose in the enterprise market segment where we are focused on an enterprise, data center TAM we expect to be over $2 billion in 2015 for processors switch in 5 functions. Earlier this week, we announced the expansion of our Axxia communication processor portfolio to target enterprise applications. Today's enterprise and cloud data centers are dealing with both massive data growth and the impact of virtualization, creating bottlenecks and switching. The Axxia Communication Processor delivers intelligent exploration to help data center architects cope with traffic growth. As a proof point Axxia has been chosen for a leading data center switch platform. Also in enterprise, we have 1 custom solutions for layer 2 and layer 3 switching and routing at a leading data networking customer with revenue ramps beginning before the end of this year. We are fully ramped on an integrated custom gigabit Ethernet 5 for client applications at Intel, we expect that this device will also be integrated into the upcoming Ultrabook launch. We have also begun ramping up custom gigabit Ethernet Mac 5 for solution for Romley server platform. 
I'll now turn to server and storage which includes 5 businesses: Our Flash businesses, SAS, server RAID adapter and software, Sand and HDD. In Flash, we are unique in offering 3 product families. Standard product flash towards processor or FSPs, custom FSPs and PCIe flash adapters with caching enduring software, strongly positioning LSI to benefit from a multiyear growth cycle in Flash-based storage solutions. In FSP, our Q1 revenues were above expectations and we continue to build momentum with key leaders in the industry, and believe we are positioned to be the share leader in 2012. LSI delivers better performance and we also enable customers by providing, not only Flash storage processor silicon, but also firmware, manufacturing and test tools and SSD wins designs. 
In addition, we continue to support in production all 6 major flash vendors and are well-positioned to support the latest generation of Flash at the earliest time to market for our customers. This unique model of providing Kingery [ph] to produce SSD continues to drive our momentum in both client and enterprise applications. In client, we have a displaced the competition by securing wins with Intel, for their 520 and 330 series SSD and we have also won 15 additional SSD models that were announced in the quarter at other suppliers. We are also well-positioned for the ramp of Ultrabooks, both in systems where the SSD is used as SAS main storage and in dual drive systems, where smaller capacity Flash is used as a cache in conduction with high-capacity HDDs. 
Our enterprise momentum is also increasing as we release production firmware for our second-generation FSP in the first quarter. We expect volume production at Enterprises system OEMs this quarter and new platforms to launch throughout the rest of the year. 
In PCIe flash adapters, we are expanding and increasing focus in storage and server application acceleration bringing the performance advantages of Flash to  Enterprise storage, server and networking applications. We recently introduced our nitro product line which encompasses Nitro work drive, Nitro XP and Nitro Mega Rate. This is a family of solutions that combine PCIe Flash technology with intelligent caching and management software to achieve accelerated application performance. We are also expanded our offerings to include NLC based solutions, as well as a wider range of capacity points. Nitro solutions allow data centers Enterprises to contend with massive data growth and speed the ability of databases and other applications to access data and provide real-time analytics and reporting. 
Building on the established LSI SAS and Mega Rate infrastructure, the Nitro portfolio represents a strategic inflection, enabling broader adoption across Enterprise and data center workloads. LSI is not only develop solutions to address early adoption of PCIe Flash, but we now offer a full range of Flash capacity coupled with seamless caching and acceleration software which is unique in the industry. A prime example of this new approach is Nitro MegaRAID, which combines high performance Flash and intelligent caching software onto a single PCI card, enabling an end user to use the solution where they use MegaRAID today and achieve up to 30x performance improvement. Nitro MegaRAID use the same tools, standard OS drivers and management as MegaRAID enabling OEMs and end-users to deploy it with minimal effort. This is a breakthrough in usability and is the key to expanding flash to ultimately become an every unit item in servers. The Nitro product line will go into production this quarter utilizing the industry's best-in-class SandForce flash storage processors, another clear differentiating feature. 
Our leadership position has enabled us to secure a new PCIe flash adapters wins with Oracle and IBM, which are proved points of the benefits of the Nitro architecture and also significant position in the server ecosystem. 
In our SAS and RAID business, LSI solutions will power more than 200 new server models based on the recently introduced Intel Romley platform. Server market leaders, including Dell, IBM, Intel and others that selected LSI 6 gig SAS and MegaRAID solutions for new data center servers. We have a shipped more than 30 million SAS ICs in close to 5 million SAS storage adapters establishing LSI as the SAS proprietor of choice for the world's leading server manufacturers. 
In addition, key customers in China and Taiwan has elected LSI's 6 gig SAS and MegaRAID solutions for their Romley platform rollouts. These include Wally, Lenovo, ZTE, Acer, and many others. As why the adoption of our 6 gig SAS technology continues, LSI is in a position to support customers at the next critical inflection point, the 12 gig SAS rollout. LSI is at least 6 months ahead of our competition and we have already been awarded the industry's first 12 gig SAS ROC design wins at 2 top tier server OEMs. 
In hard disk drives, we're seeing near term benefits from a snapback following Thailand flood related issues. We set a new record in Q1 for largest customer and we expect further growth in Q2 in line with increased demand. Our HDD team has done an outstanding job on recovery from flood-related issues which enabled us to meet elevated demand and without our key customers to be successful in the marketplace. 
Beyond the near-term upside, the underlying fundamentals of our HDD business are solid. We expect to grow revenues and the share year-over-year in 2012 with continued ramp of enterprise SSDs, increased demand for high-capacity 3.5 inch drives by cloud deployment and shipments of SSD and preamps in all the 3 HD OEMs by the end of this year. 
To wrap up, we think it's time to take a new look at LSI. We are seeing the results of our multi-year growth strategy and are well-positioned with share gain opportunities and new product cycles to enable us to grow our business in excess of the markets that we serve. 
Now, let me hand the call over to Bryon who will take you through our results and provide guidance."
30956,183752459,289118,"LSI Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2012",2012-04-25,"Earnings Calls","LSI Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. LSI delivered a solid first quarter meeting or exceeding the update we provided in March at our Analyst Day. A few of the highlights are as follows. Revenues increased sequentially by 19% to 200 -- to $622 mil",1228,"Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. LSI delivered a solid first quarter meeting or exceeding the update we provided in March at our Analyst Day. 
A few of the highlights are as follows. Revenues increased sequentially by 19% to 200 -- to $622 million. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded to 52.4%. We continue to carefully manage expenses with non-GAAP operating expenses of $224 million. And we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.20. Moreover, the company grew the top line by approximately 32% year-over-year, while expanding year-over-year non-GAAP operating margins from 12% to 16.4%. 
We are pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter, which represents the strongest first quarter non-GAAP operating income percentage we've had in several years, and demonstrate significant progress towards our new business model target of 20% to 22%. 
Now turning to a more detailed discussion of our financial results for the quarter beginning with revenues. Q1 revenues were $622 million, sequentially up 19% from $523 million. Q1 revenues in our networking business were $107 million, flat sequentially and represented 17% of total revenues for the first quarter. Our investment areas grew sequentially but were offset by declines in our legacy products. 
Moving next to our server and storage semiconductor revenues. As a reminder, we will be including revenues from standard and custom flash storage processors along with our PCIe flash adapter and software products within this category as we discuss the results and provide guidance. In the aggregate, server and storage semiconductor revenues will consist of our ServeRAID adapter and software, Flash, SAS, SAN and HDD businesses. Revenues for server and storage semiconductors were sequentially up $100 million or 26% to $408 million and represented 78% of total revenues in the first quarter. This upside was primarily driven by a snapback in demand in our HDD business, along with better-than-expected strength in our newly acquired SandForce Flash business, and partially offset by typical seasonality in other product areas. Revenues for the IP business were $27 million. 
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's Q1 gross margin, excluding special items, was 52.4%. Gross margins increased sequentially by approximately 290 basis points, primarily due to the recovery from the effects in Q4 relating to the Thailand flood, along with improved absorption of fixed cost with higher revenues. In terms of operating expenses, R&D, together with SG&A expenses excluding special items, totaled $224 million in Q1 primarily driven by the addition of SandForce. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter increased sequentially to 16.4% or $102 million. Interest income and other net interest expense excluding special items was $9 million for Q1, approximately half of which was related to income from transition services associated with the sale of our External Systems business last year. 
Now let me turn to the special items which we recorded in the first quarter which netted to $42 million. Special items primarily noncash included $31 million of stock-based compensation expense, $30 million in amortization of acquisition related items, $15 million of restructuring cost and other items, $14 million from the purchase accounting affect on inventory relating to the SandForce acquisition, offset by a $43 million tax benefit reported in Q1 relating to the SandForce acquisition, and a $6 million investment gain related to the acquisition. 
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision on both a GAAP a non-GAAP basis can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. The non-GAAP tax benefit we recorded for Q1 was $6 million compared to the $9 million provision we guided you in March. This favorability of approximately $15 million or $0.025 per diluted share was primarily due to discrete items associated with the exploration of limitations along with the change in profitability across our geographic tax jurisdictions. The GAAP tax benefit we recorded for the period was a favorable $49 million primarily due to the one-time tax benefit associated with the SandForce acquisition we mentioned in March.  On a GAAP basis, first quarter income from continuing operations was approximately $75 million or $0.13 per diluted share. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $117 million or $0.20 per diluted share. The weighted average share count for the period for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was 591 million shares. This includes the weighted average benefit of purchasing approximately 4.6 million shares during the period under our share repurchase program. The majority of the sequential increase in our reported share count used to calculate earnings per share with a result of our stock price increasing and subsequently increasing the dilutive effect of about standing options and RSUs on reported shares. 
Relative to our existing share repurchase authorization, we have repurchased a total of 77 million shares and utilized approximately $537 million for our current $750 million buyback program. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. Cash and short-term investments ended the March quarter at approximately $623 million. Within the quarter, we acquired SandForce, primarily for cash, as well as capital purchases of property plant and equipment, including and new headquarter facility in San Jose. We're excited about the opportunity to consolidate into 1 facility in the Bay Area, which we expect will drive efficiencies and lower our cost. 
Operating cash flow for the first quarter were $15 million, and we continue to operate with no debt on our balance sheet. 
Finally, with respect to Q1 results. Depreciation and software amortization was $15 million and capital expenditures was $65 million. 
Next is a discussion of our guidance for Q2 2012. Q2 revenues in the range of $630 million to $670 million or sequentially up about 4% at midpoint, we expect our server and storage semiconductor revenues to be sequentially up in Q2, and our networking semiconductor revenues to be roughly flat. 
Gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be 53%, plus or minus 1%. Operating expenses excluding special items in a range of $225 million to $235 million with the increase primarily driven by annual salary merit increases, which take effect in the second quarter. 
At midpoint, our guidance represents further expansion in non-GAAP operating income to approximately 17.5% for Q2, which is above our prior business model target of 17%, and demonstrates further progress towards reaching 20% to 22%. 
Interest income and other and interest expense excluding special items is expected to net to income of approximately $3 million. This sequential decline is primarily due to the completion of transition services relating to the sale of our External Systems business. 
Special items are expected to net to approximately $50 million to $70 million. Included in these special items is approximately $24 million of expected of stock-based compensation for Q2. The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $11 million for Q2. 
We expect Q2 GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $0.03 to $0.13, and non-GAAP net income in the range of $0.15 to $0.21 per diluted share. The share count is expected to be approximately 600 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. 
In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $16 million and capital expenditures of approximately $20 million. 
In closing, we delivered solid expansion of revenues, gross margin and operating income in the first quarter as we continue demonstrate significant progress towards our new business model targets. 
Now let me turn the call to Sujal."

If we look at our networking investment areas, we expect that to grow in Q2, kind of consistent with what some of our peers are also saying. At the same time, we've got some legacy declines. Longer-term, we're very excited about our networking strategy and the success that we've had with Axxia, also combined with our custom silicon capability. Not only in wireless infrastructure as we alluded to in our Analyst Day, where we've got some very significant wins that will enable us to have 50% share and the control and data plan and even 40% share in baseband functions with next generation systems which are just now started beginning in the development phase. And as we also discussed in prepared remarks, we're starting to now take Axxia and expand that into an enterprise, in particular, data centers switching that can really leverage the architecture's benefits."

We are in production with Axxia today at a major wireless infrastructure provider today. So we're already now in the production, and we expect that to grow as we bring on many customers and we announced second customer out of the major players as well. And that has now just started development. And we expect our networking investment areas which again comprise wireless networks as well as enterprise customers standard to continue to outpace our legacy declines. And we still expect, assuming CapEx returned to the wireless space is having everyone is expecting, exiting Q2 into the second half that in aggregate our networking business should grow this year. Okay? In hard disk drives. Lots of moving parts, obviously. Both TAM increases, post-merger product roadmap rationalization and decisions as well. Ramps of new products, very, very difficult to really call how things play out in the second half.

Just a number of facts. First of all, in Q4, let me back off, we have a hub based supply chain model with our customers. So we have complete visibility in that inventory that we maintain and our customers have no intent to order more than they need because they order, when they pull from the hub, they build the drive-in and they ship it. So we have a very good visibility from that standpoint. Just some other facts. We under shipped our customers in Q4 because our customers leveraged what they had from an inventory standpoint. So we probably under shipped between 2 million to 4 million units in Q4. As it pertains to Q1, there were a number of factors that drove our performance, and I think one factor that is not well understood is our preamp business. Our preamp business was estimated in Q4 because that's where the type was aided the hardest and is our preamp business grow almost from Q4 to Q1, which is also part of the growth that we experienced. In addition to that, some of the other factors who are growing share in enterprise and so we saw a nice grow Q4 to Q1 in the enterprise space.

Some of the technologies that we have around where management and so forth, such as our technology is another example. I think the other key to the success that SandForce's had, which enabled many players in the marketplace is the fact that we have a very complete comprehensive firmware base, as well as the ability to provide a level of customization, as well as we do see that required across a lot of the major players as well as they personalized that something that we do extensively and are also building up support to take on more of that because we think that's going to be a differentiator in terms of support as well. And then we've been providing reference designs to enable more players into the marketplace. And I think the other element which is not well understood by a lot of people is the cost and capability. Because we also are not experiencing some of the large SSP players, as they try to cover a very broad-based SSD segments and that's market is going to continue to bifurcate.

I would like to begin by providing some highlights for the first quarter. Our revenue of $ 622 million represented 19% sequential growth and over 30% year-over-year growth, driven by 3 main components: a snapbac",1745,"Thanks, Sujal. Good afternoon, and welcome. I would like to begin by providing some highlights for the first quarter. Our revenue of $ 622 million represented 19% sequential growth and over 30% year-over-year growth, driven by 3 main components: a snapback in HDD business, better-than-expected strength in our newly acquired SandForce flash business, and growth in networking investment areas. We are demonstrating strong operating margin expansion and attained over 16% non-GAAP operating margins in Q1, showing progress towards our new business model target of 20% to 22%. 
We also continue to increase momentum with leaders in the industry, with SandForce flash storage processor wins at Intel and SanDisk, PCIe flash adapter and software wins at Oracle and IBM, and Axxia multi-core processor wins at 2 top base station OEMs and 12-gig fast wins at 2 top server OEMs. 
At our Analyst Day event last month, we talked about our company being a new LSI, with all ingredients now in place to drive the expanding shareholder value. This is an exciting time for our industry, and we have centered LSI within the key secular trends of data and traffic growth. We're effectively positioned and focused on large and exciting market segments, including data center cloud, mobile networks and flash. 
Our increasingly connected world is generating data and traffic faster than the current IT investments can keep up, which we believe will generate increased demand for our solutions. These data and traffic generators include social platforms, the growth of the mobile Internet with the rise of smartphones and tablets, rapid proliferation of video, collection and real-time analysis of massive amounts of data and growth of cloud services. 
LSI is well positioned to respond to these trends with a broad portfolio of storage and networking solutions that uniquely leverage intelligence to help accelerate access to data, improve application performance and enable highly efficient network utilization. As we move through 2012, we're excited by new product cycles, accumulated share gains and new opportunities that we have ahead of us across our businesses. 
Now I want to review additional business highlights for Q1. I will begin with our networking business, where our products address the wireless mobile network, data center and enterprise market segments, and where we expect revenue from new products to grow faster than market rates over the coming years as we gain share and displace competitors with designs we have won in the last few years. 
We continue to make progress to increase our content in base stations through a combination of our Axxia multi-core communications processor and our custom silicon capability. Specifically, our solutions address an estimated $2 billion in wireless SAN opportunity in 2015 that encompasses data plane, control plane switch, base band and digital front-end functions. LSI has already secured wins, which we expect will enable greater than 50% share of data plane, control plane functions and 40% share of base band functions. 
LSI solutions are strongly differentiated with superior performance and low power consumption. The Axxia architecture integrates purpose-built acceleration engines for functions such as traffic management, packet classification and security, which off-load these functions from the main CPU, thereby boosting performance. In fact, one key customer demonstrated that Axxia has twice the performance per watt of a competing multi-core processor in wireless transport processing. Moving forward, we are excited with our partnership with ARM that will bring the benefit of multi-core ARM to our industry-leading Axxia architecture. 
We are now turning Axxia loose in the enterprise market segment, where we are focused on an enterprise, data center TAM we expect to be over $2 billion in 2015 for processor, switch and PHY functions. Earlier this week, we announced the expansion of our Axxia communication processor portfolio to target enterprise applications. Today's enterprise and cloud data centers are dealing with both massive data growth and the impact of virtualization, creating bottlenecks and switching. The Axxia communication processor delivers intelligent acceleration to help data center architects cope with traffic growth. As a proof point, Axxia has been chosen for a leading data center switch platform. 
Also in enterprise, we have one custom solutions for layer 2 and layer 3 switching and routing at a leading data networking customer with revenue ramps beginning before the end of this year. We are fully ramped on an integrated custom Gigabit Ethernet PHY for client applications at Intel. We expect that this device will also be integrated into the upcoming Ultrabook launch. We have also begun ramping a custom Gigabit Ethernet Mac/PHY solution for Romley server platforms. 
I'll now turn to server and storage which includes 5 businesses: our flash businesses, SAS, ServeRAID adapter and software, SAN and HDD. 
In flash, we are unique in offering 3 product families: standard product flash storage processor or FSPs, custom FSPs and PCIe flash adapters with caching and tiering software, strongly positioning LSI to benefit from a multi-year growth cycle in flash-based storage solutions. 
In FSPs, our Q1 revenues were above expectations, and we continue to build momentum with key leaders in the industry and believe we are positioned to be the share leader in 2012. LSI delivers better performance, and we also enable customers by providing, not only flash storage processor silicon, but also firmware, manufacturing and test tools and SSD OEM designs. In addition, we continue to support in production all 6 major flash vendors and are well positioned to support the latest generation of flash at the earliest time to market for our customers. 
This unique model of providing key ingredients to produce SSDs continues to drive our momentum in both client and enterprise applications. In client, we have a displaced the competition by securing wins with Intel for their 520 and 330 series SSD, and we have also won 15 additional SSD models that were announced in the quarter at other suppliers. We are also well positioned for the ramp of Ultrabooks, both in systems, where the SSD is used as SAS main storage; and in dual-drive systems, where smaller capacity flash is used as a cache in conjunction with high-capacity HDDs. 
Our enterprise momentum is also increasing as we released production firmware for our second-generation FSP in the first quarter. We expect volume production in enterprises system OEMs this quarter and new platforms to launch throughout the rest of the year. 
In PCIe flash adapters, we are expanding and increasing focus in storage and server application acceleration, bringing the performance advantages of flash to  enterprise storage, server and networking applications. We recently introduced our Nytro product line, which encompasses Nytro WarpDrive, Nytro XD and Nytro MegaRAID. This is a family of solutions that combines PCIe flash technology with intelligent caching and management software to achieve accelerated application performance. We also expanded our offerings to include MLC-based solutions, as well as a wider range of capacity points. Nytro solutions allow data centers and enterprises to contend with massive data growth and speed the ability of databases and other applications to access data and provide real-time analytics and reporting. 
Building on the established LSI SAS and MegaRAID infrastructure, the Nytro portfolio represents a strategic inflection, enabling broader adoption across enterprise and data center workloads. LSI has not only developed solutions to address early adoption of PCIe flash, but we now offer a full range of flash capacity coupled with seamless caching and acceleration software, which is unique in the industry. A prime example of this new approach is Nytro MegaRAID, which combines MegaRAID, high performance flash and intelligent caching software onto a single PCI card, enabling an end user to use the solution where they use MegaRAID today and achieve up to 30x performance improvement. 
Nytro MegaRAID uses the same tools, standard OS drivers and management as MegaRAID, enabling OEMs and end users to deploy it with minimal effort. This is a breakthrough in usability and is the key to expanding flash to ultimately become an every-unit item in servers. The Nytro product line will go into production this quarter utilizing the industry's best-in-class SandForce flash storage processors, another clear differentiating feature. Our leadership position has enabled us to secure a new PCIe flash adapters wins with Oracle and IBM, which are proof points of the benefits of the Nytro architecture and also significant position in the server ecosystem. 
In our SAS and RAID business, LSI solutions will power more than 200 new server models based on the recently introduced Intel Romley platform. Server market leaders, including Dell, IBM, Intel and others, have selected LSI 6-gig SAS and MegaRAID solutions for new data center servers. We have a shipped more than 30 million SAS ICs and close to 5 million SAS storage adapters, establishing LSI as the SAS provider of choice for the world's leading server manufacturers. 
In addition, key customers in China and Taiwan has elected LSI's 6-gig SAS and MegaRAID solutions for their Romley platform rollouts. These include Huwawei, Lenovo, ZTE, Acer, ASUSTeK, Inventec, Quanta and many others. As why the adoption of our 6-gig SAS technology continues, LSI is in a position to support customers at the next critical inflection point, the 12-gig SAS rollout. LSI is at least 6 months ahead of our competition, and we have already been awarded the industry's first 12-gig SAS ROC design wins at 2 top-tier server OEMs. 
In hard disk drives, we are seeing near-term benefits from a snapback following Thailand flood-related issues. We set a new record in Q1 for SoCs shipped to our largest customer, and we expect further growth in Q2 in line with increased demand. Our HDD team has done an outstanding job on recovery from flood-related issues, which has enabled us to meet elevated demand and allowed our key customers to be successful in the marketplace. 
Beyond the near-term upside, the underlying fundamentals of our HDD business are solid. We expect to grow revenues and the share year-over-year in 2012 with continued ramp of enterprise SSCs, increased demand for high-capacity 3.5-inch drives driven by cloud deployments and shipments of SoC and preamps into all 3 HD OEMs by the end of this year. 
To wrap up, we think it's time to take a new look at LSI. We are seeing the results of our multi-year growth strategy and are well positioned with share gain opportunities and new product cycles to enable us to grow our business in excess of the markets that we serve. 
Now let me hand the call over to Bryon, who will take you through our results and provide guidance."

LSI delivered a solid first quarter, meeting or exceeding the update we provided in March at our Analyst Day. A few of the highlights are as follows: Revenues increased sequentially by 19% to 200 -- to $622 mi",1230,"Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. LSI delivered a solid first quarter, meeting or exceeding the update we provided in March at our Analyst Day. 
A few of the highlights are as follows: Revenues increased sequentially by 19% to 200 -- to $622 million. Non-GAAP gross margins expanded to 52.4%. We continue to carefully manage expenses with non-GAAP operating expenses of $224 million, and we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.20. Moreover, the company grew at the top line by approximately 32% year-over-year, while expanding year-over-year non-GAAP operating margins from 12% to 16.4%. We're pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter, which represents the strongest first quarter non-GAAP operating income percentage we've had in several years and demonstrate significant progress towards our new business model target of 20% to 22%. 
Now turning to a more detailed discussion of our financial results for the quarter, beginning with revenues. Q1 revenues were $622 million, sequentially up 19% from $523 million. Q1 revenues in our networking business were $107 million, flat sequentially and represented 17% of total revenues for the first quarter. Our investment areas grew sequentially but were offset by declines in our legacy products. 
Moving next to our server and storage semiconductor revenues. As a reminder, we will be including revenues from standard and custom flash storage processors, along with our PCIe flash adapter and software products within this category as we discuss the results and provide guidance. In the aggregate, server and storage semiconductor revenues will consist of our ServeRAID adapter and software, flash, SAS, SAN and HDD businesses. 
Revenues for server and storage semiconductors were sequentially up $100 million or 26% to $488 million and represented 78% of total revenues in the first quarter. This upside was primarily driven by a snapback in demand in our HDD business, along with better-than-expected strength in our newly acquired SandForce flash business, and partially offset by typical seasonality in other product areas. Revenues for the IP business were $27 million. 
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's Q1 gross margin, excluding special items, was 52.4%. Gross margins increased sequentially by approximately 290 basis points, primarily due to the recovery from the effects in Q4 relating to the Thailand flood, along with improved absorption of fixed costs with higher revenues. In terms of operating expenses, R&D, together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, totaled $224 million in Q1, primarily driven by the addition of SandForce. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter increased sequentially to 16.4% or $102 million. Interest income and other net of interest expense, excluding special items, was $9 million for Q1, approximately half of which was related to income from transition services associated with the sale of our external systems business last year. 
Now let me turn to the special items, which we recorded in the first quarter, which netted to $42 million. Special items, primarily non-cash, included $31 million of stock-based compensation expense, $30 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $15 million of restructuring costs and other items, $14 million from the purchase accounting effect on inventory relating to the SandForce acquisition, offset by a $43 million tax benefit reported in Q1 relating to the SandForce acquisition and a $6 million investment gain related to the acquisition. 
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. The non-GAAP tax benefit we recorded for Q1 was $6 million compared to the $9 million provision we guided to in March. This favorability of approximately $15 million or $0.025 per diluted share was primarily due to discrete items associated with the exploration of statutes of limitations, along with the change in profitability across our geographic tax jurisdictions. The GAAP tax benefit we recorded for the period was a favorable $49 million, primarily due to the onetime tax benefit associated with the SandForce acquisition we mentioned in March.  
On a GAAP basis, first quarter income from continuing operations was approximately $75 million or $0.13 per diluted share. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $117 million or $0.20 per diluted share. The weighted average share count for the period for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was 591 million shares. This includes the weighted average benefit of purchasing approximately 4.6 million shares during the period under our share repurchase program. 
The majority of the sequential increase in our reported share count used to calculate earnings per share was the result of our stock price increasing and subsequently increasing the dilutive effect of outstanding options and RSUs on reported shares. Relative to our existing share repurchase authorization, we have repurchased a total of 77 million shares and utilized approximately $537 million for our current $750 million buyback program. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. Cash and short-term investments ended the March quarter at approximately $623 million. Within the quarter, we acquired SandForce, primarily for cash, as well as capital purchases of property, plant and equipment, including a new headquarters facility in San Jose. We're excited about the opportunity to consolidate into one facility in the Bay Area, which we expect will drive efficiencies and lower our costs. 
Operating cash flows for the first quarter were $50 million, and we continue to operate with no debt on our balance sheet. Finally, with respect to Q1 results, depreciation and software amortization was $15 million, and capital expenditures was $65 million. 
Next is a discussion of our guidance for Q2 in 2012. Q2 revenues in the range of $630 million to $670 million were sequentially up about 4% at midpoint. We expect our server and storage semiconductor revenues to be sequentially up in Q2, and our networking semiconductor revenues to be roughly flat. Gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be 53%, plus or minus 1%. 
Operating expenses, excluding special items, in a range of $225 million to $235 million, with the increase primarily driven by annual salary merit increases, which take effect in the second quarter. 
At midpoint, our guidance represents further expansion in non-GAAP operating income to approximately 17.5% for Q2, which is above our prior business model target of 17%, and demonstrates further progress towards reaching 20% to 22%. 
Interest income and other and interest expense, excluding special items, is expected to net to income of approximately $3 million. This sequential decline is primarily due to the completion of transition services relating to the sale of our external systems business. 
Special items are expected to net to approximately $50 million to $70 million. Included in these special items is approximately $24 million of expected of stock-based compensation for Q2. 
The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $11 million for Q2. We expect Q2 GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $0.03 to $0.13 and non-GAAP net income in the range of $0.15 to $0.21 per diluted share. The share count is expected to be approximately 600 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $16 million and capital expenditures of approximately $20 million. 
In closing, we delivered solid expansion of revenues, gross margin and operating income in the first quarter as we continue demonstrate significant progress towards our new business model targets.

If we look at our networking investment areas, we expect that to grow in Q2, kind of consistent with what some of our peers are also saying. At the same time, we've got some legacy declines. Longer term, we're very excited about our networking strategy and the success that we've had with Axxia, also combined with our custom silicon capability, not only in wireless infrastructure, as we alluded to in our Analyst Day, where we've got some very significant wins that will enable us to have 50% share in the control and data plane and even 40% share in baseband functions with next generation systems, which have just now started beginning in the development phase.

That still is not back up to probably full natural demand, but I think we agree with some of the comments that have been made. Notebook is pretty much all caught up. Enterprise is almost caught up. Desktop or 3.5-inch drives are not completely caught up, likely will catch up in Q3. We don't anticipate any inventory replenishment in Q2 either as output is still probably lagging demand, in particular, in the areas that I've discussed.

And we expect our networking investment areas, which again comprise wireless networks, as well as enterprise, custom and standard, to continue to outpace our legacy declines.

Yes, I've seen some of the analysis that was done around LSI potentially overshipping or shipping ahead of customers. I've looked at it and those are grossly inaccurate and is missing a number of elements as well. Just a number of facts. First of all, in Q4, let me back up, we have a hub-based supply chain model with our customers, so we have complete visibility into that inventory that we maintain. And our customers have no incentive to order more than they need because they order and they pull from the hub. They build the drive, and they ship it. So we have very good visibility from that standpoint. Just some other facts. We undershipped our customers in Q4 because our customers leveraged what they had from an inventory standpoint, so we probably undershipped to the tune of 4 million units in Q4. As it pertains to Q1, there were a number of factors that drove our performance, and I think one factor that is not well understood is our preamp business. Our preamp business was decimated in Q4 because that's where the Thai floods hit us the hardest. And we saw our preamp business grow almost 100% from Q4 to Q1, which is also part of the growth that we experienced.

Some of the technologies that we have around where management and so forth, such as our DuraClass technology is another example.

Because we think that is going to be a differentiator in terms of support as well. And then we've been providing reference designs to enable more players into the marketplace. And then I think the other element, which is not well understood by a lot of people, is the custom capability. Because we also are now experiencing some of the large SSD players as they try to cover a very broad base of SSD segments, and that market is going to continue to bifurcate. They have a strategies in certain areas where they want to do full custom to drive different levels of differentiation, and were doing that today because of our great custom capability in a number of areas they are going to use standard products, which are going to be SandForce-based.

I would like to begin by providing some highlights for the first quarter. Our revenue of $ 622 million represented 19% sequential growth and over 30% year-over-year growth, driven by 3 main components: a snapback in HDD business, better-than-expected strength in our newly acquired SandForce flash business, and growth in networking investment areas. We are demonstrating strong operating margin expansion and attained over 16% non-GAAP operating margins in Q1, showing progress towards our new business model target of 20% to 22%. 
We also continue to increase momentum with leaders in the industry, with SandForce flash storage processor wins at Intel and SanDisk, PCIe flash adapter and software wins at Oracle and IBM, and Axxia multi-core processor wins at 2 top base station OEMs and 12-gig fast wins at 2 top server OEMs. 
At our Analyst Day event last month, we talked about our company being a new LSI, with all ingredients now in place to drive the expanding shareholder value. This is an exciting time for our industry, and we have centered LSI within the key secular trends of data and traffic growth. We're effectively positioned and focused on large and exciting market segments, including data center cloud, mobile networks and flash. 
Our increasingly connected world is generating data and traffic faster than the current IT investments can keep up, which we believe will generate increased demand for our solutions. These data and traffic generators include social platforms, the growth of the mobile Internet with the rise of smartphones and tablets, rapid proliferation of video, collection and real-time analysis of massive amounts of data and growth of cloud services. 
LSI is well positioned to respond to these trends with a broad portfolio of storage and networking solutions that uniquely leverage intelligence to help accelerate access to data, improve application performance and enable highly efficient network utilization. As we move through 2012, we're excited by new product cycles, accumulated share gains and new opportunities that we have ahead of us across our businesses. 
Now I want to review additional business highlights for Q1. I will begin with our networking business, where our products address the wireless mobile network, data center and enterprise market segments, and where we expect revenue from new products to grow faster than market rates over the coming years as we gain share and displace competitors with designs we have won in the last few years. 
We continue to make progress to increase our content in base stations through a combination of our Axxia multi-core communications processor and our custom silicon capability. Specifically, our solutions address an estimated $2 billion in wireless SAN opportunity in 2015 that encompasses data plane, control plane switch, base band and digital front-end functions. LSI has already secured wins, which we expect will enable greater than 50% share of data plane, control plane functions and 40% share of base band functions. 
LSI solutions are strongly differentiated with superior performance and low power consumption. The Axxia architecture integrates purpose-built acceleration engines for functions such as traffic management, packet classification and security, which off-load these functions from the main CPU, thereby boosting performance. In fact, one key customer demonstrated that Axxia has twice the performance per watt of a competing multi-core processor in wireless transport processing. Moving forward, we are excited with our partnership with ARM that will bring the benefit of multi-core ARM to our industry-leading Axxia architecture. 
We are now turning Axxia loose in the enterprise market segment, where we are focused on an enterprise, data center TAM we expect to be over $2 billion in 2015 for processor, switch and PHY functions. Earlier this week, we announced the expansion of our Axxia communication processor portfolio to target enterprise applications. Today's enterprise and cloud data centers are dealing with both massive data growth and the impact of virtualization, creating bottlenecks and switching. The Axxia communication processor delivers intelligent acceleration to help data center architects cope with traffic growth. As a proof point, Axxia has been chosen for a leading data center switch platform. 
Also in enterprise, we have won custom solutions for layer 2 and layer 3 switching and routing at a leading data networking customer with revenue ramps beginning before the end of this year. We are fully ramped on an integrated custom Gigabit Ethernet PHY for client applications at Intel. We expect that this device will also be integrated into the upcoming Ultrabook launch. We have also begun ramping a custom Gigabit Ethernet Mac/PHY solution for Romley server platforms. 
I'll now turn to server and storage which includes 5 businesses: our flash businesses, SAS, ServeRAID adapter and software, SAN and HDD. 
In flash, we are unique in offering 3 product families: standard product flash storage processor or FSPs, custom FSPs and PCIe flash adapters with caching and tiering software, strongly positioning LSI to benefit from a multi-year growth cycle in flash-based storage solutions. 
In FSPs, our Q1 revenues were above expectations, and we continue to build momentum with key leaders in the industry and believe we are positioned to be the share leader in 2012. LSI delivers better performance, and we also enable customers by providing, not only flash storage processor silicon, but also firmware, manufacturing and test tools and SSD OEM designs. In addition, we continue to support in production all 6 major flash vendors and are well positioned to support the latest generation of flash at the earliest time to market for our customers. 
This unique model of providing key ingredients to produce SSDs continues to drive our momentum in both client and enterprise applications. In client, we have a displaced the competition by securing wins with Intel for their 520 and 330 series SSD, and we have also won 15 additional SSD models that were announced in the quarter at other suppliers. We are also well positioned for the ramp of Ultrabooks, both in systems, where the SSD is used as SAS main storage; and in dual-drive systems, where smaller capacity flash is used as a cache in conjunction with high-capacity HDDs. 
Our enterprise momentum is also increasing as we released production firmware for our second-generation FSP in the first quarter. We expect volume production in enterprises system OEMs this quarter and new platforms to launch throughout the rest of the year. 
In PCIe flash adapters, we are expanding and increasing focus in storage and server application acceleration, bringing the performance advantages of flash to  enterprise storage, server and networking applications. We recently introduced our Nytro product line, which encompasses Nytro WarpDrive, Nytro XD and Nytro MegaRAID. This is a family of solutions that combines PCIe flash technology with intelligent caching and management software to achieve accelerated application performance. We also expanded our offerings to include MLC-based solutions, as well as a wider range of capacity points. Nytro solutions will have data centers and enterprises to contend with massive data growth and speed the ability of databases and other applications to access data and provide real-time analytics and reporting. 
Building on the established LSI SAS and MegaRAID infrastructure, the Nytro portfolio represents a strategic inflection, enabling broader adoption across enterprise and data center workloads. LSI has not only developed solutions to address early adoption of PCIe flash, but we now offer a full range of flash capacity coupled with seamless caching and acceleration software, which is unique in the industry. A prime example of this new approach is Nytro MegaRAID, which combines MegaRAID, high performance flash and intelligent caching software onto a single PCI card, enabling an end user to use the solution where they use MegaRAID today and achieve up to 30x performance improvement. 
Nytro MegaRAID uses the same tools, standard OS drivers and management as MegaRAID, enabling OEMs and end users to deploy it with minimal effort. This is a breakthrough in usability and is the key to expanding flash to ultimately become an every-unit item in servers. The Nytro product line will go into production this quarter utilizing the industry's best-in-class SandForce flash storage processors, another clear differentiating feature. Our leadership position has enabled us to secure a new PCIe flash adapters wins with Oracle and IBM, which are proof points of the benefits of the Nytro architecture and also significant position in the server ecosystem. 
In our SAS and RAID business, LSI solutions will power more than 200 new server models based on the recently introduced Intel Romley platform. Server market leaders, including Dell, IBM, Intel and others, have selected LSI 6-gig SAS and MegaRAID solutions for new data center servers. We have a shipped more than 30 million SAS ICs and close to 5 million SAS storage adapters, establishing LSI as the SAS provider of choice for the world's leading server manufacturers. 
In addition, key customers in China and Taiwan has elected LSI's 6-gig SAS and MegaRAID solutions for their Romley platform rollouts. These include Huwawei, Lenovo, ZTE, Acer, ASUSTeK, Inventec, Quanta and many others. As why the adoption of our 6-gig SAS technology continues, LSI is in a position to support customers at the next critical inflection point, the 12-gig SAS rollout. LSI is at least 6 months ahead of our competition, and we have already been awarded the industry's first 12-gig SAS ROC design wins at 2 top-tier server OEMs. 
In hard disk drives, we are seeing near-term benefits from a snapback following Thailand flood-related issues. We set a new record in Q1 for SoCs shipped to our largest customer, and we expect further growth in Q2 in line with increase in demand. Our HDD team has done an outstanding job on recovery from flood-related issues, which has enabled us to meet elevated demand and allowed our key customers to be successful in the marketplace. 
Beyond the near-term upside, the underlying fundamentals of our HDD business are solid. We expect to grow revenues and the share year-over-year in 2012 with continued ramp of enterprise SSCs, increased demand for high-capacity 3.5-inch drives driven by cloud deployments and shipments of SoC and preamps into all 3 HD OEMs by the end of this year. 
To wrap up, we think it's time to take a new look at LSI. We are seeing the results of our multi-year growth strategy and are well positioned with share gain opportunities and new product cycles to enable us to grow our business in excess of the markets that we serve. 
Now let me hand the call over to Bryon, who will take you through our results and provide guidance."

Moreover, the company grew at the top line by approximately 32% year-over-year, while expanding year-over-year non-GAAP operating margins from 12% to 16.4%. We're pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter, which represents the strongest first quarter non-GAAP operating income percentage we've had in several years and demonstrates significant progress towards our new business model target of 20% to 22%. 
Now turning to a more detailed discussion of our financial results for the quarter, beginning with revenues. Q1 revenues were $622 million, sequentially up 19% from $523 million. Q1 revenues in our networking business were $107 million, flat sequentially and represented 17% of total revenues for the first quarter. Our investment areas grew sequentially but were offset by declines in our legacy products. 
Moving next to our server and storage semiconductor revenues. As a reminder, we will be including revenues from standard and custom flash storage processors, along with our PCIe flash adapter and software products within this category as we discuss the results and provide guidance. In the aggregate, server and storage semiconductor revenues will consist of our ServeRAID adapter and software, flash, SAS, SAN and HDD businesses. 
Revenues for server and storage semiconductors were sequentially up $100 million or 26% to $488 million and represented 78% of total revenues in the first quarter. This upside was primarily driven by a snapback in demand in our HDD business, along with better-than-expected strength in our newly acquired SandForce flash business, and partially offset by typical seasonality in other product areas. Revenues for the IP business were $27 million. 
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's Q1 gross margin, excluding special items, was 52.4%. Gross margins increased sequentially by approximately 290 basis points, primarily due to the recovery from the effects in Q4 relating to the Thailand flood, along with improved absorption of fixed costs with higher revenues. In terms of operating expenses, R&D, together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, totaled $224 million in Q1, primarily driven by the addition of SandForce. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter increased sequentially to 16.4% or $102 million. Interest income and other net of interest expense, excluding special items, was $9 million for Q1, approximately half of which was related to income from transition services associated with the sale of our external systems business last year. 
Now let me turn to the special items, which we recorded in the first quarter, which netted to $42 million. Special items, primarily non-cash, included $31 million of stock-based compensation expense, $30 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $15 million of restructuring costs and other items, $14 million from the purchase accounting effect on inventory relating to the SandForce acquisition, offset by a $43 million tax benefit reported in Q1 relating to the SandForce acquisition and a $6 million investment gain related to the acquisition. 
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. The non-GAAP tax benefit we recorded for Q1 was $6 million compared to the $9 million provision we guided to in March. This favorability of approximately $15 million or $0.025 per diluted share was primarily due to discrete items associated with the exploration of statutes of limitations, along with the change in profitability across our geographic tax jurisdictions. The GAAP tax benefit we recorded for the period was a favorable $49 million, primarily due to the onetime tax benefit associated with the SandForce acquisition we mentioned in March.  
On a GAAP basis, first quarter income from continuing operations was approximately $75 million or $0.13 per diluted share. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $117 million or $0.20 per diluted share. The weighted average share count for the period for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was 591 million shares. This includes the weighted average benefit of purchasing approximately 4.6 million shares during the period under our share repurchase program. 
The majority of the sequential increase in our reported share count used to calculate earnings per share was the result of our stock price increasing and subsequently increasing the dilutive effect of outstanding options and RSUs on reported shares. Relative to our existing share repurchase authorization, we have repurchased a total of 77 million shares and utilized approximately $537 million for our current $750 million buyback program. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. Cash and short-term investments ended the March quarter at approximately $623 million. Within the quarter, we acquired SandForce, primarily for cash, as well as capital purchases of property, plant and equipment, including a new headquarters facility in San Jose. We're excited about the opportunity to consolidate into one facility in the Bay Area, which we expect will drive efficiencies and lower our costs. 
Operating cash flows for the first quarter were $50 million, and we continue to operate with no debt on our balance sheet. Finally, with respect to Q1 results, depreciation and software amortization was $15 million, and capital expenditures were $65 million. 
Next is a discussion of our guidance for Q2 in 2012. Q2 revenues in the range of $630 million to $670 million were sequentially up about 4% at midpoint. We expect our server and storage semiconductor revenues to be sequentially up in Q2, and our networking semiconductor revenues to be roughly flat. Gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be 53%, plus or minus 1%. 
Operating expenses, excluding special items, in a range of $225 million to $235 million, with the increase primarily driven by annual salary merit increases, which take effect in the second quarter. 
At midpoint, our guidance represents further expansion in non-GAAP operating income to approximately 17.5% for Q2, which is above our prior business model target of 17%, and demonstrates further progress towards reaching 20% to 22%. 
Interest income and other and interest expense, excluding special items, is expected to net to income of approximately $3 million. This sequential decline is primarily due to the completion of transition services relating to the sale of our external systems business. 
Special items are expected to net to approximately $50 million to $70 million. Included in these special items is approximately $24 million of expected of stock-based compensation for Q2. 
The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $11 million for Q2. We expect Q2 GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $0.03 to $0.13 and non-GAAP net income in the range of $0.15 to $0.21 per diluted share. The share count is expected to be approximately 600 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $16 million and capital expenditures of approximately $20 million. 
In closing, we delivered solid expansion of revenues, gross margin and operating income in the first quarter as we continue demonstrate significant progress towards our new business model targets. 
Now let me turn the call to Sujal."

And I think people are starting to call the bottom at this point in time. If we look at our networking investment areas, we expect that to grow in Q2, kind of consistent with what some of our peers are also saying. At the same time, we've got some legacy declines. Longer term, we're very excited about our networking strategy and the success that we've had with Axxia, also combined with our custom silicon capability, not only in wireless infrastructure, as we alluded to in our Analyst Day, where we've got some very significant wins that will enable us to have 50% share in the control and data plane and even 40% share in baseband functions with next generation systems, which have just now started beginning in the development phase. And as we also discussed in prepared remarks, we're starting now to take Axxia and expand that into enterprise, in particular, data center switching that can really leverage the architecture's benefits."

Couple of big questions there. Let's take the networking one. First of all, our networking investment areas have been consistently growing at CAGR of about 25-plus percent over the last 5 years, and we've been very much focused on wireless infrastructure and obviously, a number of segments in enterprise through a standard product, as well as a custom silicon sort of strategy. And they go hand-in-hand as well. We are in production with Axxia today at a major wireless infrastructure provider today. So we're already now in the production and will expect that to grow as we bring on more customers, and we announced the second customer out of the major players as well. And that has now just started development. And we expect our networking investment areas, which again comprise wireless networks, as well as enterprise, custom and standard, to continue to outpace our legacy declines. And we still expect, assuming CapEx returns in the wireless space, as I think everyone is expecting, exiting Q2 and into the second half, that in aggregate our networking business should grow this year. Okay? In hard disk drives, lots of moving parts, obviously, both TAM increases, post-merger product road map rationalization and decisions as well, ramps of new products. Very, very difficult to really call how things play out in the second half, but we very much we'll be gaining share for the full year. And we will be very much growing our business very nicely in 2012 over 2011, both on the SoC side, as well as the preamp side."

Yes, I've seen some of the analysis that was done around LSI potentially overshipping or shipping ahead of customers. I've looked at it and it's grossly inaccurate and is missing a number of elements as well. Just a number of facts. First of all, in Q4, let me back up, we have a hub-based supply chain model with our customers, so we have complete visibility into that inventory that we maintain. And our customers have no incentive to order more than they need because they order and they pull from the hub. They build the drive, and they ship it. So we have very good visibility from that standpoint. Just some other facts. We undershipped our customers in Q4 because our customers leveraged what they had from an inventory standpoint, so we probably undershipped to the tune of 4 million units in Q4. As it pertains to Q1, there were a number of factors that drove our performance, and I think one factor that is not well understood is our preamp business. Our preamp business was decimated in Q4 because that's where the Thai floods hit us the hardest. And we saw our preamp business grow almost 100% from Q4 to Q1, which is also part of the growth that we experienced. In addition to that, some of the other factors, we are growing share in enterprise and so we saw a nice growth Q4 to Q1 in the enterprise space.

So we've got, I think, a good coverage of the segments and good performance across a broad base of application environment. Some of the technologies that we have around where management and so forth, such as our DuraClass technology is another example. I think the other key to the success that SandForce has had which has enabled many players in the marketplace has been the fact that we have a very complete, comprehensive firmware base, as well as the ability to provide a level of customization as well, as we do see that required across a lot of the major players as well as they personalize that something that we do extensively and are also building up support to take on more of that. Because we think that is going to be a differentiator in terms of support as well. And then we've been providing reference designs to enable more players into the marketplace. And then I think the other element, which is not well understood by a lot of people, is the custom capability. Because we also are now experiencing some of the large SSD players as they try to cover a very broad base of SSD segments, and that market is going to continue to bifurcate. They have a strategies in certain areas where they want to do full custom to drive different levels of differentiation, and were doing that today because of our great custom capability in a number of areas they are going to use standard products, which are going to be SandForce-based. That comprehensive capability is something that really only LSI has.

I would like to begin by providing some highlights for the first quarter. Our revenue of $ 622 million represented 19% sequential growth and over 30% year-over-year growth, driven by 3 main components: a snapbac",1747,"Thanks, Sujal. Good afternoon, and welcome. I would like to begin by providing some highlights for the first quarter. Our revenue of $ 622 million represented 19% sequential growth and over 30% year-over-year growth, driven by 3 main components: a snapback in HDD business, better-than-expected strength in our newly acquired SandForce flash business, and growth in networking investment areas. We are demonstrating strong operating margin expansion and attained over 16% non-GAAP operating margins in Q1, showing progress towards our new business model target of 20% to 22%. 
We also continue to increase momentum with leaders in the industry, with SandForce flash storage processor wins at Intel and SanDisk, PCIe flash adapter and software wins at Oracle and IBM, and Axxia multi-core processor wins at 2 top base station OEMs and 12-gig fast wins at 2 top server OEMs. 
At our Analyst Day event last month, we talked about our company being a new LSI, with all ingredients now in place to drive the expanding shareholder value. This is an exciting time for our industry, and we have centered LSI within the key secular trends of data and traffic growth. We're effectively positioned and focused on large and exciting market segments, including data center cloud, mobile networks and flash. 
Our increasingly connected world is generating data and traffic faster than the current IT investments can keep up, which we believe will generate increased demand for our solutions. These data and traffic generators include social platforms, the growth of the mobile Internet with the rise of smartphones and tablets, rapid proliferation of video, collection and real-time analysis of massive amounts of data and growth of cloud services. 
LSI is well positioned to respond to these trends with a broad portfolio of storage and networking solutions that uniquely leverage intelligence to help accelerate access to data, improve application performance and enable highly efficient network utilization. As we move through 2012, we're excited by new product cycles, accumulated share gains and new opportunities that we have ahead of us across our businesses. 
Now I want to review additional business highlights for Q1. I will begin with our networking business, where our products address the wireless mobile network, data center and enterprise market segments, and where we expect revenue from new products to grow faster than market rates over the coming years as we gain share and displace competitors with designs we have won in the last few years. 
We continue to make progress to increase our content in base stations through a combination of our Axxia multi-core communications processor and our custom silicon capability. Specifically, our solutions address an estimated $2 billion in wireless SAN opportunity in 2015 that encompasses data plane, control plane switch, base band and digital front-end functions. LSI has already secured wins, which we expect will enable greater than 50% share of data plane, control plane functions and 40% share of base band functions. 
LSI solutions are strongly differentiated with superior performance and low power consumption. The Axxia architecture integrates purpose-built acceleration engines for functions such as traffic management, packet classification and security, which off-load these functions from the main CPU, thereby boosting performance. In fact, one key customer demonstrated that Axxia has twice the performance per watt of a competing multi-core processor in wireless transport processing. Moving forward, we are excited with our partnership with ARM that will bring the benefit of multi-core ARM to our industry-leading Axxia architecture. 
We are now turning Axxia loose in the enterprise market segment, where we are focused on an enterprise, data center TAM we expect to be over $2 billion in 2015 for processor, switch and PHY functions. Earlier this week, we announced the expansion of our Axxia communication processor portfolio to target enterprise applications. Today's enterprise and cloud data centers are dealing with both massive data growth and the impact of virtualization, creating bottlenecks and switching. The Axxia communication processor delivers intelligent acceleration to help data center architects cope with traffic growth. As a proof point, Axxia has been chosen for a leading data center switch platform. 
Also in enterprise, we have won custom solutions for layer 2 and layer 3 switching and routing at a leading data networking customer with revenue ramps beginning before the end of this year. We are fully ramped on an integrated custom Gigabit Ethernet PHY for client applications at Intel. We expect that this device will also be integrated into the upcoming Ultrabook launch. We have also begun ramping a custom Gigabit Ethernet Mac/PHY solution for Romley server platforms. 
I'll now turn to server and storage which includes 5 businesses: our flash businesses, SAS, ServeRAID adapter and software, SAN and HDD. 
In flash, we are unique in offering 3 product families: standard product flash storage processor or FSPs, custom FSPs and PCIe flash adapters with caching and tiering software, strongly positioning LSI to benefit from a multi-year growth cycle in flash-based storage solutions. 
In FSPs, our Q1 revenues were above expectations, and we continue to build momentum with key leaders in the industry and believe we are positioned to be the share leader in 2012. LSI delivers better performance, and we also enable customers by providing, not only flash storage processor silicon, but also firmware, manufacturing and test tools and SSD OEM designs. In addition, we continue to support in production all 6 major flash vendors and are well positioned to support the latest generation of flash at the earliest time to market for our customers. 
This unique model of providing key ingredients to produce SSDs continues to drive our momentum in both client and enterprise applications. In client, we have a displaced the competition by securing wins with Intel for their 520 and 330 series SSD, and we have also won 15 additional SSD models that were announced in the quarter at other suppliers. We are also well positioned for the ramp of Ultrabooks, both in systems, where the SSD is used as SAS main storage; and in dual-drive systems, where smaller capacity flash is used as a cache in conjunction with high-capacity HDDs. 
Our enterprise momentum is also increasing as we released production firmware for our second-generation FSP in the first quarter. We expect volume production in enterprises system OEMs this quarter and new platforms to launch throughout the rest of the year. 
In PCIe flash adapters, we are expanding and increasing focus in storage and server application acceleration, bringing the performance advantages of flash to  enterprise storage, server and networking applications. We recently introduced our Nytro product line, which encompasses Nytro WarpDrive, Nytro XD and Nytro MegaRAID. This is a family of solutions that combines PCIe flash technology with intelligent caching and management software to achieve accelerated application performance. We also expanded our offerings to include MLC-based solutions, as well as a wider range of capacity points. Nytro solutions will have data centers and enterprises to contend with massive data growth and speed the ability of databases and other applications to access data and provide real-time analytics and reporting. 
Building on the established LSI SAS and MegaRAID infrastructure, the Nytro portfolio represents a strategic inflection, enabling broader adoption across enterprise and data center workloads. LSI has not only developed solutions to address early adoption of PCIe flash, but we now offer a full range of flash capacity coupled with seamless caching and acceleration software, which is unique in the industry. A prime example of this new approach is Nytro MegaRAID, which combines MegaRAID, high performance flash and intelligent caching software onto a single PCI card, enabling an end user to use the solution where they use MegaRAID today and achieve up to 30x performance improvement. 
Nytro MegaRAID uses the same tools, standard OS drivers and management as MegaRAID, enabling OEMs and end users to deploy it with minimal effort. This is a breakthrough in usability and is the key to expanding flash to ultimately become an every-unit item in servers. The Nytro product line will go into production this quarter utilizing the industry's best-in-class SandForce flash storage processors, another clear differentiating feature. Our leadership position has enabled us to secure a new PCIe flash adapters wins with Oracle and IBM, which are proof points of the benefits of the Nytro architecture and also significant position in the server ecosystem. 
In our SAS and RAID business, LSI solutions will power more than 200 new server models based on the recently introduced Intel Romley platform. Server market leaders, including Dell, IBM, Intel and others, have selected LSI 6-gig SAS and MegaRAID solutions for new data center servers. We have a shipped more than 30 million SAS ICs and close to 5 million SAS storage adapters, establishing LSI as the SAS provider of choice for the world's leading server manufacturers. 
In addition, key customers in China and Taiwan has elected LSI's 6-gig SAS and MegaRAID solutions for their Romley platform rollouts. These include Huwawei, Lenovo, ZTE, Acer, ASUSTeK, Inventec, Quanta and many others. As why the adoption of our 6-gig SAS technology continues, LSI is in a position to support customers at the next critical inflection point, the 12-gig SAS rollout. LSI is at least 6 months ahead of our competition, and we have already been awarded the industry's first 12-gig SAS ROC design wins at 2 top-tier server OEMs. 
In hard disk drives, we are seeing near-term benefits from a snapback following Thailand flood-related issues. We set a new record in Q1 for SoCs shipped to our largest customer, and we expect further growth in Q2 in line with increase in demand. Our HDD team has done an outstanding job on recovery from flood-related issues, which has enabled us to meet elevated demand and allowed our key customers to be successful in the marketplace. 
Beyond the near-term upside, the underlying fundamentals of our HDD business are solid. We expect to grow revenues and the share year-over-year in 2012 with continued ramp of enterprise SSCs, increased demand for high-capacity 3.5-inch drives driven by cloud deployments and shipments of SoC and preamps into all 3 HD OEMs by the end of this year. 
To wrap up, we think it's time to take a new look at LSI. We are seeing the results of our multi-year growth strategy and are well positioned with share gain opportunities and new product cycles to enable us to grow our business in excess of the markets that we serve. 
Now let me hand the call over to Bryon, who will take you through our results and provide guidance."

LSI delivered a solid first quarter, meeting or exceeding the update we provided in March at our Analyst Day. A few of the highlights are as follows: Revenues increased sequentially by 19% to 200 -- to $622 mi",1230,"Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. LSI delivered a solid first quarter, meeting or exceeding the update we provided in March at our Analyst Day. 
A few of the highlights are as follows: Revenues increased sequentially by 19% to 200 -- to $622 million. Non-GAAP gross margins expanded to 52.4%. We continue to carefully manage expenses with non-GAAP operating expenses of $224 million, and we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.20. Moreover, the company grew at the top line by approximately 32% year-over-year, while expanding year-over-year non-GAAP operating margins from 12% to 16.4%. We're pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter, which represents the strongest first quarter non-GAAP operating income percentage we've had in several years and demonstrates significant progress towards our new business model target of 20% to 22%. 
Now turning to a more detailed discussion of our financial results for the quarter, beginning with revenues. Q1 revenues were $622 million, sequentially up 19% from $523 million. Q1 revenues in our networking business were $107 million, flat sequentially and represented 17% of total revenues for the first quarter. Our investment areas grew sequentially but were offset by declines in our legacy products. 
Moving next to our server and storage semiconductor revenues. As a reminder, we will be including revenues from standard and custom flash storage processors, along with our PCIe flash adapter and software products within this category as we discuss the results and provide guidance. In the aggregate, server and storage semiconductor revenues will consist of our ServeRAID adapter and software, flash, SAS, SAN and HDD businesses. 
Revenues for server and storage semiconductors were sequentially up $100 million or 26% to $488 million and represented 78% of total revenues in the first quarter. This upside was primarily driven by a snapback in demand in our HDD business, along with better-than-expected strength in our newly acquired SandForce flash business, and partially offset by typical seasonality in other product areas. Revenues for the IP business were $27 million. 
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's Q1 gross margin, excluding special items, was 52.4%. Gross margins increased sequentially by approximately 290 basis points, primarily due to the recovery from the effects in Q4 relating to the Thailand flood, along with improved absorption of fixed costs with higher revenues. In terms of operating expenses, R&D, together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, totaled $224 million in Q1, primarily driven by the addition of SandForce. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter increased sequentially to 16.4% or $102 million. Interest income and other net of interest expense, excluding special items, was $9 million for Q1, approximately half of which was related to income from transition services associated with the sale of our external systems business last year. 
Now let me turn to the special items, which we recorded in the first quarter, which netted to $42 million. Special items, primarily non-cash, included $31 million of stock-based compensation expense, $30 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $15 million of restructuring costs and other items, $14 million from the purchase accounting effect on inventory relating to the SandForce acquisition, offset by a $43 million tax benefit reported in Q1 relating to the SandForce acquisition and a $6 million investment gain related to the acquisition. 
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. The non-GAAP tax benefit we recorded for Q1 was $6 million compared to the $9 million provision we guided to in March. This favorability of approximately $15 million or $0.025 per diluted share was primarily due to discrete items associated with the exploration of statutes of limitations, along with the change in profitability across our geographic tax jurisdictions. The GAAP tax benefit we recorded for the period was a favorable $49 million, primarily due to the onetime tax benefit associated with the SandForce acquisition we mentioned in March.  
On a GAAP basis, first quarter income from continuing operations was approximately $75 million or $0.13 per diluted share. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $117 million or $0.20 per diluted share. The weighted average share count for the period for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was 591 million shares. This includes the weighted average benefit of purchasing approximately 4.6 million shares during the period under our share repurchase program. 
The majority of the sequential increase in our reported share count used to calculate earnings per share was the result of our stock price increasing and subsequently increasing the dilutive effect of outstanding options and RSUs on reported shares. Relative to our existing share repurchase authorization, we have repurchased a total of 77 million shares and utilized approximately $537 million for our current $750 million buyback program. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. Cash and short-term investments ended the March quarter at approximately $623 million. Within the quarter, we acquired SandForce, primarily for cash, as well as capital purchases of property, plant and equipment, including a new headquarters facility in San Jose. We're excited about the opportunity to consolidate into one facility in the Bay Area, which we expect will drive efficiencies and lower our costs. 
Operating cash flows for the first quarter were $50 million, and we continue to operate with no debt on our balance sheet. Finally, with respect to Q1 results, depreciation and software amortization was $15 million, and capital expenditures were $65 million. 
Next is a discussion of our guidance for Q2 in 2012. Q2 revenues in the range of $630 million to $670 million were sequentially up about 4% at midpoint. We expect our server and storage semiconductor revenues to be sequentially up in Q2, and our networking semiconductor revenues to be roughly flat. Gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be 53%, plus or minus 1%. 
Operating expenses, excluding special items, in a range of $225 million to $235 million, with the increase primarily driven by annual salary merit increases, which take effect in the second quarter. 
At midpoint, our guidance represents further expansion in non-GAAP operating income to approximately 17.5% for Q2, which is above our prior business model target of 17%, and demonstrates further progress towards reaching 20% to 22%. 
Interest income and other and interest expense, excluding special items, is expected to net to income of approximately $3 million. This sequential decline is primarily due to the completion of transition services relating to the sale of our external systems business. 
Special items are expected to net to approximately $50 million to $70 million. Included in these special items is approximately $24 million of expected of stock-based compensation for Q2. 
The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $11 million for Q2. We expect Q2 GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $0.03 to $0.13 and non-GAAP net income in the range of $0.15 to $0.21 per diluted share. The share count is expected to be approximately 600 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $16 million and capital expenditures of approximately $20 million. 
In closing, we delivered solid expansion of revenues, gross margin and operating income in the first quarter as we continue demonstrate significant progress towards our new business model targets.

I think the combination of LSI and SandForce has also driven a lot of synergies as all of the sudden now, this great technology is supported by the wherewithal of LSI."

I've looked at it and it's grossly inaccurate and is missing a number of elements as well. Just a number of facts. First of all, in Q4, let me back up, we have a hub-based supply chain model with our customers, so we have complete visibility into that inventory that we maintain. And our customers have no incentive to order more than they need because they order and they pull from the hub. They build the drive, and they ship it. So we have very good visibility from that standpoint. Just some other facts. We undershipped our customers in Q4 because our customers leveraged what they had from an inventory standpoint, so we probably undershipped to the tune of 4 million units in Q4. As it pertains to Q1, there were a number of factors that drove our performance, and I think one factor that is not well understood is our preamp business. Our preamp business was decimated in Q4 because that's where the Thai floods hit us the hardest. And we saw our preamp business grow almost 100% from Q4 to Q1, which is also part of the growth that we experienced.

Some of the technologies that we have around where management and so forth, such as our DuraClass technology is another example.

Because we think that is going to be a differentiator in terms of support as well. And then we've been providing reference designs to enable more players into the marketplace. And then I think the other element, which is not well understood by a lot of people, is the custom capability. Because we also are now experiencing some of the large SSD players as they try to cover a very broad base of SSD segments, and that market is going to continue to bifurcate. They have a strategies in certain areas where they want to do full custom to drive different levels of differentiation, and were doing that today because of our great custom capability in a number of areas they are going to use standard products, which are going to be SandForce-based. That comprehensive capability is something that really only LSI has.

Good afternoon, and welcome. While we are in an environment with broad macro challenges, our strong results for the second quarter are a testament to our sound strategy, the contribution from our new product cycles and exciting and growing market segments and solid execution. 
Our revenue of $660 million was above the midpoint of guidance and represented 32% year-over-year growth and 6% sequential growth, driven by increases in our HDD business and better-than-expected growth in our newly acquired SandForce flash business. We continue to make progress towards our new business model target of 20% to 22% non-GAAP operating margins. 
In Q2, we obtained 18.6% non-GAAP operating margins along with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.21, which is at the high-end of our guidance range. 
Going forward, our guidance for Q3 reflects the cautious outlook due to the macro environment and declines in shipments of SSDs and preamps for hard disk drives. Based on recent industry trends and revenue by our largest customers, we believe that demand eroded faster than industry supply in the month of June. Therefore, we expect to see reductions in demand for our compliments in Q3 as our customers adjust inventory to bring supply back in line with lower demand levels. We expect this to be a single quarter inventory adjustment and expect to see higher HD-related shipments in Q4 provided that the PC market experiences some level of normal seasonality. 
While we expect our third quarter to be impacted by the macro environment and anticipated inventory adjustments in the HDD market segment, as the management team, we are driving improvements as to what we can control. Our efforts have led to significantly better financial results and solid position in growing market to reflected by new product cycles and share gains. Year-over-year versus 2Q '11, revenues have grown over 30%, and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margin has expanded by 210 basis points, operating margins have grown from 12.4% to 18.6% and EPS has doubled from $0.10 a share to $0.21 per share.
As a company, LSI is centered in applications driving strong secular growth in data and traffic. We are rapidly building momentum in the fastest-growing sectors in technology such as full  storage and mega data centers.
At flash towards adoption increases in notebooks and data centers, LSI is in a leading positioned to deliver significant growth. We focused our strategy on hitting the inflection point of flash adoption, and as a result, have achieved key design wins that we believe will enable LSI to be the leader in the emerging, high-growth market segment. We believe we have the broadest and most competitive lineup of flash-based storage solutions. 
While end demand environments remain challenging, we expect to benefit from a number of new product cycles that will be ramping into production in the coming months. In addition to our ramps of our SandForce FSP, Q3 will be the first quarter of initial production ramps for a Nytro PCIe flash adopter product and Axxia multi-core products and we remain on track to be in production with all HDD customer's by the end of this year. 
Now I would like to review additional business highlights for Q2.  I will begin with our server and storage business, which includes a flash-related businesses, SAS, server-rated adapter and software, SAN and HDD. In flash, we are unique in offering 3 product families: Standard product flash storage processor or FSPs, custom FSPs and PCIe flash adapters, strongly positioning LSI to benefit from a multiyear growth cycle in flash-based storage adoptions. We previously indicated our flash businesses would grow 100% to 150% in 2012 from a rough base of $70 million in 2011. Based upon strong customer momentum and new design wins, we are seeing in SandForce FSPs and Nytro PCIe solutions, we now believe that our revenues will exceed 200% growth year-over-year in 2012. 
In Q2, our standard product SandForce FSP revenues were above $45 million, representing 42% sequential growth and continued market share gains. Growth is being driven by increased penetration into the notebook market segment with key wins at Toshiba, Intel, Hynix, Asus and others. According to IDC, flash-enabled notebooks are expected to be the fastest-growing segment of the PC market for years to come, in contrast to the overall HDD-enabled notebooks space. LSI has focused on developing inflection point as ultrabooks and other flash-enabled notebooks take a growing foothold in the marketplace.
LSI FSPs are the core of many of the most popular solid-state drives, sell for significantly higher prices than equivalent HD SCCs and have enhanced for more value. Our recent wins in the flash-enabled notebooks give us confidence that LSI will be the leader in this high-growth market segment in 2012. 
In FSPs, for enterprise FSPs, our momentum and share are also increasing. We are now shipping to 6 enterprise SSD OEMs, enabling us to gain significant share year-over-year in this space. Relative to the competition, we believe our FSP solutions deliver better performance, and we provide not only flash storage processor silicon, but also firmware, manufacturing and test tools and turnkey SSD reference designs, improving our customers time to market. In addition, we continue to support introduction all 6 major flash vendors, and are well-positioned to support the latest generation of flash. In PCIe flash adapters, we are bringing the performance advantages of flash to enterprise server, storage and networking applications. We are focused on transparent, acceleration of applications and we encourage you to visit our website, the smarter way to faster.com for additional information. 
Last quarter, we introduced the Nytro product family, our second generation of PCIe flash adapters that incorporate our SandForce FSPs and offer a high performance with low latency, accelerating a broad spectrum of enterprise applications. Nytro is now in production and we expect double-digit million revenue contribution from PCIe flash adapters in Q3 driven by ramps in higher performance data warehouse applications.
Last quarter, we announced that we were working with Cisco and EMC to bring the application acceleration benefits of PCIe flash cache and technology to Cisco USC blade servers. We expect initial shipments in Q4.
In our SAS and RAID business, we continue to benefit from the ramp of Intel's Romley platform in addition to continuing to supply existing 6-gig SAS solutions to leading server OEMs. As customers begin migrating servers from  6-gig SAS to 12-gig SAS technology in the second half of '13, LSI is in the position to drive this transition. We are now sampling customers with our production to upgrade SAS rocks and has expanded our design win footprint to include 4 out of the top 5 server OEMs. 
In external storage, has fully adopted our 12-gig SAS controllers and expanders and we expect to begin the initial shipments later this year.
In hard disk drive, we saw a further growth in Q2 as a result of increased SSC and preamp shipments. However, we did see signs of industry softness in June and believe that HDD build exceeded demand in the quarter. Because of uncertainty in the macro environment, expected inventory adjustment and lower PC sales affecting HDD demand, we believe it is prudent to assume a lower shipments sequentially in Q3 and this is factored into our guidance. As I previously mentioned, we believe the inventory adjustments will take place in Q3 and we should return to a more normalized supply-demand environment as we exit the quarter.
Hard disk drives represent a large market segment with only 2 major SSCs and we continue to make progress in winning new platforms and positioning for additional share gains in SSCs.  We have gained traction in next-generation notebook platforms and are well-positioned for 5-millimeter hybrid drives which are expected to be a  volume platform for Ultras. We also expect to be ramping SSCs and preamps Toshiba this quarter and remain 100% on track to be shipping SSCs in production to all ACB customers prior to the end of this year.
I would like to discuss our networking business where our products address the wireless mobile network, data center and enterprise market segments. We are increasing LSI content in base stations through a combination of our Axxia multi-core communications processors and our custom silicon capability. As we previously communicated, Axxia has been selected by 2 top base station OEMs for next-generation systems. We're expecting to begin ramping Axxia in to these base stations during this quarter. Axxia processors use industry-standard cores in a clearly partitioned architecture that provide the flexibility to seamlessly integrate ARM processors into our solutions and develop robust roadmaps for customers. We do not use customize cores that are heavily integrated with accelerators so we expect the capitalize as competitors work to re-architect their solutions.
We're winning Axxia designs and enterprise applications as well. Last quarter, we mentioned that Axxia has been chosen for leading data center switch platform. These design wins translates to a robust pipeline for next year and beyond. Also in enterprise, we have won both high-volume and high-end switch platforms with custom products at the leading data networking customer with revenue ramps in 2013. We have also expanded our design win footprint in the Gigabit Ethernet space by securing a custom 5 win in a switch application as this same customer.  To wrap up, I'm pleased with execution that we're delivering as a company, and as progress shows in our financial performance. LSI is well-positioned with share gain opportunities and new product cycles to enable us to outgrow the storage and networking markets we serve. We're growing revenues in new, high-growth market segments, expanding margins and aggressively driving to higher levels of profitability in our new business model targets.

30956,212758769,330833,"LSI Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2012",2012-07-25,"Earnings Calls","LSI Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, LSI delivered a strong quarter of financial performance and met or exceeded the guidance we provided in April. A few highlights for the quarter are as follows: Revenues were $660 million, increasing 6% se",987,"Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, LSI delivered a strong quarter of financial performance and met or exceeded the guidance we provided in April. A few highlights for the quarter are as follows: Revenues were $660 million, increasing 6% sequentially, and up 32% year-over-year. 
Non-GAAP gross margin expanded to 54%. We continue to carefully manage expenses with non-GAAP operating expenses of $233 million for the period. Non-GAAP operating income expanded 220 basis points to 18.6%. We delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.21, and operating cash flows were $117 million. 
Now turning to a more detailed discussion of our financial results for the quarter beginning with the revenues. Our Q2 revenues of $660 million were sequentially up 6% from $622 million, and $10 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Q2 revenues in our networking business were $99 million and represented 15% of total revenues for the second quarter. The networking business was sequentially down, approximately 8%, primarily due to declines in our legacy products along continued softness in wireless infrastructure spend. 
Moving next to our server and storage semiconductor revenues. As a reminder, server and storage semiconductor revenues consist of our ServeRAID adapter and software, flash, SAS, San and HDD businesses. Revenues for server and storage semiconductors were sequentially up $46 million or 9% to $535 million, and represented 81% of total revenues in the second quarter. This upside was primarily driven by continued strength in HDD, along with increased demand for our flash products.  Revenues for the IP business were $26 million. 
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's Q2 gross margin, excluding special items, was 54.0%. Gross margins increased sequentially by approximately 160 basis points, primarily due to continued focus on cost reduction along with product mix. 
In terms of operating expenses, R&D, together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, totaled $233 million in Q2. This was sequentially up from Q1 primarily due to compensation in benefit cost reflecting annual merit increases which go into effect at the start of Q2. 
Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter increased to $123 million or 18.6% of revenue. This represented a sequential improvement of 220 basis points and a significant increase from 12.4% a year ago.
Interest income and other net of interest expense excluding special items was $10 million for Q2, approximately half of which represented payments received for insurance claims covering a portion of our losses that resulted from the Thailand flooding of late last year. 
Now let me turn to the special items which we recorded in the second quarter which netted to approximately $62 million. Special items, primarily noncash, included $30 million in amortization of acquisition related items, $26 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $6 million of restructuring cost and other items. 
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly quarter to quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. The tax provision we recorded for Q2 for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was $12 million. On a GAAP basis, second quarter net income was approximately $59 million or $0.10 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $121 million or $0.21 per diluted share. The weighted average share count for the period for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was 581 million shares. This includes the weighted average benefit of purchasing approximately 18 million shares during the period under our share repurchase program. We have now repurchased a total of 95 million shares and utilized approximately $675 million of our current $750 million buyback program. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. Cash and short-term investments ended the second quarter at approximately $601 million. Operating cash flows for the second quarter were $117 million, and we continue to operate with no debt on our balance sheet. 
Finally, with respect to Q2 results, depreciation and software amortization was $15 million and capital expenditures were $13 million. 
Next is a discussion of our guidance for Q3 2012. Q3 revenues in the range of $620 million to $660 million were sequentially down about 3% at midpoint. This would represent, however, about 17% growth on a year-over-year basis. We expect our server and storage semiconductor revenues to be sequentially down in Q3. We expect HDD declines in the quarter due to inventory adjustments to be partially offset by growth in flash and server-related products. In addition, we expect our networking semiconductor revenues to be slightly up. 
Gross margin excluding special items is expected to be 53%, plus or minus 1%. Operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected be in the range of $228 million to $238 million, we're essentially flat to Q2 at midpoint.
Interest income and other and interest expense, excluding special items, is expected to net to income of approximately $3 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately $50 million to $70 million. The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $12 million for Q3, and we expect Q3 GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $0.02 to $0.11, and non-GAAP net income in the range of $0.14 to $0.20 per diluted share. 
The share count is expected to be approximately 570 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. 
In addition, we expect depreciation of software amortization of approximately $15 million and capital expenditures of approximately $25 million.
In closing, we delivered strong sequential expansion of revenues, gross margin and operating income in the second quarter as we continue to demonstrate significant progress towards our new business model targets. Despite the recent HDD correction, along with the challenging macroeconomic environment impacting our sequential guidance, the midpoint for Q3 reflects 17% growth on a year-over-year basis. We're well-positioned as a leader in our server markets and expect to benefit from new product cycles in the quarters ahead. And now let me turn the call back over to Sujal."

What's driving that growth is just the number of design wins that we've had, as well as the design wins that we've had a much larger players as this market becomes a bigger. And we noted the number of those in the prepared remarks. We talked about Intel, Toshiba and so forth. And these are the companies now that are starting to really be the big players of SSDs. We also are benefiting from a unique strategy depicting read only once we have today, which is a great line of standard SandForce processors that has a fantastic for Mary Stack and a number of  a fantastic firmware stack and then a number of other value elements. But also a full custom capability, and this combination has allowed us to do really well across even the non-flash companies that have some captive capabilities as well. We've been to able to augment what they're doing and as a result, our shares even higher, given the custom capability. Enterprises  is a great example where we have 6 different enterprise SSDs that they're shipping now a number of those are custom in nature. So that's a bit what's been driving our growth and the market certainly continues to do very well in terms of the flash. And the pricing dynamics, as the market continues to grow, will certainly see ASPs move in the direction, all technology does as the market grows, but the ASPs are very, very healthy growth ASPs and significantly higher than HTD SScs as well a large part because of the volume dynamics being very different but also a very rich firmware stack that we saw with our flash processors."

We are seeing some modest growth, we're expecting growth in our networking business in the third quarter. We are expecting our networking investment areas to grow for the full year as well, albeit not at the levels anticipated in here but very healthy growth nonetheless for our investment areas.

Relative to your first question, I'm quite sure I had a trained that question. But I think the simple way to think about it is, in sort of the middle of June, as demand started dropping, and as we all know, PCs in particular, in the consumer retail space and so forth started softening that it in itself started driving demand signals that, to us, late in the quarter. And you just can't correct that supply-chain fast enough between our customers and LSI as well to attract to exactly what's happening to demand. So demand dropped faster than supply chains were able to correct themselves. As a result, you have a pocket of inventory that has to get adjusted in Q3.

While we are in an environment with broad macro challenges, our strong results for the second quarter are a testament to our sound strategy, the contribution from our new product cycles in exciting and growing m",1653,"Thanks, Sujal. Good afternoon, and welcome. While we are in an environment with broad macro challenges, our strong results for the second quarter are a testament to our sound strategy, the contribution from our new product cycles in exciting and growing market segments and solid execution.
Our revenue of $660 million was above the midpoint of guidance and represented 32% year-over-year growth and 6% sequential growth, driven by increases in our HDD business and better-than-expected growth in our newly acquired SandForce flash business. We continue to make progress towards our new business model target of 20% to 22% non-GAAP operating margins.
 In Q2, we obtained 18.6% non-GAAP operating margins, along with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.21, which is at the high end of our guidance range.
Going forward, our guidance for Q3 reflects a cautious outlook due to the macro environment and declines in shipments of SoCs and preamps for hard disk drives. Based on recent industry trends and revenue revisions by our largest customer, we believe that demand eroded faster than industry supply in the month of June. Therefore, we expect to see reductions in demand for our compliments in Q3, as our customers adjust inventory to bring supply back in line with lower demand levels. We expect this to be a single-quarter inventory adjustment and expect to see higher HD-related shipments in Q4, provided that the PC market experiences some level of normal seasonality. 
While we expect our third quarter to be impacted by the macro environment and anticipated inventory adjustments in the HDD market segment, as the management team, we are driving improvements to what we can control. Our efforts have led to significantly better financial results and solid positioning in growing markets reflected by new product cycles and share gains. Year-over-year versus 2Q '11, revenues have grown over 30%; and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margin has expanded by 210 basis points; operating margins have grown from 12.4% to 18.6%; and EPS has doubled, from $0.10 a share to $0.21 per share.
As a company, LSI is centered in applications driving strong secular growth in data and traffic. We are rapidly building momentum in the fastest-growing sectors in technology, such as full actual in storage and mega data centers.
As flash towards adoption increases in notebooks and data centers, LSI is in a leading position to deliver significant growth. We focus our strategy on hitting the inflection point of flash adoption, and as a result, have achieved key design wins that we believe will enable LSI to be the leader in this emerging, high-growth market segment. We believe we have the broadest and most competitive lineup of flash-based storage solutions.
While end-demand environments remain challenging, we expect to benefit from a number of new product cycles that will be ramping into production in the coming months. In addition to our ramps of our SandForce FSPs, Q3 will be the first quarter of initial production ramps for our Nytro PCIe flash adapter products and Axxia multi-core standard products, and we remain on track to be in production with all HDD customers by the end of this year.
 Now I'd like to review additional business highlights for Q2.  I will begin with our server and storage business, which includes  flash-related businesses, SAS, ServeRAID adapter and software, SAN and HDD.
In flash, we are unique in offering 3 product families: Standard product flash storage processors or FSPs, custom FSPs and PCIe flash adapters, strongly positioning LSI to benefit from a multiyear growth cycle in flash-based storage adoption. We had previously indicated that our flash businesses would grow 100% to 150% in 2012 from a rough base of $70 million in 2011. Based upon strong customer momentum and new design wins we are seeing in SandForce FSPs and Nytro PCIe solutions, we now believe that our revenues will exceed 200% growth year-over-year in 2012.
In Q2, our standard product SandForce FSP revenues were above $45 million, representing 42% sequential growth and continued market share gains. Growth is being driven by increased penetration into the notebook market segment, with key wins at Toshiba, Intel, Hynix, Asus and others. According to IDC, flash-enabled notebooks are expected to be the fastest-growing segment of the PC market for years to come in contrast to the overall HDD-enabled notebooks space. LSI has focused on developing FSPs that hit this inflection point, as ultrabooks and other flash-enabled notebooks take a growing foothold in the marketplace.
LSI FSPs are the core of many of the most popular solid-state drives, sell for significantly higher prices than equivalent HD SSDs and have enhanced for more value. Our recent wins in the flash-enabled notebooks give us confidence that LSI will be the leader in this high-growth market segment in 2012.
In FSPs -- for enterprise FSPs, our momentum and share are also increasing. We are now shipping to 6 enterprise SSD OEMs, enabling us to gain significant share year-over-year in this space. Relative to the competition, we believe our FSP solutions deliver better performance, and that we provide not only flash storage processor silicon, but also firmware, manufacturing and test tools and turnkey SSD reference designs, improving our customers' time-to-market. In addition, we continue to support in production all 6 major flash vendors and are well-positioned to support the latest generation of flash.
In PCIe flash adapters, we are bringing the performance advantages of flash to enterprise server, storage and networking applications. We are focused on transparent acceleration of applications, and we encourage you to visit our website, thesmarterwaytofaster.com for additional information.
Last quarter, we introduced the Nytro product family, our second generation of PCIe flash adapters that incorporate our SandForce FSPs and offer a high performance with low latency, accelerating a broad spectrum of enterprise applications. Nytro is now in production, and we expect double-digit million revenue contribution from PCIe flash adapters in Q3, driven by ramps in high-performance data warehouse applications.
Last quarter, we announced that we were working with Cisco and EMC to bring the application acceleration benefits of PCIe flash cache and technology to Cisco UCS Blade Servers. We expect initial shipments in Q4.
In our SAS and RAID business, we continue to benefit from the ramp of Intel's Romley platform in addition to continuing to supply existing 6-gig SAS solutions to leading server OEMs. As customers begin migrating servers from 6-gig SAS to 12-gig SAS technology in the second half of '13, LSI is in the leading position to drive this transition. We are now sampling customers with our production 12-gig SAS rocks and has expanded our design win footprint to include 4 out of the top 5 server OEMs.
In external storage, Zyrtax [ph] has fully adopted our 12-gig SAS controllers and expanders, and we expect to begin initial shipments later this year.
In hard disk drives, we saw further growth in Q2, as a result of increased SoC and preamp shipments. However, we did see signs of industry softness in June and believe that HDD builds exceeded demand in the quarter. Because of uncertainty in the macro environment, expected inventory adjustments and lower PC sales affecting HDD demand, we believe it is prudent to assume a lower comp on our shipments sequentially in Q3, and this is factored into our guidance. As I previously mentioned, we believe the inventory adjustments will take place in Q3, and we should return to a more normalized supply-demand environment as we exit the quarter.
Hard disk drives represent a large market segment with only 2 major SoC suppliers, and we continue to make progress in winning new platforms and positioning for additional share gains in SoCs. 
We have gained traction in next-generation notebook platforms and are well-positioned for 5-millimeter hybrid drives, which are expected to be a volume platform for ultrabooks. We also expect to be ramping SoCs and preamps Toshiba this quarter and remain 100% on track to be shipping SoCs in production to all ACD customers prior to the end of this year.
I would like to discuss our networking business where our products address the wireless mobile network, data center and enterprise market segments. We are increasing LSI content in base stations through a combination of our Axxia multi-core communications processors and our custom silicon capability. As we previously communicated, Axxia has been selected by 2 top base station OEMs for next-generation systems. We're expecting to begin ramping Axxia into these base stations during this quarter. Axxia processors use industry-standard cores in a clearly partitioned architecture that provide the flexibility to seamlessly integrate ARM processors into our solutions and develop robust roadmaps for customers. We do not use customized cores that are heavily integrated with accelerators, so we expect to capitalize as competitors work to re-architect their solutions.
We are winning Axxia designs and enterprise applications as well. Last quarter, we mentioned that Axxia has been chosen for a leading data center switch platform. These design wins translate to a robust pipeline for next year and beyond. Also in enterprise, we have won both high-volume and high-end switch platforms with custom products at a leading data networking customer with revenue ramps in 2013. We have also expanded our design win footprint in the Gigabit Ethernet space by securing a custom supply win in a switch application at this same customer.
To wrap up, I'm pleased with the execution that we're delivering as a company and as progress shows in our financial performance. LSI is well-positioned with share gain opportunities and new product cycles to enable us to outgrow the storage and networking markets we serve. We're growing revenues in new, high-growth market segments, expanding margins and aggressively driving to higher levels of profitability in our new business model targets. We remain debt-free with strong operating cash flows, with the opportunity to continue to return capital to our shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Byron, who will take you through our results and provide guidance."
30956,212758769,331024,"LSI Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2012",2012-07-25,"Earnings Calls","LSI Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, LSI delivered a strong quarter of financial performance and met or exceeded the guidance we provided in April.A few highlights for the quarter are as follows: Revenues were $660 million, increasing 6% s",985,"Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, LSI delivered a strong quarter of financial performance and met or exceeded the guidance we provided in April.
A few highlights for the quarter are as follows: Revenues were $660 million, increasing 6% sequentially and up 32% year-over-year; Non-GAAP gross margins expanded to 54%; we continue to carefully manage expenses with non-GAAP operating expenses of $233 million for the period; non-GAAP operating income expanded 220 basis points to 18.6%; we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.21; and operating cash flows were $117 million.
Now turning to a more detailed discussion of our financial results for the quarter, beginning with revenues. Our Q2 revenues of $660 million were sequentially up 6% from $622 million, and $10 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Q2 revenues in our networking business were $99 million and represented 15% of total revenues for the second quarter. The networking business was sequentially down approximately 8%, primarily due to declines in our legacy products along with continued softness in wireless infrastructure spend.
Moving next to our server and storage semiconductor revenues. As a reminder, server and storage semiconductor revenues consist of our ServeRAID adapter and software, flash, SAS, San and HDD businesses. Revenues for server and storage semiconductors were sequentially up $46 million, or 9%, to $535 million, and represented 81% of total revenues in the second quarter. This upside was primarily driven by continued strength in HDD, along with increased demand for our flash products.  Revenues for the IP business were $26 million.
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's Q2 gross margin, excluding special items, was 54.0%. Gross margins increased sequentially by approximately 160 basis points, primarily due to continued focus on cost reductions along with the product mix.
In terms of operating expenses, R&D, together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, totaled $233 million in Q2. This was sequentially up from Q1, primarily due to compensation in benefit costs, reflecting annual merit increases which go into effect at the start of Q2.
Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter increased to $123 million or 18.6% of revenue. This represented a sequential improvement of 220 basis points and a significant increase from 12.4% a year ago.
Interest income and other net of interest expense, excluding special items, was $10 million for Q2, approximately 1/2 of which represented payments received for insurance claims covering a portion of our losses that resulted from the Thailand flooding of late last year.
Now let me turn to the special items, which we recorded in the second quarter, which netted to approximately $62 million. Special items, primarily noncash, included $30 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $26 million of stock-based compensation expense and $6 million of restructuring costs and other items.
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. The tax provision we recorded for Q2 for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was $12 million. On a GAAP basis, second quarter net income was approximately $59 million or $0.10 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $121 million or $0.21 per diluted share.
The weighted average share count for the period for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was 581 million shares. This includes the weighted average benefit of purchasing approximately 18 million shares during the period under our share repurchase program. We have now repurchased a total of 95 million shares and utilized approximately $675 million of our current $750 million buyback program.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. Cash and short-term investments ended the second quarter at approximately $601 million. Operating cash flows for the second quarter were $117 million, and we continue to operate with no debt on our balance sheet.
Finally, with respect to Q2 results, depreciation and software amortization was $15 million, and capital expenditures were $13 million.
Next is a discussion of our guidance for Q3 2012. Q3 revenues in the range of $620 million to $660 million were sequentially down about 3% at midpoint. This would represent, however, about 17% growth on a year-over-year basis. We expect our server and storage semiconductor revenues to be sequentially down in Q3. We expect HDD declines in the quarter due to inventory adjustments to be partially offset by growth in flash and server-related products. In addition, we expect our networking semiconductor revenues to be slightly up.
Gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be 53%, plus or minus 1%. Operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the range of $228 million to $238 million, were essentially flat to Q2 at midpoint.
Interest income and other and interest expense, excluding special items, is expected to net to income of approximately $3 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately $50 million to $70 million.
The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $12 million for Q3. And we expect Q3 GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $0.02 to $0.11, and non-GAAP net income in the range of $0.14 to $0.20 per diluted share. The share count is expected to be approximately 570 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. In addition, we expect depreciation in software amortization of approximately $15 million and capital expenditures of approximately $25 million.
In closing, we delivered strong sequential expansion of revenues, gross margin and operating income in the second quarter, as we continue to demonstrate significant progress towards our new business model targets. Despite the recent HDD correction, along with the challenging macroeconomic environment impacting our sequential guidance, the midpoint for Q3 reflects 17% growth on a year-over-year basis. We're well-positioned as the leader in our served markets and expect to benefit from new product cycles in the quarters ahead.
And now, let me turn the call back to Sujal."

And supply lines just can't correct that fast.

On the preamp side, we've gotten into a point of probably nearly 50% share or close to, up from 15% share, 3-plus years ago.

We absolutely are outpacing the market from a unit standpoint. Market is expected to grow about 100% in units this year. We're still forecasting the SSD market, comprised of both enterprise and client to probably in the 35 million units sort of range this year. And we're seeing our share grow considerably this year from probably in the 30% non-captive sort of share level last year to certainly higher levels in terms of non-captive share. Aggregate share will also be a leader. But what's driving that growth is just the number of design wins that we've had, as well as the design wins that we've had with the much larger players as this market becomes bigger. And we noted a number of those in the prepared remarks. We talked about Intel, Toshiba and so forth. And these are the companies now that are starting to really be the big players of SSDs. We also are benefiting from a unique strategy that I think we're the only ones that have today, which is a great line of the standard SandForce processors that has a fantastic firmware stack and a number of other value elements, but also a full-custom capability. And this combination has allowed us to do really well across even the NAND flash companies that have some captive capability as well. We've been able to augment what they're doing. And as a result, our shares even higher, given the custom capability. Enterprise is a great example, where we have 6 different enterprise SSDs that are shipping now. A number of those are custom in nature. So that's a bit what's been driving our growth. And the market's certainly continues to do very well in terms of adoption of flash. And then pricing dynamics, as the market continues to grow, we'll certainly see ASPs move in the direction -- all technology does as the market grows, but the ASPs are very, very healthy ASPs and significantly higher than HDD SoCs as well a large part because of the volume dynamics being very different than HDD, but also a very rich firmware stack that we saw with our flash word processors."

We can definitely confirm that our networking investment areas are absolutely growing this year, but probably not to the level of a 25% CAGR that we've historically experienced. But nonetheless, growing very respectively for the full year."

While we are in an environment with broad macro challenges, our strong results for the second quarter are a testament to our sound strategy, the contribution from our new product cycles in exciting and growing m",1650,"Thanks, Sujal. Good afternoon, and welcome. While we are in an environment with broad macro challenges, our strong results for the second quarter are a testament to our sound strategy, the contribution from our new product cycles in exciting and growing market segments and solid execution.
Our revenue of $660 million was above the midpoint of guidance and represented 32% year-over-year growth and 6% sequential growth, driven by increases in our HDD business and better-than-expected growth in our newly acquired SandForce flash business. We continue to make progress towards our new business model target of 20% to 22% non-GAAP operating margins.
In Q2, we obtained 18.6% non-GAAP operating margins, along with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.21, which is at the high end of our guidance range.
Going forward, our guidance for Q3 reflects a cautious outlook due to the macro environment and declines in shipments of SoCs and preamps for hard disk drives. Based on recent industry trends and revenue revisions by our largest customer, we believe that demand eroded faster than industry supply in the month of June. Therefore, we expect to see reductions in demand for our components in Q3, as our customers adjust inventory to bring supply back in line with lower demand levels. We expect this to be a single-quarter inventory adjustment and expect to see higher HD-related shipments in Q4, provided that the PC market experiences some level of normal seasonality. 
While we expect our third quarter to be impacted by the macro environment and anticipated inventory adjustments in the HDD market segment, as the management team, we are driving improvements to what we can control. Our efforts have led to significantly better financial results and solid positioning in growing markets reflected by new product cycles and share gains. Year-over-year versus 2Q '11, revenues have grown over 30%; and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margin has expanded by 210 basis points; operating margins have grown from 12.4% to 18.6%; and EPS has doubled, from $0.10 a share to $0.21 per share.
As a company, LSI is centered in applications driving strong secular growth in data and traffic. We are rapidly building momentum in the fastest-growing sectors in technology, such as flash oriented storage and mega data centers.
As flash storage adoption increases in notebooks and data centers, LSI is in a leading position to deliver significant growth. We focused our strategy on hitting the inflection point of flash adoption, and as a result, have achieved key design wins that we believe will enable LSI to be the leader in this emerging, high-growth market segment. We believe we have the broadest and most competitive lineup of flash-based storage solutions.
While end-demand environments remain challenging, we expect to benefit from a number of new product cycles that will be ramping into production in the coming months. In addition to our ramps of our SandForce FSPs, Q3 will be the first quarter of initial production ramps for our Nytro PCIe flash adapter products and Axxia multi-core standard products, and we remain on track to be in production with all HDD customers by the end of this year.
Now I'd like to review additional business highlights for Q2.  I will begin with our server and storage business, which includes  flash-related businesses, SAS, ServeRAID adapter and software, SAN and HDD.
In flash, we are unique in offering 3 product families: Standard product flash storage processors or FSPs, custom FSPs and PCIe flash adapters, strongly positioning LSI to benefit from a multiyear growth cycle in flash-based storage adoption. We had previously indicated that our flash businesses would grow 100% to 150% in 2012 from a rough base of $70 million in 2011. Based upon strong customer momentum and new design wins, we are seeing in SandForce, FSPs and Nytro PCIe solutions, we now believe that our revenues will exceed 200% growth year-over-year in 2012.
In Q2, our standard product SandForce FSP revenues were above $45 million, representing 42% sequential growth and continued market share gains. Growth is being driven by increased penetration into the notebook market segment, with key wins at Toshiba, Intel, Hynix, Asus and others. According to IDC, flash-enabled notebooks are expected to be the fastest-growing segment of the PC market for years to come in contrast to the overall HDD-enabled notebooks space. LSI has focused on developing FSPs that hit this inflection point, as ultrabooks and other flash-enabled notebooks take a growing foothold in the marketplace.
LSI FSPs are the core of many of the most popular solid-state drives, sell for significantly higher prices than equivalent HD SSDs and have enhanced for more value. Our recent wins in the flash-enabled notebooks give us confidence that LSI will be the leader in this high-growth market segment in 2012.
In FSPs -- for enterprise SSDs, our momentum and share are also increasing. We are now shipping to 6 enterprise SSD OEMs, enabling us to gain significant share year-over-year in this space. Relative to the competition, we believe our FSP solutions deliver better performance, and that we provide not only flash storage processor silicon, but also firmware, manufacturing and test tools and turnkey SSD reference designs, improving our customers' time-to-market. In addition, we continue to support in production all 6 major flash vendors and are well-positioned to support the latest generation of flash.
In PCIe flash adapters, we are bringing the performance advantages of flash to enterprise server, storage and networking applications. We are focused on transparent acceleration of applications, and we encourage you to visit our website, thesmarterwaytofaster.com for additional information.
Last quarter, we introduced the Nytro product family, our second generation of PCIe flash adapters that incorporate our SandForce FSPs and offer a high performance with low latency, accelerating a broad spectrum of enterprise applications. Nytro is now in production, and we expect double-digit million revenue contribution from PCIe flash adapters in Q3, driven by ramps in high-performance data warehouse applications.
Last quarter, we announced that we were working with Cisco and EMC to bring the application acceleration benefits of PCIe flash cache and technology to Cisco UCS Blade Servers. We expect initial shipments in Q4.
In our SAS and RAID business, we continue to benefit from the ramp of Intel's Romley platform in addition to continuing to supply existing 6-gig SAS solutions to leading server OEMs. As customers begin migrating servers from 6-gig SAS to 12-gig SAS technology in the second half of '13, LSI is in the leading position to drive this transition. We are now sampling customers with our production 12-gig SAS rocks and has expanded our design win footprint to include 4 out of the top 5 server OEMs.
In external storage, Zyrtax [ph] has fully adopted our 12-gig SAS controllers and expanders, and we expect to begin initial shipments later this year.
In hard disk drives, we saw further growth in Q2, as a result of increased SoC and preamp shipments. However, we did see signs of industry softness in June and believe that HDD builds exceeded demand in the quarter. Because of uncertainty in the macro environment, expected inventory adjustments and lower PC sales affecting HDD demand, we believe it is prudent to assume a lower component shipments sequentially in Q3, and this is factored into our guidance. As I previously mentioned, we believe the inventory adjustments will take place in Q3, and we should return to a more normalized supply-demand environment as we exit the quarter.
Hard disk drives represent a large market segment with only 2 major SoC suppliers, and we continue to make progress in winning new platforms and positioning for additional share gains in SoCs. 
We have gained traction in next-generation notebook platforms and are well-positioned for 5-millimeter hybrid drives, which are expected to be a volume platform for ultrabooks. We also expect to be ramping SoCs and preamps Toshiba this quarter and remain 100% on track to be shipping SoCs in production to all ACD customers prior to the end of this year.
I would like to discuss our networking business where our products address the wireless mobile network, data center and enterprise market segments. We are increasing LSI content in base stations through a combination of our Axxia multi-core communications processors and our custom silicon capability. As we previously communicated, Axxia has been selected by 2 top base station OEMs for next-generation systems. We're expecting to begin ramping Axxia into these base stations during this quarter. Axxia processors use industry-standard cores in a clearly partitioned architecture that provide the flexibility to seamlessly integrate ARM processors into our solutions and develop robust roadmaps for customers. We do not use customized cores that are heavily integrated with accelerators, so we expect to capitalize as competitors work to re-architect their solutions.
We are winning Axxia designs and enterprise applications as well. Last quarter, we mentioned that Axxia has been chosen for a leading data center switch platform. These design wins translate to a robust pipeline for next year and beyond. Also in enterprise, we have won both high-volume and high-end switch platforms with custom products at a leading data networking customer with revenue ramps in 2013. We have also expanded our design win footprint in the Gigabit Ethernet space by securing a custom supply win in a switch application at this same customer.
To wrap up, I'm pleased with the execution that we're delivering as a company and as progress shows in our financial performance. LSI is well-positioned with share gain opportunities and new product cycles to enable us to outgrow the storage and networking markets we serve. We're growing revenues in new, high-growth market segments, expanding margins and aggressively driving to higher levels of profitability in our new business model targets. We remain debt-free with strong operating cash flows, with the opportunity to continue to return capital to our shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Bryon, who will take you through our results and provide guidance."
30956,212758769,331084,"LSI Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2012",2012-07-25,"Earnings Calls","LSI Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, LSI delivered a strong quarter of financial performance and met or exceeded the guidance we provided in April.A few highlights for the quarter are as follows: Revenues were $660 million, increasing 6% s",985,"Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, LSI delivered a strong quarter of financial performance and met or exceeded the guidance we provided in April.
A few highlights for the quarter are as follows: Revenues were $660 million, increasing 6% sequentially and up 32% year-over-year; Non-GAAP gross margins expanded to 54%; we continue to carefully manage expenses with non-GAAP operating expenses of $233 million for the period; non-GAAP operating income expanded 220 basis points to 18.6%; we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.21; and operating cash flows were $117 million.
Now turning to a more detailed discussion of our financial results for the quarter, beginning with revenues. Our Q2 revenues of $660 million were sequentially up 6% from $622 million, and $10 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Q2 revenues in our networking business were $99 million and represented 15% of total revenues for the second quarter. The networking business was sequentially down approximately 8%, primarily due to declines in our legacy products along with continued softness in wireless infrastructure spend.
Moving next to our server and storage semiconductor revenues. As a reminder, server and storage semiconductor revenues consist of our ServeRAID adapter and software, flash, SAS, San and HDD businesses. Revenues for server and storage semiconductors were sequentially up $46 million, or 9%, to $535 million, and represented 81% of total revenues in the second quarter. This upside was primarily driven by continued strength in HDD, along with increased demand for our flash products.  Revenues for the IP business were $26 million.
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's Q2 gross margin, excluding special items, was 54.0%. Gross margins increased sequentially by approximately 160 basis points, primarily due to continued focus on cost reductions along with the product mix.
In terms of operating expenses, R&D, together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, totaled $233 million in Q2. This was sequentially up from Q1, primarily due to compensation in benefit costs, reflecting annual merit increases which go into effect at the start of Q2.
Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter increased to $123 million or 18.6% of revenue. This represented a sequential improvement of 220 basis points and a significant increase from 12.4% a year ago.
Interest income and other net of interest expense, excluding special items, was $10 million for Q2, approximately 1/2 of which represented payments received for insurance claims covering a portion of our losses that resulted from the Thailand flooding of late last year.
Now let me turn to the special items, which we recorded in the second quarter, which netted to approximately $62 million. Special items, primarily noncash, included $30 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $26 million of stock-based compensation expense and $6 million of restructuring costs and other items.
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. The tax provision we recorded for Q2 for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was $12 million. On a GAAP basis, second quarter net income was approximately $59 million or $0.10 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $121 million or $0.21 per diluted share.
The weighted average share count for the period for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was 581 million shares. This includes the weighted average benefit of purchasing approximately 18 million shares during the period under our share repurchase program. We have now repurchased a total of 95 million shares and utilized approximately $675 million of our current $750 million buyback program.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. Cash and short-term investments ended the second quarter at approximately $601 million. Operating cash flows for the second quarter were $117 million, and we continue to operate with no debt on our balance sheet.
Finally, with respect to Q2 results, depreciation and software amortization was $15 million, and capital expenditures were $13 million.
Next is a discussion of our guidance for Q3 2012. Q3 revenues in the range of $620 million to $660 million were sequentially down about 3% at midpoint. This would represent, however, about 17% growth on a year-over-year basis. We expect our server and storage semiconductor revenues to be sequentially down in Q3. We expect HDD declines in the quarter due to inventory adjustments to be partially offset by growth in flash and server-related products. In addition, we expect our networking semiconductor revenues to be slightly up.
Gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be 53%, plus or minus 1%. Operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the range of $228 million to $238 million, were essentially flat to Q2 at midpoint.
Interest income and other and interest expense, excluding special items, is expected to net to income of approximately $3 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately $50 million to $70 million.
The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $12 million for Q3. And we expect Q3 GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $0.02 to $0.11, and non-GAAP net income in the range of $0.14 to $0.20 per diluted share. The share count is expected to be approximately 570 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. In addition, we expect depreciation in software amortization of approximately $15 million and capital expenditures of approximately $25 million.
In closing, we delivered strong sequential expansion of revenues, gross margin and operating income in the second quarter, as we continue to demonstrate significant progress towards our new business model targets. Despite the recent HDD correction, along with the challenging macroeconomic environment impacting our sequential guidance, the midpoint for Q3 reflects 17% growth on a year-over-year basis. We're well-positioned as the leader in our served markets and expect to benefit from new product cycles in the quarters ahead.
And now, let me turn the call back to Sujal."

We absolutely are outpacing the market from a unit standpoint. Market is expected to grow about 100% in units this year. We're still forecasting the SSD market, comprised of both enterprise and client to probably be in the 35 million units sort of range this year. And we're seeing our share grow considerably this year from probably in the 30% non-captive sort of share level last year to certainly higher levels in terms of non-captive share. Aggregate share will also be a leader. But what's driving that growth is just the number of design wins that we've had, as well as the design wins that we've had with the much larger players as this market becomes bigger. And we noted a number of those in the prepared remarks. We talked about Intel, Toshiba and so forth. And these are the companies now that are starting to really be the big players of SSDs. We also are benefiting from a unique strategy that I think we're the only ones that have today, which is a great line of the standard SandForce processors that has a fantastic firmware stack and a number of other value elements, but also a full-custom capability. And this combination has allowed us to do really well across even the NAND flash companies that have some captive capability as well. We've been able to augment what they're doing. And as a result, our share is even higher, given the custom capability. Enterprise is a great example, where we have 6 different enterprise SSDs that are shipping now. A number of those are custom in nature. So that's a bit what's been driving our growth. And the market's certainly continues to do very well in terms of adoption of flash. And then pricing dynamics, as the market continues to grow, we'll certainly see ASPs move in the direction -- all technology does as the market grows, but the ASPs are very, very healthy ASPs and significantly higher than HDD SoCs as well a large part because of the volume dynamics being very different than HDD, but also a very rich firmware stack that we saw with our flash word processors."

And relative to the Win 8, your guess is as good as mine. I've heard all kinds of different views and so forth around the potential for Win 8 to really start and catalyze another PC cycle, as well as there's a lot of promise around ultrabooks, as well as a combination Ultrabook platforms as well. So as we said earlier in our remarks, we do anticipate growth in our HDD business in the fourth quarter, assuming some level of modest seasonality, which certainly assumes PCs see some life going into the holiday season. I don't think that necessarily equates to Windows 8 having been a big driver because I think that's going to be a latter part of the year, and really more of a question of what it's going to do to the 2013 PC cycle."

No pricing [indiscernible] as that took place.

And if there are, they're already planned and part of our forecast and so forth, as part of just quarter-to-quarter drops. Relative to your first question, I'm not quite sure how to frame that question. But I think the simple way to think about it is, in sort of the middle of June, as demand started dropping, and as we all know, PCs in particular, in the consumer retail space and so forth, started softening. That, in itself, started driving demand signals that, to us, late in the quarter. Right? And it's just -- you just can't correct that supply chain fast enough between our customers and LSI as well to track to exactly what's happening to demand. Right? So demand dropped faster than supply chains were able to correct themselves. As a result, you have a pocket of inventory that has to get adjusted in Q3.

While there continues to be challenges in the macro environment and softness in certain end markets impacting near-term revenue, I'm pleased with our execution and results for the third quarter and the progress",1501,"Thanks, Sujal. Good afternoon, and welcome. While there continues to be challenges in the macro environment and softness in certain end markets impacting near-term revenue, I'm pleased with our execution and results for the third quarter and the progress we have made over the past year. 
For Q3, revenue was within our guidance range, but below our midpoint driven largely by a weak PC market leading to decline in our HDD business. However, revenues grew 14% year-over-year driven by growth from new products including SandForce FSPs, Nytro PCIe flash adapters and Axxia multi-core communications processors. Even the revenue softness, non-GAAP gross margin and EPS came in at the midpoint of our guidance as we lowered variable expenses to be in line with lower revenue and earnings level. 
For year-over-year basis, non-GAAP operating margin expanded or 15% to nearly 18% illustrating the structural improvements we have made as we work towards our business model target from 20% to 22%.
Going forward, our guidance for Q4 reflects a cautious outlook due to uncertainties in the macro environment and softness end PC demand. While we did see reductions in our HDD business in Q3, we expect further reductions in component shipments in Q4 tied to ongoing softness in the PC end market. We also expect reductions in both our custom and standard product, flash storage processors in Q4. This is driven by several factors including ongoing weakness in the PC market, elevated shipments in Q3 and supported of new product launches, and SSD PC enabled rollouts being roll outs being lower than previous expectations.
As we look beyond the near-term environment, LSI is centered in applications benefiting from strong, secular growth in data and traffic. We continue to benefit from the rapid adoption of flash-based products and the penetration of our products into large web and cloudy data centers.
We believe we have the broadest and most competitive lineup of flash solutions and expect to have a #1 share in flash storage processors this year, emerging as the #2 player in the margin, PCIe flash adapters. We continue to expect our total flash revenues to grow over 200% year-over-year in 2012, well ahead of market growth rates.
Given with the revenue softness in the second half, we expect to grow over 20% year-over-year in 2012 while the semiconductor market in many peers are expected to decline. This year, our design win momentum is tracking ahead of expectations, giving us confidence in our ability to grow more than our served market segments and our semiconductor peer group. As we look ahead, we expect to benefit from new product cycle ramps including PCIe flash adapters and Oracle, Cisco, IBM and a new win at a leading social networking company. We have a broad footprint of FSP designs and are well-positioned as FSPs get increasingly adopted in client, as well as enterprise platforms. We also began shipping FSP to ACD customers this quarter, and we'll benefit as this program reaches full production in 2013. In addition, Axxia revenues are expected to grow as we continue ramping at the leading base station OEM.
In the management team we continue to drive improvements to what we can control. Our efforts have led to improvement in financial results and solid positioning in growing markets, reflected by new product cycles and share gains.
I'd like to review additional business highlights for Q3. We will begin with our server and storage business, which includes flash-related businesses, SAS, ServeRAID adapter and software, San and ACD. In flash, we were unique in offering 3 product families. Standard flash storage processors or FSPs, custom FSPs and PCIe flash adapters, strongly positioning LSI to benefit from a multiyear growth cycle in flash-based storage adoption.  In Q3, we saw further growth in standard product SandForce FSP revenues reflecting our broad footprint with market leaders such as Toshiba, Intel, Hynix, Asus and others. Our power optimize hardware and firmware was specifically engineered to meet the very aggressive power and performance specifications of new Ultrabook platforms. Our solutions are now qualified and shipping to 6 PC OEMs and Ultras and notebooks, and we're excited about the upcoming Intel household platform launch. In Q3, we also saw a growth in custom and standard FSPs targeted to enterprise applications shipments Intel, SanDisk, Smart Modular and Toshiba. 
I'll now move to PCIe adapters where we are bringing the performance advantages of flash to enterprise server storage and networking applications.  Earlier this year, we introduced the Nytro product family, our second generation of PCIe flash adapters to incorporate our SandForce FSPs and enable acceleration across a broad spectrum of enterprise and data center applications. We are pleased to announce that Oracle recalls at the data platforms leveraging and shipping LSI's micro flash acceleration technology. With the Oracle and other key wins, we believe LSI is emerging  as the #2 provider of merchant PCIe flash solutions worldwide behind Fusion I/O. We were recently awarded business at a leading social networking company where Nytro is being used to accelerate webpage access. We also expect to release Nytro solutions in the production for IBM and Cisco. In our SAS and RAID business, we continue to benefit from the ramp of Intel's Romley platform in addition to continued supply existing 6-gig SAS solutions to leading server OEMs. We anticipate that customers will begin to migrate servers from 6-gig SAS to 12-gig SAS in the second half of 2013. Given LSI's early market leadership position and value proposition, we believe that many of those server platforms will leverage LSI solutions.
Beyond the traditional markets for SAS, we are now sampling our high-availability direct attached storage or AJ DAS solutions for Microsoft Windows server 2012. Our solutions deliver the benefits of traditional San and shared storage capabilities in a much lower cost easy-to-use, DAS environment. LSI solutions are expected to be generally available in the first quarter next year, in conjunction with the rollout of Microsoft Windows server 2012, and we'll add to future SAS rate growth enabling us to grow above server market growth rates.
In hard disk drives, we saw declines of over 20% sequentially driven by lower PC sales affecting AC demand and resulting inventory adjustment by key customers. We expect demand to remain soft due to weakness in the PC market segment resulting in lower component shipments in Q4 and this is reflected on our guidance.
We continue to execute well on the factors we can control, which we believe will lead to share gains over the long term. We have now begun shipping 1 terabyte per platter desktop SSE to new customer and expect to benefit as this program ramps into full production. In 2.5-inch notebook drives, we have been selected to provide SoCs into a 500-gig per platter hybrid drive targeted at Ultrabook platforms.  Lastly, we have secured 2 additional wins for 500-gig per platter notebook designs and these SoCs will enable our customers to achieve even higher aerial density points. 
I would now like to discuss our networking business where our products address the wireless mobile network, data center and enterprise market segments.
In the wireless business, we began ramping our standard product Axxia multi-core communications processor at the leading base station OEM during the past quarter. We also secured our second data plane and control plane design win at another leading OEM, displacing an incumbent competitor in a future generation with our Axxia solution.
We now have multi-generational engagements with leading system OEMs in the wireless space that will enable LSI to have access -- in excess of 50% share in control and data plane silicon a few years out. Our previously mentioned custom silicon wins in the base band sections of based stations with multiple system OEMs further adds to LSI's footprint in base station infrastructure.
A year ago, we added an enterprise focus to our Axxia efforts. We reported on a beach headwind in a leading data center switch platform and now have another key win in to add to this. Additionally, in enterprise, we have won both high volume and high-end switch platforms with custom products at a leading data networking customer, with revenue ramps in 2013. We've also expanded our footprint in the Gigabit Ethernet space by sampling a low-power Gigabit Ethernet PHY coveted for Ultrabook platforms. 
Lastly, we're very excited about our efforts with ARM to extend LSI's differentiation with ARM-based Axxia solutions. We are working closely with ARM on interconnect technology that will enable Axxia to be the industry's first, many core ARM SSC targeted to wireless and enterprise networking infrastructure.
To wrap up, I am pleased with the execution that we're delivering as a company, LSI's is well-positioned with share gain opportunities in new product cycles to enable us to outgrow storage and networking markets we serve. We remain debt-free with strong operating cash flows with the opportunity to continue to return capital to our shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Bryon who will take you through our results and provide guidance."

I'll start with a discussion of our financial results for the quarter beginning with revenues. Our Q3 revenues were $624 million, a 14% on a year-over-year basis, and down 5% sequentially. Q3 revenues in our net",898,"Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a discussion of our financial results for the quarter beginning with revenues. Our Q3 revenues were $624 million, a 14% on a year-over-year basis, and down 5% sequentially. Q3 revenues in our networking business were $106 million, down 10% on a year-over-year basis, and up 7% sequentially. Networking revenues represented 17% of total revenues for the third quarter.
Looking next to our server and storage semiconductor business, which consist of our ServeRAID adapter and software, flash, SAS, San and HDD businesses. Revenues for server and storage semiconductors were $493 million, up 22% on a year-over-year basis, and down 8% sequentially. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in demand for our HDD products, partially offset by increased demand for our flash products. Revenues for the server and storage semiconductors represented 79% of total revenues in the third quarter.  Revenues for the IP business were approximately $25 million.
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's Q3 gross margin, excluding special items, was 63.9% [ph].  Gross margins decreased sequentially by approximately 10 basis points. In terms of operating expenses, R&D, together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, totaled $226 million in Q3. This was sequentially down $7 million from Q2, as variable compensation expenses were lowered in the quarter.
Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $111 million or 17.7% of revenue. This represented a sequential decrease of 90 basis points and a 250 basis points increase from a year ago.  Interest income and other net of interest expense, excluding special items, was $3 million for Q3. 
Now let me turn to the special items, which we reported in the third quarter, which netted to approximately $59 million. Special items, primarily noncash, included $30 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $28 million of stock-based compensation expense and $4 million of restructuring costs and other items, offset by a $3 million gain on the sale of investments. 
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis will vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. The tax provision we recorded for Q3 for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was $15 million. On a GAAP basis, third quarter net income was approximately $40 million or $0.07 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $99 million or $0.17 per diluted share.
The weighted average share count for the period for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was 572 million shares. This includes the weighted average benefit of purchasing approximately 7 million shares during the period under our stock repurchase program. On a relative basis, LSI has repurchased a total of 102 million shares and utilized approximately $725 million of the $750 million stock repurchase program the Board authorized last year.  In addition, in August, the Board authorized a new $500 million stock repurchase program. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. Cash and short-term investments ended the third quarter with $643 million, and we continue to operate with no debt on our balance sheet.  Operating cash flows for the third quarter were $112 million. Finally, with respect to Q3 results, depreciation and software amortization was $15 million, and capital expenditures were $26 million.
Next is a discussion of our guidance for Q4 2012. Q4 revenues in the range of $570 million to $610 million were sequentially down about 5% at midpoint. This would represent about 13% growth on a year-over-year basis. We expect our server and storage semiconductor revenues to be down sequentially in Q4. We expect declines in our flash and HDD businesses and a slight growth in our server-related products. We expect declines in our flash and HDD businesses are tied to soft PC market conditions as mentioned by Abhi earlier. We expect our networking semiconductor revenues to be slightly down sequentially in Q4.
Gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be 53%, plus or minus 1%. Operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the range of $223 million to $233 million. Operating expenses for Q3 and Q4 reflect lower variable compensation expenses and tied to lower revenue and profitability level.  Interest income and other and interest expense excluding special items is expected to net to income of approximately $3 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately $55 million to $75 million.
The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $9 million for Q4. We expect Q4 GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of negative $0.02 to positive $0.07, and non-GAAP net income in the range of $0.11 to $0.17 per diluted share.
The share count is expected to be approximately 570 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. In addition, we expect depreciation in software amortization of approximately $15 million and capital expenditures of approximately $27 million.
In closing, we delivered solid results in Q3 in spite of a difficult business environment. We continue to demonstrate solid year-over-year progress across key areas including revenues, which grew 14%; non-GAAP gross margins, which expanded by 170 basis points; non-GAAP operating income which grew by 250 basis points, and non-GAAP EPS which increased by 21%. We continue with our stock buyback program which the Board extended in August 2012, with the announcement of a new $500 million authorization. 
Now let me turn the call back to Sujal."

But if the market TAM is sort of what is expected out there relative to PC consumption and at least what one major HDD customer shared in terms of their view on the Tam, I think we would conclude that the inventory adjustments that remain will get addressed in Q4, not all of it got addressed in Q3. There are some remnants of inventory adjustment that are taking place going into Q4 and that's obviously factored into our guidance. Relative to seasonality, I mean, we haven't had a normal Q4 to Q1 in a number of years, given natural disasters and a number of other factors. But if you go back to when we had stability in our lives, seasonality, typically, for our business, Q1 is down from Q4, given there is a budget flush for enterprise in Q4, and obviously, the holiday season associated with consumer products and PCs, so that's typically what we've seen.  Q1 being down from Q4."

But assuming all of us are projecting that correctly, the inventory situation will be cleared up in Q4, and then hopefully, we'll be on to a number of new industry product cycles that are ahead of us in the first half of next year. Relative to sort of growth rates and our outlook for growth rates, in the ACD space, obviously PC growth rates that re being forecasted for the next 3 to 4 years have to come down given what is this year and some of the challenges around tablet and mobile sort of cannibalization lease is in terms of share of wallet. We still expect the ACD market to grow, the question is whether it's 3%, 4% or 5% CAGR, there are projections that are even higher. Keep in mind that 40% of the HDD sort of products have nothing to do with PCs and are growing in that teens from that standpoint. Relative to your last part of your question, in terms of investment allocations, I mean, clearly, I think it's safe to conclude that we're going to make sure that we're investing for growth in where we have high growth opportunities, flash, in particular, obviously is getting a lot of attention and a lot of investment given 40% to 30% growth rates sort of opportunity. That doesn't mean we're losing focus on HDD, it's a multibillion-dollar market, we're only in the high 30s in terms of share.

We've come, over the course of this year, we've seen the company now at a much more elevated profitability level and we certainly hope to do that as we look into 2013. Very much dependent on what consumption is next year, which is tied to macro economic environment, which is probably anyone's guess at this juncture. We have a number of growth drivers, right, that we're excited about. Flash is obviously significant growth driver for the company. We are a very underrepresented in the PCIe flash after space. There's no reason why we can't significantly outpaced the market, the opportunity is there, the product line is there, and the customer interest in pool is there for us as well. And we're certainly aiming to drive that much higher growth rates. So I think that is a pretty sizable lever. Another lever that we've certainly hope to benefit, even in what maybe weak macro environment next year is the huge design win pipeline that we've been accumulating across all our product lines over the last 3, 4 years, which has had very high conversion rates, which has helped us deliver a CAGR over the last 3 years in the teens. And that will also contribute to the next year's growth. Ultimately, OpEx is a factor as well, and is a controlled point and as we've demonstrated over the last 2, 3 years and very similar situations where environments can be tough, we'll take the right action to balance long-term and short-term, and continue to focus on driving earnings growth while we also drive topline growth as well."

It's great when someone else sometimes does that heavy lifting and then you come in behind as a fast and you benefit from that.

The third one that was just recently announced, which leverages our leadership position in ServeRAID or DAS RAID, so we're combining the benefits of our RAID position along with Flash, to provide accelerated sort of application performance in DAS environments. And then we also have the very high end Nytro product, remember which is called work drive, which is for flash being used as primary storage. And so the breadth of our product line, certainly I think will be an advantage. I think the fact that they're using proven driver technology and firmware that all of the server vendors basically, everyone is used to and has been using for many, many years, harder  technologies another advantage. In a number of the workload, we also have performance advantages as well. And lastly, we do believe for a broad spectrum of workloads and usage models, the fact that we have what we refer to as an offload sort of architecture, which minimizes consumptions of CPU cycles, we think that's also a big benefit as well.

And you did see the notification that our board has authorized a new share repurchase authorization in the amount of $500 million which was done in August. So our expectations are, we're in a strong position to utilize our cash would use of our cash. And depending on market conditions, we may continue to be very active in terms of those share repurchases."

30956,222481270,369461,"LSI Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2012",2012-10-24,"Earnings Calls","LSI Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Sujal. Good afternoon, and welcome. While there continues to be challenges in the macro environment and softness in certain end markets impacting near-term revenue, I'm pleased with our execution and results for the third quarter and the progress",1501,"Thanks, Sujal. Good afternoon, and welcome. While there continues to be challenges in the macro environment and softness in certain end markets impacting near-term revenue, I'm pleased with our execution and results for the third quarter and the progress we have made over the past year. 
For Q3, revenue was within our guidance range, but below our midpoint, driven largely by a weak PC market leading to declines in our HDD business. However, revenues grew 14% year-over-year driven by growth from new products, including SandForce FSPs, Nytro PCIe flash adapters and Axxia multi-core communications processors. Even the revenue softness, non-GAAP gross margin and EPS came in at the midpoint of our guidance as we lowered variable expenses to be in line with lower revenue and earnings levels. 
On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP operating margin expanded from 15% to nearly 18%, illustrating the structural improvements we've made as we work towards our business model target for 20% to 22%.
Going forward, our guidance for Q4 reflects a cautious outlook due to uncertainties in the macro environment and softness in PC demand. While we did see reductions in our HDD business in Q3, we expect further reductions in component shipments in Q4 tied to ongoing softness in the PC end market. We also expect reductions in both our custom and standard product, flash storage processors in Q4. This is driven by several factors including ongoing weakness in the PC market, elevated shipments in Q3 in support of new product launches, and SSD PC enabled rollouts being roll outs being lower than previous expectations.
As we look beyond the near-term environment, LSI is centered in applications benefiting from strong, secular growth in data and traffic. We continue to benefit from the rapid adoption of flash-based products and the penetration of our products into large web and cloud data centers.
We believe we have the broadest and most competitive lineup of flash-based solutions and expect to have a #1 share in flash storage processors this year, emerging as the #2 player in merchant PCIe flash adapters. We continue to expect our total flash revenues to grow over 200% year-over-year in 2012, well ahead of market growth rates.
Even with the revenue softness in the second half, we expect to grow over 20% year-over-year in 2012 while the semiconductor market and many peers are expected to decline. This year, our design win momentum is tracking ahead of expectations, giving us confidence in our ability to grow more than our served market segments and our semiconductor peer group. As we look ahead, we expect to benefit from new product cycle ramps, including PCIe flash adapters at Oracle, Cisco, IBM and a new win at a leading social networking company. We have a broad footprint of FSP designs and are well-positioned as FSPs get increasingly adopted in client, as well as enterprise platforms. We also began shipping FSP to a new ACD customer this quarter, and we'll benefit as this program reaches full production in 2013. In addition, Axxia revenues are expected to grow as we continue ramping at the leading base station OEM.
In the management team, we continue to drive improvements to what we can control. Our efforts have led to improvement in financial results and solid positioning in growing markets, reflected by new product cycles and share gains.
I'd like to review additional business highlights for Q3. We will begin with our server and storage business, which includes flash-related businesses, SAS, ServeRAID adapters and software, SAN and ACD. In flash, we are unique in offering 3 product families. Standard product flash storage processors or FSPs, custom FSPs and PCIe flash adapters, strongly positioning LSI to benefit from a multiyear growth cycle in flash-based storage adoption.  In Q3, we saw further growth in standard product SandForce FSP revenues reflecting our broad footprint with market leaders, such as Toshiba, Intel, Hynix, ASUS and others. Our power-optimized hardware and firmware were specifically engineered to meet the very aggressive power and performance specifications of new Ultrabook platforms. Our solutions are now qualified and shipping to 6 PC OEMs in Ultrabooks and notebooks, and we're excited about the upcoming Intel Haswell platform launch. In Q3, we also saw our growth in custom and standard FSPs targeted to enterprise applications with shipments to Intel, SanDisk, Kingston, SMART Modular and Toshiba. 
I'll now move to PCIe adapters where we are bringing the performance advantages of flash to enterprise server storage and networking applications.  Earlier this year, we introduced the Nytro product family, our second generation of PCIe flash adapters that incorporate our SandForce FSPs and enable acceleration across a broad spectrum of enterprise and data center applications. We are pleased to announce that Oracle Exadata platform is leveraging and shipping LSI's Nytro flash acceleration technology. 
With Oracle and other key wins, we believe LSI is emerging as the #2 provider of merchant PCIe flash solutions worldwide, behind Fusion I/O. We were recently awarded business at a leading social networking company where Nytro is being used to accelerate webpage access. We also expect to release Nytro solutions in the production for IBM and Cisco. In our SAS and RAID business, we continue to benefit from the ramp of Intel's Romley platform in addition to continuing to supply existing 6-gig SAS solutions to leading server OEMs. We anticipate that customers will begin to migrate servers from 6-gig SAS to 12-gig SAS in the second half of 2013. Given LSI's early market leadership position and value proposition, we believe that many of those server platforms will leverage LSI solutions.
Beyond the traditional markets for SAS, we are now sampling our high-availability, direct-attached storage, or HA-DAS solutions for Microsoft Windows Server 2012. Our solutions deliver the benefits Of traditional SAN and shared storage capabilities in a much lower cost, easy-to-use, DAS environment. LSI solutions are expected to be generally available in the first quarter next year, in conjunction with the rollout of Microsoft Windows Server 2012, and will add to future SAS RAID growth enabling us to grow above server market growth rates.
In hard disk drives, we saw declines of over 20% sequentially driven by lower PC sales affecting ACD demand and resulting inventory adjustments by key customers. We expect demand to remain soft due to weakness in the PC market segment resulting in lower component shipments in Q4 and this is reflected on our guidance.
We continue to execute well on the factors we can control, which we believe will lead to share gains over the long term. We have now begun shipping one terabyte per platter desktop SSCs to new customer and expect to benefit as this program ramps into full production. In 2.5-inch notebook drives, we have been selected to provide SSCs into a 500-gig per platter hybrid drive targeted at Haswell-based Ultrabook platforms.  Lastly, we have secured 2 additional wins for 500-gig per platter notebook designs and these SSCs will enable our customers to achieve even higher areal density points. 
I would now like to discuss our networking business where our products address the wireless mobile network, data center and enterprise market segments.
In the wireless space, we began ramping our standard product Axxia multi-core communications processor at the leading base station OEM during the past quarter. We also secured our second data plane and control plane design win at another leading OEM, displacing an incumbent competitor in a future generation with our Axxia solution.
We now have multi-generational engagements with leading system OEMs in the wireless space that will enable LSI to have access of --  in excess of 50% share in control and data plane silicon a few years out. Our previously mentioned custom silicon wins in the base band section of base stations with multiple system OEMs further adds to LSI's footprint in base station infrastructure.
A year ago, we added an enterprise focus to our Axxia effort. We reported on a beachhead win in a leading data center switch platform and now have another key win to add to this. Additionally, in enterprise, we have won both high-volume and high-end switch platforms with custom products at a leading data networking customer, with revenue ramps in 2013. We've also expanded our footprint in the Gigabit Ethernet space by sampling a low-power Gigabit Ethernet PHY targeted for Ultrabook platforms. 
Lastly, we're very excited about our efforts with ARM to extend LSI's differentiation with ARM-based Axxia solutions. We are working closely with ARM on interconnect technology that will enable Axxia to be the industry's first, many-core ARM SSC targeted to wireless and enterprise networking infrastructure.
To wrap up, I am pleased with the execution that we're delivering as a company, LSI's is well-positioned with share gain opportunities and new product cycles to enable us to outgrow the storage and networking markets we serve. We remain debt-free with strong operating cash flows with the opportunity to continue to return capital to our shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Bryon who will take you through our results and provide guidance."

I'll start with a discussion of our financial results for the quarter beginning with revenues. Our Q3 revenues were $624 million, up 14% on a year-over-year basis, and down 5% sequentially. Q3 revenues in our ne",896,"Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a discussion of our financial results for the quarter beginning with revenues. Our Q3 revenues were $624 million, up 14% on a year-over-year basis, and down 5% sequentially. Q3 revenues in our networking business were $106 million, down 10% on a year-over-year basis, and up 7% sequentially. Networking revenues represented 17% of total revenues for the third quarter.
Moving next to our server and storage semiconductor business, which consists of our ServeRAID adapter and software, flash, SAS, SAN and HDD businesses. Revenues for server and storage semiconductors were $493 million, up 22% on a year-over-year basis, and down 8% sequentially. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in demand for our HDD products, partially offset by increased demand for our flash products. Revenues from server and storage semiconductors represented 79% of total revenues in the third quarter.  Revenues for the IP business were approximately $25 million.
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's Q3 gross margin, excluding special items, was 53.9%.  Gross margin decreased sequentially by approximately 10 basis points. In terms of operating expenses, R&D, together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, totaled $226 million in Q3. This was sequentially down $7million from Q2, as variable compensation expenses were lowered in the quarter.
Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $111 million or 17.7% of revenue. This represented a sequential decrease of 90 basis points and a 250 basis point increase from a year ago.  Interest income and other net of interest expense, excluding special items, was $3 million for Q3. 
Now let me turn to the special items, which we recorded in the third quarter, which netted to approximately $59 million. Special items, primarily noncash, included $30 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $28 million of stock-based compensation expense and $4 million of restructuring costs and other items, offset by a $3 million gain on the sale of investments. 
Moving next to tax. The tax provision on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis will vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. The tax provision we recorded for Q3 for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was $15 million. On a GAAP basis, third quarter net income was approximately $40 million or $0.07 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $99 million or $0.17 per diluted share.
Weighted average share count for the period for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was 572 million shares. This includes the weighted average benefit of purchasing approximately 7 million shares during the period under our stock repurchase program. On a cumulative basis, LSI has repurchased a total of 102 million shares and utilized approximately $725 million of the $750 million stock repurchase program the Board authorized last year.  In addition, in August, the Board authorized a new $500 million stock repurchase program. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. Cash and short-term investments ended the third quarter with $643 million, and we continue to operate with no debt on our balance sheet.  Operating cash flows for the third quarter were $112 million. Finally, with respect to Q3 results, depreciation and software amortization was $15 million and capital expenditures were $26 million.
Next is a discussion of our guidance for Q4 2012. Q4 revenues in the range of $570 million to $610 million were sequentially down about 5% at midpoint. This would represent about 13% growth on a year-over-year basis. We expect our server and storage semiconductor revenues to be down sequentially in Q4. We expect declines in our flash and HDD businesses and a slight growth in our server-related products. We expect the declines in our flash and HDD businesses are tied to soft PC market conditions, as mentioned by Abhi earlier. We expect our networking semiconductor revenues to be slightly down sequentially in Q4.
Gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be 53%, plus or minus 1%. Operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the range of $223 million to $233 million. Operating expenses for Q3 and Q4 reflect lower variable compensation expenses and tied to lower revenue and profitability levels.  Interest income and other and interest expense, excluding special items, is expected to net to income of approximately $3 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately $55 million to $75 million.
The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $9 million for Q4. We expect Q4 GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of negative $0.02 to positive $0.07, and non-GAAP net income in the range of $0.11 to $0.17 per diluted share.
Share count is expected to be approximately 570 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. In addition, we expect depreciation in software amortization of approximately $15 million and capital expenditures of approximately $27 million.
In closing, we delivered solid results in Q3 in spite of a difficult business environment. We continue to demonstrate solid year-over-year progress across key areas including revenues, which grew sub 14%; non-GAAP gross margins, which expanded by 170 basis points; non-GAAP operating income which grew by 250 basis points, and non-GAAP EPS which increased by 21%. We continue with our stock buyback program, which the Board extended in August 2012, with the announcement of a new $500 million authorization.

But if the market TAM is sort of what is expected out there, relative to PC consumption and at least what one major HDD customer shared in terms of their view on the TAM, I think we would conclude that the inventory adjustments that remain will get addressed in Q4. Not all of it got addressed in Q3, there are some remnants of inventory adjustment that are taking place going into Q4 and that's obviously factored into our guidance. Relative to seasonality, I mean, we haven't had a normal Q4 to Q1 in a number of years, given natural disasters and a number of other factors. But if you go back to when we had stability in our lives, seasonality, typically, for our business, Q1 is down from Q4, given there is a budget flush for enterprise in Q4, and obviously, there's the holiday season associated with consumer products and PCs, so that's typically what we've seen, is that Q1 being down from Q4."

So revenues in the third quarter were elevated and supported those new product launches and then, as we said, on top of that, there's certainly a weak PC market that  is also affecting SSD based PCs.

And your question is to -- as to Q1, certainly not going to guide into Q1, but a number of these factors that we discussed are sort of onetime.

But if we put aside our networking sort of legacy business and just focus on our investment areas, our investment areas this year will grow.

But assuming all of us are projecting that correctly, the inventory situation will be cleared up in Q4, and then hopefully, we'll be on to a number of new industry product cycles that are ahead of us in the first half of next year. Relative to sort of growth rates and our outlook for growth rates, in the ACD space, obviously PC growth rates that are being forecasted here for the next 3 to 4 years have come down, given what has transpired this year and some of the challenges around tablet and mobile sort of cannibalization lease in terms of share of wallet, we still expect the ACD market to grow. The question is whether it's 3%, 4% or 5% CAGR. There are projections that are even higher. Keep in mind that 40% of the HDD sort of products have nothing to do with PCs and are growing in the teens from that standpoint. Relative to your last part of your question, in terms of investment allocations, I mean, clearly, I think it's safe to conclude that we're going to make sure that we're investing for growth in where we have high growth opportunities. flash, in particular, obviously is getting a lot of attention and a lot of investment, given 40% to 50% growth rates sort of opportunities. That doesn't mean we're losing focus on HDD. It's a multibillion-dollar market. We're only in the high-30s in terms of share, markets have been consolidating, and our customers are going to a dual supplier strategy and we've won a number of designs this quarter, as well as we'll be ramping into a new customer.

There's no reason why we can't significantly outpace the market. The opportunity is there, the product line is there and the customer interest in pool is there for us as well, and we're certainly aiming to drive much higher growth rates. So I think that is a pretty sizable lever. Another lever that we certainly hope to benefit, even in maybe a weak macro environment next year is the huge design win pipeline that we've been accumulating across all our product lines over the last 3, 4 years, which has had very high conversion rates, which has helped us deliver a CAGR over the last 3 years in the teens.

Now one of the reasons LSI does really well in this market and has been winning is, in addition to our flash storage process or silicon, we provide a very robust and fully productized firmware stack that our competitors really don't to the level that we do. We provide tremendous amount of support around manufacturing and test and test programs and so forth. But we have no intent in selling an SSD. Those are our customers, and we'll be shipping flash storage processors to them. And then, keep in mind though, we do that also for enterprise SSDs. We sell flash storage processors there as well. So in enterprise, we're participating 2 ways: PCIe flash adapters, with lots of different software, caching software, to be specific; and then we also sell flash storage processors for companies that are developing and selling enterprise flash SSDs."

30956,222481270,369569,"LSI Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2012",2012-10-24,"Earnings Calls","LSI Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Sujal. Good afternoon, and welcome. While there continues to be challenges in the macro environment and softness in certain end markets impacting near-term revenue, I'm pleased with our execution and results for the third quarter and the progress",1502,"Thanks, Sujal. Good afternoon, and welcome. While there continues to be challenges in the macro environment and softness in certain end markets impacting near-term revenue, I'm pleased with our execution and results for the third quarter and the progress we have made over the past year. 
For Q3, revenue was within our guidance range but below our midpoint, driven largely by a weak PC market leading to declines in our HDD business. However, revenues grew 14% year-over-year driven by growth from new products, including SandForce FSPs, Nytro PCIe flash adapters and Axxia multi-core communications processors. Even the revenue softness, non-GAAP gross margin and EPS came in at the midpoint of our guidance as we lowered variable expenses to be in line with lower revenue and earnings levels. 
On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP operating margin expanded from 15% to nearly 18%, illustrating the structural improvements we've made as we work towards our business model target for 20% to 22%.
Going forward, our guidance for Q4 reflects a cautious outlook due to uncertainties in the macro environment and softness in PC demand. While we did see reductions in our HDD business in Q3, we expect further reductions in component shipments in Q4 tied to ongoing softness in the PC end market. We also expect reductions in both our custom and standard product, flash storage processors in Q4. This is driven by several factors including ongoing weakness in the PC market, elevated shipments in Q3 in support of new product launches, and SSD PC enabled rollouts being rollouts being lower than previous expectations.
As we look beyond the near-term environment, LSI is centered in applications benefiting from strong, secular growth in data and traffic. We continue to benefit from the rapid adoption of flash-based products and the penetration of our products into large web and cloud data centers.
We believe we have the broadest and most competitive lineup of flash-based solutions and expect to have a #1 share in flash storage processors this year, emerging as the #2 player in merchant PCIe flash adapters. We continue to expect our total flash revenues to grow over 200% year-over-year in 2012, well ahead of market growth rates.
Even with the revenue softness in the second half, we expect to grow over 20% year-over-year in 2012 while the semiconductor market and many peers are expected to decline. This year, our design win momentum is tracking ahead of expectations, giving us confidence in our ability to grow more than our served market segments and our semiconductor peer group. As we look ahead, we expect to benefit from new product cycle ramps, including PCIe flash adapters at Oracle, Cisco, IBM and a new win at a leading social networking company. We have a broad footprint of FSP designs and are well positioned as FSPs get increasingly adopted in client, as well as enterprise platforms. We also began shipping FSP to a new ACD customer this quarter, and we'll benefit as this program reaches full production in 2013. In addition, Axxia revenues are expected to grow as we continue ramping at the leading base station OEM.
In the management team, we continue to drive improvements to what we can control. Our efforts have led to improvement in financial results and solid positioning in growing markets, reflected by new product cycles and share gains.
I'd like to review additional business highlights for Q3. We will begin with our server and storage business, which includes flash-related businesses, SAS, ServeRAID adapters and software, SAN and ACD. In flash, we are unique in offering 3 product families. Standard product flash storage processors or FSPs, custom FSPs and PCIe flash adapters, strongly positioning LSI to benefit from a multiyear growth cycle in flash-based storage adoption.  In Q3, we saw further growth in standard product SandForce FSP revenues reflecting our broad footprint with market leaders such as Toshiba, Intel, Hynix, ASUS and others. Our power-optimized hardware and firmware were specifically engineered to meet the very aggressive power and performance specifications of new Ultrabook platforms. Our solutions are now qualified and shipping to 6 PC OEMs in Ultrabooks and notebooks, and we're excited about the upcoming Intel Haswell platform launch. In Q3, we also saw our growth in custom and standard FSPs targeted to enterprise applications with shipments to Intel, SanDisk, Kingston, SMART Modular and Toshiba. 
I'll now move to PCIe adapters where we are bringing the performance advantages of flash to enterprise server storage and networking applications.  Earlier this year, we introduced the Nytro product family, our second generation of PCIe flash adapters that incorporate our SandForce FSPs and enable acceleration across a broad spectrum of enterprise and data center applications. We are pleased to announce that Oracle Exadata platform is leveraging and shipping LSI's Nytro flash acceleration technology. 
With Oracle and other key wins, we believe LSI is emerging as the #2 provider of merchant PCIe flash solutions worldwide, behind Fusion I/O. We were recently awarded business at a leading social networking company where Nytro is being used to accelerate webpage access. We also expect to release Nytro solutions in the production for IBM and Cisco. In our SAS and RAID business, we continue to benefit from the ramp of Intel's Romley platform in addition to continuing to supply existing 6-gig SAS solutions to leading server OEMs. We anticipate that customers will begin to migrate servers from 6-gig SAS to 12-gig SAS in the second half of 2013. Given LSI's early market leadership position and value proposition, we believe that many of those server platforms will leverage LSI solutions.
Beyond the traditional markets for SAS, we are now sampling our high-availability, direct-attached storage, or HA-DAS solutions for Microsoft Windows Server 2012. Our solutions deliver the benefits Of traditional SAN and shared storage capabilities in a much lower cost, easy-to-use, DAS environment. LSI solutions are expected to be generally available in the first quarter next year, in conjunction with the rollout of Microsoft Windows Server 2012 and will add to future SAS RAID growth, enabling us to grow above server market growth rates.
In hard disk drives, we saw declines of over 20% sequentially driven by lower PC sales affecting ACD demand and resulting inventory adjustments by key customers. We expect demand to remain soft due to weakness in the PC market segment resulting in lower component shipments in Q4 and this is reflected on our guidance.
We continue to execute well on the factors we can control, which we believe will lead to share gains over the long term. We have now begun shipping one terabyte per platter desktop SSCs to new customer and expect to benefit as this program ramps into full production. In 2.5-inch notebook drives, we have been selected to provide SSCs into a 500-gig per platter hybrid drive targeted at Haswell-based Ultrabook platforms.  Lastly, we have secured 2 additional wins for 500-gig per platter notebook designs and these SSCs will enable our customers to achieve even higher areal density points. 
I would now like to discuss our networking business where our products address the wireless mobile network, data center and enterprise market segments.
In the wireless space, we began ramping our standard product Axxia multi-core communications processor at the leading base station OEM during the past quarter. We also secured our second data plane and control plane design win at another leading OEM, displacing an incumbent competitor in a future generation with our Axxia solution.
We now have multi-generational engagements with leading system OEMs in the wireless space that will enable LSI to have access of --  in excess of 50% share in control and data plane silicon a few years out. Our previously mentioned custom silicon wins in the base band section of base stations with multiple system OEMs further adds to LSI's footprint in base station infrastructure.
A year ago, we added an enterprise focus to our Axxia effort. We reported on a beachhead win in a leading data center switch platform and now have another key win to add to this. Additionally, in enterprise, we have won both high-volume and high-end switch platforms with custom products at a leading data networking customer, with revenue ramps in 2013. We've also expanded our footprint in the Gigabit Ethernet space by sampling a low-power Gigabit Ethernet PHY targeted for Ultrabook platforms. 
Lastly, we're very excited about our efforts with ARM to extend LSI's differentiation with ARM-based Axxia solutions. We are working closely with ARM on interconnect technology that will enable Axxia to be the industry's first, many-core ARM SSC targeted to wireless and enterprise networking infrastructure.
To wrap up, I am pleased with the execution that we're delivering as a company, LSI's is well positioned with share gain opportunities and new product cycles to enable us to outgrow the storage and networking markets we serve. We remain debt-free with strong operating cash flows with the opportunity to continue to return capital to our shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Bryon, who will take you through our results and provide guidance."

Q3 revenues in our net",897,"Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a discussion of our financial results for the quarter beginning with revenues. Our Q3 revenues were $624 million, up 14% on a year-over-year basis and down 5% sequentially. Q3 revenues in our networking business were $106 million, down 10% on a year-over-year basis, and up 7% sequentially. Networking revenues represented 17% of total revenues for the third quarter.
Moving next to our server and storage semiconductor business, which consists of our ServeRAID adapter and software, flash, SAS, SAN and HDD businesses. Revenues for server and storage semiconductors were $493 million, up 22% on a year-over-year basis, and down 8% sequentially. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in demand for our HDD products, partially offset by increased demand for our flash products. Revenues from server and storage semiconductors represented 79% of total revenues in the third quarter.  Revenues for the IP business were approximately $25 million.
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's Q3 gross margin, excluding special items, was 53.9%.  Gross margin decreased sequentially by approximately 10 basis points. In terms of operating expenses, R&D, together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, totaled $226 million in Q3. This was sequentially down $7 million from Q2, as variable compensation expenses were lowered in the quarter.
Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $111 million or 17.7% of revenue. This represented a sequential decrease of 90 basis points and a 250 basis point increase from a year ago.  Interest income and other net of interest expense, excluding special items, was $3 million for Q3. 
Now let me turn to the special items which we recorded in the third quarter, which netted to approximately $59 million. Special items, primarily noncash, included $30 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $28 million of stock-based compensation expense and $4 million of restructuring costs and other items, offset by a $3 million gain on the sale of investments.
 
Moving next to tax. The tax provision on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis will vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. The tax provision we recorded for Q3 for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was $15 million. On a GAAP basis, third quarter net income was approximately $40 million or $0.07 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $99 million or $0.17 per diluted share.
Weighted average share count for the period for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was 572 million shares. This includes the weighted average benefit of purchasing approximately 7 million shares during the period under our stock repurchase program. On a cumulative basis, LSI has repurchased a total of 102 million shares and utilized approximately $725 million of the $750 million stock repurchase program the Board authorized last year.  In addition, in August, the Board authorized a new $500 million stock repurchase program. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. Cash and short-term investments ended the third quarter with $643 million, and we continue to operate with no debt on our balance sheet.  Operating cash flows for the third quarter were $112 million. Finally, with respect to Q3 results, depreciation and software amortization was $15 million and capital expenditures were $26 million.
Next is a discussion of our guidance for Q4 2012. Q4 revenues in the range of $570 million to $610 million were sequentially down about 5% at midpoint. This would represent about 13% growth on a year-over-year basis. We expect our server and storage semiconductor revenues to be down sequentially in Q4. We expect declines in our flash and HDD businesses and a slight growth in our server-related products. We expect the declines in our flash and HDD businesses are tied to soft PC market conditions, as mentioned by Abhi earlier. We expect our networking semiconductor revenues to be slightly down sequentially in Q4.
Gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be 53%, plus or minus 1%. Operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the range of $223 million to $233 million. Operating expenses for Q3 and Q4 reflect lower variable compensation expenses and tied to lower revenue and profitability levels.  Interest income and other and interest expense, excluding special items, is expected to net to income of approximately $3 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately $55 million to $75 million.
The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $9 million for Q4. We expect Q4 GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of negative $0.02 to positive $0.07, and non-GAAP net income in the range of $0.11 to $0.17 per diluted share.
Share count is expected to be approximately 570 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. In addition, we expect depreciation in software amortization of approximately $15 million and capital expenditures of approximately $27 million.
In closing, we delivered solid results in Q3 in spite of a difficult business environment. We continue to demonstrate solid year-over-year progress across key areas including revenues, which grew sub 14%; non-GAAP gross margins, which expanded by 170 basis points; non-GAAP operating income which grew by 250 basis points, and non-GAAP EPS which increased by 21%. We continue with our stock buyback program, which the Board extended in August 2012, with the announcement of a new $500 million authorization. 
Now let me turn the call back to Sujal."

But if the market TAM is sort of what is expected out there relative to PC consumption and at least what one major HDD customer shared in terms of their view on the TAM, I think we would conclude that the inventory adjustments that remain will get addressed in Q4. Not all of it got addressed in Q3, there are some remnants of inventory adjustment that are taking place going into Q4 and that's obviously factored into our guidance. Relative to seasonality, I mean, we haven't had a normal Q4 to Q1 in a number of years, given natural disasters and a number of other factors. But if you go back to when we had stability in our lives, seasonality, typically for our business, Q1 is down from Q4, given there is a budget flush for enterprise in Q4, and obviously there's the holiday season associated with consumer products and PCs, so that's typically what we've seen, is that Q1 being down from Q4."

We had a number of our customers launch new products, a number of them obviously for SSDs integrated into thin and light sort of notebooks or Ultrabooks, as well as a number of SSDs that were launched for after market adaptation in the PCs and so forth. So revenues in the third quarter were elevated and supported those new product launches and then as we said, on top of that there's certainly a weak PC market that  is also affecting SSD based PCs. And lastly, I think relative to expectations that many of us had in the industry in terms of Ultrabooks 3 months back as to where they're now performing, those are coming in lower. And your question is to -- as to Q1, certainly not going to guide into Q1, but a number of these factors that we discussed are sort of onetime.

Carriers around the world continue to hold CapEx spending very tightly and we have not seen much life there and certainly hope to, towards sometime next year. Because the networks are very saturated and we're very well positioned to benefit from that when that starts to take hold. In terms of Q3, we'll definitely starting to see contributions from our Axxia ramp at the very early stages of that particular ramp. Obviously, very excited to see that. That's been a program that's underway for quite some time, and we believe it's the start of many exciting sort of opportunities with Axxia across wireless. But also, as we've noted in the prepared remarks, in enterprise data center switching as well. I think the other thing to keep in mind, there is a lot of different puts and takes in networking. If we look at our overall networking business this year, we will decline. Now our legacy business will have declined approximately $50 million year-over-year. But if we put aside our networking sort of legacy business and just focus on our investment areas, our investment areas this year will grow. And this will grow despite many of our peers, a vast majority of our peers actually declining in networking and the overall market being down.

But assuming all of us are projecting that correctly, the inventory situation will be cleared up in Q4, and then hopefully we'll be on to a number of new industry product cycles that are ahead of us in the first half of next year. Relative to sort of growth rates and our outlook for growth rates in the ACD space, obviously PC growth rates that are being forecasted here for the next 3 to 4 years have come down, given what has transpired this year and some of the challenges around tablet and mobile sort of cannibalization lease in terms of share of wallet, we still expect the ACD market to grow. The question is whether it's 3%, 4% or 5% CAGR. There are projections that are even higher. Keep in mind that 40% of the HDD sort of products have nothing to do with PCs and are growing in the teens from that standpoint. Relative to your last part of your question in terms of investment allocations, I mean clearly, I think it's safe to conclude that we're going to make sure that we're investing for growth in where we have high growth opportunities. Flash in particular obviously is getting a lot of attention and a lot of investment, given 40% to 50% growth rates sort of opportunities. That doesn't mean we're losing focus on HDD. It's a multibillion-dollar market. We're only in the high-30s in terms of share, markets have been consolidating, and our customers are going to a dual supplier strategy and we've won a number of designs this quarter, as well as we'll be ramping into a new customer.

Very much dependent on what consumption is next year, which is tied to macroeconomic environment, which is probably anyone's guess at this juncture. We have a number of growth drivers, right, that we're excited about. Flash is obviously significant growth driver for the company. We are very underrepresented in the PCIe flash adapter space. There's no reason why we can't significantly outpace the market. The opportunity is there, the product line is there and the customer interest in pool is there for us as well, and we're certainly aiming to drive much higher growth rates. So I think that is a pretty sizable lever. Another lever that we certainly hope to benefit, even in maybe a weak macro environment next year is the huge design win pipeline that we've been accumulating across all our product lines over the last 3, 4 years, which has had very high conversion rates, which has helped us deliver a CAGR over the last 3 years in the teens. And that will also contribute to next year's growth. Ultimately, OpEx is a factor as well, and is a controlled point.

And then we also have the very high-end Nytro product member which is called WarpDrive, which is for flash being used as primary storage. And so the breadth of our product line is certainly, I think, will be an advantage. I think the fact that we're using proven driver technology and firmware that all of the server vendors -- basically, everyone is used to and has been using for many, many years, and hardened [ph] technology is another advantage. In a number of the workloads, we also have performance advantages as well. And lastly, we do believe for a broad spectrum of workloads and usage models, the fact that we have what we refer to as an offload sort of architecture, which minimizes consumptions of CPU cycles, we think that's also a big benefit as well. And I could probably go on longer, but we feel very good about our competitive position. And frankly, the industry is looking for a strong alternative.

And a number of the HD -- all the HDD OEMs are now starting to aggressively focus on this. We do believe that it's really around the Haswell platform that we'll see more uptake with these hybrid drives because they're going to be of the smaller sort of form factor, the 7-millimeter form factor. There may or may not be 5-millimeter products in production at that time. I think they're going to come later in '13. And you're correct, we do believe we're ahead here by a meaningful sort of margin, and this initial product has a 500-gig per platter hybrid product. As to projections for the year, Harlan, I don't know. I hope they're widely successful because we're in a great position.
