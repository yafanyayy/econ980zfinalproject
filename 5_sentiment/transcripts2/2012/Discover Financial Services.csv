We certainly appreciate you joining as for the discussion today. Let me begin by reminding all of you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2011, which is on file with the SEC. 
In the first quarter 2012 earnings release and supplement, which are now posted on our website at discoverfinancial.com and have been furnished to the SEC, we've provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and to investors. And we urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Finally, we will be holding our Annual Financial Community Update tomorrow morning at 8:30 a.m. at the New York Palace Hotel. If you would like more information about that meeting, please get in touch with me these evening by e-mail. And with that event ahead of us tomorrow, it is our intention to keep this call and your questions focused in our first quarter results and performance, and we'll certainly have much more for you tomorrow regarding our strategies for profitable growth. Our call this afternoon will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer, and of course a question-and-answer session. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to David."

As Gregg mentioned, we are looking forward to our Annual Financial Community Briefing tomorrow morning where our members of Executive team will take you through some of the exciting developments and opportunities ahead of us at Discover. 
After the market closed today, we reported record first quarter net income of $631 million or $1.18 per share driven by continued improvements in credit performance, along with solid organic growth in receivables and strong volume growth across all of our networks. In Direct Banking, we continue to deliver good growth in card, private student and personal loans and achieved record profits in our Payment Services business and are continuing to expand our network. I'm very pleased with our 9% year-over-year loan growth, which reflects $1.6 billion in card loan growth, and in private student and personal loans, we eclipsed $10 billion in receivables. In terms of credit card performance, we achieved 25-year lows for net charge-off rate and 30-plus delinquency rate, demonstrating the quality of our portfolio and the strength of our risk management capabilities. 
Before I turn the call over to Mark for some more detail in the financial results, I want to mention some recent developments that augur well for future growth and for continued generation of solid shareholder returns. The first of these was our receipt of the non-injection from the Fed related to our capital plan and proposed capital actions. In connection with that, we announced the new 2-year share repurchase authorization of $2 billion along with our regular quarterly dividend. I did want to remind you that last quarter, we took up the dividend by 67% to its current quarterly level of $0.10 per share, and we will review the dividend level at least on an annual basis. 
A second recent development for us in the business side was our announcement of a new long-term agreement with the National Payments Corporation of India, which runs the pay network in India. Since its founding in 2009 by a consortium of Indian banks, NPCI has grown its share of ATM-processed transactions in India to 95%. Our new agreement will enable acceptance at Discover and Diners Club international cards at NPCI ATMs and eventually point-of-sale terminals throughout India. The agreement will also now RuPay cardholders to utilize the Discover, Diners Club International and PULSE networks for purchases and cash access outside of India. We expect this arrangement will result in increased transaction volume over time. I am very pleased that NPCI recognize Discover as the most flexible network and best partner for the future in one of the fastest-growing, largest potential customer -- countries for payment cards. 
At our meeting tomorrow, Diane will have more to say about our global different strategy. The other very recent announcement that I want to highlight relates to the launch of the first Discover-branded card in the international marketplace by our Diners Club franchise partner in Ecuador. This is an important strategic development because we believe it will allow us to market test the model that could eventually become a framework for expanding Discover brand to the card issuance into additional countries with what to date has been a purely domestic model. One final recent announcement was earlier today, we announced a new deal with the large network in Puerto Rico, and we're excited to tell you more about that tomorrow as well. We look forward to meeting with you tomorrow where we will share our model for long-term profitable growth and the initiatives that will help us to achieve our goals for 2012 and beyond. With that, I'd like to had it over to Mark Graf to review our first quarter results."

I'll begin my comments by focusing on our Direct Banking segment's first quarter results. The segment earned $962 million pretax this quarter versus $677 million last year. Reserve releases contributed $226 mil",1203,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin my comments by focusing on our Direct Banking segment's first quarter results. The segment earned $962 million pretax this quarter versus $677 million last year. Reserve releases contributed $226 million to pretax earnings in the quarter as credit continue to improve to a greater degree than we had expected last quarter. 
Turning to yield on the card portfolio. We reported a 44 basis point decrease from the prior year to 12.21%. This happened as our higher-priced balances declined and our promotional volumes increased. These were partially offset by lower interest charge-offs. We are now including total interest and fee charge-offs in the financial supplement so you don't have to wait for the 10-Q for that disclosure. Total portfolio yield was 11.36%, lower by 74 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year driven primarily by the acquisition of the Private Student Loan portfolios in the first and fourth quarters of last year, as well as the yield compression I just mentioned. The yield compression was likely offset by the affect of the sale of federal student loans last month. Net interest income increased $123 million or 11% versus the prior year, driven by asset growth, lower charge-offs of accrued interest and the benefit of lower interest expense. Net interest margin on receivables was 9.03%, down 19 basis points compared to the prior year due to the yield compression I mentioned a moment ago partially offset by funding cost improvement. The modest sequential decrease in net interest margin of 7 basis points was primarily driven by having a full fourth quarter of net interest income from the $2.4 billion in Private Student Loans that we acquired during the fourth quarter, along with the corresponding sequential card yield compression. Again, funding cost improvement partially offset this NIM compression. Absent any inorganic asset mix shifts,  we expect the net interest margin to stabilize around this level for the remainder of the year as funding cost improvement largely offset those card yield compression and organic growth in Private Student Loans. However, it's important to note that we also expect student loans to produce much lower average credit losses than we expect to see in the card product. 
Other income for the Direct Banking segment decreased $22 million from last year's first quarter due in large part to a $16 million purchase gain related to the SLC acquisition in the prior year period, as well as slightly lower production product revenues. Higher discount interchange revenues was partially offset by higher rewards as we increased our rewards rate on card sales to 92 basis points from 86 basis points in the first quarter of last year. 
Total operating expenses for the segment were up $82 million over the prior year. Expenses were up to support completed acquisitions, the higher level of loans and higher legal reserves. The increase in expenses for this quarter reflect investments the further our diversification in Direct Banking, and we expect the benefit from these investments as we move further into 2012. Going forward, we'll continue to be diligent on expense management, and we'll provide more perspective on our thoughts around operating expenses during our Investor Day tomorrow. 
Now I'll switch to lending product growth and credit performance for the segment. We achieved card sales growth of 7% for the first quarter versus the prior year. The growth in card sales was driven by our continued focus on increasing our merchant acceptance, enriching our rewards programs and leveraging our marketing investments. Our total loan portfolio grew $4.6 million dollars with $2.4 billion of this growth attributable to the second accretive Private Student Loan acquisition. Receivables in our personal loan product were up $764 million from the prior year while our credit card loans were up $1.6 billion. The sale of our remaining student loans fully was completed this quarter and is already reflected in the numbers I just provided. 
Turning to card credit quality. Our positive moment and continue this quarter as the card net charge-off rate and 30-plus delinquency each declined 17 basis points sequentially. The card reserve rate decreased 44 basis points as well reflecting a brighter forward 12-month outlook for credit performance, which resulted in a $235 million card reserve release. Going forward, we still expect to build reserves at some point in the next 12 months as our loan portfolio continues to grow. However, the underlying economic environment clearly seems to be more constructive at this juncture. 
For our Private Student Loan portfolio, the principal charge-off rate, excluding our purchase portfolio was 49 basis points. The charge-offs and delinquency in our Private Student Loan portfolio are performing according to our expectations. In terms of personal loan credit performance, loans greater than 30 days past due fell 6 basis points sequentially, and the personal loans net principal charge-off rate was essentially flat at 2.59%. 
On the payment side, we had another quarter of record pretax earnings in payment volumes. Pretax income was up $9 million or 21% from the prior year to $52 million driven by higher-margin point-of-sale volume from our PULSE PIN debit network business. Volumes were up 8% against the prior year driven by 9% growth in PULSE debit volumes and 15% growth in our third-party issuing volumes. The increase in third-party issuing volume was driven mostly by spend on Wal-Mart and Sam's Club Cards and higher prepaid volume. 
Let's move on to liquidity, funding and capital. Our liquidity levels were strong in the quarter with total actual and contingent liquidity at $28 billion. Our liquidity portfolio ended the quarter at $12.1 billion, up $1.9 billion from the prior year as we opportunistically pre-funded upcoming maturities, including by issuing a $1 billion 3-year ABS deal prior to the quarter's close at a fix rate of 81 basis points. Direct-to-consumer deposits are once again our largest source of funding at 46%. Our funding cost is continuing to fall as we replace higher cost deposits that we originated in a much higher rate environment. I'll take you through our expected quarterly maturities for 2012 and 2013 in my presentation tomorrow. As we said before, we continue to remain opportunistic across all our funding channels by tapping all but not exhausting any of them. 
Turning to capital. For some time now, we have benchmark our key capital ratio as tangible common equity to tangible common assets with a target or plus or minus 8%. Going forward, we will switch to focusing on our Tier 1 common capital ratio as it better represents how regulators and the industry look at capital levels, and we have established they 9.5% long-term target. We ended the most recent quarter at 14.3%. We'll address both this new target and our approach to excess capital in more detail tomorrow. 
The strength of our capital position allowed us to announce the new $2 billion share repurchase authorization last week after completing the capital review process with our regulators. We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders via mix of share repurchases and dividends, as well as opportunistic acquisitions at the right price. That concludes our formal remarks, so I'll turn the call back to the operator for the Q&A session."

I'll try to touch on all of, them. Please feel free to catch me if I don't touch all of them. With respect to expectations for card deal, I think we'll be providing some greater detail on that thought during our Investor Day tomorrow, so I do want to jump the gun too much, but what I would say is that we continue to expect to see some continued compression coming primarily from the attrition of some of those higher rate balances that create CARD Act that is continuing at this point in time. But we expect the compression resulting from that, as well as our other activities to essentially be offset by the funding cost tailwind that we've got right now. Actually, on the card yield loan basis, it'll more than offset I think. So that's the right way to think about it, range it in, again, a little bit more detail tomorrow. And then with respect to the share repurchase thoughts, we are going to give some guidance around our expectations and cadence in terms of how we'll be looking at that going forward during the Investor Day tomorrow as well.

We just don't have all the subprime players out there that used to have an impact on everyone. Even the CARD Act had a certain impact on it. And so, and I think you've in consumer behavior essentially taken the shift after coming through  this cycle, consumers are more cautious, and that will show up in lower losses over time. So if I had to guess, I would say eventually we're going to see more than 4% to 5% of the kind of the range of normalization. And I think it's going to maybe take longer than we might have expected to get there. Mark originally earlier today as we look in the next 12 months, we're not really seeing any signs. We're seeing signs of maybe approaching a bottom, but you saw both our delinquencies and charge-off rate this quarter still improve.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2011, which is on file with the SEC. 
In the first quarter 2012 earnings release and supplement, which are now posted on our website at discoverfinancial.com and have been furnished to the SEC, we provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and to investors. And we urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. 
Finally, we will be holding our annual financial community update tomorrow morning at 8:30 a.m. at The New York Palace hotel. If you would like more information about that meeting, please get in touch with me these evening by e-mail. And with that event ahead of us tomorrow, it is our intention to keep this call and your questions focused on our first quarter results and performance, and we'll certainly have much more for you tomorrow regarding our strategies for profitable growth.

As Craig mentioned, we are looking forward to our annual financial community briefing tomorrow morning where members of our executive team will take you through some of the exciting developments and opportunities ahead of us at Discover. 
After the market closed today, we reported record first quarter net income of $631 million, or $1.18 per share, driven by continued improvements in credit performance, along with solid organic growth in receivables and strong volume growth across all of our networks. In Direct Banking, we continued to deliver good growth in card, private student and personal loans and achieved record profits in our Payment Services business and are continuing to expand our network. I'm very pleased with our 9% year-over-year loan growth, which reflects $1.6 billion in card loan growth. And in private student and personal loans, we eclipsed $10 billion in receivables. In terms of credit card performance, we achieved 25-year lows for net charge-off rate and 30-plus delinquency rate, demonstrating the quality of our portfolio and the strength of our risk management capabilities. 
Before I turn the call over to Mark for some more detail in the financial results, I want to mention some recent developments that augur well for future growth and for continued generation of solid shareholder returns. The first of these was our receipt of the non-objection from the Fed related to our capital plan and proposed capital actions. In connection with that, we announced a new 2-year share repurchase authorization of $2 billion along with our regular quarterly dividend. I do want to remind you that last quarter, we took up the dividend by 67% to its current quarterly level of $0.10 per share, and we will review the dividend level at least on an annual basis. 
A second recent development for us on the business side was our announcement of a new long-term agreement with the National Payments Corporation of India, which runs the RuPay network in India. Since its founding in 2009 by a consortium of Indian banks, NPCI has grown its share of ATM process transactions in India to 95%. Our new agreement will enable acceptance of Discover and Diners Club International cards at NPCI's ATMs and, eventually, point-of-sale terminals throughout India. The agreement will also allow RuPay cardholders to utilize the Discover, Diners Club International and PULSE networks for purchases and cash access outside of India. We expect this arrangement will result in increased transaction volume over time. I am very pleased that NPCI recognize Discover as the most flexible network and best partner for the future in one of the fastest-growing, largest potential customer or countries for payment cards. At our meeting tomorrow, Diane Offereins will have more to say about our global network strategy. 
The other very recent announcement that I want to highlight relates to the launch of the first Discover-branded card in the international marketplace by our Diners Club franchise partner in Ecuador. This is an important strategic development because we believe it will allow us to market-test a model that could eventually become a framework for expanding Discover-branded card issuance into additional countries with what to date has been a purely domestic model. 
One final recent announcement was earlier today, we announced a new deal with the large network in Puerto Rico, and we're excited to tell you more about that tomorrow as well. 
We look forward to meeting with you tomorrow where we will share our model for long-term, profitable growth and the initiatives that will help us to achieve our goals for 2012 and beyond. With that, I'd like to hand it over to Mark Graf to review our first quarter results."

I'll begin my comments by focusing on our Direct Banking segment's first quarter results. The segment earned $962 million pretax this quarter versus $677 million last year. Reserve releases contributed $226 mil",1202,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin my comments by focusing on our Direct Banking segment's first quarter results. The segment earned $962 million pretax this quarter versus $677 million last year. Reserve releases contributed $226 million to pretax earnings in the quarter as credit continued to improve to a greater degree than we had expected last quarter. 
Turning to yield on the card portfolio. We reported a 44-basis-point decrease from the prior year to 12.21%. This happened as our higher-priced balances declined and our promotional volumes increased. These were partially offset by lower interest charge-offs. We are now including total interest and fee charge-offs in the financial supplement, so you don't have to wait for the 10-Q for that disclosure. 
Total portfolio yield was 11.36%, lower by 74 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year driven primarily by the acquisition of the private student loan portfolios in the first and fourth quarters of last year as well as the card yield compression I just mentioned. The yield compression was slightly offset by the effect of the sale of federal student loans last month. 
Net interest income increased $123 million, or 11%, versus the prior year driven by asset growth, lower charge-offs of accrued interest and the benefit of lower interest expense. Net interest margin on receivables was 9.03%, down 19 basis points compared to the prior year due to the yield compression I mentioned a moment ago, partially offset by funding cost improvement. 
The modest sequential decrease in net interest margin of 7 basis points was primarily driven by having a full quarter of net interest income from the $2.4 billion in private student loans that we acquired during the fourth quarter, along with the corresponding sequential card yield compression. Again, funding cost improvement partially offset this NIM compression. Absent any inorganic asset mix shifts,  we expect the net interest margin to stabilize around this level for the remainder of the year as funding cost improvement largely offsets both card yield compression and organic growth in private student loans. However, it's important to note that we also expect student loans to produce much lower average credit losses than we expect to see in the card product. 
Other income for the Direct Banking segment decreased $22 million from last year's first quarter due in large part to a $16 million bargain purchase gain related to the SLC acquisition in the prior year period, as well as slightly lower protection product revenues. Higher discount and interchange revenue was partially offset by higher rewards as we increased our rewards rate on card sales to 92 basis points from 86 basis points in the first quarter of last year. 
Total operating expenses for the segment were up $82 million over the prior year. Expenses were up to support completed acquisitions, the higher level of loans and higher legal reserves. The increase in expenses for this quarter reflects investments to further our diversification in Direct Banking, and we expect to benefit from these investments as we move further into 2012. Going forward, we'll continue to be diligent on expense management, and we'll provide more perspective on our thoughts around operating expenses during our Investor Day tomorrow. 
Now I'll switch to lending product growth and credit performance for the segment. We achieved card sales growth of 7% for the first quarter versus the prior year. The growth in card sales was driven by our continued focus on increasing our merchant acceptance, enriching our rewards programs and leveraging our marketing investments. Our total loan portfolio grew $4.6 billion with $2.4 billion of this growth attributable to the second accretive private student loan acquisition. Receivables in our personal loan product were up $764 million from the prior year, while our credit card loans were up $1.6 billion. The sale of our remaining federal student loan portfolio was completed this quarter and is already reflected in the numbers I just provided. 
Turning to card credit quality. Our positive momentum continued this quarter as the card net charge-off rate and 30-plus delinquency rate each declined 17 basis points sequentially. The card reserve rate decreased 44 basis points as well, reflecting a brighter forward 12-month outlook for credit performance, which resulted in a $235 million card reserve release. Going forward, we still expect to build reserves at some point in the next 12 months as our loan portfolio continues to grow. However, the underlying economic environment clearly seems to be more constructive at this juncture. 
For our private student loan portfolio, the net principal charge-off rate, excluding our purchased portfolios, was 49 basis points. The charge-offs and delinquencies in our private student loan portfolio were performing according to our expectations. 
In terms of personal loan credit performance, loans greater than 30 days past due fell 6 basis points sequentially, and the personal loan net principal charge-off rate was essentially flat at 2.59%. 
On the payment side, we had another quarter of record pretax earnings and payment volumes. Pretax income was up $9 million, or 21%, from the prior year to $52 million, driven by higher-margin point-of-sale volume from our PULSE PIN debit network business. Volumes were up 8% against the prior year, driven by 9% growth in PULSE debit volumes and 15% growth in our third-party issuing volumes. The increase in third-party issuing volume was driven mostly by spend on Walmart and Sam's Club Cards and higher prepaid volume. 
Let's move on to liquidity, funding and capital. Our liquidity levels were strong to end the quarter with total actual and contingent liquidity of $28 billion. Our liquidity portfolio ended the quarter at $12.1 billion, up $1.9 billion from the prior year as we opportunistically pre-funded upcoming maturities, including by issuing a $1 billion, 3-year ABS deal prior to the quarter's close at a fixed rate of 81 basis points. 
Direct-to-consumer deposits are once again our largest source of funding at 46%. Our funding cost is continuing to fall as we replace higher-cost deposits that we originated in a much higher rate environment. I'll take you through our expected quarterly maturities for 2012 and 2013 in my presentation tomorrow. As we've said before, we continue to remain opportunistic across all our funding channels by tapping all but not exhausting any of them. 
Turning to capital. For some time now, we have benchmarked our key capital ratio as tangible common equity-to-tangible assets with a target of plus or minus 8%. Going forward, we will switch to focusing on our Tier 1 common capital ratio as it better represents how regulators and the industry look at capital levels, and we have established a 9.5% long-term target. We ended the most recent quarter at 14.3%. We'll address both this new target and our approach to excess capital in more detail tomorrow. 
The strength of our capital position allowed us to announce the new $2 billion share repurchase authorization last week after completing the capital review process with our regulators. We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders via a mix of share repurchases and dividends as well as opportunistic acquisitions at the right price. 
That concludes our formal remarks, so I'll turn the call back to the operator for the Q&A session."

With respect to expectations for card yield, I think we -- we'll be providing some greater detail on that thought during our Investor Day tomorrow, so I don't want to jump the gun too much. But what I would say is we continue to expect to see some continued compression coming primarily from the attrition of some of those higher-rate balances that predate CARD Act. That is continuing at this point in time. But we expect the compression resulting from that, as well as our other activities, to essentially be offset by the funding cost tailwind we've got right now.

In terms of the dischargeability in bankruptcy, it -- there's not -- I don't expect anything to happen real quickly, if at all, in this area. But if it did, it would depend on exactly how. Is it immediately dischargeable? So when someone graduates and they haven't even had time to start making money, they could walk away? Or would it be after 5 years they could be dischargeable? So I think the precise way it happened would matter. But I'd also say we have  relatively low losses in this. So it -- I don't think -- I think it will certainly change how we think about pricing going forward, but I don't think it would totally undermine the business model. Certainly, the fact that most of our loans are cosigned, I think, gives us some protection from anything too dramatic."

In the first quarter 2012 earnings release and supplement, which are now posted on our website at discoverfinancial.com and have been furnished to the SEC, we provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and to investors. And we urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.

As Craig mentioned, we are looking forward to our annual financial community briefing tomorrow morning where members of our executive team will take you through some of the exciting developments and opportunities ahead of us at Discover. 
After the market closed today, we reported record first quarter net income of $631 million, or $1.18 per share, driven by continued improvements in credit performance, along with solid organic growth in receivables and strong volume growth across all of our networks. In Direct Banking, we continued to deliver good growth in card, private student and personal loans and achieved record profits in our Payment Services business and are continuing to expand our network. 
I'm very pleased with our 9% year-over-year loan growth, which reflects $1.6 billion in card loan growth. And in private student and personal loans, we eclipsed $10 billion in receivables. In terms of credit card performance, we achieved 25-year lows for net charge-off rate and 30-plus delinquency rate, demonstrating the quality of our portfolio and the strength of our risk management capabilities. 
Before I turn the call over to Mark for some more detail in the financial results, I want to mention some recent developments that augur well for future growth and for continued generation of solid shareholder returns. The first of these was our receipt of the non-objection from the Fed related to our capital plan and proposed capital actions. In connection with that, we announced a new 2-year share repurchase authorization of $2 billion along with our regular quarterly dividend. I do want to remind you that last quarter, we took up the dividend by 67% to its current quarterly level of $0.10 per share, and we will review the dividend level at least on an annual basis. 
A second recent development for us on the business side was our announcement of a new long-term agreement with the National Payments Corporation of India, which runs the RuPay network in India. Since its founding in 2009 by a consortium of Indian banks, NPCI has grown its share of ATM process transactions in India to 95%. Our new agreement will enable acceptance of Discover and Diners Club International cards at NPCI's ATMs and, eventually, point-of-sale terminals throughout India. The agreement will also allow RuPay cardholders to utilize the Discover, Diners Club International and PULSE networks for purchases and cash access outside of India. We expect this arrangement will result in increased transaction volume over time. I am very pleased that NPCI recognized Discover as the most flexible network and best partner for the future in one of the fastest-growing, largest potential customer, or countries for payment cards. At our meeting tomorrow, Diane Offereins will have more to say about our global network strategy. 
The other very recent announcement that I want to highlight relates to the launch of the first Discover-branded card in the international marketplace by our Diners Club franchise partner in Ecuador. This is an important strategic development because we believe it will allow us to market-test a model that could eventually become a framework for expanding Discover-branded card issuance into additional countries with what to date has been a purely domestic model. 
One final recent announcement was earlier today, we announced a new deal with the large network in Puerto Rico, and we're excited to tell you more about that tomorrow as well. 
We look forward to meeting with you tomorrow where we will share our model for long-term, profitable growth and the initiatives that will help us to achieve our goals for 2012 and beyond. With that, I'd like to hand it over to Mark Graf to review our first quarter results."

I'll begin my comments by focusing on our Direct Banking segment's first quarter results. The segment earned $962 million pretax this quarter versus $677 million last year. Reserve releases contributed $226 mil",1202,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin my comments by focusing on our Direct Banking segment's first quarter results. The segment earned $962 million pretax this quarter versus $677 million last year. Reserve releases contributed $226 million to pretax earnings in the quarter as credit continued to improve to a greater degree than we had expected last quarter. 
Turning to yield on the card portfolio. We reported a 44-basis-point decrease from the prior year to 12.21%. This happened as our higher-priced balances declined and our promotional volumes increased. These were partially offset by lower interest charge-offs. We are now including total interest and fee charge-offs in the financial supplement, so you don't have to wait for the 10-Q for that disclosure. 
Total portfolio yield was 11.36%, lower by 74 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year driven primarily by the acquisition of the private student loan portfolios in the first and fourth quarters of last year, as well as the card yield compression I just mentioned. The yield compression was slightly offset by the effect of the sale of federal student loans last month. 
Net interest income increased $123 million, or 11%, versus the prior year driven by asset growth, lower charge-offs of accrued interest and the benefit of lower interest expense. Net interest margin on receivables was 9.03%, down 19 basis points compared to the prior year due to the yield compression I mentioned a moment ago, partially offset by funding cost improvement. 
The modest sequential decrease in net interest margin of 7 basis points was primarily driven by having a full quarter of net interest income from the $2.4 billion in private student loans that we acquired during the fourth quarter, along with the corresponding sequential card yield compression. Again, funding cost improvement partially offset this NIM compression. Absent any inorganic asset mix shifts, we expect the net interest margin to stabilize around this level for the remainder of the year as funding cost improvement largely offsets both card yield compression and organic growth in private student loans. However, it's important to note that we also expect student loans to produce much lower average credit losses than we expect to see in the card product. 
Other income for the Direct Banking segment decreased $22 million from last year's first quarter due in large part to a $16 million bargain purchase gain related to the SLC acquisition in the prior year period, as well as slightly lower protection product revenues. Higher discount and interchange revenue was partially offset by higher rewards as we increased our rewards rate on card sales to 92 basis points from 86 basis points in the first quarter of last year. 
Total operating expenses for the segment were up $82 million over the prior year. Expenses were up to support completed acquisitions, the higher level of loans and higher legal reserves. The increase in expenses for this quarter reflects investments to further our diversification in Direct Banking, and we expect to benefit from these investments as we move further into 2012. Going forward, we'll continue to be diligent on expense management, and we'll provide more perspective on our thoughts around operating expenses during our Investor Day tomorrow. 
Now I'll switch to lending product growth and credit performance for the segment. We achieved card sales growth of 7% for the first quarter versus the prior year. The growth in card sales was driven by our continued focus on increasing our merchant acceptance, enriching our rewards programs and leveraging our marketing investments. Our total loan portfolio grew $4.6 billion with $2.4 billion of this growth attributable to the second accretive private student loan acquisition. Receivables in our personal loan product were up $764 million from the prior year, while our credit card loans were up $1.6 billion. The sale of our remaining federal student loan portfolio was completed this quarter and is already reflected in the numbers I just provided. 
Turning to card credit quality. Our positive momentum continued this quarter as the card net charge-off rate and 30-plus delinquency rate each declined 17 basis points sequentially. The card reserve rate decreased 44 basis points as well, reflecting a brighter forward 12-month outlook for credit performance, which resulted in a $235 million card reserve release. Going forward, we still expect to build reserves at some point in the next 12 months as our loan portfolio continues to grow. However, the underlying economic environment clearly seems to be more constructive at this juncture. 
For our private student loan portfolio, the net principal charge-off rate, excluding our purchased portfolios, was 49 basis points. The charge-offs and delinquencies in our private student loan portfolio were performing according to our expectations. 
In terms of personal loan credit performance, loans greater than 30 days past due fell 6 basis points sequentially, and the personal loan net principal charge-off rate was essentially flat at 2.59%. 
On the payment side, we had another quarter of record pretax earnings and payment volumes. Pretax income was up $9 million, or 21%, from the prior year to $52 million, driven by higher-margin point-of-sale volume from our PULSE PIN debit network business. Volumes were up 8% against the prior year, driven by 9% growth in PULSE debit volumes and 15% growth in our third-party issuing volumes. The increase in third-party issuing volume was driven mostly by spend on Walmart and Sam's Club Cards and higher prepaid volume. 
Let's move on to liquidity, funding and capital. Our liquidity levels were strong to end the quarter with total actual and contingent liquidity of $28 billion. Our liquidity portfolio ended the quarter at $12.1 billion, up $1.9 billion from the prior year as we opportunistically pre-funded upcoming maturities, including by issuing a $1 billion, 3-year ABS deal prior to the quarter's close at a fixed rate of 81 basis points. 
Direct-to-consumer deposits are once again our largest source of funding at 46%. Our funding cost is continuing to fall as we replace higher-cost deposits that we originated in a much higher rate environment. I'll take you through our expected quarterly maturities for 2012 and 2013 in my presentation tomorrow. As we've said before, we continue to remain opportunistic across all our funding channels by tapping all but not exhausting any of them. 
Turning to capital. For some time now, we have benchmarked our key capital ratio as tangible common equity-to-tangible assets with a target of plus or minus 8%. Going forward, we will switch to focusing on our Tier 1 common capital ratio as it better represents how regulators and the industry look at capital levels, and we have established a 9.5% long-term target. We ended the most recent quarter at 14.3%. We'll address both this new target and our approach to excess capital in more detail tomorrow. 
The strength of our capital position allowed us to announce the new $2 billion share repurchase authorization last week after completing the capital review process with our regulators. We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders via a mix of share repurchases and dividends as well as opportunistic acquisitions at the right price.

With respect to expectations for card yield, I think we -- we'll be providing some greater detail on that thought during our Investor Day tomorrow, so I don't want to jump the gun too much. But what I would say is we continue to expect to see some continued compression coming primarily from the attrition of some of those higher-rate balances that predate CARD Act. That is continuing at this point in time. But we expect the compression resulting from that, as well as our other activities, to essentially be offset by the funding cost tailwind we've got right now. Actually, on a card yield loan basis, it'll more than offset it, I think. So it's -- that's the right way to think about it, range it in. Again, a little bit more detail tomorrow. And then with respect to the share repurchase thoughts, we are going to give some guidance around our expectations and cadence in terms of how we'll be looking at that going forward during the Investor Day tomorrow as well.

We used to say 5% to 6% losses in credit cards over the cycle, and I think that there's been enough structural changes in the industry between deleveraging, consolidated industry. You just don't have all the sub-prime players out there that used to have an impact on everyone. Even the CARD Act had a certain impact on it. And so -- and I think even consumer behavior has actually taken a shift after coming through this cycle. Consumers are more cautious, and that will show up in lower losses over time. So if I had to guess, I would say eventually we're going to see more like 4% to 5% being kind of a range of normalization. And I think it's going to maybe take longer than we might have expected to get there. Mark originally -- earlier today, he said, ""Look, over the next 12 months, we're not going to -- we're not really seeing any signs."" I mean, we're seeing signs of maybe approaching a bottom, but you saw both our delinquencies and charge-off rates this quarter still improve."" So it indicates we're not quite at the bottom yet, but we should be getting close. And so -- but I wouldn't see anything that would dramatically take it up, and I would say it's probably going to be a while before we -- if it's going to go back to 4% or 5%, it's going to be a while, we think."

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2011, which is on file with the SEC.
In the second quarter 2012 earnings release and supplement, which are now posted on our website at discoverfinancial.com and have been furnished to the SEC, we provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Our call this morning will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer, and of course, a question-and-answer session. I would encourage you that it would be helpful to limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before the market opened this morning, we reported quarterly earnings of $537 million, an even $1 per diluted share, driven by 6% year-over-year increase in revenues and continued improvements in credit.
Additionally, we returned significant amount of capital to shareholders with combined share buybacks and dividends of approximately $500 million in the quarter.
In Direct Banking, we continued to deliver strong growth in card, private student and personal loans and launched some new products for future growth. I'm very pleased with our to the loan growth of 9% over the prior year, which reflects another quarter of nearly 4% growth in card loans as we continue to focus on profitable revolver sales through cash rewards leadership, promotional offers, partnerships and advertising.
We continue to achieve strong receivables growth while the overall card industry remains relatively flat. In terms of credit card performance, the strength of our risk management capabilities and the quality of our portfolio is new historic lows for the 30-plus delinquency and net charge-off rates.
The 30-plus delinquency rate fell below 2% and our 90-plus delinquency rate fell below 1%. This is truly outstanding credit performance.
Also, in card, we recently announced our first affinity partnership with Docs Unlimited, the largest group in the world with more than 600,000 adult members committed to wetlands and water conservation. This partnership will leverage our Lady rewards program to be a nice addition for new content sales growth.
Considered loans we started offering a new fixed rate private Student Loan product. This in new fixed-rate loan product provides predictability with a set interest rate for the life of the loan. Discover fixed rate Private Student Loans are designed to have rates comparable to the federal unsubsidized and plus loans for qualifying students with without the upfront origination fees of up to 4%. It is too early to tell how much long-term growth will come from this offering us speeding the market for less than a month, but the early signs from customers and school financial aid officers are positive.
The third new product that we just started marketing is residential mortgages under the Discover Home Loans brand. On June 6, we start -- we closed on the acquisition of the Home Loans center business from tree.com. The platform we acquired had a seasoned management team, approximately 750 employees and technology platform to give us room to expand in the future.
We are originating prime, fixed and variable-rate conventional and FHA loans, which will be sold in the secondary market with servicing relief. Home Loans is a product our customers have been asking Discover for, and the Mortgage business is a natural extension of our Direct Banking strategy.
We are entering this market in a sensible way, having acquired a platform at low-cost without the complexities of MSRs or legacy assets. After we launched the checking product later this year, I believe that we will have achieved another key milestone toward building the full suite of Direct Banking products.
In payments, false growth was up 14% over the prior year to on all-time record of $42 billion. As we have discussed previously, PULSE added 129 new relationships in 2011, however, merchant and acquirer routing discussions are still in process, and competitors pricing changes are still being implemented in the market.
We continue to remain concerned about 1 competitor's actions in the market, but that being said, I am pleased with how our PULSE team has responded. In summary, credit performance continues to be exceptional, but we continue to expect that we must be at or near the bottom. We are launching new products which will position us for revenue an asset growth in the future, and we are deploying capital in a thoughtful, meaningful way.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to review our second quarter results."
3695566,208434054,320879,"Discover Financial Services, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jun 19, 2012",2012-06-19,"Earnings Calls","Discover Financial Services","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my comments by focusing on our Direct Banking segment second quarter results. The segment earned $820 million pretax this quarter versus $883 million last year. Yield on the card portfolio declined 22",1410,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my comments by focusing on our Direct Banking segment second quarter results. The segment earned $820 million pretax this quarter versus $883 million last year. Yield on the card portfolio declined 22 basis points from the prior year to 12.35%. We continue to see our APR mix move away from higher APR balances but at a slower pace than we expected, and our promotional volumes increased over the prior year.
These were partially offset by lower interest charge-offs. Sequentially, card yield increased 14 basis points as we saw higher revolver rate in our merchandise balances and as we continue to benefit from lower accrued interest charge-offs.
Total portfolio yield was 11.55%, lower by 38 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year driven primarily by the acquisition of the additional Private Student Loan portfolio in the fourth quarter, as well as the current yield compression I'd just mentioned. Our and remind you that while Private Student Loans have lower yields than cards and personal loans, they also have lower charge-off rates and operating expenses.
The yield compression was slightly offset by the sale of our remaining federal student loans in the first quarter of this year.
Net interest income increased $122 million or 10% versus the prior year, driven by asset growth, the benefit of lower interest expense on our funding and lower charge-offs of accrued interest. Net interest margin on receivables was up 60 basis points to 9.31% compared to the prior year due to lower charge-offs of accrued interest and continued funding cost improvement. In fact, funding costs are down 50 basis points versus the prior year to 2.41% as a percentage of average receivables. This was partially offset by card yield compression and growth in lower yielding Private Student Loans.
The sequential increase in net interest margin of 28 basis points was primarily driven by yield expansion across all assets and lower funding costs. We expect the net interest margin to stabilize around the current level for the remainder of the year primarily as result of card yield holding up better than expected.
Other income from the Direct Banking segment decreased $21 million from last year's second quarter as a result of lower late fees, lower transition services revenue related to the Student Loan Corporation and a decline in protection products revenue. The largest component of other income, discount and interchange revenue, was up compared to the prior year but offset by higher rewards as we modestly increase our rewards rate on card sales to 95 basis points.
Rewards should be this area for the remainder of the year as we continue to invest in our program to drive profitable sales growth and feel this is the right level in this environment.
Total operating expenses for the segment were up $108 million from the prior year or 18%. This growth was primarily due to $71 million increase in legal reserve expenses over the prior year as we added $90 million to the reserving the quarter. Excluding the increase in the legal reserve expenses, operating expenses would have been up 6% compared to the prior year, which was essentially in line with revenue growth and would imply flat operating leverage.
For the second half of the year, we do expect marketing and business development expenses to increase relating to the timing of some marketing companies. The acquisition of the Home Loan Center platform and launch of the Discover Home Loans will also raise operating expenses by about $35 million a quarter, but with the new product launch, there will also be fee revenue.
Now I'll switch to lending product growth and credit performance for the segment. We achieved card sales growth of 5% for the second quarter versus the prior year. The growth in card sales was driven by our continued focus on increasing our merchant acceptance, enriching our rewards programs and leveraging our marketing investments. Lower year-over-year increases in gas prices, as well as more difficult comps resulted in slightly lower card sales growth than in the prior quarter year-over-year increase.
Our total loan portfolio grew $4.5 billion, with $2.4 billion of this growth attributable to the accretive Private Student Loan acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year. Credit card loans were up $1.6 billion, and personal loans receivables were up $703 million from the prior year.
Turning to card credit quality. Our positive momentum continued this quarter as the net charge-off rate declined 28 basis points versus the prior quarter and the 30-plus the link when see rate declined 31 basis points sequentially. The card reserve rate decreased 32 basis points as well, which resulted in $122 million card reserve release. In Private Student Loans, the net principal charge-off rate excluding our purchased volumes was 67 basis points. The charge-offs in delinquencies in our Private Student Loan portfolio performing according to our expectations and will continue to rise slightly as the portfolio seasons.
In terms of personal loan credit performance, loans greater than 30 days past due fell 2 basis points sequentially, and the personal loan net principal charge-off rate was down 35 basis points. The improvement can be attributed to portfolio growth and risk initiatives.
We continue to focus on thoughtful, measured growth in this asset class by leveraging our established underwriting competencies. Shifting to the Payment side. We had another quarter of strong pretax earnings and Payment volumes. Pretax income was up $4 million or 10% from the prior year-over-year to $47 million, driven by higher-margin point-of-sale volume from our PULSE PIN debit network business and third-party issuing volume. Higher revenues had than offsetting impact as incentives paid for transaction routing preference increased in the prior year. Volumes were up 12% against the prior year, driven by 14% growth in PULSE and 19% growth in our Discover Network third-party issuing volumes, offset partly by Diners Club performance.
Let's move on to liquidity, funding and capital. Our liquidity levels remain strong, with total available liquidity at $27.6 billion at the end of the quarter. Our on balance sheet and liquidity portfolio ended the quarter at $11.3 billion, up $2.6 billion from the prior year but down from the end of the first quarter. As you may recall, the end of the first quarter we have prefunded a large volume of second quarter maturities. While direct-to-consumer deposits continue to be our largest source of funding, we remain opportunistic across all of our funding channels. During the quarter, we completed an unsecured debt exchange through which we traded approximately 80% or $322 million of our 10.25% senior due in 2019 for a new 5.2% senior notes due in 2022. While the exchange offer had a slightly negative impact on results for the quarter, it would deliver a pretax benefit of approximately $8 million per year over the coming years.
Additionally, we competed a 2 tranche ABS transaction after the quarter closed. The deal included a 3-year, $800 million tranche priced at fixed coupon of 86 basis points and a $650 million 5-year, floating-rate tranche priced at 1 month LIBOR plus 37 basis points.
Turning to capital. We ended the quarter with 14% Tier 1 common ratio, slightly lower than last quarter as we repurchased nearly $450 million worth of shares in the quarter. This buybacks included the completion of our previously disclosed $250 million accelerated share repurchase program.
With that, let me conclude with a few final comments. In the second quarter, credit improvement and strong revenue growth, paired with controlled operating expense growth, generated strong earnings. We are continuing to invest in our business through new products and global acceptance and believe these investments position us well for the future. We're continuing to return capital to shareholders with more than 2% of our shares repurchased last quarter and $0.10 per share dividend which we committed to revisit at least annually. Before opening up to questions, I want to take a moment to formally announce an congratulate Bill Franklin and on his recent promotion to Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. I think most of you had the chance to interact with Bill as he's been a key part of our IR team over the past several years. He's the company and function made him a logical choice to take the helm of our program.
That concludes our formal remarks. So now I'll turn the call back to the operator to open up for Q&A."

But with respect to the legal reserve matter, I think that the matter is not resolved. We are engaged in ongoing dialogue with the CFPB and the FDIC, and we hope we can resolve it soon. It's a constructive dialogue. And we obviously reserve in accordance with the GAAP, and the reserve is set based on probable and estimable loss contingencies. So I think beyond that, I just pointed to the disclosures in our first quarter 10-Q as they contain a pretty full some discussion of the significant matters. But given that it's an ongoing investigation, that's really about all we can say. With respect to the buybacks, I would say that the $450 million probably included a little bit of capture productivity from being dark in the market in the first quarter while we went through the capital planning process. I still pretty confident in my guidance. But over the course of fiscal 2012, we'll probably use a little bit north of half of that authorization is probably the right way to think about it.

We operation math on the delinquency side of the equation would lead a logical person to kind of the conclusion you're making. But that notwithstanding, we do see some absolute limits to how low these things can go. So we tend to think about being somewhere near the bottom in the improvement. We still think we will return to growth at some point in time over, let's say, now the next 9 months in the reserve. That growth being driven though not by a turn in the credit environment, that growth being driven simply by loan growth. So provision for growth being the key issue there.

So that would be the general thought process I'd have you think about there. The other thing I would say in response to managing accretion going forward, I think you had the right way to think about this very much is that I think we returned a little bit north of 90% roughly in terms of total payout this quarter, so I think it's pretty high.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this morning's call. Let me begin by reminding everyone that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2011, which is on file with the SEC.
In the second quarter 2012 earnings release and supplement, which are now posted on our website at discoverfinancial.com and have been furnished to the SEC, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Our call this morning will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer, and of course, a question-and-answer session. I would encourage you that it would be helpful to limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before the market opened this morning, we reported quarterly earnings of $537 million or an even $1 per diluted share, driven by 6% year-over-year increase in revenues and continued improvements in credit.
Additionally, we returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders with combined share buybacks and dividends of approximately $500 million in the quarter.
In Direct Banking, we continued to deliver strong growth in card, private student and personal loans and launched some new products for future growth. I'm very pleased with our total loan growth of 9% over the prior year, which reflects another quarter of nearly 4% growth in card loans as we continue to focus on profitable revolver sales through cash rewards leadership, promotional offers, partnerships and advertising.
We continue to achieve strong receivables growth while the overall card industry remains relatively flat. In terms of credit card performance, the strength of our risk management capabilities and the quality of our portfolio has altered in new historic lows for the 30-plus delinquency and net charge-off rates.
The 30-plus delinquency rate fell below 2%, and our 90-plus delinquency rate fell to below 1%. This is truly outstanding credit performance.
Also, in card, we recently announced our first affinity partnership with Ducks Unlimited, the largest conservation group in the world with more than 600,000 adult members committed to wetlands and waterfowl conservation. This partnership will leverage our leading rewards program to be a nice addition for new account and sales growth.
In student loans, we started offering a new fixed-rate private student loan product. This new fixed-rate loan product provides predictability with a set interest rate for the life of the loan. Discover fixed-rate private student loans are designed to have rates comparable to federal unsubsidized Stafford and PLUS Loans for qualifying students without the upfront origination fees of up to 4%. It is too early to tell how much long-term growth will come from this offering as it has been in the market for less than a month, but the early signs from customers and school financial aid officers are positive.
The third new product that we just started marketing is residential mortgages under the Discover Home Loans brand. On June 6, we start -- we closed on the acquisition of a Home Loan Center business from Tree.com. The platform we acquired had a seasoned -- has a seasoned management team, approximately 750 employees and a technology platform that gives us room to expand in the future.
We are originating prime, fixed- and variable-rate, conventional and FHA loans, which will be sold in the secondary market with servicing released. Home Loans is a product our customers have been asking Discover for, and the mortgage business is a natural extension of our Direct Banking strategy.
We are entering this market in a sensible way, having acquired a platform at low-cost without the complexities of MSRs or legacy assets. After we launch the checking product later this year, I believe we will have achieved another key milestone toward building a full suite of Direct Banking products.
In Payments, PULSE growth was up 14% over the prior year to on all-time record of $42 billion. As we have discussed previously, PULSE added 129 new relationships in 2011. However, merchant and acquirer routing discussions are still in process, and competitors' pricing changes are still being implemented in the market.
We continue to remain concerned about one competitor's actions in the market, but that being said, I am pleased with how our PULSE team has responded. In summary, credit performance continues to be exceptional, but we continue to expect that we must be at or near the bottom. We are launching new products which will position us for revenue and asset growth in the future, and we are deploying capital in a thoughtful, meaningful way.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to review our second quarter results."

I'll begin my comments by focusing on our Direct Banking segment second quarter results. The segment earned $820 million pretax this quarter versus $883 million last year. Yield on the card portfolio declined 22",1415,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my comments by focusing on our Direct Banking segment second quarter results. The segment earned $820 million pretax this quarter versus $883 million last year. Yield on the card portfolio declined 22 basis points from the prior year to 12.35%. We continue to see our APR mix move away from higher APR balances but at a slower pace than we expected. And our promotional volumes increased over the prior year.
These were partially offset by lower interest charge-offs. Sequentially, card yield increased 14 basis points as we saw higher revolve rate in our merchandise balances and as we continue to benefit from lower accrued interest charge-offs.
Total portfolio yield was 11.55%, lower by 38 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year, driven primarily by the acquisition of the additional private student loan portfolio in the fourth quarter, as well as the current yield compression that I just mentioned. I'll remind you that while private student loans have lower yields than cards and personal loans, they also have lower charge-off rates and operating expenses.
The yield compression was slightly offset by the sale of our remaining federal student loans in the first quarter of this year.
Net interest income increased $122 million or 10% versus the prior year, driven by asset growth, the benefit of lower interest expense on our funding and lower charge-offs of accrued interest. Net interest margin on receivables was up 16 basis points to 9.31% compared to the prior year due to lower charge-offs of accrued interest and continued funding cost improvement. In fact, funding costs are down 50 basis points versus the prior year to 2.41% as a percentage of average receivables. This was partially offset by card yield compression and growth in lower-yielding private student loans.
The sequential increase in net interest margin of 28 basis points was primarily driven by yield expansion across all assets and lower funding costs. We expect the net interest margin to stabilize around the current level for the remainder of the year primarily as result of card yield holding up better than expected.
Other income for the Direct Banking segment decreased $21 million from last year's second quarter as a result of lower late fees, lower transition services revenue related to the Student Loan Corporation and a decline in protection products revenue. The largest component of other income, discount and interchange revenue, was up compared to the prior year, but offset by higher rewards as we modestly increased our rewards rate on card sales to 95 basis points.
Rewards should be in this area for the remainder of the year as we continue to invest in our program to drive profitable sales growth, and feel this is the right level in this environment.
Total operating expenses for the segment were up $108 million from the prior year or 18%. This growth was primarily due to a $71 million increase in legal reserve expenses over the prior year as we added $90 million to the reserve in the quarter. Excluding the increase in legal reserve expenses, operating expenses would have been up 6% compared to the prior year, which was essentially in line with revenue growth and would imply flat operating leverage.
For the second half of the year, we do expect marketing and business development expenses to increase relating to the timing of some marketing campaigns. The acquisition of the Home Loan Center platform and launch of Discover Home Loans will also raise operating expenses by about $35 million a quarter. But with the new product launch, there will also be fee revenue.
Now I'll switch to lending product growth and credit performance for the segment. We achieved card sales growth of 5% for the second quarter versus the prior year. The growth in card sales was driven by our continued focus on increasing our merchant acceptance, enriching our rewards programs and leveraging our marketing investments. Lower year-over-year increases in gas prices, as well as more difficult comps resulted in slightly lower card sales growth than in the prior quarter year-over-year increase.
Our total loan portfolio grew $4.5 billion, with $2.4 billion of this growth attributable to the accretive private student loan acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year. Credit card loans were up $1.6 billion and personal loan receivables were up $703 million from the prior year.
Turning to card credit quality, our positive momentum continued this quarter as the net charge-off rate declined 28 basis points versus the prior quarter and the 30-plus delinquency rate declined 31 basis points sequentially. The card reserve rate decreased 32 basis points as well, which resulted in a $122 million card reserve release. In private student loans, the net principal charge-off rate, excluding our purchased portfolios, was 67 basis points. The charge-offs in delinquencies in our private student loan portfolio are performing according to our expectations and will continue to rise slightly as the portfolio seasons.
In terms of personal loan credit performance, loans greater than 30 days past due fell 2 basis points sequentially. And the personal loan net principal charge-off rate was down 35 basis points. The improvement can be attributed to portfolio growth and risk initiatives.
We continue to focus on thoughtful, measured growth in this asset class by leveraging our established underwriting competencies. Shifting to the Payment side, we had another quarter of strong pretax earnings and Payment volumes. Pretax income was up $4 million, or 10% from the prior year, to $47 million, driven by higher-margin point-of-sale volume from our PULSE PIN debit network business and third-party issuing volume. Higher contra revenues had an offsetting impact as incentives paid for transaction routing preference increased from the prior year. Volumes were up 12% against the prior year, driven by 14% growth in PULSE and 19% growth in our Discover Network third-party issuing volumes, offset partly by Diners Club performance.
Let's move on to liquidity, funding and capital. Our liquidity levels remain strong, with total available liquidity at $27.6 billion at the end of the quarter. Our on balance sheet liquidity portfolio ended the quarter at $11.3 billion, up $2.6 billion from the prior year but down from the end of the first quarter. As you may recall, the end of the first quarter, we had prefunded a large volume of second quarter maturities. While direct-to-consumer deposits continue to be our largest source of funding, we remain opportunistic across all of our funding channels. During the quarter, we completed an unsecured debt exchange through which we traded approximately 80% or $322 million of our 10.25% senior notes due in 2019 for a new 5.2% senior notes due in 2022. While the exchange offer had a slightly negative impact on results for the quarter, it will deliver a pretax benefit of approximately $8 million per year over the coming years.
Additionally, we completed a 2-tranche ABS transaction after the quarter closed. The deal included a 3-year, $800 million tranche priced at a fixed coupon of 86 basis points and a $650 million 5-year, floating rate tranche priced at one month LIBOR plus 37 basis points.
Turning to capital, we ended the quarter with a 14% Tier 1 common ratio, slightly lower than last quarter as we repurchased nearly $450 million worth of shares in the quarter. This buybacks included the completion of our previously disclosed $250 million accelerated share repurchase program.
With that, let me conclude with a few final comments. In the second quarter, credit improvement and strong revenue growth, paired with controlled operating expense growth, generated strong earnings. We are continuing to invest in our business through new products and global acceptance, and believe these investments position us well for the future. We're continuing to return capital to shareholders with more than 2% of our shares repurchased last quarter and a $0.10 per share dividend which we've committed to revisit at least annually. Before opening up to questions, I want to take a moment to formally announce and congratulate Bill Franklin on his recent promotion to Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. I think most of you had the chance to interact with Bill as he's been a key part of our IR team over the past several years. His knowledge of the company and the function made him a logical choice to take the helm of our program.
That concludes our formal remarks. So now I'll turn the call back to the operator to open up for Q&A."

But with respect to the legal reserve matter, I think the matter is not resolved. We are engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the CFPB and the FDIC, and we hope we can resolve it soon. It's a constructive dialogue. We obviously reserve in accordance with GAAP, and the reserve is set based on probable and estimable loss contingencies. So I think beyond that, I'll just point you to the back of the disclosures in our first quarter 10-Q as they contain a pretty full some discussion of the significant matters. But given that it's an ongoing investigation, that's really about all we can say. With respect to the buybacks, I would say that there -- the $450 million probably included a little bit of catch-up productivity from being dark in the market in the first quarter while we went through the capital planning process. I'd still remain pretty confident in my guidance, but over the course of fiscal 2012, we'll probably use a little bit north of half of that authorization is probably the right way to think about it. So that should give you some sense in terms of how to think about sizing, what our thoughts are right now. That's obviously our current thought.

Could it possibly improve? It could. Could it possibly flatten out? It could. Our operational math on the delinquency side of the equation would lead a logical person to kind of the conclusion you're making. But that notwithstanding, we do see some absolute limits to how low these things can go. So we tend to think about being somewhere near the bottom in the improvement. We still think we'll return to growth at some point in time over, let's say, now the next 9 months in the reserve. That growth being driven though not by a turn in the credit environment, that growth being driven simply by loan growth. So provision for growth being the key issue there.

So that would be the general thought process I'd have you think about there. The other thing I would say in response to managing accretion going forward, I think yes, the right way to think about this very much is that I think we returned a little bit north of 90% roughly in terms of total payout this quarter, so I think it's pretty high. Clearly, the goal at this point in time while we're in this period of, obviously, very strong earnings, at the very least, mitigate further accretion on that capital line.

So we've got a whole host of actions that we've been employing in terms of marketing programs, emphasizing Cashback Bonus, leveraging our newfound capabilities in student loans and our expanded capabilities in student loans, and that really having some what I consider to be some good advertising and marketing programs, plus our great service. Going forward, I mentioned 3 new product areas that each, I think, have an opportunity to continue and in some cases, maybe accelerate our growth, ranging from the first affinity program, which we think will be a good opportunity in cards. That space, the affinity space, has changed dramatically in the last few years. Service is critically important to groups and group members, and so we think we're well positioned to help address that marketplace. So the fixed-loan product in student loans is designed to help us accelerate growth in that area and meet some new needs. And obviously, Home Loans won't be growing receivables, but over the long term, should grow our fee income. So we are continuing to diversify across our Direct Banking and Payment strategy in an effort to grow. We've got obviously -- we'd love to be able to invest more capital in organic growth."

And I think that certainly, we've got some significant relationships in there, but we're continuing to diversify out as well with some additional relationships that are also contributing to the growth."

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2011, which is on file with the SEC.
In the second quarter 2012 earnings release and supplement, which are now posted on our website at discoverfinancial.com and have been furnished to the SEC, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Our call this morning will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer; and of course, a question-and-answer session. I would encourage you that it would be helpful to limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before the market opened this morning, we reported quarterly earnings of $537 million or an even $1 per diluted share, driven by 6% year-over-year increase in revenues and continued improvements in credit.
Additionally, we returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders with combined share buybacks and dividends of approximately $500 million in the quarter.
In Direct Banking, we continued to deliver strong growth in card, private student and personal loans and launched some new products for future growth. I'm very pleased with our total loan growth of 9% over the prior year, which reflects another quarter of nearly 4% growth in card loans as we continue to focus on profitable revolver sales through cash rewards leadership, promotional offers, partnerships and advertising.
We continue to achieve strong receivables growth while the overall card industry remains relatively flat. In terms of credit card performance, the strength of our risk management capabilities and the quality of our portfolio resulted in new historic lows for the 30-plus delinquency and net charge-off rates.
The 30-plus delinquency rate fell below 2%, and our 90-plus delinquency rate fell to below 1%. This is truly outstanding credit performance.
Also, in card, we recently announced our first affinity partnership with Ducks Unlimited, the largest conservation group in the world with more than 600,000 adult members committed to wetlands and waterfowl conservation. This partnership will leverage our leading rewards program and be a nice addition for new account and sales growth.
In student loans, we started offering a new fixed-rate private student loan product. This new fixed-rate loan product provides predictability with a set interest rate for the life of the loan. Discover's fixed-rate private student loans are designed to have rates comparable to federal unsubsidized Stafford and PLUS Loans for qualifying students without the upfront origination fees of up to 4%. It is too early to tell how much long-term growth will come from this offering as it has been in the market for less than a month, but the early signs from customers and school financial aid officers are positive.
The third new product that we just started marketing is residential mortgages under the Discover Home Loans brand. On June 6, we start -- we closed on the acquisition of the Home Loan Center business from Tree.com. The platform we acquired had a seasoned -- has a seasoned management team, approximately 750 employees and a technology platform that gives us room to expand in the future.
We are originating prime, fixed- and variable-rate, conventional and FHA loans, which will be sold to the secondary market with servicing released. Home Loans is a product our customers have been asking Discover for, and the mortgage business is a natural extension of our Direct Banking strategy.
We are entering this market in a sensible way, having acquired a platform at low-cost without the complexities of MSRs or legacy assets. After we launch the checking product later this year, I believe we will have achieved another key milestone toward building a full suite of Direct Banking products.
In Payments, PULSE growth was up 14% over the prior year to an all-time record of $42 billion. As we have discussed previously, PULSE added 129 new relationships in 2011. However, merchant and acquirer routing discussions are still in process, and competitors' pricing changes are still being implemented in the market.
We continue to remain concerned about one competitor's actions in the market, but that being said, I am pleased with how our PULSE team has responded. In summary, credit performance continues to be exceptional, but we continue to expect that we must be at or near the bottom. We are launching new products which will position us for revenue and asset growth in the future, and we are deploying capital in a thoughtful, meaningful way.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to review our second quarter results."

I'll begin my comments by focusing on our Direct Banking segment's second quarter results. The segment earned $820 million pretax this quarter versus $883 million last year. Yield on the card portfolio declined 2",1416,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my comments by focusing on our Direct Banking segment's second quarter results. The segment earned $820 million pretax this quarter versus $883 million last year. Yield on the card portfolio declined 22 basis points from the prior year to 12.35%. We continue to see our APR mix move away from higher APR balances but at a slower pace than we expected. And our promotional volumes increased over the prior year.
These were partially offset by lower interest charge-offs. Sequentially, card yield increased 14 basis points as we saw higher revolve rate in our merchandise balances and as we continue to benefit from lower accrued interest charge-offs.
Total portfolio yield was 11.55%, lower by 38 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year, driven primarily by the acquisition of the additional private student loan portfolio in the fourth quarter, as well as the current yield compression that I just mentioned. I'll remind you that while private student loans have lower yields than cards and personal loans, they also have lower charge-off rates and operating expenses.
The yield compression was slightly offset by the sale of our remaining federal student loans in the first quarter of this year.
Net interest income increased $122 million or 10% versus the prior year, driven by asset growth, the benefit of lower interest expense on our funding and lower charge-offs of accrued interest. Net interest margin on receivables was up 16 basis points to 9.31% compared to the prior year due to lower charge-offs of accrued interest and continued funding cost improvement. In fact, funding costs are down 50 basis points versus the prior year to 2.41% as a percentage of average receivables. This was partially offset by card yield compression and growth in lower-yielding private student loans.
The sequential increase in net interest margin of 28 basis points was primarily driven by yield expansion across all assets and lower funding costs. We expect the net interest margin to stabilize around the current level for the remainder of the year, primarily as result of card yield holding up better than expected.
Other income for the Direct Banking segment decreased $21 million from last year's second quarter as a result of lower late fees, lower transition services revenue related to the Student Loan Corporation and a decline in protection products revenue. The largest component of other income, discount and interchange revenue, was up compared to the prior year, but offset by higher rewards as we modestly increased our rewards rate on card sales to 95 basis points.
Rewards should be in this area for the remainder of the year as we continue to invest in our program to drive profitable sales growth and feel this is the right level in this environment.
Total operating expenses for the segment were up $108 million from the prior year or 18%. This growth was primarily due to a $71 million increase in legal reserve expenses over the prior year as we added $90 million to the reserve in the quarter. Excluding the increase in legal reserve expenses, operating expenses would have been up 6% compared to the prior year, which was essentially in line with revenue growth and would imply flat operating leverage.
For the second half of the year, we do expect marketing and business development expenses to increase relating to the timing of some marketing campaigns. The acquisition of the Home Loan Center platform and launch of Discover Home Loans will also raise operating expenses by about $35 million a quarter. But with the new product launch, there will also be fee revenue.
Now I'll switch to lending product growth and credit performance for the segment. We achieved card sales growth of 5% for the second quarter versus the prior year. The growth in card sales was driven by our continued focus on increasing our merchant acceptance, enriching our rewards programs and leveraging our marketing investments. Lower year-over-year increases in gas prices, as well as more difficult comps resulted in slightly lower card sales growth than in the prior quarter year-over-year increase.
Our total loan portfolio grew $4.5 billion, with $2.4 billion of this growth attributable to the accretive private student loan acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year. Credit card loans were up $1.6 billion and personal loan receivables were up $703 million from the prior year.
Turning to card credit quality, our positive momentum continued this quarter as the net charge-off rate declined 28 basis points versus the prior quarter and the 30-plus delinquency rate declined 31 basis points sequentially. The card reserve rate decreased 32 basis points as well, which resulted in a $122 million card reserve release. In private student loans, the net principal charge-off rate, excluding our purchased portfolios, was 67 basis points. The charge-offs in delinquencies in our private student loan portfolio are performing according to our expectations and will continue to rise slightly as the portfolio seasons.
In terms of personal loan credit performance, loans greater than 30 days past due fell 2 basis points sequentially. And the personal loan net principal charge-off rate was down 35 basis points. The improvement can be attributed to portfolio growth and risk initiatives. We continue to focus on thoughtful, measured growth in this asset class by leveraging our established underwriting competencies. 
Shifting to the Payment side, we had another quarter of strong pretax earnings and Payment volumes. Pretax income was up $4 million, or 10% from the prior year, to $47 million, driven by higher-margin point-of-sale volume from our PULSE PIN debit network business and third-party issuing volume. Higher contra revenues had an offsetting impact as incentives paid for transaction routing preference increased from the prior year. Volumes were up 12% against the prior year, driven by 14% growth in PULSE and 19% growth in our Discover Network third-party issuing volumes, offset partly by Diners Club performance.
Let's move on to liquidity, funding and capital. Our liquidity levels remain strong, with total available liquidity of $27.6 billion at the end of the quarter. Our on balance sheet liquidity portfolio ended the quarter at $11.3 billion, up $2.6 billion from the prior year but down from the end of the first quarter. As you may recall, at the end of the first quarter, we had prefunded a large volume of second quarter maturities. While direct-to-consumer deposits continue to be our largest source of funding, we remain opportunistic across all of our funding channels. During the quarter, we completed an unsecured debt exchange through which we traded approximately 80% or $322 million of our 10.25% senior notes due in 2019 for a new 5.2% senior notes due in 2022. While the exchange offer had a slightly negative impact on results for the quarter, it will deliver a pretax benefit of approximately $8 million per year over the coming years.
Additionally, we completed a 2-tranche ABS transaction after the quarter closed. The deal included a 3-year, $800 million tranche priced at a fixed coupon of 86 basis points and a $650 million 5-year floating rate tranche priced at one month LIBOR plus 37 basis points.
Turning to capital, we ended the quarter with a 14% Tier 1 common ratio, slightly lower than last quarter as we repurchased nearly $450 million worth of shares in the quarter. These buybacks included the completion of our previously disclosed $250 million accelerated share repurchase program.
With that, let me conclude with a few final comments. In the second quarter, credit improvement and strong revenue growth, paired with controlled operating expense growth, generated strong earnings. We are continuing to invest in our business through new products and global acceptance and believe these investments position us well for the future. We're continuing to return capital to shareholders with more than 2% of our shares repurchased last quarter and a $0.10 per share dividend which we've committed to revisit at least annually. Before opening up to questions, I want to take a moment to formally announce and congratulate Bill Franklin on his recent promotion to Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. I think most of you had the chance to interact with Bill, as he's been a key part of our IR team over the past several years. His knowledge of the company and the function made him a logical choice to take the helm of our program.
That concludes our formal remarks. So now I'll turn the call back to the operator to open up for Q&A."

But with respect to the legal reserve matter, I think the matter is not resolved. We are engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the CFPB and the FDIC, and we hope we can resolve it soon. It's a constructive dialogue. We obviously reserve in accordance with GAAP, and the reserve is set based on probable and estimable loss contingencies. So I think beyond that, I'd just point you to the back of the disclosures in our first quarter 10-Q as they contain a pretty fulsome discussion of the significant matters. But given that it's an ongoing investigation, that's really about all we can say. With respect to the buybacks, I would say that there -- the $450 million probably included a little bit of catch-up activity from being dark in the market in the first quarter while we went through the capital planning process. I'd still remain pretty confident in my guidance, but over the course of fiscal 2012, we'll probably use a little bit north of half of that authorization is probably the right way to think about it. So that should give you some sense in terms of how to think about sizing, what our thoughts are right now. That's obviously our current thought.

But that notwithstanding, we do see some absolute limits to how low these things can go. So we tend to think about being somewhere near the bottom in the improvement.

That growth being driven though not by a turn in the credit environment, that growth being driven simply by loan growth. So provision for growth being the key issue there.

So that would be the general thought process I'd have you think about there. The other thing I would say in response to managing accretion going forward, I think yes, the right way to think about this very much is that I think we returned a little bit north of 90% roughly in terms of total payout this quarter, which I think is pretty high. Clearly, the goal at this point in time while we're in this period of, obviously, very strong earnings, at the very least, mitigate further accretion on that capital line.

Going forward, I mentioned 3 new product areas that each, I think, have an opportunity to continue and in some cases, maybe accelerate our growth, ranging from the first affinity program, which we think will be a good opportunity in cards. That space, that affinity space, has changed dramatically in the last few years.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before the market opened, we reported quarterly earnings of $627 million or $1.21 per share, driven by continued improvements in credit, robust loan growth and share purchases. During the",565,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before the market opened, we reported quarterly earnings of $627 million or $1.21 per share, driven by continued improvements in credit, robust loan growth and share purchases. During the quarter, we generated a return on equity of 28% and returned approximately $400 million of capital to shareholders through share purchases and dividends. 
Before I further discuss our third quarter, let me first acknowledge that during the past week, we entered into a consent order with the FDIC and CFPB regarding the previously disclosed matters related to the telephone marketing practices of certain credit protection products. We agreed to provide refunds of approximately $200 million to cardholders who bought the products from December 2007 to August 2011 and to enhance our marketing practices. We will also pay an additional $14 million in saving monetary penalties. I am pleased that the settlement has been concluded. All of us at Discover are committed to doing the right thing for our customers.
Now let's talk about our third quarter performance. We achieved strong growth of the prior year as revenues were up 10% and total receivables grew 9%. Credit quality continued to improve for our Card business, which once again realized historic lows for the over 30-day delinquency and principal charge-off rates. Another achievement during the quarter was an all-time high level of active merchants generating Discover card sales, a direct consequence of our acceptance and awareness initiatives.  Discover year-over-year sales growth moderated somewhat over the prior quarter, in line with the movements in lower consumer confidence. August however, was the strongest month in the quarter, and one thing I am particularly pleased with isn't that time when revolving debt for the industry is roughly flat over last year, we grew our card receivables by 4%. We also continued to grow private student and personal loans, which we expect will offer similar enormous returns to card.
In addition to growing our loan portfolio, we are executing on our strategy to be the leading Direct Banking and Payments company with the launch of Discover Home Loans in June. Acquiring the assets of Home Loan Center from Tree.com allowed us to enter the Mortgage business with the low-cost acquisition and then originate and self model. During the first 100 days after launch we originated approximately $1 billion in mortgages through this platform.
Our Payments business continues to leverage existing assets in unique ways and build upon acceptance achievements. We have created momentum and established ourselves as a flexible partner in the evolving Payments landscape. For instance, in the U.S., we will bring PayPal to the physical point-of-sale at millions of merchant locations currently accepting Discover. Over the next few quarters, we will be working hard to accommodate PayPal's launch.
On the international front, Diners Club added Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which is the largest Chinese credit card issuer as a franchisee. Also we've recently extended our existing relationship with Russian Standard Bank, the largest Russian credit card issuer, which will now issue and promote Discover-branded cards in Russia. This is the second Discover card agreement outside of the U.S.
We are pleased with the results this quarter, particularly with the momentum we have created to our new payments in Direct Banking initiatives, as well as our card sales receivables growth. Now I'll turn the call over to Mark."

I'll begin my comments this morning by focusing on the Direct Banking segment which are $963 million pretax this quarter versus $1 billion last year. Net interest income increased $133 million or 11% over the pri",1021,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my comments this morning by focusing on the Direct Banking segment which are $963 million pretax this quarter versus $1 billion last year. Net interest income increased $133 million or 11% over the prior year driven by asset growth and a higher net interest margin, which was 18 basis points higher than the prior year at 9.44%.
Lower funding costs and lower card charge-offs more than offset asset yield compression of 33 basis points from the prior year. In terms of specifics, card interest yield declines 19 basis points from the prior year to 12.72% due to  more promotional price balances, as well as the decline in higher APR balances. Additionally, total yield was further depressed by the acquisition of lower yields due to loans during the fourth quarter of last year.
I'll remind you that while private student loans do have lower yields, they also have lower charge-offs and operating expenses. 
Interest expense as a percentage of average receivables was down 47 basis points over the prior year's 2.24% due to the continued benefit from refinancing maturing liabilities at lower rates. We expect net interest margin to remain elevated through the end of the year due to slower than expected yield compression and continued benefits from a favorable funding environment.
Other income for the Direct Banking segment was $25 million higher than the prior year mainly due to the inclusion of revenue from Discover Home Loans or mortgage business launched into this year. This product launch also added to expenses, so I'd remind you of our prior commentary that we continue to expect it to remain relatively immaterial to earnings for some time.
Continuing with other income. Our rewards expense up contour revenue item increased 99 basis points on card sales during the quarter. We're comfortable with this level of investment in the current environment and presently expect the rewards rate to be around 1% going forward. Another component of other income protection product revenue, was down from last year and as we've said previously, we expect this line item to continue to decrease over time.
Operating expenses for the Direct Banking segment were up $178 million over the prior year or 29%. This growth was due to a $94 million increase in expenses for legal reserves associated primarily with the recently concluded FDIC and CFPB settlement along with expenses related to the Home Loan Center acquisition, higher marketing expenses and higher headcount.
To put things in context for you, excluding the increase in legal reserves and the expenses associated with the Discover Home Loans, operating leverage would have been flat. Excluding all nonrecurring items, we would expect expenses to increase sequentially for the fourth quarter due to the timing of certain marketing campaigns.
Private student loans, including the $2.4 billion acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year were up $2.9 billion over the prior year. We just completed the peak student loan origination season and we're pleased with the results. Our fixed-rate Student Loan product, which was launched in May, continues to receive strong interest from borrowers.
Credit card loans were up $1.9 billion and personal loans were up $675 million from the prior year. 
Turning to credit. Credit card in delinquency and charge-off rates were once again at historic lows for the quarter. The credit card 30-plus day delinquency rate declined 10 basis points and the net charge-off rate declined 36 basis points sequentially. The over 30-day delinquency rates for student loans increased 26 basis points and the net charge-off rate, excluding purchase credit impaired loans increased 6 basis points from the second quarter. These credit metrics reflect increased seasoning of the organic portfolio. The credit performance of both organic and purchase credit impaired portfolios continue to be in line with our expectations.
The personal loan over 30-day billing when see rate was down 5 basis points and the net charge-off rate for personal loans was down 10 basis points sequentially. The improvement in card delinquencies and the prospects for future credit performance lead to $182 million loan loss reserve release this quarter. 
Turning to the Payment Services segment, pretax profit increased 31% over the prior year to $49 million. Increases in higher margin point-of-sale volume from our PULSE debit network and higher third-party issuing volume were partially offset by global acceptance and Diner's related investments. Segment volumes were up 13% over the prior year, driven by a 17% increase in PULSE volumes and 12% growth in Discover Network's third-party issuing volume. As David mentioned, we recently signed several agreements that should contribute longer-term to volume growth.
Next, I'll touch on liquidity, funding and capital. Our on balance sheet liquidity portfolio ended the quarter at $12.1 billion. Total available liquidity was $29 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion over the prior year quarter. The increase was largely, driven by opportunistic securitization funding that allowed us to pre-fund upcoming maturities. During July, we priced a dual tranche ABS deal consisting of a $1 billion, 7-year fixed-rate tranche with a coupon of 1.67% and a $650 million, 3-year floating-rate tranche priced at 1 month LIBOR plus 20 basis points. We will continue to opportunistically fund our business by tapping all of our available channels.
We ended the quarter with a 13.9% Tier 1 common ratio which was 10 basis points lower than the last quarter as we continue to grow receivables and deploy capital. Let me conclude with some final comments. During the quarter, we generated strong earnings. The credit improvement in the card book, growth in loans and higher net interest margin. The Payments business leveraged our network and acceptance footprint entering into a key service provider relationship with PayPal. We also expanded our Direct Banking product suite by launching Discover Home Loans. And lastly we continue to deploy capital by repurchasing over 4% of our shares in the last 2 quarters and have $1.2 billion remaining under our existing share repurchases program. 
That concludes our formal remarks this morning. So now I'll turn the call back over to were operator, Sandra, to open things up for questions and answers."

And you've seen us execute that strategy with a number of foreign networks over -- ranging from the Japanese, Chinese, Koreans to open up our network to their cardholder base and to provide full acceptance across the U.S. for them. And so one way to think about is, is PayPal is entirely consistent with that. It is different because they have a huge customer base and they are very big online and they're uniquely focused, and uniquely positioned. So there would be -- I don't think there will be any deal exactly like this one because no one else is positioned as uniquely and in some place cases, as well as PayPal because, to some degree, a lot of people are talking about wallets the stays in getting into it but they've been on it a lot of time they've been had a huge customer base volume online. We're opening of the offline to them and doing them way that is backward compatible with existing terminals and future ready for all of the new technologies that we will deployed at the point-of-sale. So I expect us to continue executing that strategy. We're very focused and excited about PayPal. But we will also continue to do different kinds of deals with multiple other parties over time."

And the other thing I would say is that there's a lot of things besides just sales that go in to the loan growth and as an example, this very low level of charge-off rate that we are experiencing means it helps support the loan growth beyond what it would be in the time of higher charge-offs. And Payment rates impact as do promotional rates balances."

We are well below that and see meaningful room to increase our dividend over time. I would say that the repurchases would make up the remainder. We clearly don't have any intention of continuing to run at a 14% Tier 1 common ratio over the long haul. And I think we've got $1.2 billion remaining under the current repurchase authorization. I think we've kind of provided guidance earlier that we'd expect we would use over half of that $2 billion authorization over the remainder of our fiscal year. So I would say that still probably a good guidance at this point in time given where we sit right now absent anything popping up or changing.

Before the market opened, we reported quarterly earnings of $627 million or $1.21 per share, driven by continued improvements in credit, robust loan growth and share repurchases. During t",568,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before the market opened, we reported quarterly earnings of $627 million or $1.21 per share, driven by continued improvements in credit, robust loan growth and share repurchases. During the quarter, we generated a return on equity of 28% and returned approximately $400 million of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Before I further discuss our third quarter, let me first acknowledge that during the past week, we entered into a consent order with the FDIC and CFPB regarding the previously disclosed matters related to the telephone marketing practices of certain credit protection products. We agreed to provide refunds of approximately $200 million to cardholders who bought the products from December 2007 to August 2011 and to enhance our marketing practices. We will also pay an additional $14 million in civil monetary penalties. I am pleased that this settlement has been concluded. All of us at Discover are committed to doing the right thing for our customers.
Now let's talk about our third quarter performance. We achieved strong growth over the prior year as revenues were up 10% and total receivables grew 9%. Credit quality continued to improve for our card business, which, once again, realized historic lows for the over 30-day delinquency and principal charge-off rates. Another achievement during the quarter was an all-time high level of active merchants generating Discover card sales, a direct consequence of our acceptance and awareness initiatives.  
Discover year-over-year sales growth moderated somewhat over the prior quarter, in line with the movements in lower consumer confidence. August, however, was the strongest month in the quarter, and one thing I am particularly pleased with is that at a time when revolving debt for the industry is roughly flat over last year, we grew our card receivables by 4%. We also continued to grow private student and personal loans, which we expect will offer similar normalized returns to card.
In addition to growing our loan portfolio, we are executing on our strategy to be the leading direct banking and payments company with the launch of Discover Home Loans in June. Acquiring the assets of Home Loan Center from Tree.com allowed us to enter the mortgage business with a low-cost acquisition and an originate and sell model. During the first 100 days after launch, we originated approximately $1 billion in mortgages through this platform.
Our payments business continues to leverage existing assets in unique ways and build upon acceptance achievements. We have created momentum and established ourselves as a flexible partner in the evolving payments landscape. For instance, in the U.S., we will bring PayPal to the physical point-of-sale at millions of merchant locations currently accepting Discover. Over the next few quarters, we will be working hard to accommodate PayPal's launch.
On the international front, Diners Club added Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which is the largest Chinese credit card issuer, as a franchisee. Also, we've recently extended our existing relationship with Russian Standard Bank, the largest Russian credit card issuer, which will now issue and promote Discover-branded cards in Russia. This is the second Discover card agreement outside of the U.S.
We are pleased with our results this quarter, particularly with the momentum we have created to our new payments and direct banking initiatives, as well as our card sales and receivables growth. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Mark."
3695566,217034958,361371,"Discover Financial Services, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Sep 27, 2012",2012-09-27,"Earnings Calls","Discover Financial Services","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. I will begin my comments this morning by focusing on the Direct Banking segment, which are $963 million pretax this quarter versus $1 billion last year. Net interest income increased $133 million or 11% over the",1024,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. I will begin my comments this morning by focusing on the Direct Banking segment, which are $963 million pretax this quarter versus $1 billion last year. Net interest income increased $133 million or 11% over the prior year, driven by asset growth and a higher net interest margin, which was 18 basis points higher than the prior year at 9.44%.
Lower funding costs and lower card charge-offs more than offset asset yield compression of 33 basis points from the prior year. In terms of specifics, card interest yield declined 19 basis points from the prior year to 12.27% due to more promotional price balances, as well as a decline in higher APR balances. Additionally, total yield was further depressed by the acquisition of lower yields student loans during the fourth quarter of last year. I will remind you that while private student loans do have lower yields, they also have lower charge-offs and operating expenses. 
Interest expense as a percentage of average receivables was down 47 basis points over the prior year to 2.24% due to the continued benefit from refinancing maturing liabilities at lower rates. We expect net interest margin to remain elevated through the end of the year due to slower-than-expected yield compression and continued benefits from a favorable funding environment.
Other income for the Direct Banking segment was $25 million higher than the prior year mainly due to the inclusion of revenue from Discover Home Loans, our mortgage business launched in June of this year. This product launch also added to expenses, so I would remind you of our prior commentary that we continue expect -- to expect it to remain relatively immaterial to earnings for some time.
Continuing with other income. Our rewards expense, a contra revenue item, increased to 99 basis points on card sales during the quarter. We're comfortable with this level of investment in the current environment and presently expect the rewards rate to be around 1% going forward. Another component of other income, protection product revenue, was down from last year, and as we've said previously, we expect this line item to continue to decrease over time.
Operating expenses for the Direct Banking segment were up $178 million over the prior year or 29%. This growth was due to a $94 million increase in expenses for legal reserves associated primarily with the recently concluded FDIC and CFPB settlement, along with expenses related to the Home Loan Center acquisition, higher marketing expenses and higher headcount. To put things in context for you, excluding the increase in legal reserves and the expenses associated with Discover Home Loans, operating leverage would have been flat. Excluding all nonrecurring items, we would expect expenses to increase sequentially for the fourth quarter due to the timing of certain marketing campaigns.
Private student loans, including the $2.4 billion acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year, were up $2.9 billion over the prior year. We just completed the peak student loan origination season, and we're pleased with the results. Our fixed-rate student loan product, which was launched in May, continues to receive strong interest from borrowers. Credit card loans were up $1.9 billion, and personal loans were up $675 million from the prior year. 
Turning to credit. Credit card delinquency and charge-off rates were, once again, at historic lows for the quarter. The credit card 30-plus day delinquency rate declined 10 basis points and the net charge-off rate declined 36 basis points sequentially. The over 30-day delinquency rates for student loans increased 26 basis points and the net charge-off rate, excluding purchase credit impaired loans, increased 6 basis points from the second quarter. These credit metrics reflect increased seasoning of the organic portfolio. The credit performance of both our organic and the purchase credit impaired portfolios continues to be in line with our expectations.
The personal loan over 30-day delinquency rate was down 5 basis points and the net charge-off rate for personal loans was down 10 basis points sequentially. The improvement in card delinquencies and the prospects for future credit performance led to a $182 million loan loss reserve release this quarter. 
Turning to the Payment Services segment. Pretax profit increased 31% over the prior year to $49 million. Increases in higher margin point-of-sale volume for our PULSE PIN debit network and higher third-party issuing volume were partially offset by global acceptance- and Diners-related investments. Segment volumes were up 13% over the prior year, driven by a 17% increase in PULSE volumes and 12% growth in Discover Network third-party issuing volume. As David mentioned, we recently signed several agreements that should contribute, longer term, to volume growth.
Next, I'll touch on liquidity, funding and capital. Our on-balance-sheet liquidity portfolio ended the quarter at $12.1 billion. Total available liquidity was $29 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion over the prior quarter. The increase was largely driven by opportunistic securitization funding that allowed us to prefund upcoming maturities. 
During July, we priced a dual-tranche ABS deal consisting of a $1 billion 7-year fixed-rate tranche, with a coupon of 1.67%; and a $650 million 3-year floating-rate tranche, priced at 1 month LIBOR plus 20 basis points. We will continue to opportunistically fund our business by tapping all of our available channels. We ended the quarter with a 13.9% Tier 1 common ratio, which was 10 basis points lower than the last quarter, as we continue to grow receivables and deploy capital. 
Let me conclude with some final comments. During the quarter, we generated strong earnings through continued credit improvement in the card book, growth in loans and higher net interest margin. The Payments business leveraged our network and acceptance footprint to enter into a key service provider relationship with PayPal. We also expanded our Direct Banking product suite by launching Discover Home Loans.

And you've seen us execute that strategy with a number of foreign networks over -- ranging from the Japanese, Chinese, Koreans, to open up our network to their cardholder base and to provide full acceptance across the U.S. for them. And so one way to think about this is PayPal is entirely consistent with that. It is different because they have a huge customer base and they are very big online and they're uniquely focused and uniquely positioned. So there won't be -- I don't think there will be any deal exactly like this one because no one else is positioned as uniquely, and in some cases, as well as PayPal because, to some degree, a lot of people are talking about wallets these days and getting into it, but they've been in a long time. They've enhanced it and they've got a huge customer base, huge volume online. We're opening up the offline to them and doing it in a way that is backward-compatible with existing terminals and future-ready for all the new technologies that will be deployed at the point of sale. So I expect us to continue executing that strategy. We're very focused and excited about PayPal. But we will also continue to do different kinds of deals with multiple other parties over time."

In terms of the net interchange revenue line item that you noted, I think that's probably a pretty good way to think about things and about one of the metrics we use look at things. I would say any of the enhancements we make, we look at the NPV of those enhancements to the products to make sure that they're in the best interest of shareholders over the long haul with all the puts and takes. And I would expect that, that 1% guidance would result in that net interchange line being roughly flat going forward. It may bounce a basis point or 2 here or there due to some fluctuations in the market or in the actual product offerings quarter-over-quarter, but that's probably a pretty good metric to keep your eye on."

I would say it could be partly a sign that the deleveraging trend that we've seen may have run its course and there may be less of a difference between sales and loan growth over time, which is not necessarily a bad thing given that most of the income in cards does come from loans versus sales.

But with that as the backdrop, I think they have sent a pretty clear signal that 30% dividend payout ratios are kind of the maximum that they're looking at in terms of dividends. We are well below that and see meaningful room to increase our dividend over time. I would say that the repurchases would make up the remainder. We clearly don't have any intention of continuing to run at a 14% Tier 1 common ratio over the long haul. And I think we've got $1.2 billion remaining under the current repurchase authorization. I think we've kind of provided guidance earlier that we'd expect we would use over half of that $2 billion authorization over the remainder of our fiscal year. So I would say that's still probably good guidance at this point in time given where we sit right now, absent anything popping up or changing. But over the long term, as we move forward, I think we are going to continue to look for opportunities to deploy and/or return that capital in our shareholders' best interest."

We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Our call this morning will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before the market opened, we reported quarterly earnings of $627 million or $1.21 per share, driven by continued improvements in credit, robust loan growth and share repurchases. During t",568,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before the market opened, we reported quarterly earnings of $627 million or $1.21 per share, driven by continued improvements in credit, robust loan growth and share repurchases. During the quarter, we generated a return on equity of 28% and returned approximately $400 million of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Before I further discuss our third quarter, let me first acknowledge that during the past week, we entered into a consent order with the FDIC and CFPB regarding the previously disclosed matters related to the telephone marketing practices of certain credit protection products. We agreed to provide refunds of approximately $200 million to cardholders who bought the products from December 2007 to August 2011 and to enhance our marketing practices. We will also pay an additional $14 million in civil monetary penalties. I am pleased that this settlement has been concluded. All of us at Discover are committed to doing the right thing for our customers.
Now let's talk about our third quarter performance. We achieved strong growth over the prior year as revenues were up 10% and total receivables grew 9%. Credit quality continued to improve for our card business, which, once again, realized historic lows for the over 30-day delinquency and principal charge-off rates. Another achievement during the quarter was an all-time high level of active merchants generating Discover Card sales, a direct consequence of our acceptance and awareness initiatives.  
Discover year-over-year sales growth moderated somewhat over the prior quarter, in line with the movements in lower consumer confidence. August, however, was the strongest month in the quarter, and one thing I am particularly pleased with is that at a time when revolving debt for the industry is roughly flat over last year, we grew our card receivables by 4%. We also continued to grow private student and personal loans, which we expect will offer similar normalized returns to card.
In addition to growing our loan portfolio, we are executing on our strategy to be the leading direct banking and payments company with the launch of Discover Home Loans in June. Acquiring the assets of Home Loan Center from Tree.com allowed us to enter the mortgage business with a low-cost acquisition and an originate and sell model. During the first 100 days after launch, we originated approximately $1 billion in mortgages through this platform.
Our payments business continues to leverage existing assets in unique ways and build upon acceptance achievements. We have created momentum and established ourselves as a flexible partner in the evolving payments landscape. For instance, in the U.S., we will bring PayPal to the physical point-of-sale at millions of merchant locations currently accepting Discover. Over the next few quarters, we will be working hard to accommodate PayPal's launch.
On the international front, Diners Club added Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which is the largest Chinese credit card issuer, as a franchisee. Also, we've recently extended our existing relationship with Russian Standard Bank, the largest Russian credit card issuer, which will now issue and promote Discover-branded cards in Russia. This is the second Discover card agreement outside of the U.S.
We are pleased with our results this quarter, particularly with the momentum we have created through our new payments and direct banking initiatives, as well as our card sales and receivables growth. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Mark."

I will begin my comments this morning by focusing on the Direct Banking segment, which earned $963 million pretax this quarter versus $1 billion last year. Net interest income increased $133 million or 11% over t",1025,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. I will begin my comments this morning by focusing on the Direct Banking segment, which earned $963 million pretax this quarter versus $1 billion last year. Net interest income increased $133 million or 11% over the prior year, driven by asset growth and a higher net interest margin, which was 18 basis points higher than the prior year at 9.44%.
Lower funding costs and lower card charge-offs more than offset asset yield compression of 33 basis points from the prior year. In terms of specifics, card interest yield declined 19 basis points from the prior year to 12.27% due to more promotional price balances, as well as a decline in higher APR balances. Additionally, total yield was further depressed by the acquisition of lower yield student loans during the fourth quarter of last year. I will remind you that while private student loans do have lower yields, they also have lower charge-offs and operating expenses. 
Interest expense as a percentage of average receivables was down 47 basis points over the prior year to 2.24% due to the continued benefit from refinancing maturing liabilities at lower rates. We expect net interest margin to remain elevated through the end of the year due to slower-than-expected yield compression and continued benefits from a favorable funding environment.
Other income for the Direct Banking segment was $25 million higher than the prior year mainly due to the inclusion of revenue from Discover Home Loans, our mortgage business launched in June of this year. This product launch also added to expenses, so I would remind you of our prior commentary that we continue expect -- to expect it to remain relatively immaterial to earnings for some time.
Continuing with other income. Our rewards expense, a contra revenue item, increased to 99 basis points on card sales during the quarter. We're comfortable with this level of investment in the current environment and presently expect the rewards rate to be around 1% going forward. Another component of other income, protection product revenue, was down from last year, and as we've said previously, we expect this line item to continue to decrease over time.
Operating expenses for the Direct Banking segment were up $178 million over the prior year or 29%. This growth was due to a $94 million increase in expenses for legal reserves associated primarily with the recently concluded FDIC and CFPB settlement, along with expenses related to the Home Loan Center acquisition, higher marketing expenses and higher headcount. To put things in context for you, excluding the increase in legal reserves and the expenses associated with Discover Home Loans, operating leverage would have been flat. Excluding all nonrecurring items, we would expect expenses to increase sequentially for the fourth quarter due to the timing of certain marketing campaigns.
Private student loans, including the $2.4 billion acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year, were up $2.9 billion over the prior year. We just completed the peak student loan origination season, and we're pleased with the results. Our fixed-rate student loan product, which was launched in May, continues to receive strong interest from borrowers. Credit card loans were up $1.9 billion, and personal loans were up $675 million from the prior year. 
Turning to credit. Credit card delinquency and charge-off rates were, once again, at historic lows for the quarter. The credit card 30-plus day delinquency rate declined 10 basis points and the net charge-off rate declined 36 basis points sequentially. The over 30-day delinquency rates for student loans increased 26 basis points and the net charge-off rate, excluding purchase credit impaired loans, increased 6 basis points from the second quarter. These credit metrics reflect increased seasoning of the organic portfolio. The credit performance of both our organic and the purchase credit impaired portfolios continues to be in line with our expectations.
The personal loan over 30-day delinquency rate was down 5 basis points and the net charge-off rate for personal loans was down 10 basis points sequentially. The improvement in card delinquencies and the prospects for future credit performance led to a $182 million loan loss reserve release this quarter. 
Turning to the Payment Services segment. Pretax profit increased 31% over the prior year to $49 million. Increases in higher margin point-of-sale volume for our PULSE PIN debit network and higher third-party issuing volume were partially offset by global acceptance- and Diners-related investments. Segment volumes were up 13% over the prior year, driven by a 17% increase in PULSE volumes and 12% growth in Discover Network third-party issuing volume. As David mentioned, we recently signed several agreements that should contribute, longer term, to volume growth.
Next, I'll touch on liquidity, funding and capital. Our on-balance-sheet liquidity portfolio ended the quarter at $12.1 billion. Total available liquidity was $29 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion over the prior quarter. The increase was largely driven by opportunistic securitization funding that allowed us to prefund upcoming maturities. 
During July, we priced a dual-tranche ABS deal consisting of a $1 billion 7-year fixed-rate tranche, with a coupon of 1.67%; and a $650 million 3-year floating-rate tranche, priced at 1 month LIBOR plus 20 basis points. We will continue to opportunistically fund our business by tapping all of our available channels. We ended the quarter with a 13.9% Tier 1 common ratio, which was 10 basis points lower than the last quarter, as we continue to grow receivables and deploy capital. 
Let me conclude with some final comments. During the quarter, we generated strong earnings through continued credit improvement in the card book, growth in loans and a higher net interest margin. The Payments business leveraged our network and acceptance footprint to enter into a key service provider relationship with PayPal. We also expanded our Direct Banking product suite by launching Discover Home Loans. And lastly, we continue to deploy capital by repurchasing over 4% of our shares in the last 2 quarters and have $1.2 billion remaining under our existing share repurchase program. 
That concludes our formal remarks this morning. So now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Sandra, to open things up for questions and answers."

And you've seen us execute that strategy with a number of foreign networks over -- ranging from the Japanese, Chinese, Koreans, to open up our network to their cardholder base and to provide full acceptance across the U.S. for them. And so one way to think about this is PayPal is entirely consistent with that. It is different because they have a huge customer base and they are very big online and they're uniquely focused and uniquely positioned. So there won't be -- I don't think there will be any deal exactly like this one because no one else is positioned as uniquely, and in some cases, as well as PayPal because, to some degree, a lot of people are talking about wallets these days and getting into it, but they've been in it a long time. They've enhanced it and they've got a huge customer base, huge volume online. We're opening up the offline to them and doing it in a way that is backward-compatible with existing terminals and future-ready for all the new technologies that will be deployed at point of sale. So I expect us to continue executing that strategy. We're very focused and excited about PayPal. But we will also continue to do different kinds of deals with multiple other parties over time."

I would say any of the enhancements we make, we look at the NPV of those enhancements to the products to make sure that they're in the best interest of shareholders over the long haul with all the puts and takes. And I would expect that, that 1% guidance would result in that net interchange line being roughly flat going forward. It may bounce a basis point or 2 here or there due to some fluctuations in the market or in the actual product offerings quarter-over-quarter, but that's probably a pretty good metric to keep your eye on."

So we -- I don't think that we're going to see a big upturn in Diners Club until some of those things really start to kick in and we get past, hopefully, some of the headwinds that we see right now. In terms of PULSE, I think that I'm just very pleased with the execution. I think it's pretty consistent with more of how PULSE has executed the last several years. Really, since we bought PULSE, they've managed to gain share in a very competitive environment. I think in terms of Durbin, it's really too early to tell exactly whether that's going to be helpful or hurtful, frankly, given some of VISA's actions that we've been on record that we're concerned about and that the DOJ is looking into."

I guess what I'd say in respect to that is just preface the comment by reminding everybody, not that you need a reminding, but I just feel I have to do it, that we now have to get any capital actions approved on an annual basis, if you will, as part of the CCAR capital process with the Federal Reserve. But with that as the backdrop, I think they have sent a pretty clear signal that 30% dividend payout ratios are kind of the maximum that they're looking at in terms of dividends. We are well below that and see meaningful room to increase our dividend over time. I would say that the repurchases would make up the remainder. We clearly don't have any intention of continuing to run at a 14% Tier 1 common ratio over the long haul. And I think we've got $1.2 billion remaining under that current repurchase authorization. I think we've kind of provided guidance earlier that we'd expect we would use over half of that $2 billion authorization over the remainder of our fiscal year. So I would say that's still probably good guidance at this point in time given where we sit right now, absent anything popping up or changing. But over the long term, as we move forward, I think we are going to continue to look for opportunities to deploy and/or return that capital in our shareholders' best interests."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'm going to start off the discussing the fourth quarter and then walk through some highlights of our full year accomplishments. 
Before the market opened, we reported a quarterly diluted earnings per share $1.07, up 13% over the prior year, driven primarily by loan growth and share repurchases. During the quarter, we generated return on equity of 23% and returned approximately 451 million of capital to common shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Our robust results, strong capital position and positive outlook led us to announce 40% increase in our dividend to common shareholders. 
This quarter, we accelerated our organic growth to 6% on total receivables. Card receivables growth for the quarter was the highest in over 5 years driven by spin from the revolver segment of our card base. Our strong receivables and sales results demonstrate effectiveness of our marketing programs, consumers' preference for cash rewards and our acceptance and awareness initiatives. 
For the fourth quarter, our noncard assets, specifically our personal and private student loans, achieved a combined 11% year-over-year growth as broadened marketing and added new schools and a fixed-rate product on student loans earlier in the year. Our payments segment experienced 13% year-over-year purchase volume growth driven largely by PULSE. Volume processed on our networks achieved an all-time high for the fourth quarter. 
We also increased our level of investment to drive future growth and achieve the full potential of our Direct Banking and payment strategy. Important new initiatives included new domestic and global payments partners; a new core banking system; our first checking product, which we expect the launch in early 2013; and Discover It, our new credit card product that is testing successfully in select markets and will be launched nationally next month. 
Our card net charge-off rate set another record low but our over-30-day delinquency rate ticked up slightly due to seasonality. While the continued improvement in credit appears to be nearing an end, we don't believe we are -- are at the point were charge-offs are poised to rise significantly. 
Now, I'd like to share some thoughts how we performed against our 2012 priorities. We had 2 principal priorities for our Direct Banking segment. First, we wanted to build on the momentum from 2011 and grow card sales and receivables. Second, we wanted to grow our noncard product offerings. During the year, successfully grew card sales and receivables in a challenging environment by increasing our market wallet share and achieving double-digit new account growth. We increased customer engagement for our rewards programs, marketing initiatives and by expanding online and mobile capabilities. increased merchant participation in our rewards program, which also enhanced the value for our card members.  For the full year, card receivables grew by $3 billion or 6%. 
In our Direct Banking segment, we grew noncard assets and launched new products, including home loans and student loans focused and graduate and professional programs. By leveraging our expertise in unsecured underwriting and maintaining customer-centric focus, we disbursed over $1 billion in private student loans and grew personal loan originations to $1.8 billion. Additionally, we originated over $2 billion in home loans since June. 
In payments, we continue to build a domestic and international acceptance and successfully grew our network volume while dealing with competitive challenges. For the full year, volume for the payments segment grew by 12% and we achieved a record number of active merchants. Further in payments, we positioned ourselves as a flexible and innovative partner for payment solutions with a number of new agreements, domestically with PayPal and internationally with new network and issuer partnerships. 
Lastly, one of our top corporate priorities was to drive shareholder value for effective capital management. During the fiscal year, we returned a little over $1.4 billion through share repurchases and common dividends. 
Our fourth quarter provided a strong finish to a record year. As we enter 2013, I am looking forward to maintaining a momentum in our Direct Banking segment and executing on our recently formed network partnerships as we continue to leverage our network assets. We look forward to providing you with an update on our 2013 priorities in our annual financial community briefing in March. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark."

Let me start by reminding you that as of January 2013, Discover will be converting to a December fiscal year end. We'll provide you with historical calendar year data in early March in advance of our financial community briefing. 
That said, I'll begin my remarks on this quarter's performance starting with a Direct Banking segment, which earned $827 million pretax this quarter versus $776 million last year. Net interest income increased $134 million or 11% over the prior year driven by both asset growth as well as net interest margin, which was 34 basis points higher than the prior year at 9.44%. Lower funding costs and lower interest charge-offs more than offset 70 basis point compression in total asset yield from the prior year. Specifically, card yield declined 20 basis points from prior year to 12.16% due to more promotional balances and a decline in higher rate of default risk balances. Interest expense as a percentage of average receivables was down 49 basis points over the prior year to 2.11%, due to the continued benefit from refinancing maturing liabilities at lower rates. We expect to continue to benefit from this funding cost tailwind through 2013. 
Over the next year, the combination of yield and funding cost trends should keep net interest margin above our long-term target of 8.5% to 9%. However, we do anticipate some compression driven largely by card deals, which will continue to decline. 
Other income for the Direct Banking segment was $50 million higher than the prior year, mainly due to the inclusion of revenue from Discover Home Loans, our mortgage business that we launched in June of this year, as well as a $26 million gain on the sale of a minority investment. The mortgage business was profitable for the quarter. However, I would remind you of my comments from last quarter's call that we continue to expect it to remain relatively immaterial to earnings for some time. 
Continuing with other income, our awards expense, a contra revenue item, increased to 106 basis points in card sales during the quarter due to what was, in retrospect, a richer-than-expected 5% cashback promotion that generated very strong cardmember engagement. We do not expect this elevated rewards rate persist into the calendar first quarter. However, I would point out the current program runs through December. 
Another component of other income, protection product revenue, was down from last year and we continue to expect this line item to decrease over time. During the quarter, we did cease marketing this products to focus implementing changes required by our consent order. We continue to service and maintain product memberships and intend to once again make these products available to new customers next year. 
Operating expenses for the Direct Banking segment were up $114 million over the prior year or 18%. There are several factors contributing to this higher level of expenses. First, we increased employee headcount as well as marketing and other expenses due to the Home Loan acquisition and the launch of our direct mortgage product, which contributed roughly $50 million to expenses in this period.  Second, as evidenced by our strong receivables growth, we believe investments in marketing are bearing fruit in this environment. And as a result, we think the timing is right for us to continue to opportunistically drive new account acquisition and card utilization. Finally, our headcount information processing and professional fee line items grew further, as we laid the groundwork for launching several new products in the coming quarters and added resources to address new regulatory expectations. Some of these initiatives will also result in higher operating expenses next quarter. 
Turning to credit. Sequentially, the credit card 30-plus delinquency rate increased 5 basis points due to seasonality, but the net charge-off rate declined 14 basis points to a new historic low. The over-30-day delinquency rate for student loans decreased 21 basis points and the net charge-off rate, excluding purchase loans, increased 22 basis points from the third quarter. The net charge-off rate reflects increased seasoning of the organic portfolio. We would remind you that portfolio seasons, we will see this rate rise past 1% and come back down over the long term. The credit performance of both our organic and purchase portfolios remains in line with our expectations. 
The personal loan over-30-day delinquency rate was up 2 basis points and the net charge-off rate was up 22 basis points sequentially as the portfolio continued to season. Over the course of the year, we have said that loan growth will eventually lead us to build reserve. This quarter's $38 million reserve build reflects the strong asset growth that we have realized. 
One last thing I want to mention is that effective November 30, the company began including confirmed card transactions as parts of loan in process, which resulted in a $365 million increase to ending card receivables for the fourth quarter. This will have no impact on historic or future income statement items including earnings per share, but will lower some ratios which use average card or total receivable balances in the denominator such as card yield and net interest margin. 
Turning to the Payment Services segment, pretax profit decreased 21% over the prior year to $33 million. The decrease resulted primarily from higher expenses at Diners, which included marketing and incentives related to several new issuing relationships. Expense increases were partially offset by increases in higher margin point of sale volume for our PULSE debit network and higher Network Partners volume. Network Partners is our new name for what we formerly referred to as Third-Party Issuers. We've changed the name to better reflect our strategy of partnering to drive volume growth. However, the compositions of the business has not changed. Segments volumes were up 13% driven by strong increases in PULSE and Network Partners volumes. 
Next, I'll touch on liquidity, funding and capital. Our on balance sheet liquidity portfolio at quarter end was $9.6 billion. Total available liquidity was $27 billion, a decrease of $2.4 billion over the prior quarter. We opportunistically executed a $575 million 6.5% perpetual preferred stock issue and a $500 million debt exchange offer that allowed us to broaden our regulatory capital mix. Also in November, we issued $250 million of 3-year Class B asset-backed securities with a floating-rate coupon of 1 month LIBOR plus 45 basis points. This is Discover's first Class B issuance since 2007. As we have said before, we continue to opportunistically fund our business by accessing all available channels.  We ended the quarter with a 13.6% tier 1 common ratio, which was 30 basis points lower than the last quarter. 
Let me conclude with some full year comments. We achieved record net income in fiscal 2012 due to improvements in credit, loan growth and a higher net interest margin. The payments business leveraged our network and acceptance footprint to achieve record network volume and entered into several key partnerships, which we expect to be drivers of future profitability. Lastly, we continue to deploy capital, as evidenced by today's announced dividend increase to $0.14 as well as our repurchase of over 6% of shares over the course of the past year. 
That concludes our formal remarks. So now I'll turn the call back over to the operator, John, to open things up for Q&A."

And so if you look at the reserving, it's largely due to our loan growth, which I was very pleased to have achieved a 5-year high growth rates, and that leads to more reserving.

On as we've been saying, that growth would at some point in time cause us to begin to build reserves. And the growth in reserves you've seen is a direct result of the growth in loans over the course of the last several years. With respect your expenses question, Sanjay, I would say a couple of different things. I think as we look forward to next year, that $3 billion number is a close number to utilize. It may come in a little bit higher than that would be my general expectation, however. I think in terms of an operating leverage way of looking at things, if we were not investing in a number of these growth investments over the course of the next year, we would be reporting flat operating leverage for 2013. I think we will be slightly below that because of the investments in growth we are making. I think you all understand that when you're investing for organic growth, expenses lead to revenues. But given the ROIs and the opportunities we see in these products, we're very comfortable going ahead in making those investments. With respect to the rewards rate itself, as I said in my prepared remarks, I think the 106 basis point level that you saw in this quarter was higher than we expect it to be, quite honestly. The program was probably too rich in retrospect. But it did drive fabulous cardmember engagement, which is great. I would say going forward, I would expect it to be closer to that 1% level is the right way to think about things. Bill again, I would point out for the month of December, that higher program is still running."

It's certainly have had a regional impact, obviously with timing. We saw some components that changed around of it. For instance, home improvement had been softer before Sandy and post-Sandy. There's been enough rebuilding needs that we've actually seen that component drive higher. So there have been some ins and outs maybe from Sandy, but I think the overall volume, not too affected. I think in terms of fiscal cliff, we don't have a separate plan or, as I've heard some companies have. And we think that -- I don't expect a big impact. I do expect something to get resolved. I think the big wild card is what happens the consumer confidence. And I think as long as consumer confidence doesn't take a big nosedive, I expect sales volume and so on to continue doing just fine. If consumer confidence, for whatever reason, went down significantly, then that's what would probably start affecting sales volume."

If you look at how much everyone pulled back during the financial crisis and very few new accounts were booked, we're now back into a more normal time period. And so as the new accounts that are now being booked start the season, that will tend to increase the loss rate a bit to more normal levels. I'd say a second thing is that as we get further away from the very large spike in charge-off rates, to some degree, people that were close to the edge all recognized in a short period of time. So much like the bankruptcy law changed from a number of years ago where there was a trough afterwards. And it took a few years, but eventually you get back to more normal levels. So I think as we get away from the spike, you're going to eventually start to normalize. And so those are 2 macro factors. Then you start getting back into the normal, unemployment, health care costs, divorces. These are the kinds of things that in prime business tend to drive charge-offs, and you get back to more normal levels of all those kind of life events."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'm going to start off by discussing the fourth quarter and then walk through some highlights of our full year accomplishments. Before the market opened, we reported",725,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'm going to start off by discussing the fourth quarter and then walk through some highlights of our full year accomplishments. 
Before the market opened, we reported a quarterly diluted earnings per share of $1.07, up 13% over the prior year, driven primarily by loan growth and share repurchases. During the quarter, we generated return on equity of 23% and returned approximately $451 million of capital to common shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Our robust results, strong capital position and positive outlook led us to announce a 40% increase in our dividend to common shareholders. 
This quarter, we accelerated our organic growth to 6% on total receivables. Card receivables growth for the quarter was the highest in over 5 years, driven by spin from the revolver segment of our card base. Our strong receivables and sales growth results demonstrate the effectiveness of our marketing programs, consumers' preference for our cash rewards and our acceptance and awareness initiatives. 
For the fourth quarter, our noncard assets, specifically our personal and private student loans, achieved a combined 11% year-over-year growth as we broadened marketing and added new schools and a fixed-rate product in student loans earlier in the year. Our Payments segment experienced 13% year-over-year purchase volume growth, driven largely by PULSE. Volume processed on our networks achieved an all-time high for the fourth quarter. 
We also increased our level of investment to drive future growth and achieved the full potential of our Direct Banking and payment strategy. Important new initiatives included new domestic and global payments partners; a new core banking system; our first checking product, which we expect to launch in early 2013; and Discover It, our new credit card product that is testing successfully in select markets and will be launched nationally next month. 
Our card net charge-off rate set another record low, but our over-30-day delinquency rate ticked up slightly due to seasonality. While the continued improvement in credit appears to be nearing an end, we don't believe we were -- we are at a point were charge-offs are poised to rise significantly. 
Now, I'd like to share some thoughts how we performed against our 2012 priorities. We had 2 principal priorities for our Direct Banking segment. First, we wanted to build on the momentum from 2011 and grow card sales and receivables. Second, we wanted to grow our noncard product offerings. During the year, we successfully grew card sales and receivables in a challenging environment by increasing our marked wallet share and achieving double-digit new account growth. We increased customer engagement through our rewards programs, marketing initiatives and by expanding online and mobile capabilities. We increased merchant participation in our rewards program, which also enhanced the value for our card members.  For the full year, card receivables grew by $3 billion or 6%. 
In our Direct Banking segment, we grew noncard assets and launched new products, including home loans and student loans focused on graduate and professional programs. By leveraging our expertise in unsecured underwriting and maintaining a customer-centric focus, we disbursed over $1 billion in private student loans and grew personal loan originations to $1.8 billion. Additionally, we originated over $2 billion in home loans since June. 
In payments, we continue to build on domestic and international acceptance and successfully grew our network volume while dealing with competitive challenges. For the full year, volume for the Payments segment grew by 12%, and we achieved a record number of active merchants. Further in Payments, we positioned ourselves as a flexible and innovative partner for payment solutions with a number of new agreements, domestically with PayPal and internationally with new network and issuer partnerships. 
Lastly, one of our top corporate priorities was to drive shareholder value through effective capital management. During the fiscal year, we returned a little over $1.4 billion through share repurchases and common dividends. 
Our fourth quarter provided a strong finish to a record year. As we enter 2013, I am looking forward to maintaining the momentum in our Direct Banking segment and executing on our recently formed network partnerships as we continue to leverage our network assets. We look forward to providing you with an update on our 2013 priorities at our annual financial community briefing in March. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark."
3695566,224896182,399388,"Discover Financial Services, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2012",2012-12-20,"Earnings Calls","Discover Financial Services","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone.

Let me start by reminding you that as of January 2013, Discover will be converting to a December fiscal year end. We'll provide you with historical calendar year data in early March in advance of our financial community briefing. 
That said, I'll begin my remarks on this quarter's performance, starting with the Direct Banking segment, which earned $827 million pretax this quarter versus $776 million last year. Net interest income increased $134 million or 11% over the prior year, driven by both asset growth as well as the net interest margin, which was 34 basis points higher than the prior year at 9.44%. Lower funding costs and lower interest charge-offs more than offset 17 basis point compression in total asset yield from the prior year. Specifically, card yield declined 20 basis points from prior year to 12.16%, due to more promotional balances and a decline in higher rate and default priced balances. Interest expense, as a percentage of average receivables, was down 49 basis points over the prior year to 2.11%, due to the continued benefit from refinancing maturing liabilities at lower rates. We expect to continue to benefit from this funding cost tailwind through 2013. 
Over the next year, the combination of yield and funding cost trends should keep net interest margin above our long-term target of 8.5% to 9%. However, we do anticipate some compression, driven largely by card yield, which should continue to decline. 
Other income for the Direct Banking segment was $50 million higher than the prior year, mainly due to the inclusion of revenue from Discover Home Loans, our mortgage business that we launched in June of this year, as well as a $26 million gain on the sale of a minority investment. The mortgage business was profitable for the quarter. However, I would remind you of my comments from last quarter's call that we continue to expect it to remain relatively immaterial to earnings for some time. 
Continuing with other income, our rewards expense, a contra revenue item, increased to 106 basis points on card sales during the quarter, due to what was, in retrospect, a richer-than-expected 5% cashback promotion that generated very strong cardmember engagement. We do not expect this elevated rewards rate to persist into the calendar first quarter. However, I would point out that the current program runs through December. 
Another component of other income, Protection Product revenue, was down from last year, and we continue to expect this line item to decrease over time. During the quarter, we did cease marketing these products to focus on implementing changes required by our consent order. We continue to service and maintain existing product memberships and intend to once again make these products available to new customers next year. 
Operating expenses for the Direct Banking segment were up $114 million over the prior year or 18%. There are several factors contributing to this higher level of expenses. First, we increased employee headcount as well as marketing and other expenses due to the Home Loan acquisition and the launch of our direct mortgage product, which contributed roughly $50 million to expenses in this period.  Second, as evidenced by our strong receivables growth, we believe investments in marketing are bearing fruit in this environment. And as a result, we think the timing is right for us to continue to opportunistically drive new account acquisition and card utilization. Finally, our headcount information processing and professional fee line items grew further, as we laid the groundwork for launching several new products in the coming quarters and added resources to address new regulatory expectations. Some of these initiatives will also result in higher operating expenses next quarter. 
Turning to credit. Sequentially, the credit card 30-plus delinquency rate increased 5 basis points due to seasonality, but the net charge-off rate declined 14 basis points to a new historic low. The over-30-day delinquency rate for student loans decreased 21 basis points and the net charge-off rate, excluding purchase loans, increased 22 basis points from the third quarter. The net charge-off rate reflects increased seasoning of the organic portfolio. We would remind you that as the portfolio seasons, we will see this rate rise past 1% and come back down over the long term. The credit performance of both our organic and purchased portfolios remains in line with our expectations. 
The personal loan over-30-day delinquency rate was up 2 basis points, and the net charge-off rate was up 22 basis points sequentially as the portfolio continued to season. Over the course of the year, we have said that loan growth will eventually lead us to build reserves. This quarter's $38 million reserve build reflects the strong asset growth that we have realized. 
One last thing I want to mention is that effective November 30, the company began including confirmed card transactions as parts of loans in process, which resulted in a $365 million increase to ending card receivables for the fourth quarter. This will have no impact on historic or future income statement items, including earnings per share, but will lower some ratios which use average card or total receivable balances in the denominator such as card yield and net interest margin. 
Turning to the Payment Services segment, pretax profit decreased 21% over the prior year to $33 million. The decrease resulted primarily from higher expenses at Diners, which included marketing and incentives related to several new issuing relationships. Expense increases were partially offset by increases in higher margin point of sale volume for our PULSE debit network and higher Network Partners volume. Network Partners is our new name for what we formerly referred to as Third-Party Issuers. We've changed the name to better reflect our strategy of partnering to drive volume growth. However, the composition of the business has not changed. Segments volumes were up 13% driven by strong increases in PULSE and Network Partners volumes. 
Next, I'll touch on liquidity, funding and capital. Our on balance sheet liquidity portfolio at quarter end was $9.6 billion. Total available liquidity was $27 billion, a decrease of $2.4 billion over the prior quarter. We opportunistically executed a $575 million, 6.5% perpetual preferred stock issue and a $500 million debt exchange offer that allowed us to broaden our regulatory capital mix. Also in November, we issued $250 million of 3-year Class B asset-backed securities with a floating-rate coupon of 1 month LIBOR plus 45 basis points. This is Discover's first Class B issuance since 2007. As we have said before, we'll continue to opportunistically fund our business by accessing all available channels.  We ended the quarter with a 13.6% tier 1 common ratio, which was 30 basis points lower than the last quarter. 
Let me conclude with some full year comments. We achieved record net income in fiscal 2012 due to improvements in credit, loan growth and a higher net interest margin. The payments business leveraged our network and acceptance footprint to achieve record network volume and entered into several key partnerships, which we expect to be drivers of future profitability. Lastly, we continue to deploy capital, as evidenced by today's announced dividend increase to $0.14, as well as our repurchase of over 6% of our shares over the course of the past year. 
That concludes our formal remarks. So now I'll turn the call back to the operator, John, to open things up for Q&A."

And as we've been saying, that growth would, at some point in time, cause us to begin to build reserves. And the growth in reserves you've seen is a direct result of the growth in loans over the course of the last several years. With respect your expenses question, Sanjay, I would say a couple of different things. I think as we look forward to next year, that $3 billion number is a close number to utilize. It may come in a little bit higher than that, would be my general expectation, however. I think in terms of an operating leverage way of looking at things, if we were not investing in a number of these growth investments over the course of the next year, we would be reporting flat operating leverage for 2013. I think we will be slightly below that because of the investments in growth we're making. I think you all understand that when you're investing for organic growth, the expenses lead to revenues. But given the ROIs and the opportunities we see in these products, we're very comfortable going ahead in making those investments. With respect to the rewards rate itself, as I said in my prepared remarks, I think the 106 basis point level that you saw in this quarter was higher than we expected it to be, quite honestly. That program was probably a little bit too rich, in retrospect. But it did drive fabulous cardmember engagement, which is great. I would say, going forward, I would expect it to be closer to that 1% level is the right way to think about things. Though again, I would point out for the month of December, that higher program is still running."

There's been enough rebuilding needs that we've actually seen that component drive higher. So there've been some ins and outs maybe from Sandy, but I think the overall volume, not too affected. I think in terms of fiscal cliff, we don't have a separate plan or, as I've heard some companies have. And we think that -- I don't expect a big impact. I do expect something to get resolved. I think the big wild card is what happens to consumer confidence. And I think as long as consumer confidence doesn't take a big nosedive, I expect our sales volume and so on to continue doing just fine. If consumer confidence, for whatever reason, went down significantly, then that's what would probably start affecting sales volume."

And while that will likely carry through this month, and if I look -- if I think about full year, we're going to be pulling back a bit to more normal levels of promotions. And that can also affect that growth throughout the year."

And then secondly, if it does launch and does scale significantly, could it also be another tailwind to your cost of funds in '13?"

And so we wanted to really kind of get it right from a consumer value proposition. And so I am really excited to the able to launch it early next year. In terms of the impact and cost to funds, that's, that is our reason for launching it. We don't expect this to necessarily make money as a product, except it's going to be, over time, a good low-cost, stable source of funds and an additional important core relationship. And I expect it to not have a material impact in the near term, because it's going to take some time. By definition, these are the sticky bank deposits. And so it's going to take some time for us to pry those sticky relationships into a direct banking relationships. But I'm excited about the technology and the value that we can offer to, over time, have that start to become a tailwind on cost of funds.

I'd say a second thing is that, as we get further away from the very large spike in charge-off rates, to some degree, people that were close to the edge all got recognized in a short period of time. So much like the bankruptcy law changed from a number of years ago, where there was a trough afterwards, and it took a few years, but eventually you get back to more normal levels. So I think as we get away from the spike, you're going to eventually start to normalize. And so those are 2 macro factors. Then you start getting back into the normal, unemployment, health care costs, divorces. These are the kinds of things that in prime business, tend to drive charge-offs, and you get back to more normal levels of all those, kind of life events."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'm going to start off by discussing the fourth quarter and then walk through some highlights of our full year accomplishments. 
Before the market opened, we reported quarterly diluted earnings per share of $1.07, up 13% over the prior year, driven primarily by loan growth and share repurchases. During the quarter, we generated return on equity of 23% and returned approximately $451 million of capital to common shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Our robust results, strong capital position and positive outlook led us to announce a 40% increase in our dividend to common shareholders. 
This quarter, we accelerated our organic growth to 6% on total receivables. Card receivables growth for the quarter was the highest in over 5 years, driven by spin from the revolver segment of our card base. Our strong receivables and sales growth results demonstrate the effectiveness of our marketing programs, consumers' preference for cash rewards and our acceptance and awareness initiatives. 
For the fourth quarter, our noncard assets, specifically our personal and private student loans, achieved a combined 11% year-over-year growth as we broadened marketing and added new schools and a fixed-rate product in student loans earlier in the year. Our Payments segment experienced 13% year-over-year purchase volume growth, driven largely by PULSE. Volume processed on our networks achieved an all-time high for the fourth quarter. 
We also increased our level of investment to drive future growth and achieved the full potential of our Direct Banking and payment strategy. Important new initiatives included new domestic and global payments partners; a new core banking system; our first checking product, which we expect to launch in early 2013; and Discover it, our new credit card product that is testing successfully in select markets and will be launched nationally next month. 
Our card net charge-off rate set another record low, but our over-30-day delinquency rate ticked up slightly due to seasonality. While the continued improvement in credit appears to be nearing an end, we don't believe we were -- we are at a point were charge-offs are poised to rise significantly. 
Now, I'd like to share some thoughts on how we performed against our 2012 priorities. We had 2 principal priorities for our Direct Banking segment. First, we wanted to build on the momentum from 2011 and grow card sales and receivables. Second, we wanted to grow our noncard product offerings. During the year, we successfully grew card sales and receivables in a challenging environment by increasing our marked wallet share and achieving double-digit new account growth. We increased customer engagement through our rewards programs, marketing initiatives and by expanding online and mobile capabilities. We increased merchant participation in our rewards program, which also enhanced the value for our card members. For the full year, card receivables grew by $3 billion or 6%. 
In our Direct Banking segment, we grew noncard assets and launched new products, including home loans and student loans focused on graduate and professional programs. By leveraging our expertise in unsecured underwriting and maintaining the customer-centric focus, we disbursed over $1 billion in private student loans and grew personal loan originations to $1.8 billion. Additionally, we originated over $2 billion in home loans since June. 
In payments, we continued to build on domestic and international acceptance and successfully grew our network volume while dealing with competitive challenges. For the full year, volume for the Payments segment grew by 12%, and we achieved a record number of active merchants. Further in Payments, we positioned ourselves as a flexible and innovative partner for payment solutions with a number of new agreements, domestically with PayPal and internationally with new network and issuer partnerships. 
Lastly, one of our top corporate priorities was to drive shareholder value through effective capital management. During the fiscal year, we returned a little over $1.4 billion through share repurchases and common dividends. 
Our fourth quarter provided a strong finish to a record year. As we enter 2013, I am looking forward to maintaining the momentum in our Direct Banking segment and executing on our recently formed network partnerships as we continue to leverage our network assets. We look forward to providing you with an update on our 2013 priorities at our annual financial community briefing in March. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark."

Let me start by reminding you that as of January 2013, Discover will be converting to a December fiscal year end.

Let me start by reminding you that as of January 2013, Discover will be converting to a December fiscal year end. We'll provide you with historical calendar year data in early March in advance of our financial community briefing. 
That said, I'll begin my remarks on this quarter's performance, starting with the Direct Banking segment, which earned $827 million pretax this quarter versus $776 million last year. Net interest income increased $134 million or 11% over the prior year, driven by both asset growth as well as the net interest margin, which was 34 basis points higher than the prior year at 9.44%. Lower funding costs and lower interest charge-offs more than offset a 17 basis point compression in total asset yield from the prior year. Specifically, card yield declined 20 basis points from the prior year to 12.16%, due to more promotional balances and a decline in higher rate and default priced balances. Interest expense, as a percentage of average receivables, was down 49 basis points over the prior year to 2.11%, due to the continued benefit from refinancing maturing liabilities at lower rates. We expect to continue to benefit from this funding cost tailwind through 2013. 
Over the next year, the combination of yield and funding cost trends should keep net interest margin above our long-term target of 8.5% to 9%. However, we do anticipate some compression, driven largely by card yield, which should continue to decline. 
Other income for the Direct Banking segment was $50 million higher than the prior year, mainly due to the inclusion of revenue from Discover Home Loans, our mortgage business that we launched in June of this year, as well as a $26 million gain on the sale of a minority investment. The mortgage business was profitable for the quarter. However, I would remind you of my comments from last quarter's call that we continue to expect it to remain relatively immaterial to earnings for some time. 
Continuing with other income, our rewards expense, a contra revenue item, increased to 106 basis points on card sales during the quarter, due to what was, in retrospect, a richer than expected 5% cashback promotion that generated very strong cardmember engagement. We do not expect this elevated rewards rate to persist into the calendar first quarter. However, I would point out that the current program runs through December. 
Another component of other income, Protection Product revenue, was down from last year, and we continue to expect this line item to decrease over time. During the quarter, we did cease marketing these products to focus on implementing changes required by our consent order. We continue to service and maintain existing products and memberships and intend to once again make these products available to new customers next year. 
Operating expenses for the Direct Banking segment were up $114 million over the prior year or 18%. There are several factors contributing to this higher level of expenses. First, we increased employee headcount as well as marketing and other expenses due to the Home Loan acquisition and the launch of our direct mortgage product, which contributed roughly $50 million to expenses in this period.  Second, as evidenced by our strong receivables growth, we believe investments in marketing are bearing fruit in this environment. And as a result, we think the timing is right for us to continue to opportunistically drive new account acquisition and card utilization. Finally, our headcount information processing and professional fee line items grew further, as we laid the groundwork for launching several new products in the coming quarters and added resources to address new regulatory expectations. Some of these initiatives will also result in higher operating expenses next quarter. 
Turning to credit. Sequentially, the credit card 30-plus delinquency rate increased 5 basis points due to seasonality, but the net charge-off rate declined 14 basis points to a new historic low. The over-30-day delinquency rate for student loans decreased 21 basis points and the net charge-off rate, excluding purchase loans, increased 22 basis points from the third quarter. The net charge-off rate reflects increased seasoning of the organic portfolio. We would remind you that as the portfolio seasons, we will see this rate rise past 1% and come back down over the long term. The credit performance of both our organic and purchased portfolios remains in line with our expectations. 
The personal loan over-30-day delinquency rate was up 2 basis points, and the net charge-off rate was up 22 basis points sequentially as the portfolio continued to season. Over the course of the year, we have said that loan growth will eventually lead us to build reserves. This quarter's $38 million reserve build reflects the strong asset growth that we have realized. 
One last thing I want to mention is that effective November 30, the company began including confirmed card transactions as parts of loans in process, which resulted in a $365 million increase to ending card receivables for the fourth quarter. This will have no impact on historic or future income statement items, including earnings per share, but will lower some ratios which use average card or total receivable balances in the denominator such as card yield and net interest margin. 
Turning to the Payment Services segment, pretax profit decreased 21% over the prior year to $33 million. The decrease resulted primarily from higher expenses at Diners, which included marketing and incentives related to several new issuing relationships. Expense increases were partially offset by increases in higher margin point of sale volume for our PULSE debit network and higher Network Partners volume. Network Partners is our new name for what we formerly referred to as Third-Party Issuers. We've changed the name to better reflect our strategy of partnering to drive volume growth. However, the composition of the business has not changed. Segment volumes were up 13%, driven by strong increases in PULSE and Network Partners volumes. 
Next, I'll touch on liquidity, funding and capital. Our on-balance sheet liquidity portfolio at quarter end was $9.6 billion. Total available liquidity was $27 billion, a decrease of $2.4 billion over the prior quarter. We opportunistically executed a $575 million, 6.5% perpetual preferred stock issue and a $500 million debt exchange offer that allowed us to broaden our regulatory capital mix. Also in November, we issued $250 million of 3-year Class B asset-backed securities with a floating-rate coupon of one month LIBOR plus 45 basis points. This is Discover's first Class B issuance since 2007. As we have said before, we'll continue to opportunistically fund our business by accessing all available channels.  We ended the quarter with a 13.6% tier 1 common ratio, which was 30 basis points lower than the last quarter. 
Let me conclude with some full year comments. We achieved record net income in fiscal 2012 due to improvements in credit, loan growth and a higher net interest margin. The payments business leveraged our network and acceptance footprint to achieve record network volume and entered into several key partnerships, which we expect to be drivers of future profitability. Lastly, we continue to deploy capital, as evidenced by today's announced dividend increase to $0.14, as well as our repurchase of over 6% of our shares over the course of the past year. 
That concludes our formal remarks. So now I'll turn the call back to the operator, John, to open things up for Q&A."

But it's my expectation that we're going to see, at this point, some flatness and more seasonal trends occurring. It wouldn't surprise me to see a slight increase over the coming 12 months. But as I've kind of indicated, we're certainly not expecting anything dramatic. And so if you look at the reserving, it's largely due to our loan growth, which I was very pleased to have achieved a 5-year high growth rate, and that leads to more reserving. And that's more of a driver as opposed to expecting a big increase in credit cost. Mark?"

And as we've been saying, that growth would, at some point in time, cause us to begin to build reserves. And the growth in reserves you've seen is a direct result of the growth in loans over the course of the last several years. With respect to your expenses question, Sanjay, I would say a couple of different things. I think as we look forward to next year, that $3 billion number is a close number to utilize. It may come in a little bit higher than that, would be my general expectation, however. I think in terms of an operating leverage way of looking at things, if we were not investing in a number of these growth investments over the course of the next year, we would be reporting flat operating leverage for 2013. I think we will be slightly below that because of the investments in growth we're making. I think you all understand that when you're investing for organic growth, the expenses lead to revenues. But given the ROIs and the opportunities we see in these products, we're very comfortable going ahead and making those investments. With respect to the rewards rate itself, as I said in my prepared remarks, I think the 106 basis point level that you saw this quarter was higher than we expected it to be, quite honestly. That program was probably a little bit too rich, in retrospect. But it did drive fabulous cardmember engagement, which is great. I would say going forward, I would expect it to be closer to that 1% level is the right way to think about things. Though again, I would point out for the month of December, that higher program is still running."

There's been enough rebuilding needs that we've actually seen that component drive higher. So there've been some ins and outs maybe from Sandy, but I think the overall volume, not too affected. I think in terms of fiscal cliff, we don't have a separate plan for -- as I've heard some companies have. And we think that -- I don't expect a big impact. I do expect something to get resolved. I think the big wild card is what happens to consumer confidence. And I think as long as consumer confidence doesn't take a big nosedive, I expect our sales volume and so on to continue doing just fine. If consumer confidence, for whatever reason, went down significantly, then that's what would probably start affecting sales volume."

Because it strikes me that you invest on rewards. You get some share, then somebody else invests more in awards, and they take away some of the share from other folks. In terms of the natural growth rate, of -- underlying growth rate of the industry, doesn't it make sense to dial back on investments just because, if everyone starts doing that, everybody loses? I mean, how you think about that, at a high level?"

So I think they're not going to be dropping credit standards to reach for growth, which is always the biggest concern you've got. And so what it comes to is us using our competitive advantages to gain share, so our advantage in service, our advantage in rewards, our advantage in growing acceptance, our advantage on differentiation, including with new products.

In terms of the impact on cost to funds, that's, that is our reason for launching it. We don't expect this to necessarily make money as a product, except it's going to be, over time, a good low-cost, stable source of funds and an additional important core relationship. And I expect it to not have a material impact in the near term, because it's going to take some time. By definition, these are the sticky bank deposits. And so it's going to take some time for us to pry those sticky relationships into a direct banking relationships.

I'd say a second thing is that as we get further away from the very large spike in charge-off rates, to some degree, people that were close to the edge all got recognized in a short period of time. So much like the bankruptcy law changed from a number of years ago, where there was a trough afterwards, and it took a few years, but eventually you get back to more normal levels. So I think as we get away from the spike, you're going to eventually start to normalize. And so those are 2 macro factors. Then you start getting back into the normal, unemployment, health care costs, divorces. These are the kinds of things that in prime business, tend to drive charge-offs, and you get back to more normal levels of all those, kind of life events."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'm going to start off by discussing the fourth quarter and then walk through some highlights of our full year accomplishments. 
Before the market opened, we reported quarterly diluted earnings per share of $1.07, up 13% over the prior year, driven primarily by loan growth and share repurchases. During the quarter, we generated return on equity of 23% and returned approximately $451 million of capital to common shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Our robust results, strong capital position and positive outlook led us to announce a 40% increase in our dividend to common shareholders. 
This quarter, we accelerated our organic growth to 6% on total receivables. Card receivables growth for the quarter was the highest in over 5 years, driven by spin from the revolver segment of our card base. Our strong receivables and sales growth results demonstrate the effectiveness of our marketing programs, consumers' preference for cash rewards and our acceptance and awareness initiatives. 
For the fourth quarter, our noncard assets, specifically our personal and private student loans, achieved a combined 11% year-over-year growth as we broadened marketing and added new schools and a fixed-rate product in student loans earlier in the year. Our Payments segment experienced 13% year-over-year purchase volume growth, driven largely by PULSE. Volume processed on our networks achieved an all-time high for the fourth quarter. 
We also increased our level of investment to drive future growth and achieved the full potential of our Direct Banking and payment strategy. Important new initiatives included new domestic and global payments partners; a new core banking system; our first checking product, which we expect to launch in early 2013; and Discover it, our new credit card product that is testing successfully in select markets and will be launched nationally next month. 
Our card net charge-off rate set another record low, but our over-30-day delinquency rate ticked up slightly due to seasonality. While the continued improvement in credit appears to be nearing an end, we don't believe we were -- we are at a point where charge-offs are poised to rise significantly. 
Now, I'd like to share some thoughts on how we performed against our 2012 priorities. We had 2 principal priorities for our Direct Banking segment. First, we wanted to build on the momentum from 2011 and grow card sales and receivables. Second, we wanted to grow our noncard product offerings. During the year, we successfully grew card sales and receivables in a challenging environment by increasing our marked wallet share and achieving double-digit new account growth. We increased customer engagement through our rewards programs, marketing initiatives and by expanding online and mobile capabilities. We increased merchant participation in our rewards program, which also enhanced the value for our card members. For the full year, card receivables grew by $3 billion or 6%. 
In our Direct Banking segment, we grew noncard assets and launched new products, including home loans and student loans focused on graduate and professional programs. By leveraging our expertise in unsecured underwriting and maintaining the customer-centric focus, we disbursed over $1 billion in private student loans and grew personal loan originations to $1.8 billion. Additionally, we originated over $2 billion in home loans since June. 
In payments, we continued to build on domestic and international acceptance and successfully grew our network volume while dealing with competitive challenges. For the full year, volume for the Payments segment grew by 12%, and we achieved a record number of active merchants. Further in Payments, we positioned ourselves as a flexible and innovative partner for payment solutions with a number of new agreements, domestically with PayPal and internationally with new network and issuer partnerships. 
Lastly, one of our top corporate priorities was to drive shareholder value through effective capital management. During the fiscal year, we returned a little over $1.4 billion through share repurchases and common dividends. 
Our fourth quarter provided a strong finish to a record year. As we enter 2013, I am looking forward to maintaining the momentum in our Direct Banking segment and executing on our recently formed network partnerships as we continue to leverage our network assets. We look forward to providing you with an update on our 2013 priorities at our annual financial community briefing in March. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark."
3695566,224896182,399678,"Discover Financial Services, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2012",2012-12-20,"Earnings Calls","Discover Financial Services","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by reminding you that as of January 2013, Discover will be converting to a December fiscal year end.

Let me start by reminding you that as of January 2013, Discover will be converting to a December fiscal year end. We'll provide you with historical calendar year data in early March in advance of our financial community briefing. 
That said, I'll begin my remarks on this quarter's performance, starting with the Direct Banking segment, which earned $827 million pretax this quarter versus $776 million last year. Net interest income increased $134 million or 11% over the prior year, driven by both asset growth as well as the net interest margin, which was 34 basis points higher than the prior year at 9.44%. Lower funding costs and lower interest charge-offs more than offset a 17 basis point compression in total asset yield from the prior year. Specifically, card yield declined 20 basis points from the prior year to 12.16%, due to more promotional balances and a decline in higher rate and default priced balances. Interest expense, as a percentage of average receivables, was down 49 basis points over the prior year to 2.11%, due to the continued benefit from refinancing maturing liabilities at lower rates. We expect to continue to benefit from this funding cost tailwind through 2013. 
Over the next year, the combination of yield and funding cost trends should keep net interest margin above our long-term target of 8.5% to 9%. However, we do anticipate some compression, driven largely by card yield, which should continue to decline. 
Other income for the Direct Banking segment was $50 million higher than the prior year, mainly due to the inclusion of revenue from Discover Home Loans, our mortgage business that we launched in June of this year, as well as a $26 million gain on the sale of a minority investment. The mortgage business was profitable for the quarter. However, I would remind you of my comments from last quarter's call that we continue to expect it to remain relatively immaterial to earnings for some time. 
Continuing with other income, our rewards expense, a contra revenue item, increased to 106 basis points on card sales during the quarter, due to what was, in retrospect, a richer than expected 5% cashback promotion that generated very strong cardmember engagement. We do not expect this elevated rewards rate to persist into the calendar first quarter. However, I would point out that the current program runs through December. 
Another component of other income, Protection Product revenue, was down from last year, and we continue to expect this line item to decrease over time. During the quarter, we did cease marketing these products to focus on implementing changes required by our consent order. We continue to service and maintain existing products and memberships and intend to once again make these products available to new customers next year. 
Operating expenses for the Direct Banking segment were up $114 million over the prior year or 18%. There are several factors contributing to this higher level of expenses. First, we increased employee headcount as well as marketing and other expenses due to the Home Loan acquisition and the launch of our direct mortgage product, which contributed roughly $50 million to expenses in this period.  Second, as evidenced by our strong receivables growth, we believe investments in marketing are bearing fruit in this environment. And as a result, we think the timing is right for us to continue to opportunistically drive new account acquisition and card utilization. Finally, our headcount information processing and professional fee line items grew further, as we laid the groundwork for launching several new products in the coming quarters and added resources to address new regulatory expectations. Some of these initiatives will also result in higher operating expenses next quarter. 
Turning to credit. Sequentially, the credit card 30-plus delinquency rate increased 5 basis points due to seasonality, but the net charge-off rate declined 14 basis points to a new historic low. The over-30-day delinquency rate for student loans decreased 21 basis points and the net charge-off rate, excluding purchase loans, increased 22 basis points from the third quarter. The net charge-off rate reflects increased seasoning of the organic portfolio. We would remind you that as the portfolio seasons, we will see this rate rise past 1% and come back down over the long term. The credit performance of both our organic and purchased portfolios remains in line with our expectations. 
The personal loan over-30-day delinquency rate was up 2 basis points, and the net charge-off rate was up 22 basis points sequentially as the portfolio continued to season. Over the course of the year, we have said that loan growth will eventually lead us to build reserves. This quarter's $38 million reserve build reflects the strong asset growth that we have realized. 
One last thing I want to mention is that effective November 30, the company began including confirmed card transactions as parts of loans in process, which resulted in a $365 million increase to ending card receivables for the fourth quarter. This will have no impact on historic or future income statement items, including earnings per share, but will lower some ratios which use average card or total receivable balances in the denominator such as card yield and net interest margin. 
Turning to the Payment Services segment, pretax profit decreased 21% over the prior year to $33 million. The decrease resulted primarily from higher expenses at Diners, which included marketing and incentives related to several new issuing relationships. Expense increases were partially offset by increases in higher margin point of sale volume for our PULSE debit network and higher Network Partners volume. Network Partners is our new name for what we formerly referred to as Third-Party Issuers. We've changed the name to better reflect our strategy of partnering to drive volume growth. However, the composition of the business has not changed. Segment volumes were up 13%, driven by strong increases in PULSE and Network Partners volumes. 
Next, I'll touch on liquidity, funding and capital. Our on-balance sheet liquidity portfolio at quarter end was $9.6 billion. Total available liquidity was $27 billion, a decrease of $2.4 billion over the prior quarter. We opportunistically executed a $575 million, 6.5% perpetual preferred stock issue and a $500 million debt exchange offer that allowed us to broaden our regulatory capital mix. Also in November, we issued $250 million of 3-year Class B asset-backed securities with a floating-rate coupon of one month LIBOR plus 45 basis points. This is Discover's first Class B issuance since 2007. As we have said before, we'll continue to opportunistically fund our business by accessing all available channels.  We ended the quarter with a 13.6% tier 1 common ratio, which was 30 basis points lower than the last quarter. 
Let me conclude with some full year comments. We achieved record net income in fiscal 2012 due to improvements in credit, loan growth and a higher net interest margin. The payments business leveraged our network and acceptance footprint to achieve record network volume and entered into several key partnerships, which we expect to be drivers of future profitability. Lastly, we continue to deploy capital, as evidenced by today's announced dividend increase to $0.14, as well as our repurchase of over 6% of our shares over the course of the past year. 
That concludes our formal remarks. So now I'll turn the call back to the operator, John, to open things up for Q&A."

Just the first on credit quality, I think David, you mentioned that you don't anticipate a significant rise in charge-offs. Could you just talk about the dynamics there, when we look a year out from now, especially when you -- when considering how you factored in to your provision? Do you assume flattish a year from now or up slightly? And then secondarily, just on operating expenses, I was just hoping to get some color from Mark, maybe. When we look out to 2013, is $3 billion roughly a good assumption to use as an annual budget for operating expenses? And then maybe on rewards costs as well, is 100 basis points still a good number, roughly?"

But as I've kind of indicated, we're certainly not expecting anything dramatic. And so if you look at the reserving, it's largely due to our loan growth, which I was very pleased to have achieved a 5-year high growth rate, and that leads to more reserving. And that's more of a driver as opposed to expecting a big increase in credit cost. Mark?"

And as we've been saying, that growth would, at some point in time, cause us to begin to build reserves. And the growth in reserves you've seen is a direct result of the growth in loans over the course of the last several years. With respect to your expenses question, Sanjay, I would say a couple of different things. I think as we look forward to next year, that $3 billion number is a close number to utilize. It may come in a little bit higher than that, would be my general expectation, however. I think in terms of an operating leverage way of looking at things, if we were not investing in a number of these growth investments over the course of the next year, we would be reporting flat operating leverage for 2013. I think we will be slightly below that because of the investments in growth we're making. I think you all understand that when you're investing for organic growth, the expenses lead to revenues. But given the ROIs and the opportunities we see in these products, we're very comfortable going ahead and making those investments. With respect to the rewards rate itself, as I said in my prepared remarks, I think the 106 basis point level that you saw this quarter was higher than we expected it to be, quite honestly. That program was probably a little bit too rich, in retrospect. But it did drive fabulous cardmember engagement, which is great. I would say going forward, I would expect it to be closer to that 1% level is the right way to think about things. Though again, I would point out for the month of December, that higher program is still running."

I think in terms of fiscal cliff, we don't have a separate plan for -- as I've heard some companies have. And we think that -- I don't expect a big impact. I do expect something to get resolved. I think the big wild card is what happens to consumer confidence. And I think as long as consumer confidence doesn't take a big nosedive, I expect our sales volume and so on to continue doing just fine.

We are currently in the throes of our annual capital planning activities, both internally and with our own Board of Directors, and also preparing for submission in the first couple days of January to the Fed, as part of the CCAR capital process, our annual capital plan as well. I think you all know that any capital actions we propose to take need non-objection on the part of our regulatory body. I guess I'd say a couple of things. Number one, I don't think we feel that we were necessarily aggressive enough in our ask last year. So I think you should expect our ask to be somewhat more aggressive than it was last year; it was not objected to. I think the other thing I would say in this regard is we remain committed to being responsible stewards of that capital. And fulfilling that mission is going to be a combination of deploying it at ROE levels above our threshold 15% that we have talked to you about in the past, and finding ways to get that capital returned to our shareholders to the extent we don't have the ability to do that. So it's not lost on us that you guys would love to see an increase in the returns of capital, and we are working toward that end."

And I think that the big effect for us is that we are going to be going through a seasoning where we've had a lot of growth, and we're getting -- we're going to have more of the students that we booked, who will be entering repayment for the first time. And most of the losses or about 1/2 the losses that you occur -- that occur over the life of a student loan occur the first 2 years after repayment. So as we get more of those people, we're going to end up having more people in forbearance, more losses, and then you get a maturing over time. And it, I would say, that business continues to perform on a vintage basis as we had anticipated."

But that's something, which I think is kind of an obvious question, but just be helpful to get additional perspective on that. When you look at the credit card business and the fact that there are, of course a few, small, a small number of large competitors in the business. And you are investing in rewards and trying to gain share, or you are gaining share of receivables, how do you think of it from a gain theory perspective? Because it strikes me that you invest on rewards. You get some share, then somebody else invests more in awards, and they take away some of the share from other folks. In terms of the natural growth rate, of -- underlying growth rate of the industry, doesn't it make sense to dial back on investments just because, if everyone starts doing that, everybody loses? I mean, how you think about that, at a high level?"

And what I see is that while it's a smaller number of sizable competitors today than in the past, the good news is, they're more rational competitors. So I think they're not going to be dropping credit standards to reach for growth, which is always the biggest concern you've got. And so what it comes to is us using our competitive advantages to gain share, so our advantage in service, our advantage in rewards, our advantage in growing acceptance, our advantage on differentiation, including with new products. And so we're going to be focused on -- from a game theory perspective, using all those competitive advantages, to gain share in the credit card market."

But I think what I would attribute more of that to is that it is a more -- it's probably a much more robust product and a better product than what I might have anticipated a year ago. And so we wanted to really kind of get it right from a consumer value proposition. And so I am really excited to the able to launch it early next year. In terms of the impact on cost to funds, that's, that is our reason for launching it. We don't expect this to necessarily make money as a product, except it's going to be, over time, a good low-cost, stable source of funds and an additional important core relationship. And I expect it to not have a material impact in the near term, because it's going to take some time. By definition, these are the sticky bank deposits. And so it's going to take some time for us to pry those sticky relationships into a direct banking relationships. But I'm excited about the technology and the value that we can offer to, over time, have that start to become a tailwind on cost of funds. But I think realistically, you're -- you'd have to look more in a -- 2014, 2015 and beyond that, just to really start seeing some movement."

And then on credit, Mark, your comments are very helpful. I just -- one, a kind of modeling question on the reserve rate.

If you looked at the -- how much everyone pulled back during the financial crisis and very few new accounts were booked, we're now back into a more normal time period.

I'd say a second thing is that as we get further away from the very large spike in charge-off rates, to some degree, people that were close to the edge all got recognized in a short period of time. So much like the bankruptcy law changed from a number of years ago, where there was a trough afterwards, and it took a few years, but eventually you get back to more normal levels. So I think as we get away from the spike, you're going to eventually start to normalize. And so those are 2 macro factors. Then you start getting back into the normal, unemployment, health care costs, divorces. These are the kinds of things that in prime business, tend to drive charge-offs, and you get back to more normal levels of all those, kind of life events."
