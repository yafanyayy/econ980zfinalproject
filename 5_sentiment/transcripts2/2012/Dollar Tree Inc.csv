I'm pleased to report that our comparable store sales increased 7.3%. Driven primarily by increased traffic, this was our largest fourth quarter comparable sales increase since 1999 and a much smaller company. Total sales increased 12.8% to $1.95 billion. Earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.60 per diluted share. This represents a 24% increase over last year's $1.29 per share. Operating margin for the fourth quarter 2011 was 15.5%, an increase of 50 basis points over the fourth quarter last year, and net income rose 15.6% to $187.9 million.
For the full year fiscal 2011, comp store sales increased 6%. That's on top of a 6.3% comp store sales increase last year. And net sales were $6.63 billion, an increase of 12.7% over fiscal 2010. Earnings for the full year were $4.03 per diluted share, an increase of 24.8% compared with $3.23 per share last year. Notably, operating income increased by $125.8 million. Operating margin was 11.8%, an increase of 70 basis points compared with last year, and net income for the year rose 18% to $488.3 million. This was on top of a 29.1% increase in net income, prior year.
I'm very pleased with these results. They speak to the value and relevance of our merchandise, the power and flexibility of our model and the Day By Day execution of our strategy across the entire organization. Our stores were well stocked in merchandise. Our seasonal merchandise assortments exceeded customers' expectations for style and value. Seasonal transitions were well executed, and we were consistently in stock on basic items that customers need everyday. On top of all of that, weather was favorable throughout the quarter. As a result, customers continue to respond in record numbers. 
Sales growth in the fourth quarter came from a mix of both basic and discretionary products. The top-performing categories included Food snacks and beverages, Health and Beauty Care, [indiscernible] and home products, party supplies and of course, seasonal merchandise.
Success of Dollar Tree, as it has always been, is based on our focus on the customer. We aim our efforts at increasing the volume of the merchandise per $1, improving the quality of our shopping environment and providing the infrastructure that supports the business. The Dollar Tree merchandising model is flexible, and we use this strategy of ever-changing assortments to our advantage. Our assortments are planned to offer the greatest value to the customer for $1 and to do so on the cost that delivers our required merchandise margin.
To the customer, this means there's always something new at Dollar Tree. As customers thrive to balance their budgets, they can find the high-value basics they need while enjoying the thrill of the hunt on every visit. Seasonal assortments are fresh, colorful and fun and provide merchandise energy in the stores. This strategic advantages has been validated by results. History shows that we are consistently able to manage through inflationary and deflationary cycles by changing the product or changing the source. 
Our merchants work everyday to deliver an exciting assortment of products with the best values ever. And our planning allocations and replenishment organization directed to the right stores. As a result, inventory productivity continues to improve. Inventory turns increased to 4.22 turns in 2011 compared with 4.17 turns in 2010. This is the seventh consecutive annual increase. 
Our store teams continue to consistently deliver on the promise of a clean, bright and fun place to shop. Seasonal transitions have been well executed with fresh and timely displays of merchandise for every season. In the fourth quarter, we executed quick transitions throughout Christmas and on the big game in Valentine's Day. We're now set for Dollar Days and St. Patrick's Day and we're building for the Easter season.
As we continue to grow, we pay very close attention to our infrastructure needs. The Dollar Tree infrastructure has been built to be solid and scalable. This year, we expanded our distribution center in Savannah, Georgia from its original size of 600,000 square feet to 1 million where feet. This support the continued growth of our business in the Southeast. This project was completed on time and on budget with a total of $19.5 million of capital investment using existing cash.
As always, we plan to add capacity strategically to support our growth ahead of the need. In this regard, we're currently finalizing plans to increase our logistics capacity in the Northeast and I expect these plans to be finalized over the next 3 months. Our current logistics infrastructure can support sales nationally up to $8 billion. It provides efficient service to our stores today and asset leverage as we continue to grow.
For the full year 2011, as planned, we opened 278 new stores and relocated and expanded 91 stores for a total of 369 projects. Selling square footage increased 6.9%, and we ended the year with 4,351 stores. Our plan for 2012 includes approximately 315 new stores and 75 relocations or expansions for a total of 390 projects in the U.S. and Canada.
[indiscernible] growth opportunities in several ways. In addition to opening new Dollar Tree stores, we have a tremendous opportunity to expand categories, to grow near retail formats, to expand geographic reach and to open more productive stores. I'm pleased to say that we continue to make progress and store productivity. New store sales per-square-foot are increasing driven by improved site selection, by rightsizing our stores to the market, by opening new stores earlier in the year through improved staffing, building the bench of qualified store management and by emphasizing and expanding the most productive categories of merchandise. Average new store productivity increased once again in 2011 to the highest level in 10 years.
Our expansion of frozen and refrigerated product continues. We installed freezers and coolers in 376  net additional stores in 2011, including 125 new stores. And we now offer frozen and refrigerated products in 2,220 stores. This important category is extremely productive. It serves the current needs of our customers and it drives traffic into our stores, which provides incremental sales across all categories including our higher-margin discretionary product. While faster turning lower margin consumer products continue to lead the way and comp increases, our traffic has increased and our overall comp increase has been the result of growth in both consumer products and in higher-margin variety merchandise.
In addition to opening new Dollar Tree stores, increasing new store productivity and expanding new categories like frozen and refrigerated, a key component of our growth strategy is the development of new retail formats and the expansion of our geographic reach. Deal$ is our most pricing format. At Deal$, not everything is a dollar but everything is a value. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point, we conserve even more customers with more products and more categories. As we grow and refine the Deal$ concept, customers are responding favorably. More customers are finding us everyday, comp sales are impressive and are the results of increases in both traffic and average ticket. We're excited about the growth potential of the concept and the opportunity that it gives us to serve even more customers across the country.
We opened 28 new Deal$ stores in 2011, and ended the year with a net total of 182 Deal$ stores. We plan to continue this growth rate in total.
Our expansion into Canada is proceeding and progressing. As you may recall, we acquired Dollar Giant in the fourth quarter of 2010. At the time, it was a chain of 86 stores. In 2011, we increased the store count by about 15%, and we ended fiscal 2011 with 99 stores in Canada. While short-term performance has lagged, early expectations are primary focus in 2011 was rationalizing merchandise assortments for the Canadian market, investing in infrastructure, integrating processes and staff, developing real estate plans and training and building store teams and merchandise teams for the future. Our goal in Canada is to operate on an identical platform to the merchandising and productivity systems that support to U.S. stores, and we've made great progress toward that goal in a short period of time. I'm very pleased. Highlights include the [indiscernible] merchandise, plans and working to solidify our logistics model in Canada. In addition, we are now supplying product to our stores using our U.S. WMS system through distribution centers in British Columbia and Ontario. We completed the installation and training of store level POS and enterprise-level merchandising systems in the third quarter last year. This was a critical step in our plan as sales data from these systems support planning, allocations and replenishment. And we recently completed year-end SKU level inventories in all stores. With our core technology in place, we now have visibility through our sales, on-hand and on-order by SKU in-store. Equally important, we're building history by store SKU all key factors in the management of an efficient supply chain.
With this information, we're beginning to rollout auto replenishment of basics and employing smart allocations of new and seasonal merchandise just as we do successfully in the U.S. And as we have experienced in the U.S., the result will be an improved floor of product to the stores in a timely year basis, allowing for more efficient store operations and increased level of in stock of basic product, higher store productivity, increase inventory turns and an overall improvement in customer satisfaction. I'm extremely excited about the opportunity for Dollar Tree Canada. I'm proud of what was accomplished in only one year, and I know that we can do much better. We have a highly motivated and energetic team, and I'm confident that the results will be well worth the effort. 
This year we intend to grow our Canadian store base approximately 25% under the Dollar Tree brand. And over the long term, we believe the Canadian market can support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores. This is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the U.S., plus additional growth in our Deal$ format.
Dollar Tree Direct, our E-Commerce business is providing an opportunity to reach new customers through an additional channel distribution. New customers continue to discover Dollar Tree Direct everyday. Traffic on the site grew to 4 million visitors in the fourth quarter, that was a 25% increase over the fourth quarter last year. We're using this opportunity to drive direct sales, expand the brand and to attract customers into our stores with the offer of high-value merchandise and free shipping for pickup in any of our stores across the country. 
Sales continue to grow as many customers prefer the convenience of online shopping, especially for larger quantities needed for parties or events or by small businesses and organizations. If you haven't had the opportunity, I would invite you to take a look at our site at www.dollartree.com.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin who will give you more detail on our financial metrics and provide guidance."

As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 24% in the fourth quarter to $1.60. This increase resulted from our strong sales, a 20-basis point improvement in gross profit margin and a 30-basis point reduction in total SG&A expense compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Starting with gross profit, our gross profit margin grew to 37.8% during the fourth quarter compared with 37.6% in the fourth quarter last year. This is our highest gross profit margin since the fourth quarter of 2001.
We achieved strong leverage on our occupancy and distribution expenses, reflecting the 7.3% comp store sales growth which more than offset the impacts of the continued shifts in product mix as basic consumable products increased by about 140 basis points to the percentage of sales in the fourth quarter. The higher cost relative to sales of our Canadian stores and the impact of our strength from our first SKU-based inventory of Dollar Tree Canada and a slight increase in our freight expense relative to sales as savings on ocean freight partially offset the impacts of diesels prices that average more than $0.63 above the same period last year.
SG&A expenses were 22.2% of sales for the quarter, which is a 30-basis point improvement from the fourth quarter last year. This was driven primarily by a 20-basis point reduction in depreciation, a 10-basis point decline in payroll-related expenses due to increased store labor productivity and leverage on comp store sales, as well as lower utility costs reflecting the milder winter weather. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in general liability insurance expense.
Debit and credit card fees were flat, reflecting growth in usage of these types of tender, offset by the lower legislated rates. In the fourth quarter, compared to the fourth quarter last year, debit card penetration increased 120 basis points and credit card penetration increased 30 basis points. SNAP penetration, although small, continues to grow. 
Operating income increased $43.3 million compared with the fourth quarter last year. The operating margin was 15.5%, an increase of 50 basis points from the fourth quarter last year and was the highest operating margin since 2002. For the full year, operating income increased $125.8 million and our operating margin grew to 11.8%, up 70 basis points from last year's 11.1% operating margin. Dollar Tree's operating margin remains among the highest in the value retail sector.
The tax rate for the quarter was 37.7% versus 37% in the fourth quarter last year. The higher rate, primarily reflects a lower percentage of state tax credits compared with the fourth quarter last year, which also included some benefit from the favorable tax treatment of the [indiscernible] dividend. For the full fiscal year, the tax rate was 37.4% compared with 36.9% in 2010. 
Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow. Cash and investments at year end totaled $288.3 million versus $486 million at the end of fiscal 2010. During the fourth quarter, we invested $300 million for share repurchase through an ASR and repurchased 3.5 million shares. For the full year, we invested $645.9 million from the share repurchase and repurchased 8.7 million shares. 
The diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 117.6 million for the fourth quarter and 121.2 million for the full year of 2011. In October, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion for share repurchase. As of the yearend, we have $1.2 billion remaining in our authorization. We will continue to view share repurchase opportunistically and we will update you on additional share repurchases, if any, at the end of the quarter in which they may occur. 
As Bob mentioned, our inventory turns increased in 2011 for the seventh consecutive year to 4.22, and this includes Canada. Consolidated inventory at year end was 8% greater than at the same time last year, and selling square footage grew by 6.9%. Consolidated inventory per selling-square-foot increased by 1%. The slight increase in inventory on a per-square-foot basis supports the earlier Easter selling season, as well as inventory for new stores that are opening up early in Q1. We are well positioned as we begin the year and expect continued improvement in our inventory turns in 2012.
Capital expenditures were $53.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. This compares with $32 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year 2011, capital expenditures were $250.1 million compared with $178.7 million in 2010. For fiscal year 2012, we are planning consolidated capital expenditures to be in the range of $330 million to $340 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores or remodels, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to 325 stores, IT system enhancements and approximately $80 million toward a new distribution center in the Northeast U.S. The total capital investment anticipated for this facility was approximately $95 million.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $44 million for the fourth quarter versus $42.1 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, depreciation was $164.2 million, a 25-basis point decrease from last year. For 2012, depreciation and amortization is estimated to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million.
Our guidance for 2012 includes a couple of assumptions. First, in regard to freight expense, we will soon be negotiating new ocean rates that become effective on May 1. As always, we cannot predict the outcome of these negotiations nor can anyone accurately predict the direction of diesel prices for Nestor. For this reason our guidance assumes that ocean freight rates and diesel prices will be similar to the current levels on average throughout fiscal 2012. Second, Easter is 2 weeks earlier this year. This represents about an $8 million sales challenge in the first quarter. Third, due to the retail calendar, 2012 will include 53 weeks and the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. This is expected to add $120 million to $130 million in incremental sales and $0.13 to $0.15 of earnings per diluted share to the fourth quarter and the full year.
Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 38.4% for the first quarter and 37.4% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share count are assumed to be 116.9 million shares for the first quarter and 117.1 million shares for the full year. While we still see share repurchase of the good use of cash, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase. 
With that in mind, for the first quarter of 2012, we are forecasting sales in the range of $100 billion -- or $1.65 billion to $1.69 billion and diluted EPS in the range of $0.91 to $0.97, which represents an 11% to 18% increase compared to first quarter 2011 earnings of $0.82 per diluted share. The sales range implies a low- to mid-single-digit comparable store sales increase and store square footage of about 7%. 
For the full fiscal year of 2012, we are now forecasting sales in the range of $7.25 billion to $7.42 billion based on a low- to mid-single-digit increase in comparable store sales [indiscernible] 7.2% footage growth. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.90, representing an increase of between 15% and 22% over our record earnings per share of $4.03 in fiscal 2011 and takes into account the 53rd week that will be included in the fourth quarter of 2012.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

Despite high fuel prices, operating margins increased by 70 basis points to 11.8%, the best in the past 11 years. And earnings per share increased by nearly 25% on top of a 36% increase in the prior year. In addition, this year, the company completed the expansion of our Savannah, D.C., a key element in supporting our continued growth in the Southeast. We opened 278 new stores and completed 91 relocations and expansions. We achieved the highest new store productivity in 10 years since 2001 when our average size store was much smaller. We gained traction growth and new customers with our Deal$ model. Comp sales at Deal$ benefited from both increased traffic and average ticket. In 2011, we build a solid foundation for growth in Canada. We expect Canadian performance to improve throughout the year, especially as we gain traction in the second half.
We make significant enhancements to Dollar Tree Direct including, Spanish language and mobile capability. We repurchased $645.9 million of stock in 2011, and we announced a renewed authorization from the board for an additional $1.5 billion of share repurchase, of which $1.2 billion remain. By any measure, it was an outstanding year, and I will tell you that we are singularly positioned to do even better and future. There's a great opportunity ahead for Dollar Tree because our stores, merchants and support teams are guided by a strategic vision that involves every element of the business revolving around the customer. Because the business model is powerful and flexible, tested by time and validated by results, we've proven that Dollar Tree can adapt to a changing environment through good and bad economic times, the company has consistently increased sales and earnings and we've never been better positioned for continued growth and improvement.
The balanced mix of high value consumer basics and the unique assortment of fun, seasonally correct discretionary products position Dollar Tree stores to be relevant to customers in all economic circumstances. At Dollar Tree, yes, you can afford it. We have a solid and scalable infrastructure that we're leveraging for better inventory management, increasingly efficient supply chain logistics, more productive stores and crisper overall execution. And there's more to come. There are plenty of opportunities to grow our business through Dollar Tree stores, more productive new stores category expansion, new formats, Deal$ and Dollar Tree Direct and expanded geography. Canada provides an opportunity for substantial growth. All of these provides a roadmap for sustained profitable growth. At Dollar Tree, we have a vision of where we want to go and the people and the infrastructure and capital to make it happen.

It was a combination, I think, we believe of both new customers, finding us all the time, it's still pretty tough out there, unemployment is still high, we sell things people need everyday and it's only $1. And through word-of-mouth, they're learning about that and they're trying us and they're coming back then more often. So it's new customers and I believe, they're shopping with us, I know they're shopping with us more often. The mix of consumer products that we have now, which is about 50% of our business, that's more frequently purchased. So people are coming back more often to buy that. I will tell you that when they're in buying the consumer products, we're also seeing a lift in our variety merchandise. It's not growing as fast as a consumer product, but it's growing very significantly. So we're pleased with what we're getting from the traffic there. As far as new items, we're always adding new items. If you look at our Christmas assortment this year, you saw just a lot of tremendous new merchandise, things you hadn't seen. At the Dollar store anyway, a Dollar Tree for $1. You may see a department stores, much wouldn't have seen it in our store like ours for of only $1. The theme was all color relevant and very timely to the business. We've added a little solar items with the dancing flowers in the solar stakes and all that we've done with that this year, that's all new merchandise. But we changed about 50% of our assortment every year, every season, at least 50% every season, and 50% every year. So part of who we are is always that ever-changing assortment of new merchandise that adds fun and as I call it, merchandise energy to the store. It adds opportunity or reason to come back more often [indiscernible] store what we call the Thrill-of-the-Hunt. So go around and take a look around, you're going to find something that you didn't see last time. And the front of the stores we pay particular attention to changing those out with our items of the week and our drive items and of course, our seasonal that's in the front of the store always changing."

Second 2012, we just came back from our important trip January. As always, it was successful. Just the very nature of our we plan our business, we're always going to come back with hitting or exceeding our planned markup targets for the trip because that's the way we built our merchandise assortment based on the cost. It's the most value that we can give the customer for $1 at a margin that we're willing to accept. So we just finished our January trip. It was very successful. Our markup is higher this year and our value is even better than ever because not only was the, I think, I would characterize it as a more stable price environment in China versus a year ago. We've always been able to manage our margins because we're in control of it, but it felt like just anecdotally, this year, that business is down a little bit in China. And we're good buyers and big buyers and for that reason we've got good relationships and as a result, they did not seem to be as much pressure overall on the cost of the items. We were able to get the prices that we needed. And increased the value at the same time, which is what we tend to do. If there is deflation and cost, we tend to put more value in the product because that's how we drive the sales. Our price is $1 whether there's pressure on cost, inflation or deflation, our retail is to $1. So our goal then is to provide the most value for the $1 at the margins that we need. It was very favorable, I would characterize the January trip as very favorable. I'm excited about the new assortment coming in, not only in the second half but right now, our spring business, I'm expecting some good results there, Easter looks really good out there. If you haven't been in one of our stores, it's really starting to build. The Dollar Date promotion that we kicked off the year with is looking good, add a lot of color to the front of our store. And our stores teams, I will tell, did the best job I've ever seen in transitioning from Christmas into the big game and then the Dollar Days and now Easter and St. Patrick's Day. So kudos to those people and our customers are responding very favorably to that. Thank you."

Short term, we face headwinds there of our own doing, but it was something that had to be done. The main headwinds that we faced in Canada this past year were around rationalizing the merchandise assortment, dropping some of the SKUs, adding new SKUs, adding new important piece that we do in the U.S., getting the basics and licensed there's a lot of turmoil in the assortment in Canada. And you always drop things faster than you get them added back. Plus we are in the process of setting up 2 new distribution centers and moving them and as a result we lost some sales and that's as a result, lost some leverage on our occupancy costs. So that's one thing. The second thing was we did our SKU inventory. It was a first SKU inventory that's ever been done there. It's very critical to the where we're going to run the business, but we did that and fourth quarter answering was a little lighter than we expected. So the combination of those 2 things sort of teamed up and didn't meet my expectations. [indiscernible] many of our expectations. But on the plus side, it was such a great accomplishment that we've made in a short order, maybe we didn't have any right to inspect better than we had. We solidified the logistics model now. New DCs and BCs and in Ontario. We've got the Dollar Tree W [indiscernible] system in there. We have in the store all changing of the stores we've got the SKU level inventories and that's going to allow us to do a lot of things with allocations, smart allocations, put the right product in the right stores based on sales, based on inventory. It's going to help us replenishing the basics. It's going to take over store people in Canada, a little more out of the reordering process and more into the merchandising process and filling the counters and run the cash registers. So we're really excited about what we've done and what that means for us in the future. The result of all that, as I said in the prepared remarks, is more timely or deliveries of product, more seasonally relevant stores because of the timelier deliveries. It's going to be a more effective store by knowing what have invisibility or what's coming into the store. Our store teams can plan their payroll accordingly and get the product to the shelf faster. It'll make for a fuller and a funder store and a more complete store. And at the end of the day, it'll be more satisfied customer. So we're expecting a lot from Canada from all that we've done in 2011, it was a year of investment, it was a year of integration, it was a year of staffing and training. And at the end of the rainbow, the rewards are just terrific because it's going to provide for sustainable growth for us for years to come. As I said, we can operate 1,000 stores over the longer term in Canada.

We're still looking, although West Coast is one of our most populous areas, California, I think, our biggest state now. we're still looking at San Bernardino D.C. in Southern California there last year to help provide support for that growth. We still like the Southeast. We've expanded Savanna this past year because many stores we have in Florida then in the Southeast, we think there's room for more. The customers really like us there, and we've been able to serve them very well. So growth, I think, with that 10,000-square-foot footprint. The Deal$ stores are aimed largely at the more urban markets. It's a multi-price point, higher volume model that we're building there. It's one that can leverage those higher fixed cost that we have in say Brooklyn or in the Bronx or in the Northeast. So that we're seeing good results from there, we're seeing some leverage in there. We're seeing volume from those customers as we improve that model. Although some of them live in suburbia, you'll see  a lot of those being aimed at those urban city center kind of [indiscernible] whether it be Miami our Atlanta or New York, New Jersey.

And that part of our business is comping a little faster than our variety business. But it's the mix that works very, very well. As Bob mentioned, the buying trips for our import goods have gone very well, and we continue to come back with better IMU and the year prior, and we've said that consistently. So that bodes well for the year. So that helps us with that shift in mix a little bit. The other things that roll into that are kind of the wildcards are things like freight and you heard us talk to freight as far as what our assumptions are for the year. It's pretty hard to be able to predict what's going to happen with diesel special with some of the geopolitical issues out there. And as far as the ocean freight rate obviously, that's negotiated and we don't have those results yet. So I think all of those things kind of play together, but we think on an overall basis with our comp if we can continue to comp, that low- to mid-single-digit that, that helps us on the occupancy and distribution. And kind of the end of the day, kind of a flat gross profit margin. So that's kind of how we look at it, I think."

I'm pleased to report that our comparable store sales increased 7.3%. Driven primarily by increased traffic, this was our largest fourth quarter comparable sales increase since 1999 and a much smaller company. Total sales increased 12.8% to $1.95 billion. Earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.60 per diluted share. This represents a 24% increase over last year's $1.29 per share. Operating margin for the fourth quarter 2011 was 15.5%, an increase of 50 basis points over the fourth quarter last year, and net income rose 15.6% to $187.9 million.
For the full year fiscal 2011, comp store sales increased 6%. That's on top of a 6.3% comp store sales increase last year. And net sales were $6.63 billion, an increase of 12.7% over fiscal 2010. Earnings for the full year were $4.03 per diluted share, an increase of 24.8% compared with $3.23 per share last year. Notably, operating income increased by $125.8 million. Operating margin was 11.8%, an increase of 70 basis points compared with last year, and net income for the year rose 18% to $488.3 million. This was on top of a 29.1% increase in net income from prior year.
I'm very pleased with these results. They speak to the value and relevance of our merchandise, the power and flexibility of our model and the day-by-day execution of our strategy across the entire organization. Our stores were well stocked and merchandised. Our seasonal merchandise assortments exceeded customers' expectations for style and value. Seasonal transitions were well executed, and we were consistently in stock on basic items that customers need every day. On top of all that, weather was favorable throughout the quarter. As a result, customers continue to respond in record numbers. 
Sales growth in the fourth quarter came from a mix of both basic and discretionary products. The top-performing categories included food snacks and beverage, health and beauty care, housewares and home products, party supplies and, of course, seasonal merchandise.
The success of Dollar Tree, as it has always been, is based on our focus on the customer. We aim our efforts at increasing the value of the merchandise per dollar, improving the quality of our shopping environment and providing the infrastructure that supports the business. The Dollar Tree merchandising model is flexible, and we use this strategy of ever-changing assortments to our advantage. Our assortments are planned to offer the greatest value to the customer for $1 and to do so at a cost that delivers our required merchandise margin.
To the customer, this means there's always something new at Dollar Tree. As customers strive to balance their budgets, they can find the high-value basics they need while enjoying the Thrill-of-the-Hunt on every visit. Seasonal assortments are fresh, colorful and fun and provide merchandise energy in the stores. This strategic advantage has been validated by results. History shows that we are consistently able to manage through inflationary and deflationary cycles by changing the product or changing the source. 
Our merchants work every day to deliver an exciting assortment of products with the best values ever, and our planning allocations and replenishment organization direct it to the right stores. As a result, inventory productivity continues to improve. Inventory turns increased to 4.22 turns in 2011 compared with 4.17 turns in 2010. This is the seventh consecutive annual increase. 
Our store teams continue to consistently deliver on the promise of a clean, bright and fun place to shop. Seasonal transitions have been well executed with fresh and timely displays of merchandise for every season. In the fourth quarter, we executed quick transitions throughout Christmas and on the big game in Valentine's Day. We're now set for Dollar Days and St. Patrick's Day, and we're building for the Easter season.
As we continue to grow, we pay very close attention to our infrastructure needs. The Dollar Tree infrastructure has been built to be solid and scalable. This year, we expanded our distribution center in Savannah, Georgia from its original size of 600,000 square feet to 1 million square feet to support continued growth of our business in the Southeast. This project was completed on time and on budget with a total of $19.5 million of capital investment using existing cash.
As always, we plan to add capacity strategically to support our growth ahead of the need. In this regard, we're currently finalizing plans to increase our logistics capacity in the Northeast, and I expect these plans to be finalized over the next 3 months. Our current logistics infrastructure can support sales nationally up to $8 billion. It provides efficient service to our stores today and asset leverage as we continue to grow.
For the full year 2011, as planned, we opened 278 new stores and relocated and expanded 91 stores for a total of 369 projects. Selling square footage increased 6.9%, and we ended the year with 4,351 stores. Our plan for 2012 includes approximately 315 new stores and 75 relocations or expansions for a total of 390 projects in the U.S. and Canada.
We view growth opportunities in several ways. In addition to opening new Dollar Tree stores, we have a tremendous opportunity to expand categories, to grow new retail formats, to expand geographic reach and to open more productive stores. I'm pleased to say that we continue to make progress in store productivity. New store sales per square foot are increasing, driven by improved site selection, by rightsizing our stores to the market, by opening new stores earlier in the year, through improved staffing, building the bench of qualified store management and by emphasizing and expanding the most productive categories of merchandise. Average new store productivity increased once again in 2011 to the highest level in 10 years.
Our expansion of frozen and refrigerated product continues. We installed freezers and coolers in 376  net additional stores in 2011, including 125 new stores, and we now offer frozen and refrigerated products in 2,220 stores. This important category is extremely productive. It serves the current needs of our customers and it drives traffic into our stores, which provides incremental sales across all categories, including our higher-margin discretionary product. While faster-turning, lower-margin consumer products continue to lead the way and comp increases, our traffic has increased, and our overall comp increase has been the result of growth in both consumer products and in higher-margin variety merchandise.
In addition to opening new Dollar Tree stores, increasing new store productivity and expanding new categories like frozen and refrigerated, a key component of our growth strategy is the development of new retail formats and the expansion of our geographic reach. Deal$ is our multi-price format. At Deal$, not everything is a dollar, but everything is a value. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point, we can serve even more customers with more products and more categories. As we grow and refine the Deal$ concept, customers are responding favorably. More customers are finding us every day, comp sales are impressive and are the result of increases in both traffic and average ticket. We're excited about the growth potential of the concept and the opportunity that it gives us to serve even more customers across the country.
We opened 28 new Deal$ stores in 2011 and ended the year with a net total of 182 Deal$ stores. We plan to continue this growth rate in 2012.
Our expansion into Canada is proceeding and progressing. As you may recall, we acquired Dollar Giant in the fourth quarter of 2010. At the time, it was a chain of 86 stores. In 2011, we increased the store count by about 15%, and we ended fiscal 2011 with 99 stores in Canada. While short-term performance has lagged early expectations, our primary focus in 2011 was rationalizing merchandise assortments for the Canadian market, investing in infrastructure, integrating processes and staff, developing real estate plans and training and building store teams and merchandise teams for the future. Our goal in Canada is to operate on an identical platform to the merchandising and productivity systems that support the U.S. stores, and we've made great progress toward that goal in a short period of time. I'm very pleased. Highlights include aligning merchandise plans and working to solidify our logistics model in Canada. In addition, we are now supplying product to our stores using our U.S. WMS system through distribution centers in British Columbia and Ontario. We completed the installation and training of store-level POS and enterprise-level merchandising systems in the third quarter last year. This was a critical step in our plan as sales data from this system supports planning, allocations and replenishment. And we recently completed year-end SKU level inventories in all stores. With our core technology in place, we now have visibility to our sales, on-hand and on-order, by SKU in store. Equally important, we're building history by store SKU, all key factors in the management of an efficient supply chain.
With this information, we're beginning to roll out auto replenishment of basics and employing smart allocations of new and seasonal merchandise just as we do successfully in the U.S. And as we have experienced in the U.S., the result will be an improved flow of product to the stores on a timelier basis, allowing for more efficient store operations and increased level of in-stock of basic product, higher store productivity, increased inventory turns and an overall improvement in customer satisfaction. I'm extremely excited about the opportunity for Dollar Tree Canada. I'm proud of what was accomplished in only one year, and I know that we can do much better. We have a highly motivated and energetic team, and I'm confident that the results will be well worth the effort. 
This year, we intend to grow our Canadian store base approximately 25% under the Dollar Tree brand. And over the long term, we believe the Canadian market can support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores. This is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the U.S., plus additional growth in our Deal$ format.
Dollar Tree Direct, our E-Commerce business, is providing an opportunity to reach new customers through an additional channel distribution. New customers continue to discover Dollar Tree Direct every day. Traffic on the site grew to 4 million visitors in the fourth quarter. That was a 25% increase over the fourth quarter last year. We're using this opportunity to drive direct sales, expand the brand and to attract customers into our stores with the offer of high-value merchandise and free shipping for pick up in any of our stores across the country. 
Sales continue to grow as many customers prefer the convenience of online shopping, especially for larger quantities needed for parties or events or by small businesses and organizations. If you haven't had the opportunity, I would invite you to take a look at our site at www.dollartree.com.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin, who will give you more detail on our financial metrics and provide guidance."

As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 24% in the fourth quarter to $1.60. The increase resulted from our strong sales, a 20 basis point improvement in gross profit margin and a 30 basis point reduction in total SG&A expense compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Starting with gross profit, our gross profit margin grew to 37.8% during the fourth quarter compared with 37.6% in the fourth quarter last year. This is our highest gross profit margin since the fourth quarter of 2001.
We achieved strong leverage on our occupancy and distribution expenses, reflecting the 7.3% comp store sales growth, which more than offset the impacts of the continued shifts in product mix as basic consumable products increased by about 140 basis points as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter. The higher cost relative to sales of our Canadian stores and the impact on our shrink from our first SKU-based inventories of Dollar Tree Canada and a slight increase in our freight expense relative to sales as savings on ocean freight partially offset the impacts of diesel prices that average more than $0.62 per gallon above the same period last year.
SG&A expenses were 22.2% of sales for the quarter, which is a 30 basis point improvement from fourth quarter last year. This was driven primarily by a 20 basis point reduction in depreciation, a 10 basis point decline in payroll-related expenses due to increased store labor productivity and leverage on comp store sales, as well as lower utility costs, reflecting the milder winter weather. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in general liability insurance expense.
Debit and credit card fees were flat, reflecting growth in usage of these types of tender, offset by the lower legislated rates. In the fourth quarter, compared to the fourth quarter last year, debit card penetration increased 120 basis points and credit card penetration increased 30 basis points. SNAP penetration, although small, continues to grow. 
Operating income increased $43.3 million compared with the fourth quarter last year, and operating margin was 15.5%, an increase of 50 basis points from the fourth quarter last year and was the highest operating margin since 2002. For the full year, operating income increased $125.8 million, and our operating margin grew to 11.8%, up 70 basis points from last year's 11.1% operating margin. Dollar Tree's operating margin remains among the highest in the value retail sector.
The tax rate for the quarter was 37.7% versus 37% in the fourth quarter last year. The higher rate primarily reflects a lower percentage of state tax credits compared with the fourth quarter last year, which also included some benefit from the favorable tax treatment of the Ollie's dividend. For the full fiscal year, the tax rate was 37.4% compared with 36.9% in 2010. 
Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow, cash and investments at year end totaled $288.3 million versus $486 million at the end of fiscal 2010. During the fourth quarter, we invested $300 million for share repurchase through an ASR and repurchased 3.5 million shares. For the full year, we invested $645.9 million for the share repurchase and repurchased 8.7 million shares. 
The diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 117.6 million for the fourth quarter and 121.2 million for the full year of 2011. In October, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion for share repurchase. As of year end, we have $1.2 billion remaining in our authorization. We will continue to view share repurchase opportunistically, and we will update you on additional share repurchases, if any, at the end of the quarter in which they may occur. 
As Bob mentioned, our inventory turns increased in 2011 for the seventh consecutive year to 4.22, and this includes Canada. Consolidated inventory at year end was 8% greater than at the same time last year, and selling square footage grew by 6.9%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot increased by 1%. The slight increase in inventory on a per-square-foot basis supports the earlier Easter selling season, as well as inventory for new stores that are opening up early in Q1. We are well positioned as we begin the year and expect continued improvement in our inventory turns in 2012.
Capital expenditures were $53.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. This compares with $32 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year 2011, capital expenditures were $250.1 million compared with $178.7 million in 2010. For fiscal year 2012, we are planning consolidated capital expenditures to be in the range of $330 million to $340 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to 325 stores, IT system enhancements and approximately $80 million towards a new distribution center in the Northeast U.S. The total capital investment anticipated for this facility is approximately $95 million.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $44 million for the fourth quarter versus $42.1 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, depreciation was $164.2 million, a 25 basis point decrease from last year. For 2012, depreciation and amortization is estimated to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million.
Our guidance for 2012 includes a couple of assumptions. First, in regard to freight expense, we will soon be negotiating new ocean rates that become effective on May 1. As always, we cannot predict the outcome of these negotiations nor can anyone accurately predict the direction of diesel prices for the next year. For this reason, our guidance assumes that ocean freight rates and diesel prices will be similar to their current levels on average throughout fiscal 2012. Second, Easter is 2 weeks earlier this year. This represents about an $8 million sales challenge in the first quarter. Third, due to the retail calendar, 2012 will include 53 weeks, and the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. This is expected to add $120 million to $130 million in incremental sales and $0.13 to $0.15 of earnings per diluted share to the fourth quarter and the full year.
Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 38.4% for the first quarter and 37.7% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 116.9 million shares for the first quarter and 117.1 million shares for the full year. While we still see share repurchase as a good use of cash, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase. 
With that in mind, for the first quarter of 2012, we are forecasting sales in the range of $100 -- or $1.65 billion to $1.69 billion and diluted EPS in the range of $0.91 to $0.97, which represents an 11% to 18% increase compared to first quarter 2011 earnings of $0.82 per diluted share. The sales range implies a low- to mid-single-digit comparable store sales increase and store square footage of about 7%. 
For the full fiscal year of 2012, we are now forecasting sales in the range of $7.25 billion to $7.42 billion. Based on a low- to mid-single-digit increase in comparable store sales, 7.2% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.90, representing an increase of between 15% and 22% over our record earnings per share of $4.03 in fiscal 2011 and takes into account the 53rd week that will be included in the fourth quarter of 2012.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

Once again, I'm very pleased with our company's performance in fourth quarter and for the year. There were many notable accomplishments in 2011. Comp store sales increased 6%, and total sales grew 12.7%. We achieved record sales of over $6.6 billion, largely $1 at a time. Despite high fuel prices, operating margins increased by 70 basis points to 11.8%, the best in the past 11 years. And earnings per share increased by nearly 25% on top of a 36% increase in the prior year. In addition, this year, the company completed the expansion of our Savannah DC, a key element in supporting our continued growth in the Southeast. We opened 278 new stores and completed 91 relocations and expansions. We achieved the highest new store productivity in 10 years since 2001, when our average size store was much smaller. We gained traction growth and new customers with our Deal$ model. Comp sales at Deal$ benefited from both increased traffic and average ticket. In 2011, we built a solid foundation for growth in Canada. We expect Canadian performance to improve throughout the year, especially as we gain traction in the second half.
We made significant enhancements to Dollar Tree Direct, including break pack, Spanish language and mobile capability. We repurchased $645.9 million of stock in 2011, and we announced a renewed authorization from the board for an additional $1.5 billion of share repurchase, of which $1.2 billion remain. By any measure, it was an outstanding year, and I will tell you that we are singularly positioned to do even better in the future. I see great opportunity ahead for Dollar Tree because our stores, merchants and support teams are guided by a strategic vision that involves every element of the business revolving around the customer. Because the business model is powerful and flexible, tested by time and validated by results, we've proven that Dollar Tree can adapt to a changing environment. Through good and bad economic times, the company has consistently increased sales and earnings, and we've never been better positioned for continued growth and improvement.
The balanced mix of high-value consumer basics and the unique assortment of fun, seasonally correct discretionary products positions Dollar Tree stores to be relevant to customers in all economic circumstances. At Dollar Tree, yes, you can afford it. We have a solid and scalable infrastructure that we're leveraging for better inventory management, increasingly efficient supply chain logistics, more productive stores and crisper overall execution. And there's more to come. There are plenty of opportunities to grow our business: new Dollar Tree stores, more productive new stores, category expansion, new formats, Deal$ and Dollar Tree Direct and expanded geography. Canada provides an opportunity for substantial growth. All this provides a roadmap for sustained profitable growth. At Dollar Tree, we have a vision of where we want to go and the people and the infrastructure and capital to make it happen. 
2011 was another terrific year at Dollar Tree, and we're off to a great start in 2012.

One, with such a great quarter, our sales bonus incentive at the store level saw a nice increase, which is great. We love to reward our sales managers out there when they do a great job like they did in Q4. Also, we saw a little bit of an increase in our payroll tax line item. And then the other place we've been getting some benefit throughout the year was in health insurance. And as I spoke to it earlier in the year, I said we cannot expect, necessarily expect that to continue throughout the year. And we didn't see that in the fourth quarter.

It was a combination, I think and we believe, of both -- new customers finding us all the time. It's still pretty tough out there. Unemployment's high. We sell things people need every day, and it's only $1. And through word of mouth, they're learning about that, and they're trying us, and they're coming back then more often. So it's new customers, and I believe they're shopping with us -- I know they're shopping with us more often. The mix of consumer products that we have now, which is about 50% of our business, that's more frequently purchased. So people are coming back more often to buy that. I will tell you that when they're buying the consumer products, we're also seeing a lift in our variety merchandise. It's not growing as fast as the consumer products, but it's growing very significantly. So we're pleased with what we're getting from the traffic there. As far as new items, we're always adding new items. If you looked at our Christmas assortment this year, you saw just a lot of tremendous new merchandise, things you hadn't seen, at the Dollar store anyway, Dollar Tree for $1. You may have seen it in the department stores, but you wouldn't have seen it in a store like ours for only $1. The themed ornament wall that we had was all color-relevant and very timely to the business. We've added the little solar items with the dancing flowers and the solar stakes and all that we've done with that this year. That's all new merchandise. But we change about 50% of our assortment every year, every season, at least 50% every season, and 50% every year. So part of who we are is always that ever-changing assortment of new merchandise that adds fun and, as I call it, merchandise energy to the store. It adds opportunity or reason to come back more often. It's sort of what we call the Thrill-of-the-Hunt. So go in, take a look around. You're going to find something that you didn't see the last time. And the fronts of the stores, we pay particular attention to changing those out with our items of the week and our drive items, and of course, our seasonal sets in the front of the store are always changing."

We just came back from our important trip in January. As always, it was successful. Just the very nature of how we plan our business, we're always going to come back with hitting or exceeding our planned markup targets for the trip because that's the way we build our merchandise assortment, based on the cost. It's the most value that we can give the customer for $1 at a margin that we're willing to accept. So we just finished our January trip. It was very successful. Our markup is higher this year, and our value is even better than ever because not only was the -- I think I would characterize it as a more stable price environment in China versus a year ago. We've always been able to manage our margins because we're in control of it, but it felt like, just anecdotally, this year, that business is down a little bit in China. And we're good buyers and big buyers, and for that reason, we've got good relationships, and as a result, there did not seem to be as much pressure overall on the cost of the items. We were able to get the prices that we needed and increased the value at the same time, which is what we intend to do. If there is deflation in cost, we tend to put more value in the product because that's how we drive the sales. Our price is $1. Whether there's pressure on cost, inflation or deflation, our retail is still $1. So our goal then is to provide the most value for the $1 at the margins that we need. It was very favorable. I would characterize the January trip as very favorable. I'm excited about the new assortment coming in, not only in the second half but right now. Our spring business, I'm expecting some good results there. Easter looks really good out there. If you haven't been in one of our stores, it's really -- it's just starting to build. The Dollar Days promotion that we kicked off the year with is looking good, adds a lot of color to the front of our store. And our store teams, I will tell you, did the best job I've ever seen in transitioning from Christmas into the big game and then in the Dollar Days and now Easter and St. Patrick's Day. So kudos to those people, and our customers are responding very favorably to that. Thank you."

It's just sort of the way the rhythm of our business works. So this wasn't that unusual. But taking advantage of that traffic is really a big opportunity. Initiatives that we're focused on is all about the front of the store. From the time you walk in, to the first feature that to you see, the drive item, the item of the month, item of the week, changing those things out, we're really measuring the productivity of the fronts of our stores. We're looking in our checkouts, all the impulse locations on the checkouts, in front of the checkouts, the front-end caps that face the checkouts, that whole front aisle, we see as a huge opportunity with impulse and related sales and the chance to get that last one item sold from a customer. Throughout the store, you see a lot of related merchandise end caps and features. We're not only selling the paper towels, but we're selling the paper towel holder and the rest of the cleaning supplies and, just always, that suggestive selling on all of our features throughout the store. Clip strips, we've done a big job with clip strips. And getting those placed around the stores is productivity issue for our stores because it's a way of hanging a lot of merchandise in a pretty quick order, and also, it gets a lot of related sales out there throughout the store. So you're right. You're right on. There's a big opportunity to take advantage of this increased traffic that we have to raise that average ticket and also to keep these people coming back because we want to make sure that they enjoy the experience, the store is clean and seasonally relevant, the shelves are full, the basic in-stock is there. With gas prices going up, you don't want them to have to waste a trip to the store. I want them to have the glass cleaner and the dish detergent, the paper towels. Whatever they came for, we want to have that for them, and then while they're in the store, at every turn, we challenge them to buy another item."

Short term, we faced headwinds there of our own doing, but it was something that had to be done. The main headwinds that we faced in Canada this past year were around rationalizing the merchandise assortment, dropping some of the SKUs, adding new SKUs, adding the important piece that we do in the U.S., getting the basics in line. So there's a lot of turmoil in the assortment in Canada. And you always drop things faster than you get them added back. Plus we are in the process of setting up 2 new distribution centers and moving them, and as a result, we lost some sales and, as a result, lost some leverage on our occupancy cost. So that's one thing. The second thing was we did our SKU inventories. It was a first SKU inventory that's ever been done there. It's very critical to the way we're going to run the business, but we did that in fourth quarter, and shrink was a little higher than we expected. So the combination of those 2 things sort of teamed up and didn't meet my -- or met any of our expectations. But on the plus side, it was such great accomplishments that we've made in a short order. Maybe we didn't have any right to expect better than we had. We solidified the logistics model now, new DCs in BC and in Ontario. We've got the Dollar Tree WMS system in there. We have POS in the stores and all trained in all of the stores. We've got the SKU level inventories, and that's going to allow us to do a lot of things with allocations, smart allocations, putting the right product in the right stores based on sales, based on inventory. It's going to help us with replenishing the basics. It's going to take our store people in Canada a little more out of the reordering process and more into the merchandising process and filling the counters and running the cash registers. So we're really excited about what we've done and what that means for us in the future. The result of all that, as I said in the prepared remarks, is more timelier deliveries of product, more seasonally relevant stores because of the timelier deliveries. It's going to be a more effective store by knowing what -- having visibility of what's coming into the store. Our store teams can plan their payroll accordingly and get the product to the shelf faster. It'll make for a fuller and a funner store and a more complete store. And at the end of the day, it'll be a more satisfied customer. So we're expecting a lot from Canada from all that we've done in 2011. It was a year of investment. It was a year of integration. It was a year of staffing and training. And at the end of the rainbow, the rewards are just terrific because it's going to provide for sustainable growth for us for years to come. As I said, we can operate 1,000 stores over the longer term in Canada. So what does that mean? This year, I'm expecting improvement throughout the year, especially as we enter into second half and into fourth quarter."

And given our cash flow that we generate, that has made sense. We feel it is a great way to return value to our long-term shareholders. Historically, we have not been one necessarily to take on a lot of leverage in that regard. It's something we can think about and we do think about and we talk about as far as our overall capital structure. But it's one piece of an overall thought process as it relates to the capital structure. And again, we're going to have some larger outlays for capital expenditures this coming year with the upcoming expansion to a new DC up in the Northeast.

But somewhere around that 10,000 square foot is what we like to have. We like to place them where middle America works their shops, and that hasn't changed. We have a 48-state footprint, plus Canada now and the distribution capacity and the people and the systems to reach all of those. We're still looking at -- although West Coast is one of our most populous areas, California, I think, our biggest state now, we're still looking at growth in California. We built our new San Bernardino DC in Southern California there last year to help provide support for that growth. We still like the Southeast. We expanded Savannah this past year because, many stores as we have in Florida and in the Southeast, we think there's room for more. The customers really like us there, and we've been able to serve them very well, so growth, I think, with that 10,000-square-foot footprint. The Deal$ stores are aimed largely at the more urban markets. It's a multi-price point, higher-volume model that we're building there. It's one that can leverage those higher fixed costs that we have in, say, Brooklyn or the Bronx or in the Northeast. And we're seeing good results from there. We're seeing some leverage from there. We're seeing the volume from those customers as we improve that model, so although some of them live in suburbia, you'll see  a lot of those being aimed at those urban city center kind of markets, whether it be Miami our Atlanta or New York, New Jersey. So our real estate strategy is onward and upward. We have an economic model that we have to meet. We have -- we take strip centers. We take pre-standards, new construction when we can find it. There's been a little more -- seems like a little uptick in that lately, not much. But we take most any way, shape or form as long as it meets our demographic concerns, our size, constraints and also our economic model."

As Bob mentioned, the buying trips for our import goods have gone very well, and we continue to come back with better IMUs than the year prior, and we've said that consistently. So that bodes well for the year. So that helps us with that shift in mix a little bit. The other things that roll into that that are kind of the wildcards are things like freight, and you heard us talk to freight as far as what our assumptions are for the year. It's pretty hard to be able to predict what's going to happen with diesel, especially with some of the geopolitical issues out there. And as far as the ocean freight rate, obviously, that's negotiated, and we don't have those results yet. So I think all of those things kind of play together, but we think, on an overall basis, with our comp, if we can continue to comp, that low- to mid-single-digit, that that helps us on the occupancy and distribution. And kind of the end of the day, it kind of all comes out in the wash as kind of a flat gross profit margin. So that's kind of how we look at it, I think."

I'm pleased to report that our comparable store sales increased 7.3%. Driven primarily by increased traffic, this was our largest fourth quarter comparable sales increase since 1999 and a much smaller company. Total sales increased 12.8% to $1.95 billion. Earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.60 per diluted share. This represents a 24% increase over last year's $1.29 per share. Operating margin for the fourth quarter 2011 was 15.5%, an increase of 50 basis points over the fourth quarter last year, and net income rose 15.6% to $187.9 million.
For the full year fiscal 2011, comp store sales increased 6%. That's on top of a 6.3% comp store sales increase last year. And net sales were $6.63 billion, an increase of 12.7% over fiscal 2010. Earnings for the full year were $4.03 per diluted share, an increase of 24.8% compared with $3.23 per share last year. Notably, operating income increased by $125.8 million. Operating margin was 11.8%, an increase of 70 basis points compared with last year, and net income for the year rose 18% to $488.3 million. This was on top of a 29.1% increase in net income from prior year.
I'm very pleased with these results. They speak to the value and relevance of our merchandise, the power and flexibility of our model and the day-by-day execution of our strategy across the entire organization. Our stores were well stocked and merchandised. Our seasonal merchandise assortments exceeded the customers' expectations for style and value. Seasonal transitions were well executed, and we were consistently in stock on basic items that customers need every day. On top of all that, weather was favorable throughout the quarter. As a result, customers continue to respond in record numbers. 
Sales growth in the fourth quarter came from a mix of both basic and discretionary products. The top-performing categories included food snacks and beverage, health and beauty care, housewares and home products, party supplies and, of course, seasonal merchandise.
The success of Dollar Tree, as it has always been, is based on our focus on the customer. We aim our efforts at increasing the value of the merchandise per dollar, improving the quality of our shopping environment and providing the infrastructure that supports the business. The Dollar Tree merchandising model is flexible, and we use this strategy of ever-changing assortments to our advantage. Our assortments are planned to offer the greatest value to the customer for $1 and to do so at a cost that delivers our required merchandise margin.
To the customer, this means there's always something new at Dollar Tree. As customers strive to balance their budgets, they can find the high-value basics they need while enjoying the Thrill-of-the-Hunt on every visit. Seasonal assortments are fresh, colorful and fun and provide merchandise energy in the stores. This strategic advantage has been validated by results. History shows that we are consistently able to manage through inflationary and deflationary cycles by changing the product or changing the source. 
Our merchants work every day to deliver an exciting assortment of products with the best values ever, and our planning allocations and replenishment organization directs it to the right stores. As a result, inventory productivity continues to improve. Inventory turns increased to 4.22 turns in 2011 compared with 4.17 turns in 2010. This is the seventh consecutive annual increase. 
Our store teams continue to consistently deliver on the promise of a clean, bright and fun place to shop. Seasonal transitions have been well executed with fresh and timely displays of merchandise for every season. In the fourth quarter, we executed quick transitions throughout Christmas and on to big game and Valentine's Day. We're now set for Dollar Days and St. Patrick's Day, and we're building for the Easter season.
As we continue to grow, we pay very close attention to our infrastructure needs. The Dollar Tree infrastructure has been built to be solid and scalable. This year, we expanded our distribution center in Savannah, Georgia from its original size of 600,000 square feet to 1 million square feet to support continued growth of our business in the Southeast. This project was completed on time and on budget with a total of $19.5 million of capital investment using existing cash.
As always, we plan to add capacity strategically to support our growth ahead of the need. In this regard, we're currently finalizing plans to increase our logistics capacity in the Northeast, and I expect these plans to be finalized over the next 3 months. Our current logistics infrastructure can support sales nationally up to $8 billion. It provides efficient service to our stores today and asset leverage as we continue to grow.
For the full year 2011, as planned, we opened 278 new stores and relocated and expanded 91 stores for a total of 369 projects. Selling square footage increased 6.9%, and we ended the year with 4,351 stores. Our plan for 2012 includes approximately 315 new stores and 75 relocations or expansions for a total of 390 projects in the U.S. and Canada.
We view growth opportunities in several ways. In addition to opening new Dollar Tree stores, we have a tremendous opportunity to expand categories, to grow new retail formats, to expand geographic reach and to open more productive stores. I'm pleased to say that we continue to make progress in store productivity. New store sales per square foot are increasing, driven by improved site selection, by rightsizing our stores to the market, by opening new stores earlier in the year, through improved staffing, building the bench of qualified store management and by emphasizing and expanding the most productive categories of merchandise. Average new store productivity increased once again in 2011 to the highest level in 10 years.
Our expansion of frozen and refrigerated product continues. We installed freezers and coolers in 376  net additional stores in 2011, including 125 new stores, and we now offer frozen and refrigerated products in 2,220 stores. This important category is extremely productive. It serves the current needs of our customers and it drives traffic into our stores, which provides incremental sales across all categories, including our higher-margin discretionary product. While faster-turning, lower-margin consumer products continue to lead the way and comp increases, our traffic has increased, and our overall comp increase has been the result of growth in both consumer products and in higher-margin variety merchandise.
In addition to opening new Dollar Tree stores, increasing new store productivity and expanding new categories like frozen and refrigerated, a key component of our growth strategy is the development of new retail formats and the expansion of our geographic reach. Deal$ is our multi-price format. At Deal$, not everything is a dollar, but everything is a value. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point, we can serve even more customers with more products and more categories. As we grow and refine the Deal$ concept, customers are responding favorably. More customers are finding us every day, comp sales are impressive and are the result of increases in both traffic and average ticket. We're excited about the growth potential of the concept and the opportunity that it gives us to serve even more customers across the country. We opened 28 new Deal$ stores in 2011 and ended the year with a net total of 182 Deal$ stores. We plan to continue this growth rate in 2012.
Our expansion into Canada is proceeding and progressing. As you may recall, we acquired Dollar Giant in the fourth quarter of 2010. At the time, it was a chain of 86 stores. In 2011, we increased the store count by about 15%, and we ended fiscal 2011 with 99 stores in Canada. While short-term performance has lagged early expectations, our primary focus in 2011 was rationalizing merchandise assortments for the Canadian market, investing in infrastructure, integrating processes and staff, developing real estate plans and training and building store teams and merchandise teams for the future. Our goal in Canada is to operate on an identical platform to the merchandising and productivity systems that support the U.S. stores, and we've made great progress toward that goal in a short period of time. I'm very pleased. Highlights include aligning merchandise plans and working to solidify our logistics model in Canada. In addition, we are now supplying product to our stores using our U.S. WMS system through distribution centers in British Columbia and Ontario. We completed the installation and training of store-level POS and enterprise-level merchandising systems in the third quarter last year. This was a critical step in our plan as sales data from this system supports planning, allocations and replenishment. And we recently completed year-end SKU level inventories in all stores. With our core technology in place, we now have visibility to our sales, on-hand and on-order, by SKU in store. Equally important, we're building history by store and SKU, all key factors in the management of an efficient supply chain.
With this information, we're beginning to roll out auto replenishment of basics and employing smart allocations of new and seasonal merchandise just as we do successfully in the U.S. And as we have experienced in the U.S., the result will be an improved flow of product to the stores on a timelier basis, allowing for more efficient store operations and increased level of in-stock of basic product, higher store productivity, increased inventory turns and an overall improvement in customer satisfaction. I'm extremely excited about the opportunity for Dollar Tree Canada. I'm proud of what was accomplished in only one year, and I know that we can do much better. We have a highly motivated and energetic team, and I'm confident that the results will be well worth the effort. 
This year, we intend to grow our Canadian store base approximately 25% under the Dollar Tree brand. And over the long term, we believe the Canadian market can support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores. This is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the U.S., plus additional growth in our Deal$ format.
Dollar Tree Direct, our E-Commerce business, is providing an opportunity to reach new customers through an additional channel of distribution. New customers continue to discover Dollar Tree Direct every day. Traffic on the site grew to 4 million visitors in the fourth quarter. That was a 25% increase over the fourth quarter last year. We're using this opportunity to drive direct sales, expand the brand and to attract customers into our stores with the offer of high-value merchandise and free shipping for pick up in any of our stores across the country. 
Sales continue to grow as many customers prefer the convenience of online shopping, especially for larger quantities needed for parties or events or by small businesses and organizations. If you haven't had the opportunity, I would invite you to take a look at our site at www.dollartree.com.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin, who will give you more detail on our financial metrics and provide guidance."

As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 24% in the fourth quarter to $1.60. The increase resulted from our strong sales, a 20 basis point improvement in gross profit margin and a 30 basis point reduction in total SG&A expen",1253,"Thanks, Bob. As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 24% in the fourth quarter to $1.60. The increase resulted from our strong sales, a 20 basis point improvement in gross profit margin and a 30 basis point reduction in total SG&A expense compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Starting with gross profit, our gross profit margin grew to 37.8% during the fourth quarter compared with 37.6% in the fourth quarter last year. This is our highest gross profit margin since the fourth quarter of 2001.
We achieved strong leverage on our occupancy and distribution expenses, reflecting the 7.3% comp store sales growth, which more than offset the impacts of the continued shifts in product mix as basic consumable products increased by about 140 basis points as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter. The higher cost relative to sales of our Canadian stores and the impact on our shrink from our first SKU-based inventories of Dollar Tree Canada and a slight increase in our freight expense relative to sales as savings on ocean freight partially offset the impacts of diesel prices that averaged more than $0.62 per gallon above the same period last year.
SG&A expenses were 22.2% of sales for the quarter, which is a 30 basis point improvement from fourth quarter last year. This was driven primarily by a 20 basis point reduction in depreciation, a 10 basis point decline in payroll-related expenses due to increased store labor productivity and leverage on comp store sales, as well as lower utility costs, reflecting the milder winter weather. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in general liability insurance expense.
Debit and credit card fees were flat, reflecting growth in usage of these types of tender, offset by the lower legislated rates. In the fourth quarter, compared to the fourth quarter last year, debit card penetration increased 120 basis points and credit card penetration increased 30 basis points. SNAP penetration, although small, continues to grow. 
Operating income increased $43.3 million compared with the fourth quarter last year, and operating margin was 15.5%, an increase of 50 basis points from the fourth quarter last year and was the highest operating margin since 2002. For the full year, operating income increased $125.8 million, and our operating margin grew to 11.8%, up 70 basis points from last year's 11.1% operating margin. Dollar Tree's operating margin remains among the highest in the value retail sector.
The tax rate for the quarter was 37.7% versus 37% in the fourth quarter last year. The higher rate primarily reflects a lower percentage of state tax credits compared with the fourth quarter last year, which also included some benefit from the favorable tax treatment of the Ollie's dividend. For the full fiscal year, the tax rate was 37.4% compared with 36.9% in 2010. 
Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow, cash and investments at year end totaled $288.3 million versus $486 million at the end of fiscal 2010. During the fourth quarter, we invested $300 million for share repurchase through an ASR and repurchased 3.5 million shares. For the full year, we invested $645.9 million for the share repurchase and repurchased 8.7 million shares. 
The diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 117.6 million for the fourth quarter and 121.2 million for the full year of 2011. In October, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion for share repurchase. As of year end, we have $1.2 billion remaining in our authorization. We will continue to view share repurchase opportunistically, and we will update you on additional share repurchases, if any, at the end of the quarter in which they may occur. 
As Bob mentioned, our inventory turns increased in 2011 for the seventh consecutive year to 4.22, and this includes Canada. Consolidated inventory at year end was 8% greater than at the same time last year, and selling square footage grew by 6.9%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot increased by 1%. The slight increase in inventory on a per-square-foot basis supports the earlier Easter selling season, as well as inventory for new stores that are opening up early in Q1. We are well positioned as we begin the year and expect continued improvement in our inventory turns in 2012.
Capital expenditures were $53.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. This compares with $32 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year 2011, capital expenditures were $250.1 million compared with $178.7 million in 2010. For fiscal year 2012, we are planning consolidated capital expenditures to be in the range of $330 million to $340 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to 325 stores, IT system enhancements and approximately $80 million towards a new distribution center in the Northeast U.S. The total capital investment anticipated for this facility is approximately $95 million.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $44 million for the fourth quarter versus $42.1 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, depreciation was $164.2 million, a 25 basis point decrease from last year. For 2012, depreciation and amortization is estimated to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million.
Our guidance for 2012 includes a couple of assumptions. First, in regard to freight expense, we will soon be negotiating new ocean rates that become effective on May 1. As always, we cannot predict the outcome of these negotiations nor can anyone accurately predict the direction of diesel prices for the next year. For this reason, our guidance assumes that ocean freight rates and diesel prices will be similar to their current levels on average throughout fiscal 2012. Second, Easter is 2 weeks earlier this year. This represents about an $8 million sales challenge in the first quarter. Third, due to the retail calendar, 2012 will include 53 weeks, and the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. This is expected to add $120 million to $130 million in incremental sales and $0.13 to $0.15 of earnings per diluted share to the fourth quarter and the full year.
Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 38.4% for the first quarter and 37.7% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 116.9 million shares for the first quarter and 117.1 million shares for the full year. While we still see share repurchase as a good use of cash, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase. 
With that in mind, for the first quarter of 2012, we are forecasting sales in the range of $100 -- or $1.65 billion to $1.69 billion and diluted EPS in the range of $0.91 to $0.97, which would represent an 11% to 18% increase compared to first quarter 2011 earnings of $0.82 per diluted share. The sales range implies a low- to mid-single-digit comparable store sales increase and store square footage of about 7%. 
For the full fiscal year of 2012, we are now forecasting sales in the range of $7.25 billion to $7.42 billion. Based on a low- to mid-single-digit increase in comparable store sales, 7.2% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.90, representing an increase of between 15% and 22% over our record earnings per share of $4.03 in fiscal 2011 and takes into account the 53rd week that will be included in the fourth quarter of 2012.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

Once again, I'm very pleased with our company's performance in fourth quarter and for the year. There were many notable accomplishments in 2011. Comp store sales increased 6%, and total sales grew 12.7%. We achieved record sales of over $6.6 billion, largely $1 at a time. Despite high fuel prices, operating margins increased by 70 basis points to 11.8%, the best in the past 11 years. And earnings per share increased by nearly 25% on top of a 36% increase in the prior year. In addition, this year, the company completed the expansion of our Savannah DC, a key element in supporting our continued growth in the Southeast. We opened 278 new stores and completed 91 relocations and expansions. We achieved the highest new store productivity in 10 years since 2001, when our average size store was much smaller. We gained traction growth and new customers with our Deal$ model. Comp sales at Deal$ benefited from both increased traffic and average ticket. In 2011, we built a solid foundation for growth in Canada. We expect Canadian performance to improve throughout the year, especially as we gain traction in the second half.
We made significant enhancements to Dollar Tree Direct, including break pack, Spanish language and mobile capability. We repurchased $645.9 million of stock in 2011, and we announced a renewed authorization from the board for an additional $1.5 billion of share repurchase, of which $1.2 billion remain. By any measure, it was an outstanding year, and I will tell you that we are singularly positioned to do even better in the future. I see great opportunity ahead for Dollar Tree because our stores, merchants and support teams are guided by a strategic vision that involves every element of the business revolving around the customer. Because the business model is powerful and flexible, tested by time and validated by results, we've proven that Dollar Tree can adapt to a changing environment. Through good and bad economic times, the company has consistently increased sales and earnings, and we've never been better positioned for continued growth and improvement.
The balanced mix of high-value consumer basics and the unique assortment of fun, seasonally correct discretionary products positions Dollar Tree stores to be relevant to customers in all economic circumstances. At Dollar Tree, yes, you can afford it. We have a solid and scalable infrastructure that we're leveraging for better inventory management, increasingly efficient supply chain logistics, more productive stores and crisper overall execution. And there's more to come. There are plenty of opportunities to grow our business: new Dollar Tree stores, more productive new stores, category expansion, new formats, Deal$ and Dollar Tree Direct and expanded geography. Canada provides an opportunity for substantial growth. All this provides a roadmap for sustained profitable growth. At Dollar Tree, we have a vision of where we want to go and the people and the infrastructure and capital to make it happen. 
2011 was another terrific year at Dollar Tree, and we're off to a great start in 2012.

One, with such a great quarter, our sales bonus incentive at the store level saw a nice increase, which is great. We love to reward our sales managers out there when they do a great job like they did in Q4. Also, we saw a little bit of an increase in our payroll tax line item. And then the other place we've been getting some benefit throughout the year was in health insurance. And as I spoke to it earlier in the year, I said we cannot expect, necessarily expect that to continue throughout the year. And we didn't see that in the fourth quarter.

It was a combination, I think and we believe, of both -- new customers finding us all the time. It's still pretty tough out there. Unemployment's high. We sell things people need every day, and it's only $1. And through word of mouth, they're learning about that, and they're trying us, and they're coming back then more often. So it's new customers, and I believe they're shopping with us -- I know they're shopping with us more often. The mix of consumer products that we have now, which is about 50% of our business, that's more frequently purchased. So people are coming back more often to buy that. I will tell you that when they're in buying the consumer products, we're also seeing a lift in our variety merchandise. It's not growing as fast as the consumer products, but it's growing very significantly. So we're pleased with what we're getting from the traffic there. As far as new items, we're always adding new items. If you looked at our Christmas assortment this year, you saw just a lot of tremendous new merchandise, things you hadn't seen, at the Dollar store anyway, Dollar Tree for $1. You may have seen it in the department stores, but you wouldn't have seen it in a store like ours for only $1. The themed ornament wall that we had was all color-relevant and very timely to the business. We've added the little solar items with the dancing flowers and the solar stakes and all that we've done with that this year. That's all new merchandise. But we change about 50% of our assortment every year, every season, at least 50% every season, and 50% every year. So part of who we are is always that ever-changing assortment of new merchandise that adds fun and, as I call it, merchandise energy to the store. It adds opportunity or reason to come back more often. It's sort of what we call the Thrill-of-the-Hunt. So go in, take a look around. You're going to find something that you didn't see the last time. And the fronts of the stores, we pay particular attention to changing those out with our items of the week and our drive items, and of course, our seasonal sets in the front of the store are always changing."

We just came back from our import trip in January. As always, it was successful. Just the very nature of how we plan our business, we're always going to come back with -- hitting or exceeding our planned markup targets for the trip because that's the way we build our merchandise assortment, based on the cost. It's the most value that we can give the customer for $1 at a margin that we're willing to accept. So we just finished our January trip. It was very successful. Our markup is higher this year, and our value is even better than ever because not only was the -- I think I would characterize it as a more stable price environment in China versus a year ago. We've always been able to manage our margins because we're in control of it, but it felt like, just anecdotally, this year, that business is down a little bit in China. And we're good buyers and big buyers, and for that reason, we've got good relationships, and as a result, there did not seem to be as much pressure overall on the cost of the items. We were able to get the prices that we needed and increased the value at the same time, which is what we tend to do. If there is deflation in cost, we tend to put more value in the product because that's how we drive the sales. Our price is $1. Whether there's pressure on cost, inflation or deflation, our retail is still $1. So our goal then is to provide the most value for the $1 at the margins that we need. It was very favorable. I would characterize the January trip as very favorable. I'm excited about the new assortment coming in, not only in the second half but right now our spring business, I'm expecting some good results there. Easter looks really good out there. If you haven't been in one of our stores, it's really -- it's just starting to build. The Dollar Days promotion that we kicked off the year with is looking good, adds a lot of color to the front of our store. And our store teams, I will tell you, did the best job I've ever seen in transitioning from Christmas into the big game and then in the Dollar Days and now Easter and St. Patrick's Day.

From the time you walk in, to the first feature that to you see, the drive item, the item of the month, item of the week, changing those things out, we're really measuring the productivity of the fronts of our stores. We're looking at our checkouts, all the impulse locations on the checkouts, in front of the checkouts, the front-end caps that face the checkouts, that whole front aisle, we see as a huge opportunity with impulse and related sales and the chance to get that last one item sold from the customer. Throughout the store, you see a lot of related merchandise end caps and features. We're not only selling the paper towels, but we're selling the paper towel holder and the rest of the cleaning supplies and, just always, that suggestive selling on all of our features throughout the store. Clip strips, we've done a big job with clip strips. And getting those placed around the stores, its productivity issue for our stores because it's a way of hanging a lot of merchandise in a pretty quick order, and also, it gets a lot of related sales out there throughout the store. So you're right. You're right on. There's a big opportunity to take advantage of this increased traffic that we have to raise that average ticket and also to keep these people coming back because we want to make sure that they enjoy the experience, the store is clean, it’s seasonally relevant, the shelves are full, the basic in-stock is there. With gas prices going up, you don't want them to have to waste a trip to the store. I want them to have the glass cleaner and the dish detergent, the paper towels. Whatever they came for, we want to have that for them, and then while they're in the store, at every turn, we challenge them to buy another item."

I think as we look at the guidance we gave you, as I look at it for the year and you see the improvement in the operating margin, the expectation, I think, would be for the gross profit to be fairly flat and that we would potentially see the benefit and improvement in the SG&A side of our business.

So that is our longer-term goal. Obviously, we're going to continue to grow. We're going to continue to grow our store base, which is going to help us create leverage. We've done a good job leveraging our occupancy and distribution. We have done a pretty good job leveraging our SG&A and keeping that growth to a reasonable level. And again, from a gross profit standpoint, from a margin standpoint of product margin, it's important that we -- the value of our products is what is really important. And so if we do go through deflationary cycles, we don't put that in our pocket. We put it back into the product, and our customer really appreciates that, and that's what they look to us for.

We will be the only major, single-price point retailer at $1.25 quarter or less in Canada, and that's the focus that we have. The Dollar Trees that we open in Canada will be CAD $1.25. So we're really not changing that strategy. I think it's a good strategy. We like the single-price point strategy. We know how to do it single-price point strategy. And what we have to do is get the value equation right. That's why our Canadian team is extra important. And that's the reason that we wanted to partner up with a Canadian company versus just going greenfield is so that -- they do understand the margin equation, what CAD $1.25, what the value of that is. So as we're building these assortments, there's a little bit of difference in the value equation. We think it's stronger. We think it gives us a better opportunity, frankly, in Canada. Right now, the currency is at parity, but it hasn't always been. So this gives us the ability to manage the value for the CAD $1.25 and offer those customers even more value."

Short term, we faced headwinds there of our own doing, but it was something that had to be done. The main headwinds that we faced in Canada this past year were around rationalizing the merchandise assortment, dropping some of the SKUs, adding new SKUs, adding the important piece that we do in the U.S., getting the basics in line. So there's a lot of turmoil in the assortment in Canada. And you always drop things faster than you get them added back. Plus we are in the process of setting up 2 new distribution centers and moving them, and as a result, we lost some sales and that, as a result, lost some leverage on our occupancy cost. So that's one thing. The second thing was we did our SKU inventories. It was a first SKU inventory that ever been done there. It's very critical to the way we're going to run the business, but we did that in fourth quarter, and shrink was a little higher than we expected. So the combination of those 2 things sort of teamed up and didn't meet my expectation -- I don’t think met any of our expectations. But on the plus side, it was such great accomplishments that we made in a short order. Maybe we didn't have any right to expect better than we had. We solidified the logistics model now, new DCs in BC and in Ontario. We've got the Dollar Tree WMS system in there. We have POS in the stores and all trained in all of the stores. We've got the SKU level inventories, and that's going to allow us to do a lot of things with allocations, smart allocations, putting the right product in the right stores based on sales, based on inventory. It's going to help us with replenishing the basics. It's going to take our store people in Canada a little more out of the reordering process and more into the merchandising process and filling the counters and running the cash registers. So we're really excited about what we've done and what that means for us in the future. The result of all that, as I said in the prepared remarks, is more timelier deliveries of product, more seasonally relevant stores because of the timelier deliveries. It's going to be a more effective store by knowing what -- having visibility of what's coming into the store. Our store teams can plan their payroll accordingly and get the product to the shelf faster. It'll make for a fuller and a funner store and a more complete store. And at the end of the day, it'll be a more satisfied customer. So we're expecting a lot from Canada from all that we've done in 2011. It was a year of investment. It was a year of integration. It was a year of staffing and training. And at the end of the rainbow, the rewards are just terrific because it's going to provide for sustainable growth for us for years to come. As I said, we can operate 1,000 stores over the longer term in Canada. So what does that mean? This year, I'm expecting improvement throughout the year, especially as we enter into second half and into fourth quarter."

We have a 48-state footprint, plus Canada now and the distribution capacity and the people and the systems to reach all of those. We're still looking at -- although West Coast is one of our most populous areas, California, I think, our biggest state now, we're still looking at growth in California. We built our new San Bernardino DC in Southern California there last year to help provide support for that growth. We still like the Southeast. We expanded Savannah this past year because, as many stores as we have in Florida and in the Southeast, we think there's room for more. The customers really like us there, and we've been able to serve them very well, so growth, I think, with that 10,000-square-foot footprint. The Deal$ stores are aimed largely at the more urban markets. It's a multi-price point, higher-volume model that we're building there. It's one that can leverage those higher fixed costs that we have in, say, Brooklyn or the Bronx or in the Northeast. And we're seeing good results from there. We're seeing some leverage from there. We're seeing the volume from those customers as we improve that model, so although some of them live in suburbia, you'll see  a lot of those being aimed at those urban city center kind of markets, whether it be Miami our Atlanta or New York, New Jersey. So our real estate strategy is onward and upward. We have an economic model that we have to meet. We have -- we take strip centers. We take pre-standards, new construction when we can find it. There's been a little more -- seems like a little uptick in that lately, not much.

As Bob mentioned, the buying trips for our import goods have gone very well, and we continue to come back with better IMUs than the year prior, and we've said that consistently. So that bodes well for the year. So that helps us with that shift in mix a little bit. The other things that roll into that that are kind of the wildcards are things like freight, and you heard us talk to freight as far as what our assumptions are for the year. It's pretty hard to be able to predict what's going to happen with diesel, especially with some of the geopolitical issues out there. And as far as the ocean freight rate, obviously, that's negotiated, and we don't have those results yet. So I think all of those things kind of play together, but we think, on an overall basis, with our comp, if we can continue to comp, that low- to mid-single-digit, that that helps us on the occupancy and distribution. And kind of the end of the day, it kind of all comes out in the wash as kind of a flat gross profit margin. So that's kind of how we look at it, I think."

Our call today will be led by Bob Sasser, our President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide insights on our performance in the quarter and recent developments in our business. Kevin Wampler, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our fourth quarter financial performance and provide guidance for 2012.

We have no obligation to update our forward-looking statements, and you should not expect us to do so.
In addition, as we have previously disclosed, in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we recorded a nonrecurring noncash charge of $26.3 million or $0.13 per diluted share relating to a change in retail inventory accounting. Diluted earnings per share in the full year of 2010 were $3.10, including this charge.

I'm pleased to report that our comparable store sales increased 7.3%. Driven primarily by increased traffic, this was our largest fourth quarter comparable sales increase since 1999 and a much smaller company. Total sales increased 12.8% to $1.95 billion. Earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.60 per diluted share. This represents a 24% increase over last year's $1.29 per share. Operating margin for the fourth quarter 2011 was 15.5%, an increase of 50 basis points over the fourth quarter last year, and net income rose 15.6% to $187.9 million.
For the full year fiscal 2011, comp store sales increased 6%. That's on top of a 6.3% comp store sales increase last year. And net sales were $6.63 billion, an increase of 12.7% over fiscal 2010. Earnings for the full year were $4.03 per diluted share, an increase of 24.8% compared with $3.23 per share last year. Notably, operating income increased by $125.8 million. Operating margin was 11.8%, an increase of 70 basis points compared with last year, and net income for the year rose 18% to $488.3 million. This was on top of a 29.1% increase in net income from prior year.
I'm very pleased with these results. They speak to the value and relevance of our merchandise, the power and flexibility of our model and the day-by-day execution of our strategy across the entire organization. Our stores were well stocked and merchandised. Our seasonal merchandise assortments exceeded the customers' expectations for style and value. Seasonal transitions were well executed, and we were consistently in stock on basic items that customers need every day. On top of all that, weather was favorable throughout the quarter. As a result, customers continue to respond in record numbers. 
Sales growth in the fourth quarter came from a mix of both basic and discretionary products. The top-performing categories included food snacks and beverage, health and beauty care, housewares and home products, party supplies and, of course, seasonal merchandise.
The success of Dollar Tree, as it has always been, is based on our focus on the customer. We aim our efforts at increasing the value of the merchandise per dollar, improving the quality of our shopping environment and providing the infrastructure that supports the business. The Dollar Tree merchandising model is flexible, and we use this strategy of ever-changing assortments to our advantage. Our assortments are planned to offer the greatest value to the customer for $1 and to do so at a cost that delivers our required merchandise margin.
To the customer, this means there's always something new at Dollar Tree. As customers strive to balance their budgets, they can find the high-value basics they need while enjoying the Thrill-of-the-Hunt on every visit. Seasonal assortments are fresh, colorful and fun and provide merchandise energy in the stores. This strategic advantage has been validated by results. History shows that we are consistently able to manage through inflationary and deflationary cycles by changing the product or changing the source. 
Our merchants work every day to deliver an exciting assortment of products with the best values ever, and our planning allocations and replenishment organization directs it to the right stores. As a result, inventory productivity continues to improve. Inventory turns increased to 4.22 turns in 2011 compared with 4.17 turns in 2010. This is the seventh consecutive annual increase. 
Our store teams continue to consistently deliver on the promise of a clean, bright and fun place to shop. Seasonal transitions have been well executed with fresh and timely displays of merchandise for every season. In the fourth quarter, we executed quick transitions throughout Christmas and on to big game and Valentine's Day. We're now set for Dollar Days and St. Patrick's Day, and we're building for the Easter season.
As we continue to grow, we pay very close attention to our infrastructure needs. The Dollar Tree infrastructure has been built to be solid and scalable. This year, we expanded our distribution center in Savannah, Georgia from its original size of 600,000 square feet to 1 million square feet to support continued growth of our business in the Southeast. This project was completed on time and on budget with a total of $19.5 million of capital investment using existing cash.
As always, we plan to add capacity strategically to support our growth ahead of the need. In this regard, we're currently finalizing plans to increase our logistics capacity in the Northeast, and I expect these plans to be finalized over the next 3 months. Our current logistics infrastructure can support sales nationally up to $8 billion. It provides efficient service to our stores today and asset leverage as we continue to grow.
For the full year 2011, as planned, we opened 278 new stores and relocated and expanded 91 stores for a total of 369 projects. Selling square footage increased 6.9%, and we ended the year with 4,351 stores. Our plan for 2012 includes approximately 315 new stores and 75 relocations or expansions for a total of 390 projects in the U.S. and Canada.
We view growth opportunities in several ways. In addition to opening new Dollar Tree stores, we have a tremendous opportunity to expand categories, to grow new retail formats, to expand geographic reach and to open more productive stores. I'm pleased to say that we continue to make progress in store productivity. New store sales per square foot are increasing, driven by improved site selection, by rightsizing our stores to the market, by opening new stores earlier in the year, through improved staffing, building the bench of qualified store management and by emphasizing and expanding the most productive categories of merchandise. Average new store productivity increased once again in 2011 to the highest level in 10 years.
Our expansion of frozen and refrigerated product continues. We installed freezers and coolers in 376  net additional stores in 2011, including 125 new stores, and we now offer frozen and refrigerated products in 2,220 stores. This important category is extremely productive. It serves the current needs of our customers and it drives traffic into our stores, which provides incremental sales across all categories, including our higher-margin discretionary product. While faster-turning, lower-margin consumer products continue to lead the way and comp increases, our traffic has increased, and our overall comp increase has been the result of growth in both consumer products and in higher-margin variety merchandise.
In addition to opening new Dollar Tree stores, increasing new store productivity and expanding new categories like frozen and refrigerated, a key component of our growth strategy is the development of new retail formats and the expansion of our geographic reach. Deal$ is our multi-price format. At Deal$, not everything is a dollar, but everything is a value. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point, we can serve even more customers with more products and more categories. As we grow and refine the Deal$ concept, customers are responding favorably. More customers are finding us every day, comp sales are impressive and are the result of increases in both traffic and average ticket. We're excited about the growth potential of the concept and the opportunity that it gives us to serve even more customers across the country. We opened 28 new Deal$ stores in 2011 and ended the year with a net total of 182 Deal$ stores. We plan to continue this growth rate in 2012.
Our expansion into Canada is proceeding and progressing. As you may recall, we acquired Dollar Giant in the fourth quarter of 2010. At the time, it was a chain of 86 stores. In 2011, we increased the store count by about 15%, and we ended fiscal 2011 with 99 stores in Canada. While short-term performance has lagged early expectations, our primary focus in 2011 was rationalizing merchandise assortments for the Canadian market, investing in infrastructure, integrating processes and staff, developing real estate plans and training and building store teams and merchandise teams for the future. Our goal in Canada is to operate on an identical platform to the merchandising and productivity systems that support the U.S. stores, and we've made great progress toward that goal in a short period of time. I'm very pleased. Highlights include aligning merchandise plans and working to solidify our logistics model in Canada. In addition, we are now supplying product to our stores using our U.S. WMS system through distribution centers in British Columbia and Ontario. We completed the installation and training of store-level POS and enterprise-level merchandising systems in the third quarter last year. This was a critical step in our plan as sales data from this system supports planning, allocations and replenishment. And we recently completed year-end SKU level inventories in all stores. With our core technology in place, we now have visibility to our sales, on-hand and on-order, by SKU in store. Equally important, we're building history by store and SKU, all key factors in the management of an efficient supply chain.
With this information, we're beginning to roll out auto replenishment of basics and employing smart allocations of new and seasonal merchandise just as we do successfully in the U.S. And as we have experienced in the U.S., the result will be an improved flow of product to the stores on a timelier basis, allowing for more efficient store operations and increased level of in-stock of basic product, higher store productivity, increased inventory turns and an overall improvement in customer satisfaction. I'm extremely excited about the opportunity for Dollar Tree Canada. I'm proud of what was accomplished in only one year, and I know that we can do much better. We have a highly motivated and energetic team, and I'm confident that the results will be well worth the effort. 
This year, we intend to grow our Canadian store base approximately 25% under the Dollar Tree brand. And over the long term, we believe the Canadian market can support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores. This is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the U.S., plus additional growth in our Deal$ format.
Dollar Tree Direct, our E-Commerce business, is providing an opportunity to reach new customers through an additional channel of distribution. New customers continue to discover Dollar Tree Direct every day. Traffic on the site grew to 4 million visitors in the fourth quarter. That was a 25% increase over the fourth quarter last year. We're using this opportunity to drive direct sales, expand the brand and to attract customers into our stores with the offer of high-value merchandise and free shipping for pick up in any of our stores across the country. 
Sales continue to grow as many customers prefer the convenience of online shopping, especially for larger quantities needed for parties or events or by small businesses and organizations. If you haven't had the opportunity, I would invite you to take a look at our site at www.dollartree.com.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin, who will give you more detail on our financial metrics and provide guidance."

As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 24% in the fourth quarter to $1.60. The increase resulted from our strong sales, a 20 basis point improvement in gross profit margin and a 30 basis point reduction in total SG&A expense compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Starting with gross profit, our gross profit margin grew to 37.8% during the fourth quarter compared with 37.6% in the fourth quarter last year. This is our highest gross profit margin since the fourth quarter of 2001.
We achieved strong leverage on our occupancy and distribution expenses, reflecting the 7.3% comp store sales growth, which more than offset the impacts of the continued shifts in product mix as basic consumable products increased by about 140 basis points as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter. The higher cost relative to sales of our Canadian stores and the impact on our shrink from our first SKU-based inventories of Dollar Tree Canada and a slight increase in our freight expense relative to sales as savings on ocean freight partially offset the impacts of diesel prices that averaged more than $0.62 per gallon above the same period last year.
SG&A expenses were 22.2% of sales for the quarter, which is a 30 basis point improvement from fourth quarter last year. This was driven primarily by a 20 basis point reduction in depreciation, a 10 basis point decline in payroll-related expenses due to increased store labor productivity and leverage on comp store sales, as well as lower utility costs, reflecting the milder winter weather. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in general liability insurance expense.
Debit and credit card fees were flat, reflecting growth in usage of these types of tender, offset by the lower legislated rates. In the fourth quarter, compared to the fourth quarter last year, debit card penetration increased 120 basis points and credit card penetration increased 30 basis points. SNAP penetration, although small, continues to grow. 
Operating income increased $43.3 million compared with the fourth quarter last year, and operating margin was 15.5%, an increase of 50 basis points from the fourth quarter last year and was the highest operating margin since 2002. For the full year, operating income increased $125.8 million, and our operating margin grew to 11.8%, up 70 basis points from last year's 11.1% operating margin. Dollar Tree's operating margin remains among the highest in the value retail sector.
The tax rate for the quarter was 37.7% versus 37% in the fourth quarter last year. The higher rate primarily reflects a lower percentage of state tax credits compared with the fourth quarter last year, which also included some benefit from the favorable tax treatment of the Ollie's dividend. For the full fiscal year, the tax rate was 37.4% compared with 36.9% in 2010. 
Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow, cash and investments at year end totaled $288.3 million versus $486 million at the end of fiscal 2010. During the fourth quarter, we invested $300 million for share repurchase through an ASR and repurchased 3.5 million shares. For the full year, we invested $645.9 million for the share repurchase and repurchased 8.7 million shares. 
The diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 117.6 million for the fourth quarter and 121.2 million for the full year of 2011. In October, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion for share repurchase. As of year end, we have $1.2 billion remaining in our authorization. We will continue to view share repurchase opportunistically, and we will update you on additional share repurchases, if any, at the end of the quarter in which they may occur. 
As Bob mentioned, our inventory turns increased in 2011 for the seventh consecutive year to 4.22, and this includes Canada. Consolidated inventory at year end was 8% greater than at the same time last year, and selling square footage grew by 6.9%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot increased by 1%. The slight increase in inventory on a per-square-foot basis supports the earlier Easter selling season, as well as inventory for new stores that are opening up early in Q1. We are well positioned as we begin the year and expect continued improvement in our inventory turns in 2012.
Capital expenditures were $53.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. This compares with $32 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year 2011, capital expenditures were $250.1 million compared with $178.7 million in 2010. For fiscal year 2012, we are planning consolidated capital expenditures to be in the range of $330 million to $340 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to 325 stores, IT system enhancements and approximately $80 million towards a new distribution center in the Northeast U.S. The total capital investment anticipated for this facility is approximately $95 million.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $44 million for the fourth quarter versus $42.1 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, depreciation was $164.2 million, a 25 basis point decrease from last year. For 2012, depreciation and amortization is estimated to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million.
Our guidance for 2012 includes a couple of assumptions. First, in regard to freight expense, we will soon be negotiating new ocean rates that become effective on May 1. As always, we cannot predict the outcome of these negotiations nor can anyone accurately predict the direction of diesel prices for the next year. For this reason, our guidance assumes that ocean freight rates and diesel prices will be similar to their current levels on average throughout fiscal 2012. Second, Easter is 2 weeks earlier this year. This represents about an $8 million sales challenge in the first quarter. Third, due to the retail calendar, 2012 will include 53 weeks, and the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. This is expected to add $120 million to $130 million in incremental sales and $0.13 to $0.15 of earnings per diluted share to the fourth quarter and the full year.
Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 38.4% for the first quarter and 37.7% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 116.9 million shares for the first quarter and 117.1 million shares for the full year. While we still see share repurchase as a good use of cash, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase. 
With that in mind, for the first quarter of 2012, we are forecasting sales in the range of $100 -- or $1.65 billion to $1.69 billion and diluted EPS in the range of $0.91 to $0.97, which would represent an 11% to 18% increase compared to first quarter 2011 earnings of $0.82 per diluted share. The sales range implies a low- to mid-single-digit comparable store sales increase and store square footage of about 7%. 
For the full fiscal year of 2012, we are now forecasting sales in the range of $7.25 billion to $7.42 billion. Based on a low- to mid-single-digit increase in comparable store sales, 7.2% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.90, representing an increase of between 15% and 22% over our record earnings per share of $4.03 in fiscal 2011 and takes into account the 53rd week that will be included in the fourth quarter of 2012.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

Once again, I'm very pleased with our company's performance in fourth quarter and for the year. There were many notable accomplishments in 2011. Comp store sales increased 6%, and total sales grew 12.7%. We achieved record sales of over $6.6 billion, largely $1 at a time. Despite high fuel prices, operating margins increased by 70 basis points to 11.8%, the best in the past 11 years. And earnings per share increased by nearly 25% on top of a 36% increase in the prior year. In addition, this year, the company completed the expansion of our Savannah DC, a key element in supporting our continued growth in the Southeast. We opened 278 new stores and completed 91 relocations and expansions. We achieved the highest new store productivity in 10 years since 2001, when our average size store was much smaller. We gained traction growth and new customers with our Deal$ model. Comp sales at Deal$ benefited from both increased traffic and average ticket. In 2011, we built a solid foundation for growth in Canada. We expect Canadian performance to improve throughout the year, especially as we gain traction in the second half.
We made significant enhancements to Dollar Tree Direct, including break pack, Spanish language and mobile capability. We repurchased $645.9 million of stock in 2011, and we announced a renewed authorization from the board for an additional $1.5 billion of share repurchase, of which $1.2 billion remain. By any measure, it was an outstanding year, and I will tell you that we are singularly positioned to do even better in the future. I see great opportunity ahead for Dollar Tree because our stores, merchants and support teams are guided by a strategic vision that involves every element of the business revolving around the customer. Because the business model is powerful and flexible, tested by time and validated by results, we've proven that Dollar Tree can adapt to a changing environment. Through good and bad economic times, the company has consistently increased sales and earnings, and we've never been better positioned for continued growth and improvement.
The balanced mix of high-value consumer basics and the unique assortment of fun, seasonally correct discretionary products positions Dollar Tree stores to be relevant to customers in all economic circumstances. At Dollar Tree, yes, you can afford it. We have a solid and scalable infrastructure that we're leveraging for better inventory management, increasingly efficient supply chain logistics, more productive stores and crisper overall execution. And there's more to come. There are plenty of opportunities to grow our business: new Dollar Tree stores, more productive new stores, category expansion, new formats, Deal$ and Dollar Tree Direct and expanded geography. Canada provides an opportunity for substantial growth. All this provides a roadmap for sustained profitable growth. At Dollar Tree, we have a vision of where we want to go and the people and the infrastructure and capital to make it happen. 
2011 was another terrific year at Dollar Tree, and we're off to a great start in 2012.

You may have seen it in the department stores, but you wouldn't have seen it in a store like ours for only $1. The themed ornament wall that we had was all color-relevant and very timely to the business. We've added the little solar items with the dancing flowers and the solar stakes and all that we've done with that this year. That's all new merchandise. But we change about 50% of our assortment every year, every season, at least 50% every season, and 50% every year. So part of who we are is always that ever-changing assortment of new merchandise that adds fun and, as I call it, merchandise energy to the store. It adds opportunity or reason to come back more often. It's sort of what we call the Thrill-of-the-Hunt. So go in, take a look around. You're going to find something that you didn't see the last time. And the fronts of the stores, we pay particular attention to changing those out with our items of the week and our drive items, and of course, our seasonal sets in the front of the store are always changing."

We just came back from our import trip in January. As always, it was successful. Just the very nature of how we plan our business, we're always going to come back with -- hitting or exceeding our planned markup targets for the trip because that's the way we build our merchandise assortment, based on the cost. It's the most value that we can give the customer for $1 at a margin that we're willing to accept. So we just finished our January trip. It was very successful. Our markup is higher this year, and our value is even better than ever because not only was the -- I think I would characterize it as a more stable price environment in China versus a year ago. We've always been able to manage our margins because we're in control of it, but it felt like, just anecdotally, this year, that business is down a little bit in China. And we're good buyers and big buyers, and for that reason, we've got good relationships, and as a result, there did not seem to be as much pressure overall on the cost of the items. We were able to get the prices that we needed and increased the value at the same time, which is what we tend to do. If there is deflation in cost, we tend to put more value in the product because that's how we drive the sales. Our price is $1. Whether there's pressure on cost, inflation or deflation, our retail is still $1. So our goal then is to provide the most value for the $1 at the margins that we need. It was very favorable. I would characterize the January trip as very favorable. I'm excited about the new assortment coming in, not only in the second half but right now our spring business, I'm expecting some good results there. Easter looks really good out there. If you haven't been in one of our stores, it's really -- it's just starting to build. The Dollar Days promotion that we kicked off the year with is looking good, adds a lot of color to the front of our store. And our store teams, I will tell you, did the best job I've ever seen in transitioning from Christmas into the big game and then in the Dollar Days and now Easter and St. Patrick's Day. So kudos to those people, and our customers are responding very favorably to that. Thank you."

It's just sort of the way the rhythm of our business works. So this wasn't that unusual. But taking advantage of that traffic is really a big opportunity. Initiatives that we're focused on is all about the front of the store. From the time you walk in, to the first feature that to you see, the drive item, the item of the month, item of the week, changing those things out, we're really measuring the productivity of the fronts of our stores. We're looking at our checkouts, all the impulse locations on the checkouts, in front of the checkouts, the front-end caps that face the checkouts, that whole front aisle, we see as a huge opportunity with impulse and related sales and the chance to get that last one item sold from the customer. Throughout the store, you see a lot of related merchandise end caps and features. We're not only selling the paper towels, but we're selling the paper towel holder and the rest of the cleaning supplies and, just always, that suggestive selling on all of our features throughout the store. Clip strips, we've done a big job with clip strips. And getting those placed around the stores, its productivity issue for our stores because it's a way of hanging a lot of merchandise in a pretty quick order, and also, it gets a lot of related sales out there throughout the store. So you're right. You're right on. There's a big opportunity to take advantage of this increased traffic that we have to raise that average ticket and also to keep these people coming back because we want to make sure that they enjoy the experience, the store is clean, it’s seasonally relevant, the shelves are full, the basic in-stock is there. With gas prices going up, you don't want them to have to waste a trip to the store. I want them to have the glass cleaner and the dish detergent, the paper towels. Whatever they came for, we want to have that for them, and then while they're in the store, at every turn, we challenge them to buy another item."

So we're really not changing that strategy. I think it's a good strategy. We like the single-price point strategy. We know how to do it single-price point strategy. And what we have to do is get the value equation right. That's why our Canadian team is extra important. And that's the reason that we wanted to partner up with a Canadian company versus just going greenfield is so that -- they do understand the margin equation, what CAD $1.25, what the value of that is.

Short term, we faced headwinds there of our own doing, but it was something that had to be done. The main headwinds that we faced in Canada this past year were around rationalizing the merchandise assortment, dropping some of the SKUs, adding new SKUs, adding the important piece that we do in the U.S., getting the basics in line. So there's a lot of turmoil in the assortment in Canada. And you always drop things faster than you get them added back. Plus we are in the process of setting up 2 new distribution centers and moving them, and as a result, we lost some sales and that, as a result, lost some leverage on our occupancy cost. So that's one thing. The second thing was we did our SKU inventories. It was a first SKU inventory that ever been done there. It's very critical to the way we're going to run the business, but we did that in fourth quarter, and shrink was a little higher than we expected. So the combination of those 2 things sort of teamed up and didn't meet my expectation -- I don’t think met any of our expectations. But on the plus side, it was such great accomplishments that we made in a short order. Maybe we didn't have any right to expect better than we had. We solidified the logistics model now, new DCs in BC and in Ontario. We've got the Dollar Tree WMS system in there. We have POS in the stores and all trained in all of the stores. We've got the SKU level inventories, and that's going to allow us to do a lot of things with allocations, smart allocations, putting the right product in the right stores based on sales, based on inventory. It's going to help us with replenishing the basics. It's going to take our store people in Canada a little more out of the reordering process and more into the merchandising process and filling the counters and running the cash registers. So we're really excited about what we've done and what that means for us in the future. The result of all that, as I said in the prepared remarks, is more timelier deliveries of product, more seasonally relevant stores because of the timelier deliveries. It's going to be a more effective store by knowing what -- having visibility of what's coming into the store. Our store teams can plan their payroll accordingly and get the product to the shelf faster. It'll make for a fuller and a funner store and a more complete store. And at the end of the day, it'll be a more satisfied customer. So we're expecting a lot from Canada from all that we've done in 2011. It was a year of investment. It was a year of integration. It was a year of staffing and training. And at the end of the rainbow, the rewards are just terrific because it's going to provide for sustainable growth for us for years to come. As I said, we can operate 1,000 stores over the longer term in Canada. So what does that mean? This year, I'm expecting improvement throughout the year, especially as we enter into second half and into fourth quarter."

We built our new San Bernardino DC in Southern California there last year to help provide support for that growth. We still like the Southeast. We expanded Savannah this past year because, as many stores as we have in Florida and in the Southeast, we think there's room for more. The customers really like us there, and we've been able to serve them very well, so growth, I think, with that 10,000-square-foot footprint. The Deal$ stores are aimed largely at the more urban markets. It's a multi-price point, higher-volume model that we're building there. It's one that can leverage those higher fixed costs that we have in, say, Brooklyn or the Bronx or in the Northeast. And we're seeing good results from there. We're seeing some leverage from there. We're seeing the volume from those customers as we improve that model, so although some of them live in suburbia, you'll see  a lot of those being aimed at those urban city center kind of markets, whether it be Miami our Atlanta or New York, New Jersey. So our real estate strategy is onward and upward. We have an economic model that we have to meet. We have -- we take strip centers. We take pre-standards, new construction when we can find it.

I think our customer, obviously, is looking for those goods, those basic everyday consumables, and we're providing that. And that part of our business is comping a little faster than our variety business. But it's the mix that works very, very well. As Bob mentioned, the buying trips for our import goods have gone very well, and we continue to come back with better IMUs than the year prior, and we've said that consistently. So that bodes well for the year. So that helps us with that shift in mix a little bit. The other things that roll into that that are kind of the wildcards are things like freight, and you heard us talk to freight as far as what our assumptions are for the year. It's pretty hard to be able to predict what's going to happen with diesel, especially with some of the geopolitical issues out there. And as far as the ocean freight rate, obviously, that's negotiated, and we don't have those results yet. So I think all of those things kind of play together, but we think, on an overall basis, with our comp, if we can continue to comp, that low- to mid-single-digit, that that helps us on the occupancy and distribution. And kind of the end of the day, it kind of all comes out in the wash as kind of a flat gross profit margin. So that's kind of how we look at it, I think."

We're in the process right now of developing a new delivery model. It's not necessarily more people. It's more people at the right time doing the right things, and so it's higher volume in these city locations. But it's also a tougher model to run. You've got to -- how do you get the freight in the door, on the shelf, the cardboard out the door and out at the street. And if other people have done it, we can do it, too. And we're learning that. As a matter of fact, I was up in New York last week, looking at a new delivery method coming into the city. That looks like it's going to have a lot of -- certainly, the stores are liking it a lot because it comes in more sorted and ready to go to the shelf versus the way we do it in the suburban stores. But the answer to your question is we do have some improvements to be made in how we deliver our stores in tri-state area, these higher-volume stores, how we manage the stores in those areas, how you manage the volume, how you manage the waste, all the things. When you're doing more volume, everything is more. So that's one of the things we're trying to master right now."

Comp store sales increased 5.6% in the quarter",1936,"Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced first quarter 2012 earnings of $1 per diluted share. This represents a 22% increase over the first quarter 2011 earnings of $0.82 per share. Comp store sales increased 5.6% in the quarter, and total sales grew 11.5% to $1.72 billion. Operating income increased by $26.3 million. Operating margin was 10.9%, an increase of 40 basis points compared with the 10.5% operating margin in the first quarter last year. And net income increased 15% to $116.1 million. I want to begin by saying that I'm very pleased with these results, both sales and earnings growth exceeded the top end of guidance. Comp store sales are growing consistently year-over-year. Our comp increase of 5.6% this year was on top of the 7.1% comp in the first quarter last year and a 6.5% comp the year before. And our operating margin of 10.9% was the highest first quarter operating margin we have ever produced. 
Inventory turns increased again in the first quarter. Most importantly, our shelves are full of the right product, our stock rooms are in great shape, and we ended the quarter in stock and business and well-prepared for our customers as we entered second quarter. I particularly proud of the day-by-day execution of our strategy across organization. The merchant teams continue to source and develop product that exceeds customer expectations of what $1 can buy. The product selection and assortment day-in and day-out is of the highest value and more relevant to our customers needs than ever. These customers are buying in Dollar Tree and Deal$ to be a shopping destination, and our store teams are working very hard to keep these customers coming back by delivering on our promise of the store that is clean, bright, friendly and full of merchandise energy. Our goal is to provide our customers a store that offers a balance assortment of high-value basics, things that customer need everyday, alongside seasonally relevant and fun discretionary product, all for just $1. Delivering on this promise  requires a coordinated effort across organization. We're in that gap from source distort from our supply chain is solid, scalable and efficient, and the logistics team is focused on smoothing and improving the flow of product. Our information systems provide visibility to valuable data, and we're using this information to effectively manage cost, increase inventory turns and improve the customer experience. Seasonal transitions in the first quarter were well-executed. Fresh assortments arrived in a timely manner, and our stores transition seamlessly, almost overnight from 1 season to the next while consistently maintaining high level of in-stock on basic items that customer need everyday. That Dollar Tree and Deal$ are getting new customers all the time and existing customers are shopping more frequently. As a result, comp store sales growth in the first quarter was driven largely by traffic. Of the 5.6% comp sales increase, 5.4% came from increased transactions. 
The top-performing categories for the quarter included home products, food, snacks and beverage, health care products, party supplies, household cleaning supplies and seasonal merchandise. Sales increases in the first quarter came from growth in both the basic and variety categories with the basic consumable categories generally growing at the faster pace. This has been a continuing trend consistent with the difficult economy that we're experiencing with customers concerned over rising and uncertain fuel prices and high unemployment, many are finding Dollar Tree to be a destination for high-value consumer products as they look for ways to balance their budgets. At Dollar Tree, we remain focused on the needs of our customers, and our flexible assortment strategy enables our stores to be right for all times and relevant in all economic environment. 
While customers are under pressure from the difficult economy, as they are now, they can look to Dollar Tree for extreme value on products they need everyday. As long as this trend continues, we plan to meet our customers' demand by providing this products consistently and at the highest value possible. It's another reason to shop at Dollar Tree. And when customers around the store shopping for the basics, we plan to give them every reason to stock up on our terrific assortment of high-value and higher-margin variety merchandise. Even in a difficult economy, at Dollar Tree, you can still spurge. Everything's only $1. As sales cadence in first quarter reflected the growth in both consumable product and the growth of seasonal and variety merchandise sales. In February, we got off a great start with sales for Valentine's day. Customers were thrilled with our offerings of gift bags and tissue, candy and balloons and at 2 per $1, you can afford to buy Valentine's Day card for more than 1 for special persons. From Valentine's Day our stores quickly transitioned to Easter, and a Dollar Day event that was very successful and helped to sustain sales momentum into March. the Dollar Day event included a solid presence of Housewares, home textiles, household plastics and variety merchandise. As planned, sales momentum continued to build in March and it peaked at  Easter which was 2 weeks earlier this year on April 8. 
Performance in the first quarter was relatively consistent across the country with the highest comps coming from the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest followed closely by New England and the Southwest. Our stores have broad appeal. Our growth strategy remains consistent and can be summarized into 5 points: more stores, more productive stores, new formats, new markets and new channels. In reference to more stores, during in the first quarter of this year, we opened 110 new stores, relocated and expanded another 44 stores and grew total square footage 7.1% relative to this time last year. We ended the quarter with 4,451 stores, and we're on-track with our plan for the full year 2012, which includes 315 new stores and 75 relocations and expansions for a total of 390 projects across the U.S. and Canada. In addition to opening new Dollar Tree and Deal$ stores, we have a tremendous opportunity to expand category, to grow new retail formats, to expand geographic reach and to open more productive stores increasing store productivity overall. New store productivity have increased consistently for 6 years driven by improved site selection by rightsizing our stores to the market, by opening new stores earlier in the year, to improve the staffing, building the bench of qualified store management and by emphasizing and expanding the most productive categories of merchandise. 
Last year, average new store productivity increased to its highest level in 10 years. While  it's still very early, I'm pleased with the productivity of this year new store class, and I'm happy to report that we are ahead of plan. Our expansion of frozen and refrigerated product continues. We installed freezers and coolers in 127 stores in the first quarter and now offer frozen and refrigerated product in 2,345 stores. We are planning approximately 325 installations for the full year. This important category is extremely productive. It serves the curt needs of our customers, drives traffic into our stores and provide incremental sales across all categories. Another key component of our growth strategy is the development of new retail formats and expansion of our geographic reach. Our Deal$ format extends our ability to serve more customers with more categories the increases our unit growth potential. Deal$ delivers low prices on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home products. At Deal$, our goal is to surprise and delight our customers in every visit, and we're seeing evidence of success. Customers are responding favorably to the strategy, customer awareness of the Deal$ brand is growing and the concept is building momentum. The first quarter as in the past several quarters, Deal$'s traffic average ticket in average unit retail all continued to increase compared with the previous year. Comp store sales in our Deal$ stores have been robust. We're encouraged with the growth potential of Deal$ and the opportunity that it provides to serve even more customers. We ended the quarter with a total of 186 Deal$ stores across 18 states, and we're on-track with our growth plan for 2012. 
In addition to growing new formats, we have opportunity for growth in new geography. Our expansion into Canada continues. We initially entered the Canadian market through the acquisition of Dollar Giant stores in November of 2010. As you will remember from earlier comments, we intend to operate our Canadian stores on an identical platform to the merchandising and productivity systems that support our stores in the U.S. Our primary focus in 2011 was to install retail systems, integrate processes, merchandise assortments and store teams and delayed the foundation for future profitable growth in the Canadian market. 
To summarize our progress, to date, we have aligned with the merchandise organization and the merchandise plans. We're in the process of rationalizing and cleaning up and non-go-forward merchandise assortment investors and VCs replacing Dollar Giant assortment with higher-value Dollar Tree merchandise. We're solidify thing our logistic model in Canada, changing from a model that was heavily vendor direct to store delivery to our U.S. model of supplying most of our merchandise through the distribution centers of which we have 2 in Canada. We have completed the installation and training of store level POS and enterprise level merchandising systems in all stores gaining visibility to sales and inventory by store, by SKU while we are building sales history. These are key factors in the management of an efficient supply chain. Equally important, we've conducted SKU level inventories in each store, and we're beginning to roll out auto replenishment of basics and smart allocations of new and seasonal merchandise. As we look to the future, the necessary tools and information are coming into place. Just as we done -- as we have done in the U.S., the result will be more efficient store operations and increased level of in-stock of basic products, higher store productivity, increased inventory turns, and most importantly, improved customer satisfaction. We're extremely excited about the opportunity for Dollar Tree Canada. I'm proud of what the team has accomplished so far, and I know that we have a tremendous opportunity for profitable growth in Canada as we leverage our investments. This year, we intend to grow our Canadian store base approximately 25% under the Dollar Tree brand, and we're well on our way to achieving this goal. We opened 8 new stores in the first quarter and ended the quarter with 107 stores in Canada. As we grow and improve, we believe the Canadian market can support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores. This is an addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States, plus additional growth in our Deal$ format. 
Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I'd to give you an update on Dollar Tree Direct, our online business. As most of you know, Dollar Tree directive an additional channel distribution providing an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand the brand and attract more customers into our stores.

As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 22% in the first quarter to $1 per share. The increase resulted from our strong sales, a 35% gross profit margin and a 40 basis point reduction in total SG&A expense compared to the first quarter of last year. Starting with gross profit, our gross profit margin was 35% during the first quarter consistent with the 35% reported in the first quarter last year. We leveraged occupancy and distribution expenses reflecting the 5.6% comp store sales growth. This improvement offset the impact on the continuing shift in product mix as basic consumable products increased by 110 basis points as a percentage of sales in the first quarter. In addition, freight expense increased to a small degree relative to sales as the impact of diesel prices that averaged $0.21 per gallon above the same period last year more than offset the savings on ocean freight. Also, shrink increased slightly as a percent of sales. SG&A expenses were 24.1% of sales for the quarter, a 40 basis point improvement from the first quarter last year. This was driven primarily by expense leverage across several categories, most notably payroll reflecting improved productivity on the field management and store level. In addition, utility cost decrease due to favorable weather conditions and trash removal costs were lower. Depreciation expense declined by about 10 basis points, and debit and credit card fees declined reflecting the lower legislated rates, which more than offset continued growth and usage of these types of tender. In the first quarter compared to the first quarter last year, debit card penetration increased 140 basis points and credit card penetration increased 10 basis points. These improvements were partially offset by stock compensation and health insurance benefits. Operating income increased $26.3 million compared to the first quarter last year and operating margin was 10.9%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to the 10.5% operating margin in the first quarter last year. The tax rate for the quarter was 38.4%. This compares with a 37.5% tax rate in the first quarter last year, which included the benefit of the higher Apted Work Opportunity Tax Credits programs both of which expired at the end of last calendar year. 
Looking at the balance sheet and statement and cash flow. Cash and investments at quarter-end totaled of $382.3 million, an increase of $94 million during the quarter. Cash and investment totaled $510.3 million at the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2011. During the first quarter, we completed our $300 million Accelerated Share Repurchase that initiated in November of 2011. We also repurchased an additional 49,000 shares of Dollar Tree stock for $4.5 million. As you may remember in October of 2011, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion for share repurchase. As at quarter end, we have $1.2 billion remaining in our authorization. We will continue to view share repurchase opportunistically, and we'll update you on additional share repurchases, if any, at the end of the quarter in which they may occur. At the end of the first quarter, the diluted weighted average shares outstanding were $116.4 million. Our consolidated inventory at quarter end was 13.5% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 7.1%. Consolidated inventory per selling square footage cost increased by 5.9%, reflecting an increase in goods on the water at the end of the first quarter as we continue to execute our smoothing of inventory flow throughout our logistics network as we have previously discussed and to provide for planned new store growth in the second quarter. Additionally, our Dollar Tree Canada inventory increased as we transition these stores to a DC delivery model from a direct store delivery model beginning in the second quarter of last year. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate for our current sales plan. Also, inventory turns increased in the first quarter, and we expect continued improvement of our inventory turns for the full year. Capital expenditures were $65.4 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus $58.3 million in the first quarter last year. For fiscal year 2012, we are planning consolidated capital expenditures be in the range of $330 million to $340 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 325 stores, IP system enhancements and approximately $80 million for new distribution center in the Northeast U.S. Total capital investment anticipated for this facility is approximately $95 million. Depreciation and amortization in the first quarter totaled $41.8 million versus $39.3 million in the first  quarter last year. We expect depreciation expense to be the range of $170 million to $180 million for the year. Our guidance for 2012 includes a couple of assumptions. First, regarding freight. While we are pleased with the results of our May 1 ocean freight contract negotiations, diesel prices have risen since we issued our previous guidance. The net effect is that we believe freight cost overall will be somewhat higher than those incorporated in our previous guidance. Second, as we previously disclosed, due to the retail calendar, 2012 would include 53 weeks and the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. This will expect to add $120 million to $130 million of incremental sales and $0.13 to $0.15 of earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter and full year. Third, our guidance assumes a tax rate of 38.3% for both the second quarter and the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 116.6 million shares for the second quarter and 116.7 million shares for the full year. While we still see share repurchase as a good use of cash, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase. With this in mind, for the second quarter of 2012, we are forecasting sales in the range of $1.66 billion to $1.70 billion based on a low- to mid-single-digit comparable store sales increase at 7.1% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.87 to $0.93, an increase of 13% to 20.8% over second quarter 2011 earnings per share of $0.77. As a reminder, the second quarter of last year included a previously disclosed benefit to gross profit from a favorable inventory adjustment related to immaterial corrections to prior period. 
For the full fiscal year of 2012, we are now forecasting sales in the range of $7.33 billion to $7.46 billion based on a low- to mid-single-digit increase in comparable store sales and 7.1% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $4.74 to $4.94 representing an increase of between 17.6% and 22.6% over our record earnings per share of $4.03 in fiscal 2011. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

So the first question is on traffic which is very impressive up 5%.

And then my second question is on the ticket, which was roughly flat during the quarter. You mentioned that the Deal$ stores were showing ticket increase perhaps adjusting that doing slightly better than the core Dollar Tree stores. Can you talk about the difference that might be going on at Deal$ versus Dollar Tree? And then also with the cooler rollout, does that contribute more to traffic gains or more to ticket gains?"

It's a faster turning product. It's a product category that people buy more frequently. One of the reasons we like it so much is that it does give us, first of all, the build of customer need and responding very favorably to it. But it gives customer comes to us more often. And more footsteps in the store, gives us the ability to showcase our seasonal product and all the variety of merchandise that we do so while it so important to our continued profitability. I've mentioned that our consumer products are growing. Our variety of sales are also growing. The consumer products are growing generally by category at a faster pace in the variety, but they're both growing very nicely. So the traffic increase of 5.4%, I view as a terrific metric. We're gaining more customers all the time. When they're in the stores, they're buying the broad -- they're buying the assortment that we have to offer. And by the way, I think they're coming back more frequently. I know they are because of things like frozen and refrigerated foods, because of our Health and Beauty Care items that we sell, because of our household products that we sell. So it was a very healthy first quarter. It was a little to your point that the flow was a little different because it always is when you have an earlier Easter. Easter was April 8 this year, 2 weeks earlier. So we had terrific February. We had terrific March leading up into that Easter April 8. And then as we thought, we're up against Easter for 2 weeks the year before. And as we planned the sales fell back after those 2 weeks after Easter this year. But all in all, we had a terrific first quarter, 5.6%, most of it being driven by traffic."

So more traffic in our stores from new customers. Our mix of products that we've evolved to because of the customer demand is more of the things that are purchased more often. So existing customers are shopping us also more frequently. The price is still $1, so when you talk about the average ticket, that sometimes has been a little stubborn. I view the traffic increases though as it was increasing in market share. I view at the smart customer finding us everyday, and our goal in the stores now is when we get these new customers in to really, really show them a shopping experience. And that starts with all the fun things that we do at the front of the store with our variety merchandise and our seasonal. And at the same time, in-stock and in business on what they came to shop for. We are better in-stock today on basic needed product than we've ever been. When they spend their $1 on their field or $4 sometimes on their gasoline and they come to our stores, we want to make sure that we give them what they need. So there's really concentrated effort on in-stock on basics, running great stores, fun stores, friendly stores. And we're working on improving the average ticket all the time. And I think some of the issues that we have in place, driving impulse sales on our front-end, drive items at our checkouts, the items of the week, all the things when you walk into the store were really challenging our customers to add 1 more item to their basket. And I see that as an opportunity. Forget that customer traffic, and I believe we can drive that average ticket up."

So from an overall perspective, if we look at the things the goods on the water which is a large portion of the increase, Canada was a little less than the goods on the water at the end of the day. The other thing I would mention is that another factor potentially that really relates to this is our shift in mix of product. So you got to remember, we're reporting inventory at cost. And so part of the increase relates that shift in the mix as we -- I was our business continues to more consumable business. And that difference at retail is really a much smaller increase year-over-year. So that the point of it as well.

Part of it depends upon, again, moving of inventory is another way that we can gain efficiencies within our network and so we continue to look at that.

But your stem us is going to be efficient for you in the long term. So there's a lot of different factors that go into it. And then part of it is just regionalization. Sometimes we grow stronger in certain areas of the country that can create needs, maybe prior than would other areas. So all of this is going into consideration. The typical building -- we have buildings that probably service 300, 400 stores, and we have some buildings closer to 800 stores. So it kind of gives you an idea of that 400 to 800 range is kind of a general range of stores being serviced by a building, gives you an idea basin growth what maybe the kind of the cadence at the end of the day.

I'll use the word remarkable, but we've always said that we were in control of our margins. And when pricing was favorable, we would maybe take some into margin, but we're just as likely to put more value into the product and drive more top line. But also over the past several years, we have been responding to consumer needs and selling more of the things they need and building bigger stores and all that. But if you look back the last 10 years of our history, it really is a remarkably tight range that our gross profit has performed that. If you look back at the last 10 years, now first quarter we were 35% gross profit this year. Last year, we were 35%. If you look back at the last 10 years, the high was 35.6% and the low was 33.4% in 2006 with the average being about 34.6%. So we're just a little higher or just shorter at the high range of our gross profit percent. But over 10 years, if you think about the changes in diesel fuel prices and you think about in changes in cost of goods, ups and downs, and the mix changes in the larger stores and more consumer products that we've added, and we still manage that gross profit number in just the very tight range. And if you look at our operating margin, we're just perfect doing that. We just posted the highest operating margin percent in the history of company at 10.9%. So I believe strongly that we're going to be able to manage our gross profit percent going forward. Could you jump out there and make 1 year higher, probably. But our strategy really is more on the line of offering the most value to the customer for $1 and to deliver the margin that we need to for our shareholders. So in doing that, if you look at that 35% range, maybe a few higher, maybe a little lower but it's -- that's where we're managing the value of the offering to the customer. That drives top line growth. And when we drive top line growth, we can leverage our SG&A and all the other fixed cost."

But then we get the leverage on the fixed cost. So it really is about driving the most value possible to the customer at the dollar price point and delivering that improved operating margin. 10.9% again I said it 3x, and we're really proud of that. That's the highest first quarter operating margin we've ever had. And by the way, that's the highest first quarter penetration of consumer product that we've had. So you can do both. It's not just markup, and it's not just top line. It's really both together that provides the quality of earnings that were after. Plus, in this time and age that we're in, when our customers want it, we serve our customers, we're going to sell them what they need, what they want. And I'll just say this, too, as the economy improves, this has been a trend for several years. This is just the first quarter trend. But as the economy improves, we're going to do very well also because we do have a terrific mix of variety merchandise at higher margins. And it will be the same thought process, but it's just a little bit different calculation as we drive more variety sales to the mix of consumer products. So that's the secret formula. It's not really that secret, but initial mark-up is important.

There are store size implications as you get below that 9,000 or 8,000 square-foot store, especially you began to pinch the assortment when you really don't have the room either in the sales floor or in the back room for it. So there are some natural limitations to that. We are installing them in new stores that we opened if they fit our model.

We do like it. You're exactly right. And the stores where have frozen and refrigerated, sales per square foot are higher. And these usually our larger stores, sales are larger.

This morning, we announced first quarter 2012 earnings of $1 per diluted share. This represents a 22% increase over the first quarter 2011 earnings of $0.82 per share. Comp store sales increased 5.6% in the quarter",1951,"Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced first quarter 2012 earnings of $1 per diluted share. This represents a 22% increase over the first quarter 2011 earnings of $0.82 per share. Comp store sales increased 5.6% in the quarter, and total sales grew 11.5% to $1.72 billion. Operating income increased by $26.3 million. Operating margin was 10.9%, an increase of 40 basis points compared with the 10.5% operating margin in the first quarter last year. And net income increased 15% to $116.1 million. 
I want to begin by saying that I'm very pleased with these results, both sales and earnings growth exceeded the top end of guidance. Comp store sales are growing consistently year-over-year. Our comp increase of 5.6% this year was on top of a 7.1% comp in the first quarter last year and a 6.5% comp the year before. And our operating margin of 10.9% was the highest first quarter operating margin we have ever produced. 
Inventory turns increased again in the first quarter. Most importantly, our shelves are full of the right product, our stock rooms are in great shape and we ended the quarter in stock and business and well prepared for our customers as we entered second quarter. I'm particularly proud of the day-by-day execution of our strategy across the organization. The merchant teams continue to source and develop product that exceeds customer expectations of what $1 can buy. The product selection and assortment day-in and day-out is of the highest value, and more relevant to our customers needs than ever. 
These customers are buying in Dollar Tree and Deal$ to be a shopping destination, and our store teams are working very hard to keep these customers coming back by delivering on our promise of the store that is clean, bright, friendly and full of merchandise energy. Our goal is to provide our customers a store that offers a balanced assortment of high-value basics, things that customer need everyday, alongside seasonally relevant and fun discretionary product, all for just $1. Delivering on this promise requires a coordinated effort across the organization, bridging the gap from source to store, our supply chain is a solid, scalable and efficient, and the logistics team is focused on smoothing and improving the flow of product. Our information systems provide visibility to valuable data and we're using this information to effectively manage cost, increase inventory turns and improve the customer experience. 
Seasonal transitions in the first quarter were well executed. Fresh assortments arrived in a timely manner and our stores transitioned seamlessly, almost overnight from one season to the next, while consistently maintaining high level of in-stock on basic items that customer need everyday, that Dollar Tree and Deal$ are getting new customers all the time and existing customers are shopping more frequently. As a result, comp store sales growth in the first quarter was driven largely by traffic. Of the 5.6% comp store sales increase, 5.4% came from increased transactions. 
The top-performing categories for the quarter included home products, food, snacks and beverage, health care products, party supplies, household cleaning supplies and seasonal merchandise. Sales increases in the first quarter came from growth in both basic and variety categories with basic consumable categories generally growing at a faster pace. This has been a continuing trend consistent with the difficult economy that we're experiencing with customers concerned over rising and uncertain fuel prices and high unemployment, many are finding Dollar Tree to be a destination for high-value consumer products as they look for ways to balance their budgets. At Dollar Tree, we remain focused on the needs of our customers and our flexible assortment strategy enables our stores to be right for all times and relevant in all economic environments. 
While customers are under pressure from the difficult economy, as they are now, they can look to Dollar Tree for extreme value on products they need everyday. As long as this trend continues, we plan to meet our customers' demand by providing this products consistently and at the highest value possible. It's another reason to shop at Dollar Tree. And when customers are in the store shopping for the basics, we plan to give them every reason to stock up on our terrific assortment of high-value and higher-margin variety merchandise. Even in a difficult economy, at Dollar Tree, you can still splurge. Everything's only $1. 
Sales cadence in the first quarter reflected the growth in both consumable product and the growth of seasonal and variety merchandise sales. In February, we got off to a great start with sales for Valentine's day. Customers were thrilled with our offerings of gift bags and tissue, candy and balloons. And at 2 per $1, you can afford to buy a Valentine's Day card for more than one for special persons. From Valentine's Day our stores quickly transitioned to Easter, and a Dollar Days event that was very successful and helped to sustain sales momentum into March. The Dollar Days event included a solid presence of housewares, home textiles, household plastics and variety merchandise. 
As planned, sales momentum continued to build in March and it peaked at  Easter, which was 2 weeks earlier this year on April 8. Performance in the first quarter was relatively consistent across the country with the highest comps coming from the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest, followed closely by New England and the Southwest. Our stores have broad appeal. Our growth strategy remains consistent and can be summarized into 5 points: more stores, more productive stores, new formats, new markets and new channels. 
In reference to more stores, during in the first quarter of this year, we opened 110 new stores, relocated and expanded another 44 stores and grew total square footage 7.1% relative to this time last year. We ended the quarter with 4,451 stores and we're on track with our plan for the full year 2012, which includes 315 new stores and 75 relocations and expansions, for a total of 390 projects across the U.S. and Canada. 
In addition to opening new Dollar Tree and Deal$ stores, we have a tremendous opportunity to expand categories, to grow new retail formats, to expand geographic reach and to open more productive stores, increasing store productivity overall. New store productivity has increased consistently for 6 years driven by improved site selection by rightsizing our stores to the market; by opening new stores earlier in the year; through improve the staffing, building the bench of qualified store management; and by emphasizing and expanding the most productive categories of merchandise. 
Last year, average new store productivity increased to its highest level in 10 years. While  it's still very early, I'm pleased with the productivity of this year's new store class. And I'm happy to report that we are ahead of plan. Our expansion of frozen and refrigerated product continues. We installed freezers and coolers in 127 stores in the first quarter and now offer frozen and refrigerated product in 2,345 stores. We are planning approximately 325 installations for the full year. This important category is extremely productive. It serves the current needs of our customers, drives traffic into our stores and provides incremental sales across all categories. 
Another key component of our growth strategy is the development of new retail formats and the expansion of our geographic reach. Our Deal$ format extends our ability to serve more customers with more categories and increases our unit growth potential. Deal$ delivers low prices on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home product. At Deal$, our goal is to surprise and delight our customers in every visit, and we're seeing evidence of success. Customers are responding favorably to the strategy, customer awareness of the Deal$ brand is growing and the concept is building momentum. 
In the first quarter, as in the past several quarters, Deal$'s traffic average ticket and average unit retail all continued to increase compared with the previous year. Comp store sales in our Deal$ stores have been robust. We're encouraged with the growth potential of Deal$ and the opportunity that it provides to serve even more customers. We ended the quarter with a total of 186 Deal$ stores across 18 states, and we're on track with our growth plan for 2012. 
In addition to growing new formats, we have opportunity for growth in new geography. Our expansion into Canada continues. We initially entered the Canadian market through the acquisition of Dollar Giant stores in November of 2010. As you will remember from earlier comments, we intend to operate our Canadian stores on an identical platform to the merchandising and productivity systems that support our stores in the U.S. Our primary focus in 2011 was to install retail systems, integrate processes, merchandise assortments and store teams and to lay the foundation for future profitable growth in the Canadian market. 
To summarize our progress, to date, we have aligned both the merchandise organization and the merchandise plans. We're in the process of rationalizing and cleaning up the non-go-forward merchandise assortment in the stores and DCs, replacing Dollar Giant assortment with higher-value Dollar Tree merchandise. We're solidifying our logistics model in Canada, changing from a model that was heavily vendor direct to store delivery to our U.S. model of supplying most of our merchandise through the distribution centers, of which we have 2 in Canada. 
We have completed the installation and training of store level POS and enterprise level merchandising systems in all stores gaining visibility to sales and inventory by store, by SKU, while we are building sales history. These are key factors in the management of an efficient supply chain. Equally important, we've conducted SKU level inventories in each store and we're beginning to roll out auto replenishment of basics and smart allocations of new and seasonal merchandise. 
As we look to the future, the necessary tools and information are coming into place. Just as we done -- as we have done in the U.S., the result will be more efficient store operations and increased level of in-stock of basic products, higher store productivity, increased inventory turns and most importantly, improved customer satisfaction. We're extremely excited about the opportunity for Dollar Tree Canada. I'm proud of what the team has accomplished so far, and I know that we have a tremendous opportunity for profitable growth in Canada as we leverage our investments. 
This year, we intend to grow our Canadian store base approximately 25% under the Dollar Tree brand, and we're well on our way to achieving this goal. We opened 8 new stores in the first quarter and ended the quarter with 107 stores in Canada. As we grow and improve, we believe the Canadian market can support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores. This is an addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States, plus additional growth in our Deal$ format. 
Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I'd like to give you an update on Dollar Tree Direct, our online business. As most of you know, Dollar Tree Direct is an additional channel distribution, providing an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand the brand and attract more customers into our stores. Dollar Tree Direct now offers more than 2,500 items online. Traffic on the sites grew to 4 million visitors in the first quarter, an 19% increase over the first quarter of last year. And if you haven't already have the opportunity, I invite you to take a look at our sites at dollartree.com, deals-stores.com, dollartreecanada.com, espanol.dollartree.com or check us out on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter or Pinterest.

27685,170941554,309189,"Dollar Tree, Inc., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, May 17, 2012",2012-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Dollar Tree, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob.

As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 22% in the first quarter to $1 per share. The increase resulted from our strong sales, a 35% gross profit margin and a 40 basis point reduction in total SG&A expense compared to the first quarter of last year. 
Starting with gross profit. Our gross profit margin was 35% during the first quarter, consistent with the 35% reported in the first quarter last year. We leveraged occupancy and distribution expenses reflecting the 5.6% comp store sales growth. This improvement offset the impact of the continuing shifts in product mix, as basic consumable products increased by 110 basis points as a percentage of sales in the first quarter. In addition, freight expense increased to a small degree relative to sales, as the impact of diesel prices that averaged $0.21 per gallon above the same period last year, more than offset the savings on ocean freight. Also, shrink increased slightly as a percent of sales. 
SG&A expenses were 24.1% of sales for the quarter, a 40 basis point improvement from the first quarter last year. This was driven primarily by expense leverage across several categories, most notably payroll reflecting improved productivity at the field management and store level. In addition, utility cost decreased due to favorable weather conditions and trash removal costs were lower. Depreciation expense declined by about 10 basis points, and debit and credit card fees declined reflecting the lower legislated rates, which more than offset continued growth and usage of these types of tender. 
In the first quarter compared to the first quarter last year, debit card penetration increased 140 basis points and credit card penetration increased 10 basis points. These improvements were partially offset by higher expenses for stock compensation and health insurance benefits. Operating income increased $26.3 million compared to the first quarter last year and operating margin was 10.9%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to the 10.5% operating margin in the first quarter last year. The tax rate for the quarter was 38.4%. This compares with a 37.5% tax rate in the first quarter last year, which included the benefits of the HIRE Act and Work Opportunity Tax Credits programs, both of which expired at the end of the last calendar year. 
Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow. Cash and investments at quarter end totaled $382.3 million, an increase of $94 million during the quarter. Cash and investments totaled $510.3 million at the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2011. During the first quarter, we completed our $300 million Accelerated Share Repurchase that was initiated in November of 2011. We also repurchased an additional 49,000 shares of Dollar Tree stock for $4.5 million. As you may remember in October of 2011, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion for share repurchase. As of quarter end, we have $1.2 billion remaining in our authorization. We will continue to view share repurchase opportunistically. We will update you on additional share repurchases, if any, at the end of the quarter in which they may occur. 
At the end of the first quarter, the diluted weighted average shares outstanding were $116.4 million. Our consolidated inventory at quarter end was 13.5% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 7.1%. Consolidated inventory per selling square footage cost increased by 5.9%, reflecting an increase in goods on the water at the end of the first quarter, as we continued to execute our smoothing of inventory flow throughout our logistics network, as we have previously discussed, and to provide for planned new store growth in the second quarter. 
Additionally, our Dollar Tree Canada inventory increased as we transitioned these stores to a DC delivery model from a direct store delivery model beginning in the second quarter of last year. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate for our current sales plan. Also, inventory turns increased in the first quarter, and we expect continued improvement of our inventory turns for the full year. 
Capital expenditures were $65.4 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus $58.3 million in the first quarter last year. For fiscal year 2012, we are planning consolidated capital expenditures be in the range of $330 million to $340 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 325 stores, IT system enhancements and approximately $80 million towards a new distribution center in the Northeast U.S. Total capital investments anticipated for this facility is approximately $95 million. 
Depreciation and amortization in the first quarter totaled $41.8 million versus $39.3 million in the first quarter last year. We expect depreciation expense to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million for the year. 
Our guidance for 2012 includes a couple of assumptions. First, regarding freight. While we are pleased with the results of our May 1 ocean freight contract negotiations, diesel prices have risen since we issued our previous guidance. The net effect is that we believe freight cost, overall, will be somewhat higher than those incorporated in our previous guidance. Second, as we previously disclosed, due to the retail calendar, 2012 will include 53 weeks and the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. This is expected to add $120 million to $130 million of incremental sales and $0.13 to $0.15 of earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter and the full year. 
Third, our guidance assumes a tax rate of 38.3% for both the second quarter and the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 116.6 million shares for the second quarter and 116.7 million shares for the full year. While we still see share repurchase as a good use of cash, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase. 
With this in mind, for the second quarter of 2012, we are forecasting sales in the range of $1.66 billion to $1.70 billion based on a low- to mid-single digit comparable store sales increase and 7.1% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.87 to $0.93, an increase of 13% to 20.8% over second quarter 2011 earnings per share of $0.77. As a reminder, the second quarter of last year included a previously disclosed benefit to gross profit from a favorable inventory adjustment related to immaterial corrections to prior period. 
For the full fiscal year of 2012, we are now forecasting sales in the range of $7.33 billion to $7.46 billion based on a low- to mid-single digit increase in comparable store sales and 7.1% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $4.74 to $4.94 representing an increase of between 17.6% and 22.6% over our record earnings per share of $4.03 in fiscal 2011. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

We entered this year with goals to drive more customer traffic, to delight our customers with a surprising values on merchandise they need and want, to improve our shopping experience and to build market share. I'm pleased to report that we're off to a good start towards accomplishing these goals. First quarter sales grew 11.5% to a record $1.72 billion. Driven by increased customer traffic, comp store sales increased 5.6% on top of a 7.1% comp last year. 
Our inventory is balanced and more productive than ever. Our returns increased again in the first quarter and we entered second quarter well prepared for new store growth and customer demand. Our operating margin increased by 40 basis points to 10.9%. That's the all-time highest first quarter operating margin in our history. Net income grew 15% to $116.1 million and earnings per share increased by 22% to $1 per share. 
In addition, we opened 110 new stores across the U.S. and Canada. And so far, the productivity of the new store class has been performing ahead of last year. The Deal$ brand is gaining traction, both traffic and average ticket are growing. Dollar Tree Direct continues to broaden its reach, and we're working to build and expand our Canadian business. As I look to the future, I see even more opportunity to grow our business through new Dollar Tree stores, more productive stores and category expansion. We're developing you formats and new channels with Deal$ and Dollar Tree Direct, and we're expanding geographically as Canada provides an opportunity for a substantial growth. All of these provides a roadmap for sustained profitable growth ahead.

And then my second question is on the ticket, which was roughly flat during the quarter. You mentioned that the Deal$ stores were showing ticket increase, perhaps suggesting that's doing slightly better than the core Dollar Tree stores. Can you talk about the difference that might be going on in Deal$ versus Dollar Tree? And then also with the cooler rollout, does that contribute more to traffic gains or more to ticket gains?"

It's a faster turning product. It's a product category that people buy more frequently. One of the reasons we like it so much is that it does give us, first of all, that build of customer need that are responding very favorably to it, but it gives the customer come to us more often. And more footsteps in the store, gives us the ability to showcase our seasonal product and all the variety of merchandise that we do so well and is so important to our continued profitability. I've mentioned that our consumer products are growing. Our variety of sales are also growing. The consumer products are growing generally by category at a faster pace in the variety, but they're both growing very, very nicely. So the traffic increase of 5.4%, I view as a terrific metric. We're gaining more customers all the time. When they're in the stores, they're buying a broad -- they're buying the assortment that we have to offer. And by the way, I think they're coming back more frequently. I know they are because of things like frozen and refrigerated foods, because of our Health and Beauty Care items that we sell, because of our household products that we sell. So it was a very healthy first quarter. It was a little, to your point, the flow was a little different because it always is when you have an earlier Easter. Easter was April 8 this year, 2 weeks earlier. So we had terrific February. We had terrific March leading up into that Easter April 8. And then as we thought, we were up against Easter for 2 weeks the year before. And as we planned the sales fell back after those 2 weeks after Easter this year. But all in all, we had a terrific first quarter, 5.6%, most of it being driven by traffic."

I view it as more customers finding us everyday. And our goal in the stores now is when we get these new customers in to really, really show them a shopping experience. And that starts with all the fun things that we do at the front of the store with our variety merchandise and our seasonal. And at the same time, in-stock and in business on what they came to shop for. We are better in-stock today on basic needed product than we've ever been. When they spend their $1 on their fuel, over $4 sometimes on their gasoline and they come to our stores, we want to make sure that we give them what they need. So there's really a concentrated effort on in-stock on basics, running great stores, fun stores, friendly stores. And we're working on improving the average ticket all the time.

So in regards to the various points that we raised and since the goods on the water, and we've talked a lot about smoothing of inventory flows through our network over the last couple of years and the benefits it brings to the entire organization, it all starts with the buy and the scheduled shipment. And so we've obviously continue to ship some things around. From an overall perspective, if we look at the things, the goods on the water which is a large portion of the increase, Canada was a little less than the goods on the water at the end of the day. The other thing I would mention is that another factor potentially that really relates to this is our shift in mix of product. So you got to remember, we're reporting inventory at cost. And so part of the increase relates to that shift in the mix as we -- as our business has to continue to have more consumable business. And that difference at retail is really a much smaller increase year-over-year. So that's the point of it as well. And then I think the other thing to remember is this is just a point in time disclosure. We have many as ebbs and flows in any given year when we have -- when we're moving over $250 million cartons of goods around the world. So we look at that, but we feel very good. New stores, we've got -- we did do more new stores. I think we did about 83 new stores last year in Q1, 110 this year, so we do have more new stores. We have plenty of stores opening in Q2 as well, so there is a function of that as well. But I would tell you the largest piece is the goods on the water and our Dollar Tree Canada at the end."

So we continue to work more efficiency into the network. And so that plays a role in being able to offset the need for an additional distribution center. We get -- obviously, we've been building a lot of stores in the Northeast the last few years. They tend to be very high-volume stores and so the Northeast make sense that we need to get a new distribution center in that area. Part of it depends on growth. Part of it depends upon, against moving of inventory is another way that we can gain efficiencies within our network, and so we continue to look at that. I think, again, the size plays a part of in it, so when you look at a new distribution center, we always look at size versus stem miles because obviously a bigger building you can serve more stores. But are your stem miles us is going to be efficient for you in the long term. So there's a lot of different factors that go into it. And then part of it is just regionalization. Sometimes we grow stronger in certain areas of the country that can create needs, maybe prior than it would other areas. So all these things go into consideration. The typical building -- we have buildings that probably service 300, 400 stores, and we have some buildings that service closer to 800 stores. So it kind of gives you an idea of that 400 to 800 range is kind of a general range of stores being serviced by a building. It gives you an idea based on growth what maybe the kind of the cadence at the end of the day. So that you could potentially need one, every 3 to 4 years."

I'll use the word remarkable, but we've always said that we were in control of our margins. And when pricing was favorable, we would maybe take some into margin, but we're just as likely to put more value into the product and drive more top line. But also over the past several years, we have been responding to consumer needs and selling more of the things they need and building bigger stores and all that. But if you look back at the last 10 years of our history, it really is a remarkably tight range that our gross profit has performed at. If you look back at the last 10 years -- now first quarter we were 35% gross profit this year. Last year, we were 35%. If you look back at the last 10 years, the high was 35.6% and the low was 33.4% in 2006, with the average being about 34.6%. So we're just a little higher or just shorter at the high range of our gross profit percent. But over 10 years, as you think about the changes in diesel fuel prices and you think about the changes in cost of goods, ups and downs, and the mix changes and the larger stores and the more consumer products that we've added, and we still manage that gross profit number in just the very tight range. And if you look at our operating margin, we just perfect doing that. We just posted the highest operating margin percent in the history of company at 10.9%. So I believe strongly that we're going to be able to manage our gross profit percent going forward. Could you jump out there and make one year higher, probably. But our strategy really is more along the line of offering the most value to the customer for $1 and to deliver the margin that we need for our shareholders. So in doing that, if you look at that 35% range, maybe a few higher, maybe a little lower, but it's -- that's where we're managing the value of the offering to the customer. That drives top line growth. And when we drive top line growth, we can leverage our SG&A and all the other fixed cost."

So our markup on what we sell for $1, by category, is favorable. When you start selling more of the consumer product, the mix does drive, put pressure on the gross margin. But then we get the leverage on the fixed cost. So it really is about driving the most value possible to the customer at the dollar price point and delivering that improved operating margin. 10.9%, again, I said it 3x, and we're really proud of that. That's the highest first quarter operating margin we've ever had. And by the way, that's the highest first quarter penetration of a consumer product that we've had. So you can do both. It's not just markup and it's not just top line. It's really both together that provides the quality of earnings that were after. Plus, in this time and age that we're in, our customers want it, we serve our customers, we're going to sell them what they need, what they want. And I'll just say this, too, as the economy improves -- this has been a trend for several years. This isn't just a first quarter trend. But as the economy improves, we're going to do very well also because we do have a terrific mix of variety merchandise at higher margins. And it will be the same thought process, but it's just a little bit different calculation as we drive more variety sales to the mix of consumer products. So that's the secret formula. It's not really that secret, but initial markup is important. Top line growth is important and how we manage our cost and our fixed cost, as well as our variable cost is how we get to the bottom line."

And we're past Mother's Day and full blown into graduation sales with graduation balloons and parties and all that goes with that. If you look in our Dollar Tree stores up front, you're going to see a really terrific assortment of summer items for Summer Fun. You got water blasters for $1, 26-inch water blasters. We have a new item. We've done well with our solar stakes for only $1. Can you believe that? You buy solar stakes for the Memorial Day through the 4th of July time period. We've got some that have the red, white and blue on them. So you can be patriotic and light up your sidewalk all at the same time. Of course, this time of year, a lot of things around Memorial Day with glow sticks and barbecue items and paper goods and paper plates and water. We've got terrific values on our beverage. So it's all about Summer Fun and pools and going to the beach and having fun right now at Dollar Tree. And if you haven't been to our store lately, you should probably stop by. In our Deal$ stores, in addition to all the Summer Fun, we're also selling fans, for example. You can't sell an electric fan at Dollar Tree for $1, but you can in the Deal$ stores. And we're having terrific success in and stand fans and other kinds of electric fans. When it really turns on, I expect that business to pop in our Deal$ stores. Right now we're, again, selling 24 packs of water and little coolers and beach bags and all the things and deals for going to the beach or having fun in the summer time for picnics or for that type of thing. So that's what's going on right now. There's always something new at Dollar Tree. And then we'll come out of the summer. We'll go into back-to-school, as usual. And I'm not going to give you all our secret right now. But I can tell you, back-to-school this year will be the best ever. And it just will. We're excited about that. And of course, after back-to-school, you're right back in to the all and Halloween and getting into the holiday season again."

And you always -- you're trying to get rid of some of the existing products, you're selling down on that. In the mean time, there's little voids between getting rid of the old and getting in the new. All stores don't sell down at the same rate. We're getting it in stock and the DCs. We're changing a delivering model so that we get it to from source to DC to store more efficiently up there, and we're excited about what's going there. We just started relays in 6 of our stores up there to really change the flow of the product to more like at -- and change the name of the stores to Dollar Tree from Dollar Giant. So what you're seeing right now is just a lot of activity around building the store teams, about building the merchandise assortment, getting rid some of the old, replacing it with higher-value merchandise from our Dollar Tree assortment. Not that it wasn't great value before, but with our buying power, we are able to provide even more value for $1.25 in our Dollar Giant stores. So if you got a headwind to sales right now, margin is probably neutral. Margin rates probably neutral and a headwind on SG&A because we're investing in the business. We're doing store relays. We're investing in all the things to put the infrastructure in place, so that we can provide the platform for a future profitable growth. Just to look at the cadence, we expect headwinds all first half in our Canada business. We expect it to get better in the second half. I can't quantify it, but I can tell you that first half is planned to be a lot of activity, a lot of investment in time and effort and getting the stores and the merchandise assortments right, and then showing some improvement in the second half."

This morning, we announced first quarter 2012 earnings of $1 per diluted share. This represents a 22% increase over the first quarter 2011 earnings of $0.82 per share. Comp store sales increased 5.6% in the quarter",1944,"Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced first quarter 2012 earnings of $1 per diluted share. This represents a 22% increase over the first quarter 2011 earnings of $0.82 per share. Comp store sales increased 5.6% in the quarter, and total sales grew 11.5% to $1.72 billion. Operating income increased by $26.3 million. Operating margin was 10.9%, an increase of 40 basis points compared with the 10.5% operating margin in the first quarter last year. And net income increased 15% to $116.1 million. 
I want to begin by saying that I'm very pleased with these results. Both sales and earnings growth exceeded the top end of guidance. Comp store sales are growing consistently year-over-year. Our comp increase of 5.6% this year was on top of a 7.1% comp in the first quarter last year and a 6.5% comp the year before. And our operating margin of 10.9% was the highest first quarter operating margin we have ever produced. 
Inventory turns increased again in the first quarter. Most importantly, our shelves are full of the right product, our stock rooms are in great shape and we ended the quarter in stock and business and well prepared for our customers as we entered second quarter. I'm particularly proud of the day-by-day execution of our strategy across the organization. The merchant teams continue to source and develop product that exceeds customer expectations of what $1 can buy. The product selection and assortment day-in and day-out is of the highest value, and more relevant to our customers' needs than ever. 
New customers are finding Dollar Tree and Deal$ to be a shopping destination, and our store teams are working very hard to keep these customers coming back by delivering on our promise of the store that is clean, bright, friendly and full of merchandise energy. Our goal is to provide our customers a store that offers a balanced assortment of high-value basics, things that customer need every day, alongside seasonally relevant and fun discretionary product, all for just $1. Delivering on this promise requires a coordinated effort across the organization, bridging the gap from source to store, our supply chain is a solid, scalable and efficient, and the logistics team is focused on smoothing and improving the flow of product. Our information systems provide visibility to valuable data and we're using this information to effectively manage cost, increase inventory turns and improve the customer experience. 
Seasonal transitions in the first quarter were well executed. Fresh assortments arrived in a timely manner and our stores transitioned seamlessly, almost overnight from one season to the next, while consistently maintaining high levels of in-stock on basic items that customer need every day. At Dollar Tree and Deal$ we're gaining new customers all the time and existing customers are shopping more frequently. As a result, comp store sales growth in the first quarter was driven largely by traffic. Of the 5.6% comp store sales increase, 5.4% came from increased transactions. 
The top-performing categories for the quarter included home products, food, snacks and beverage, health care products, party supplies, household cleaning supplies and seasonal merchandise. Sales increases in the first quarter came from growth in both basic and variety categories with basic consumable categories generally growing at a faster pace. This has been a continuing trend consistent with the difficult economy that we're experiencing. With customers concerned over rising and uncertain fuel prices and high unemployment, many are finding Dollar Tree to be a destination for high-value consumer products as they look for ways to balance their budgets. At Dollar Tree, we remain focused on the needs of our customers and our flexible assortment strategy enables our stores to be right for all times and relevant in all economic environments. 
While customers are under pressure from the difficult economy, as they are now, they can look to Dollar Tree for extreme value on products they need every day. As long as this trend continues, we plan to meet our customers' demand by providing these products consistently and at the highest value possible. It's another reason to shop at Dollar Tree. And when customers are in the store shopping for the basics, we plan to give them every reason to stock up on our terrific assortment of high-value and higher-margin variety merchandise. Even in a difficult economy, at Dollar Tree, you can still splurge. Everything's only $1. 
Sales cadence in first quarter reflected the growth in both consumable product and the growth of seasonal and variety merchandise sales. In February, we got off to a great start with sales for Valentine's Day. Customers were thrilled with our offerings of gift bags and tissue, candy and balloons. And at 2 for $1, you can afford to buy a Valentine's Day cards for more than one for special persons. From Valentine's Day our stores quickly transitioned to Easter, and a Dollar Days event that was very successful and helped to sustain sales momentum into March. The Dollar Day event included a solid presence of housewares, home textiles, household plastics and variety merchandise. 
As planned, sales momentum continued to build in March and it peaked at Easter, which was 2 weeks earlier this year on April 8. Performance in the first quarter was relatively consistent across the country with the highest comps coming from the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest, followed closely by New England and the Southwest. Our stores have broad appeal. Our growth strategy remains consistent and can be summarized into 5 points: more stores, more productive stores, new formats, new markets and new channels. 
In reference to more stores, during in the first quarter this year, we opened 110 new stores, relocated and expanded another 44 stores and grew total square footage 7.1% relative to this time last year. We ended the quarter with 4,451 stores and we're on track with our plan for the full year 2012, which includes 315 new stores and 75 relocations and expansions, for a total of 390 projects across the U.S. and Canada. 
In addition to opening new Dollar Tree and Deal$ stores, we have a tremendous opportunity to expand categories, to grow new retail formats, to expand geographic reach and to open more productive stores, increasing store productivity overall. New store productivity has increased consistently for 6 years driven, by improved site selection by rightsizing our stores to the market; by opening new stores earlier in the year; through improve the staffing, building the bench of qualified store management; and by emphasizing and expanding the most productive categories of merchandise. 
Last year, average new store productivity increased to its highest level in 10 years. While it's still very early, I'm pleased with the productivity of this year's new store class. And I'm happy to report that we are ahead of plan. Our expansion of frozen and refrigerated product continues. We installed freezers and coolers in 127 stores in the first quarter and now offer frozen and refrigerated product in 2,345 stores. We are planning approximately 325 installations for the full year. This important category is extremely productive. It serves the current needs of our customers, drives traffic into our stores and provides incremental sales across all categories. 
Another key component of our growth strategy is the development of new retail formats and the expansion of our geographic reach. Our Deal$ format extends our ability to serve more customers with more categories and increases our unit growth potential. Deal$ delivers low prices on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home product. At Deal$, our goal is to surprise and delight our customers on every visit, and we're seeing evidence of success. Customers are responding favorably to the strategy, customer awareness of the Deal$ brand is growing and the concept is building momentum. 
In the first quarter, as in the past several quarters, Deal$'s traffic average ticket and average unit retail all continued to increase compared with the previous year. Comp store sales in our Deal$ stores have been robust. We're encouraged with the growth potential of Deal$ and the opportunity that it provides to serve even more customers. We ended the quarter with a total of 186 Deal$ stores across 18 states, and we're on track with our growth plan for 2012. 
In addition to growing new formats, we have opportunity for growth in new geography. Our expansion into Canada continues. We initially entered the Canadian market through the acquisition of Dollar Giant stores in November of 2010. As you will remember from earlier comments, we intend to operate our Canadian stores on an identical platform to the merchandising and productivity systems that support our stores in the U.S. Our primary focus in 2011 was to install retail systems, integrate processes, merchandise assortments and store teams and to lay the foundation for future profitable growth in the Canadian market. 
To summarize our progress, to date, we have aligned both the merchandise organization and the merchandise plans. We're in the process of rationalizing and cleaning up the non-go-forward merchandise assortment the stores and DCs, replacing Dollar Giant assortment with higher-value Dollar Tree merchandise. We're solidifying our logistics model in Canada, changing from a model that was heavily vendor direct to store delivery to our U.S. model of supplying most of our merchandise through the distribution centers, of which we have 2 in Canada. 
We have completed the installation and training of store level POS and enterprise-level merchandising systems in all stores, gaining visibility to sales and inventory by store, by SKU, while we are building sales history. These are key factors in the management of an efficient supply chain. Equally important, we've conducted SKU-level inventories in each store and we're beginning to roll out auto replenishment of basics and smart allocations of new and seasonal merchandise. 
As we look to the future, the necessary tools and information are coming into place. Just as we have done in the U.S., the result will be more efficient store operations and increased level of in-stock of basic products, higher store productivity, increased inventory turns and most importantly, improved customer satisfaction. We're extremely excited about the opportunity for Dollar Tree Canada. I'm proud of what the team has accomplished so far, and I know that we have a tremendous opportunity for profitable growth in Canada as we leverage our investments. 
This year, we intend to grow our Canadian store base approximately 25% under the Dollar Tree brand, and we're well on our way to achieving this goal. We opened 8 new stores in the first quarter and ended the quarter with 107 stores in Canada. As we grow and improve, we believe the Canadian market can support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores. This is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States, plus additional growth in our Deal$ format. 
Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I'd like to give you an update on Dollar Tree Direct, our online business. As most of you know, Dollar Tree Direct is an additional channel distribution, providing an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand the brand and attract more customers into our stores. Dollar Tree Direct now offers more than 2,500 items online. Traffic on the sites grew to 4 million visitors in the first quarter, a 19% increase over the first quarter of last year. And if you haven't already had the opportunity, I invite you to take a look at our sites at dollartree.com, deals-stores.com, dollartreecanada.com, espanol.dollartree.com or check us out on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter or Pinterest.

As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 22% in the first quarter to $1 per share. The increase resulted from our strong sales, a 35% gross profit margin and a 40 basis point reduction in total SG&A expense compared to the f",1152,"Thanks, Bob. As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 22% in the first quarter to $1 per share. The increase resulted from our strong sales, a 35% gross profit margin and a 40 basis point reduction in total SG&A expense compared to the first quarter of last year. 
Starting with gross profit. Our gross profit margin was 35% during the first quarter, consistent with the 35% reported in the first quarter last year. We leveraged occupancy and distribution expenses reflecting the 5.6% comp store sales growth. This improvement offset the impact of the continuing shifts in product mix, as basic consumable products increased by 110 basis points as a percentage of sales in the first quarter. In addition, freight expense increased to a small degree relative to sales, as the impact of diesel prices that averaged $0.21 per gallon above the same period last year, more than offset the savings on ocean freight. Also, shrink increased slightly as a percent of sales. 
SG&A expenses were 24.1% of sales for the quarter, a 40-basis-point improvement from the first quarter last year. This was driven primarily by expense leverage across several categories, most notably payroll reflecting improved productivity at the field management and store level. In addition, utility cost decreased due to favorable weather conditions and trash removal costs were lower. Depreciation expense declined by about 10 basis points, and debit and credit card fees declined reflecting the lower legislated rates, which more than offset continued growth in usage of these types of tender. 
In the first quarter compared to the first quarter last year, debit card penetration increased 140 basis points and credit card penetration increased 10 basis points. These improvements were partially offset by higher expenses for stock compensation and health insurance benefits. Operating income increased $26.3 million compared to the first quarter last year and operating margin was 10.9%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to the 10.5% operating margin in the first quarter last year. The tax rate for the quarter was 38.4%. This compares with a 37.5% tax rate in the first quarter last year, which included the benefits of the HIRE Act and Work Opportunity Tax Credits programs, both of which expired at the end of the last calendar year. 
Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow. Cash and investments at quarter end totaled $382.3 million, an increase of $94 million during the quarter. Cash and investments totaled $510.3 million at the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2011. During the first quarter, we completed our $300 million Accelerated Share Repurchase which was initiated in November of 2011. We also repurchased an additional 49,000 shares of Dollar Tree stock for $4.5 million. As you may remember in October of 2011, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion for share repurchase. As of quarter end, we have $1.2 billion remaining in our authorization. We will continue to view share repurchase opportunistically. We will update you on additional share repurchases, if any, at the end of the quarter in which they may occur. 
At the end of the first quarter, the diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 116.4 million. Our consolidated inventory at quarter end was 13.5% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 7.1%. Consolidated inventory per selling square footage cost increased by 5.9%, reflecting an increase in goods on the water at the end of the first quarter, as we continued to execute our smoothing of inventory flow throughout our logistics network that we have previously discussed, and to provide for planned new store growth in the second quarter. 
Additionally, our Dollar Tree Canada inventory increased as we transitioned these stores to a DC delivery model from a direct store delivery model beginning in the second quarter of last year. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate for our current sales plan. Also, inventory turns increased in the first quarter, and we expect continued improvement of our inventory turns for the full year. 
Capital expenditures were $65.4 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus $58.3 million in the first quarter last year. For fiscal year 2012, we are planning consolidated capital expenditures be in the range of $330 million to $340 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 325 stores, IT system enhancements and approximately $80 million towards a new distribution center in the Northeast U.S. Total capital investments anticipated for this facility is approximately $95 million. 
Depreciation and amortization in the first quarter totaled $41.8 million versus $39.3 million in the first quarter last year. We expect depreciation expense to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million for the year. 
Our guidance for 2012 includes a couple of assumptions. First, regarding freight. While we are pleased with the results of our May 1 ocean freight contract negotiations, diesel prices have risen since we issued our previous guidance. The net effect is that we believe freight costs, overall, will be somewhat higher than those incorporated in our previous guidance. Second, as we previously disclosed, due to the retail calendar, 2012 will include 53 weeks and the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. This is expected to add $120 million to $130 million of incremental sales and $0.13 to $0.15 of earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter and the full year. 
Third, our guidance assumes a tax rate of 38.3% for both the second quarter and the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 116.6 million shares for the second quarter and 116.7 million shares for the full year. While we still see share repurchase as a good use of cash, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase. 
With this in mind, for the second quarter of 2012, we are forecasting sales in the range of $1.66 billion to $1.70 billion based on a low- to mid-single digit comparable store sales increase and 7.1% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.87 to $0.93, an increase of 13% to 20.8% over second quarter 2011 earnings per share of $0.77. As a reminder, the second quarter of last year included a previously disclosed benefit to gross profit from a favorable inventory adjustment related to immaterial corrections to prior periods. 
For the full fiscal year of 2012, we are now forecasting sales in the range of $7.33 billion to $7.46 billion based on a low- to mid-single digit increase in comparable store sales and 7.1% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $4.74 to $4.94 representing an increase of between 17.6% and 22.6% over our record earnings per share of $4.03 in fiscal 2011. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

We entered this year with goals to drive more customer traffic, to delight our customers with surprising values on merchandise they need and want, to improve our shopping experience and to build market share. I'm pleased to report that we're off to a good start towards accomplishing these goals. First quarter sales grew 11.5% to a record $1.72 billion. Driven by increased customer traffic, comp store sales increased 5.6% on top of a 7.1% comp last year. 
Our inventory is balanced and more productive than ever. Our turns increased again in the first quarter and we entered second quarter well prepared for new store growth and customer demand. Our operating margin increased by 40 basis points to 10.9%. That's the all-time highest first quarter operating margin in our history. Net income grew 15% to $116.1 million and earnings per share increased by 22% to $1 per share. 
In addition, we opened 110 new stores across the U.S. and Canada. And so far, the productivity of the new store class has been performing ahead of last year. The Deal$ brand is gaining traction, both traffic and average ticket are growing. Dollar Tree Direct continues to broaden its reach, and we're working to build and expand our Canadian business. As I look to the future, I see even more opportunity to grow our business through new Dollar Tree stores, more productive stores and category expansion.

So the first question is on the traffic, which was very impressive up 5%. Can you talk about some of the factors that may have contributed to that and whether the earlier Easter actually clipped some of the traffic? And then my second question is on the ticket, which was roughly flat during the quarter. You mentioned that the Deal$ stores were showing ticket increase, perhaps suggesting that's doing slightly better than the core Dollar Tree stores. Can you talk about the difference that might be going on at Deal$ versus Dollar Tree? And then also with the cooler rollout, does that contribute more to traffic gains or more to ticket gains?"

It's a faster turning product. It's a product category that people buy more frequently. One of the reasons we like it so much is that it does give us, first of all, it filled a customer need, they're responding very favorably to it, but it gives the customer come to us more often. And more footsteps in the store, gives us the ability to showcase our seasonal product and all the variety merchandise that we do so well and is so important to our continued profitability. I've mentioned that our consumer products are growing. Our variety sales are also growing. The consumer products are growing generally by category at a faster pace than the variety, but they're both growing very, very nicely. So the traffic increase of 5.4%, I view as a terrific metric. We're gaining more customers all the time. When they're in the stores, they're buying a broad -- they're buying the assortment that we have to offer. And by the way, I think they're coming back more frequently. I know they are because of things like frozen and refrigerated foods, because of our Health and Beauty Care items that we sell, because of our household products that we sell. So it was a very healthy first quarter. It was a little, to your point, the flow was a little different because it always is when you have an earlier Easter. Easter was April 8 this year, 2 weeks earlier. So we had terrific February. We had terrific a March leading up into that Easter, April 8. And then as we thought, we were up against Easter for 2 weeks the year before. And as we planned the sales fell back after, those 2 weeks after Easter this year. But all in all, we had a terrific first quarter, 5.6%, most of it being driven by traffic."

And we're getting new customers. So more traffic in our stores from new customers. Our mix of product that we've evolved to because of customer demand is more of the things that are purchased more often. So existing customers are shopping us also more frequently. The price is still $1, so when you talk about the average ticket, that sometimes has been a little stubborn. I view the traffic increases though as increase in market share. I view it as more customers finding us every day. And our goal in the stores now is when we get these new customers in to really, really show them a shopping experience. And that starts with all the fun things that we do at the front of the store with our variety merchandise and our seasonal. And at the same time, in-stock and in business on what they came to shop for. We are better in-stock today on basic needed product than we've ever been. When they spend their $1 on their fuel, or $4 sometimes on their gasoline and they come to our stores, we want to make sure that we give them what they need. So there's really a concentrated effort on in-stock, on basics, running great stores, fun stores, friendly stores. And we're working on improving the average ticket all the time. And I think some of the initiatives that we have in place, driving impulse sales on our front end, drive items at our checkouts, the items of the week, all the things when you walk into the store we're really challenging our customers to add one more item to their basket. And I see that as just an opportunity. We get the customer traffic in the store, I believe we can then drive some of that average ticket up."

So in regards to the various points that we raised and since the goods on the water, and we've talked a lot about smoothing of inventory flow through our network over the last couple of years and the benefits it brings to the entire organization, it all starts with the buy and the scheduled shipment. And so we've obviously continued to shift some things around. From an overall perspective, if we look at the things, the goods on the water which is a large portion of the increase, Canada was a little less than the goods on the water at the end of the day. The other thing I would mention is that another factor potentially that really relates to this is our shift in mix of product. So you've got to remember, we're reporting inventory at cost. And so part of the increase relates to that shift in the mix as we -- as our business has continued to have more consumable business. And that difference at retail is really a much smaller increase year-over-year. So that's a point of it as well. And then I think the other thing to remember is this is just a point in time disclosure. And we have many as ebbs and flows in any given year when we have -- when we're moving over $250 million cartons of goods around the world. So we look at that, but we feel very good. New stores, we've got -- we did do more new stores. I think we did about 83 new stores last year in Q1, 110 this year, so we do have more new stores.

We get -- obviously, we've been building a lot of stores in the Northeast the last few years. They tend to be very high-volume stores and so the Northeast makes sense that we need to get a new distribution center in that area. Part of it depends on growth. Part of it depends upon, again, moving of inventory is another way that we can gain efficiencies within our network, and so we continue to look at that. I think, again, size plays a part of in it, so when we look at a new distribution center, we always look at size versus stem miles because obviously a bigger building you can serve more stores. But are your stem miles going to be efficient for you in the long term? So there's a lot of different factors that go into it. And then part of it is just regionalization. Sometimes we grow stronger in certain areas of the country that can create needs, maybe prior than it would other areas. So all those things go into consideration. The typical building, have buildings that probably service 300, 400 stores, and we have some buildings that service closer to 800 stores. So it kind of gives you an idea, that 400 to 800 range is kind of a general range of stores being serviced by a building. It gives you an idea based on growth what may be kind of the cadence at the end of the day. So that you could potentially need one, every 3 to 4 years."

I'll use the word remarkable, but we've always said that we were in control of our margins. And when pricing was favorable, we would maybe take some into margin, but we're just as likely to put more value into the product and drive more top line. But also over the past several years, we have been responding to consumer needs and selling more of the things they need and building bigger stores and all that. But if you look back at the last 10 years of our history, it really is a remarkably tight range that our gross profit has performed at. If you look back at the last 10 years -- now first quarter we were 35% gross profit this year. Last year, we were 35%. If you look back at the last 10 years, the high was 35.6% and the low was 33.4% in 2006, with the average being about 34.6%. So we're just a little higher or just short of the high range of our gross profit percent. But over 10 years, as you think about the changes in diesel fuel prices and you think about the changes in cost of goods, ups and downs, and the mix changes and the larger stores and the more consumer products that we've added, and we still manage that gross profit number in just a very tight range. And if you look at our operating margin, we just -- doing that. We just posted the highest operating margin percent in the history of company at 10.9%. So I believe strongly that we're going to be able to manage our gross profit percent going forward. Could you jump out there and make one year higher, probably. But our strategy really is more along the line of offering the most value to the customer for $1 and to deliver the margin that we need for our shareholders. So in doing that, if you look at that 35% range, maybe a few higher, maybe a little lower, but it's -- that's where we're managing the value of the offering to the customer. That drives top line growth. And when we drive top line growth, we can leverage our SG&A and all the other fixed cost."

So our markup on what we sell for $1, by category, is favorable. When you start selling more of the consumer product, the mix does drive, put pressure on the gross margin. But then we get the leverage on the fixed cost. So it really is about driving the most value possible to the customer at the dollar price point and delivering that improved operating margin. 10.9%, again, I'll say it 3 times, we're really proud of that. That's the highest first quarter operating margin we've ever had. And by the way, that's the highest first quarter penetration of a consumer product that we've had. So you can do both. It's not just markup and it's not just top line. It's really both together that provides the quality of earnings that we're after. Plus, in this time and age that we're in, our customers want it, we serve our customers, we're going to sell them what they need, what they want. And I'll just say this, too, as the economy improves -- this has been a trend for several years. This isn't just a first quarter trend. But as the economy improves, we're going to do very well also because we do have a terrific mix of variety merchandise at higher margins. And it will be the same thought process, but it's just a little bit different calculation as we drive more variety sales to the mix of consumer products. So that's the secret formula. It's not really that secret, but initial markup is important. Top line growth is important and how we manage our costs and our fixed costs, as well as our variable costs is how we get to the bottom line."

So we've learned where the best demographics are. There are store size implications, as you get below that 9,000 or 8,000 square-foot store, especially, you began to pinch the assortment and you really don't have the room either on the sales floor for it or in the back room for it. So there are some natural limitations to that. We are installing them in new stores that we open if they fit our model. If it fits the model of that new store with the demographics and the size and the volume and the delivery availability, so we are putting them into new stores. And we think we're going at the proper rate. We do like it. You're exactly right. And the stores where we have frozen and refrigerated, sales per square foot are higher.

This morning, we announced our sales and earnings for the second quarter of 2012. Comparable store sales increased 4.5%. This increase was on top of a 4.7% comp in the second quarter last year and it was driven principally by increases in traffic. Total sales for the quarter grew 10.5% to $1.705 billion, exceeding the high-end of our guidance. Earnings for the second quarter were $0.51 per diluted share. This represents a 30.8% increase over last year's $0.39 per share. Operating margin for the quarter was 10.8%, an increase of 80 basis points over the second quarter last year, and another record quarter. Just to note, this is our -- this is our highest second quarter operating margin ever as a public company.
Operating income was $184.4 million, an increase of $30.9 million or 20.1% over last year. And net income rose 25.6% to $119.2 million. For the first half of 2012, compared with last year, sales were $3.43 billion, an increase of 11% and comp store sales increased to 5.1%. First half 2012 earnings per share were $1.01, an increase of 27.8% compared with $0.79 per share in the first half last year. Operating income increased by $57.2 million. Operating margin was 10.9%, an increase of 70 basis points compared with the first half 2011 and net income rose 20.1% to $235.3 million.
I'm pleased with our performance in the second quarter, both top line sales and earnings exceeded the end upper end of our guidance. Most importantly, we provided value to our customers and brought a rec rod level of second quarter earnings to the bottom line. I'm particularly pleased by the productivity of our new stores. Our location planning is improvement, the value of our merchandise has never been better and customers are responding enthusiastically. 
And our current economy with customers struggling to balance their family budgets in the face of persistently high unemployment and now unpredictable fuel prices, many people are finding Dollar Tree to be a destination for high-value consumer products. We plan to meet our customers' demand by providing these frequently purchased products consistently and at the highest value possible. It's another reason to shop at Dollar Tree. 
And when customers are in the store, shopping for the basics, we plan to give them every reason to stock up on our terrific assortment of high-value and higher-margin variety merchandise. Even in a difficult economy, at Dollar Tree, you can still splurge everything is still $1. 
Sales increases in the second quarter came from growth in both basic and variety categories, with basic consumable categories growing at a slightly faster pace. Our top-performing categories included Housewares in home products, food and beverages, healthcare supplies and toys. I'm extremely pleased with the continued increase in inventory productivity. Inventory turns increased once again in the second quarter as they have consistently for the past 7 years. 
Our growth strategy remains consistent. It is to open more stores, to open more productive stores and to develop and expand new formats, new markets and new channels. In regard to more stores, during the  second quarter visit, we opened 77 new stores and relocated and expanded another 21 stores. Through the first half, we have added 187 new stores and expanded or relocated 65 stores. Selling square footage increased 7.1% relative to the same time last year.
We ended the quarter with 4,523 stores and we're on track with our plan for full year 2012, which includes 315 new stores and 75 relocations and expansions for a total of 390 projects across the U.S. and Canada.
In order to achieve consistent and profitable growth, our practice is to add infrastructure and distribution capacity to support our growth ahead of the need. In that regard, in July, we broke ground on DC-10, a new distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut. The new distribution center will be 1 million square feet. It will be automated and highly efficient, providing capacity and cost-effective service to our stores as we continue to expand in the Northeast. Along with opening new stores, we are focused on operating more productive stores. Efforts have been concentrated on improved site selection, on rightsizing our stores, expanding our assortments, improve staffing, building the bench of qualified store management and on opening new stores earlier in the year. Average new store productivity has increased in each of the past 6 years and the trend has continued through the second quarter 2012. Our expansion of frozen and refrigerated product continues. We installed freezers and coolers and 60 additional stores in the second quarter and now offer frozen and refrigerated product in 2,403 stores. We intend to roll this product out to 138 additional stores by year-end for a total of approximately 325 installations for the full year.
This important category serves the current needs of our customers and it drives traffic and drive stores more frequently, which promotes incremental sales across all categories. Our overall comp sales increase has been the result of growth in both needs base consumer products and higher-margin discretionary bra merchandise. 
[indiscernible] our strategy to increase store productivity can be seen throughout our stores. Seasonal presentations are more powerful, we're emphasizing more effective customer engagement and we're working to drive more related sales across merchandising. In addition, we're expanding our assortments in many categories, including candy, stationery, health and beauty care and home and also products, which was our fastest growing category the second quarter. Another key component of our growth strategy is the development of new retail formats and the expansion of our geographic reach. Our Deal$ format extends our ability to serve more customers with more categories and increases our unit growth potential. Deal$ delivers everyday essentials spotted goods, seasonal and home product. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point at Deal$, we're able to serve more customers with more products at value prices everyday.
Customers are responding favorably to the strategy customer awareness of the Deal$ brand is growing and the concept is building momentum. In the second quarter, Deal$ had strong sales across a wide variety of merchandise categories. To give you an idea, in May, we broke our Summer Fun promotion featuring the most relevant products for the summer season. This included snacks, beverage, picnic supplies, as well as lawn and garden and patio products. Deal$ outdoor products were very popular led by lawn and garden, patio solar light, decorations and lawn ornaments. As temperature soared sometime into the triple digits Deal$ selection of summer hats HVAC the beach towels and summer toys sold particularly well. And our selection of electric fans were a great value and big hit. 
Overall in the second quarter, as in the past several quarters, traffic average ticket and average unit retail all continued to increase at our Deal$ stores. Comp store sales in our Deal$ stores have led the company in recent quarters. We're excited about the growth potential deals and particularly the opportunity that it provides to grow profitably and higher cost of operation urban markets. we ended the quarter with a total of 190 Deal$ stores.
Our Canadian integration and expansion continues. As a reminder, we initially entered the Canadian market through the acquisition of Dollar Giant stores in November of 2010. Our primary focus in the first year in 2011 was to install and train Dollar Tree retail systems to integrate processes to align merchandise assortments and store teams and to lay the foundation for future profitable growth in the Canadian market. This year, we're working to make use of the new systems, build history and to leverage the investment. Our focus is on developing efficiency and store operations and improving the flow of product to the stores and it continued building and training of our store teams. We're working very hard to increase the service level of in-stock positions of basic products, while improving the shopping experience through a more powerful seasonal presence and a higher level of merchandise energy. Our goal over time is to be the largest retailer in Canada as a single price point of $1.25, just as we've done in the U.S. at the $1 price.
We began the year with the plan to grow our Canadian store base approximately 25% under the Dollar Tree brand and we will likely exceed this plan by 10 or 12 stores. We opened 10 stores in the second quarter, 18 stores year-to-date, and we ended the quarter with 117 Canadian stores. We have a lot of room to grow at Dollar Tree. As we grow and improve, we believe the Canadian market can support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores. This is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States, plus additional growth in our Deal$ format.
Dollar Tree Direct, our online business continues to expand and develop. BTP is providing an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand the brand and attract more customers into our stores. Dollar Tree Direct now offers more than 2,500 items online. Traffic exceeded 4 million visitors in the second quarter, a 14% increase over the second quarter last year. Of special note the now have more than a 0.5 million friends on Facebook and more than 1 million customer logged on via their smartphones. We're gaining customer every quarter and I'm pleased with the progress. 
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin, who will give you more detail on our financial metrics and provide guidance."

As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 30.8% in the second quarter to $0.51.

As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 30.8% in the second quarter to $0.51. The increase resulted from our strong sales and expense controls, which drove an 80 basis point improvement in operating profit margin compared to the second quarter last year. Our gross profit margin was 35.2% during the second quarter, consistent with the 35.2% reported in the second quarter last year. Several factors contributed to this performance. We leveraged occupancy and distribution expenses, reflecting the 4.5% comp store sales growth. Second, IMU on many categories increased in the second quarter, reflecting continued improvements in sourcing and the flexibility of our merchandise model. Third, we achieved small markdowns [indiscernible] compared with the second quarter 2011. These factors were offset principally by 2 items. Our product mix continues to shift in the second quarter, but to a lesser degree than we have seen in several years. Basic consumable products increased by 45 basis points as a percentage of sales in the second quarter. 
Also, as we have previously disclosed, in the second quarter last year, we recorded available inventory adjustment related to immaterial corrections to prior period, which benefited gross profit last year. SG&A expenses were 24.4% of sales for the quarter, an 80 basis point improvement from the second quarter of last year. Payroll-related expenses declined by 60 basis points, driven by leverage on payroll and lower expenses for stock compensation, incentive compensation and Worker's Compensation. Health insurance benefit expenses increased relative to the second quarter last year.
Operating expenses declined by about 20 basis points due to lower costs for utilities, repairs and maintenance, as well as leverage on sales. Operating income increased $31 million compared to the second quarter of last year. Operating margin for the quarter was 10.8%, an 80 basis point improvement compared to the second quarter last year. The tax rate for the quarter was 35% compared to 37.7% in the second quarter last year. The lower rate is primarily a result of statute expirations in the settlement of a state tax audit. The lower tax rate represented about a $0.025 per share benefit to second quarter earnings per share. 
Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow. Our cash and investments at quarter end totaled $379.8 million versus $545.4 million at the end of the second quarter 2011. Cash, net of debt was $115.5 million at the end of the second quarter. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of Dollar Tree stock for $80.9 million. At quarter end, we had $1.1 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. The diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the second quarter was 232.6 million.
We continue to be share repurchase as a good use of capital. Over the past 4 quarters, we have invested $634.6 million for share repurchase. We will update you on additional share repurchases, if any, at the end of the quarter which they may occur. 
Also, during the second quarter, we entered into a new $750 million unsecured credit agreement. The previous $550 million credit agreement was terminated concurrent with entering into the new agreement. The company has drawn $250 million under the new revolving credit line. This amount is reflected as long-term debt of the balance sheet. Our consolidated inventory at quarter end was 9.6% greater than it was at the same time last year. Selling square footage increased 7.1%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot increased by 2.3%. The increase reflects an increase in goods on the water and in the distribution centers at the end of the second quarter, as we continue to execute our smoothing of inventory flow throughout our logistics network. 
Inventory turns increased in the second quarter and we expect this trend to continue for the full year 2012 as it has for the past 7 years.
Capital expenditures were $74.7 million in the second quarter of 2012 versus $63 million in the second quarter last year. For the full year, we are planning consolidated capital expenditures to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 325 stores, IT key system enhancements and approximately $70 million towards a new distribution centers in Windsor, Connecticut. The total capital investment anticipated for this facility is approximately $100 million. 
Depreciation and amortization was $43 million compared to $39.6 million in the second quarter last year. We expect depreciation expense of $170 million to $180 million for the year. 
Our guidance for the second half includes several assumptions. First, Halloween shift 2 days deeper into the fourth quarter this year from the first Monday of the quarter last year to the first Wednesday this year. We believe that this will shift approximately $5 million of sales for the third quarter into the fourth quarter compared to last year. Second, due to the retail calendar, 2012 will include 53 weeks and the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. This is expected to add the $120 million to $130 million of incremental sales and $0.07 of $0.08 of earnings per diluted share to the fourth quarter and the full year.
Our guidance assumes a tax rate of 38.2% for the third quarter and 37.6% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 231.7 million shares for the third quarter and 232.2 million shares for the full year. As always, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase. 
With this in mind, for the third quarter of 2012, we are forecasting sales in the range of $1.71 billion to $1.75 billion, based on a low to mid-single digit comparable status increase to 7.2% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share expected to be in the range of $0.47 to $0.51, an increase of 9.3% to 18.6%.
For the full fiscal year of 2012, we are raising our guidance. We are now forecasting sales in the range of $7.36 billion to $7.45 billion, based on a low to mid-single digit in comparable store sales, with 7.2% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.54, representing an increase of between 21.9% and 26.4%. [indiscernible] record earnings per share of $2.01 in fiscal 2011. That does take into account the 53rd week will be included in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over back to Bob."

As I said in May at our last call, we entered this year with goals to drive more customer traffic, to thrill our customers with surprising values on merchandise they need and want, to improve our shopping experience and to build market share. We continue to make progress toward accomplishing all of these goals. First half sales grew 11% to a record $3.43 billion. Comp store sales increased 5.1% on top of a 5.9% comp last year, driven by increased customer traffic. Our inventory is balanced and more productive than ever. Our turns increased again in the first half and we enter third quarter well prepared for new store growth and customer demand. 
Our operating margin increased by 70 basis points to 10.9%. The all-time highest first half operating margin in our history. Net income grew 20.1% to $235.3 million and earnings per share increased by 27.8% to $1.01 per share. In addition, we opened 187 new stores across the U.S. and Canada and so far, the productivity of the new stores class have been performing ahead of last year. 
Looking forward, I believe that we are positioned to do even better in the future. The focus is on our customers and our stores are and product. They are strategically located to serve Middle-America. The our bright, convenient and fun to shop. Our business model is powerful and flexible. We can adapt to a changing environment. This has been tested by time and validated over the company's 26-year history. Our balance mix of high value consumer basics and our unique assortment of fun and compelling discretionary product positions us to be relevant customers in all economic circumstances. 
Dollar Tree is a solid and scalable infrastructure that we're expanding and leveraging for better inventory management, increasingly efficient supply chain logistics more productive stores and crisper execution overall. The Deal$ brand is gaining traction, both traffic and average ticket are growing. Dollar Tree Direct continues to broaden its reach. And we're working diligently to build and expand our Canadian business. We have plenty of opportunities to grow our business. Our vision of where we want to go and the infrastructure and capital to make that happen. We continue to generate substantial free cash, and we use our capital for the long-term benefit of shareholders. 
It's really exciting to be at Dollar Tree. We had a great first half. Our merchandise values are better than ever, and our future has never been brighter. As we enter the third quarter, our shelf is full of the bright products, our stock room is in great shape and our values have never been higher.

And I would tell you that where we saw the biggest benefits as we called out was due to payroll line items. And as you well know our biggest SG&A line item is our store payroll and our field payroll for those teams. And they did a very, very good job in the quarter of being efficient and we leverage those costs very, very well. And so as you think about it, I've spoken a lot over the last couple of years about the idea flowing inventory in a much more efficient manner through our system, and I would say this is one of the aspects of it in affecting labor. So this year, we'll basically have about 300 million cases of products flow through our distribution centers, which ultimately get to our stores. The average store, we get about 70,000 cases. Obviously, we have many stores that do well above average sales. We're having a lot more cases. So a lot of work has been done as we've spoken in regards to how we're flowing these goods, so the logistics folks starts with the buy and how it's been float to the distribution center and then to the stores. And we do believe that we're making gains there. At the same time, we do believe that there's more to be gained in the long run as we continue to go down that path. As far as Canadian SG&A, obviously, we did a lot of work last year with infrastructure. And so we haven't seen the same leverage there. And we don't necessarily expect to see the same leverage in the near term as we continue to build out our teams. The other thing that we have going on out there is relating the stores that are in the Ontario province, relaying them and re-branding them as Dollar Tree stores. So there's extra labor that goes into that. So we've not at this point, we've not seen that. Obviously, longer-term, we do believe that there are there will be benefits from the infrastructure, the changes in the making, as well as productivity of the stores."

So there's always a balance between that and what we call our variety merchandise, which is the find and the seasonal and other things that be surprising values are defined at Dollar Tree. Discretionary product, higher-margin type products. So we're always talking about the balance. And if you look at past several quarters, there's been an increase in the consumer products as a percent of our total, driven by the down economy. The dire straits that a lot of people are in with high unemployment, with uncertainty of fuel prices, with many uncertainties that is out there. So that was really all I was speaking to about it. We're not really changing our distribution strategy. I'm just speaking to the fact that we still see continued penetration from the consumer products, driven by the customers' need. And our intent is to continue to serve our customers. Sometimes I'm asked questions about well how far do you think that is? We're following our customers need. And were going to continue to do that. When you look at the second quarter, do is really a very good balance. I think the penetration of consumer products increased about 45 basis points, which gave us a little bit of about a 22 basis points headwind on gross profit during the quarter.

As prices go up, we change the product, not the retail price that we drive to get the best cost, the best value for the customer at $1. And at a price that fits our gross margin. And as prices can maybe pressure maybe a little bit down, we tend to invest more into product. We get better product for the same $1 price because we're still driving to get the most value for $1 and at a cost that fits our budget. So that's our strategy. It has been.

I can tell you just speaking about it anecdotally, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made in Deal$. Our customers expecting it more and more and recognizing the value that Deal$ provide. It lags in profitability as a percent, but our top line is growing and I think there's still a huge opportunity to drive the top line to higher levels at the same time, managing our expenses a little better. We're still in the try and test in line kind of a mode and we'll still build the store or and really be great but that will change it and then will turn it upside down sometimes every do it. So there's still things were looking at. We know that we can get more productive, more efficient in our sales floor. We know we can drive efficiencies and the way we deliver our product, the way we display our product. We know that we can drive efficiencies better cost advantage on the items that we are buying as we get larger as the Deal$ chain grows and the volume, our leverage on the buy gets better. So I'm very excited about Deal$. We intend to keep growing Deal$ mainly we're using it right now in the higher cost of operations urban markets because we do believe we can drive more top line sales in our Deal$ store. So good question. I can't give you -- I can't breakout the number because we don't. I will just share with you the great enthusiasm that we have for Deal$ here that I particularly have for Deal$. Deal$ is going to be a big part of our business as we go through time here at Dollar Tree and I'm very excited about it."

The seasonal offer that we have.

Well, really, I'm happy. We are doing both, by the way, we'd want to drive all of our business. But the strategy is to use consumer basics for traffic and the variety merchandise for shopping experience and find and margin. That's what you saw in the second quarter, the consumer basics increased penetration still by 45 basis points. But that's a smaller increase than we've seen in some recent quarters."

We're replacing orders for the summer of next year, the summer of 2013. And as I said earlier, and as you've heard me say frequently, we have a flexible model. We're not -- we don't set planograms. We're not stock on any one item. Our merchants go-to-market whether it's in the U.S. or in China or wherever else in the world. There's really 2 goals. One, the most value to our customers for $1, and number two, at a margin that we need for our financials. They can always change item. They can drop an item. They can add a nighttime but the end of the day, we're always in control of our margin for that reason and this trip was no different in that regard. I would tell you just to characterize the pricing, overall, the input, the download from the merchants upon return was that it was a real -- a terrific trip. One of the best environments that they've been in quite some time. The nonfood commodity prices were down in some cases significantly done over a year ago. Cotton prices for instance where we much more favorable. The currency seem to be stable. A year ago, there was a lot of anxiety and talk in the market on the part of Chinese vendors over more appreciation versus the U.S. dollar. Not so much stock this year, so that's all settled down. A lot of this is driven, of course, by the slower Chinese domestic growth in conjunction with the slower worldwide demand basically in Europe, as you hear a lot of talk in China about the slowdown in Europe. That's put downward pressure on prices. And when Dollar Tree and you're open to buy and you're growing and you have cash, then that's a real advantages as we go as to China. Our assortments from the trip are compelling, fresh, a lot of new product purchased on this trip, values, the best-ever and I just can't wait to see it on the shelf. So not much to talk about inflation, I guess on this trip."

We had its own growth on our top line, 2.5%. Our stores it tells me, our stores our relevant than ever. Our customers responding favorably. As an example, our new store productivity but it's up right now the highest in over 10 years. The comp increase of 4.5% is consistent and in line with our guidance. It's actually well above the midpoint and toward the top end of our guidance. Last year, comps in same quarter was 4.7%, this year 4.5%. And we continue to comp year-over-year. And our 4-year comp, 22% plus. And now, we're comping on a much larger comp base than before. So I see 4.5%. We got leverage on our occupancy. We've got leverage in expenses. Our gross profit percent was 35.2%, flat to last year, which means we overcame some of the hurdles of the more consumer products that we're selling, and so gross profit was terrific. It was -- our business is well managed. SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 80 basis points, so just a lot of good news in this quarter. Inventory is up. Productive is up, year-over-year for 7 years, consistent, strong and growing, that's what we always talk about here. So yes, you've got to look at the comps, but 4.5% is a good comp. It's consistent comp and on this 4.5% comp we got a lot of leverage and we dropped a whole lot to the bottom line we've the EPS increased over 30%, 34.8%. So that's how I look at second quarter, and we still view Dollar Tree as having a lot of room to grow. We have a growth strategy that includes more Dollar Tree stores. We have a deal, which is gaining traction another way to grow. And if model. We've got Dollar Tree Canada, you geography, huge opportunities for growth in Canada.

This morning, we announced our sales and earnings for the second quarter of 2012. Comparable store sales increased 4.5%. This increase was on top of a 4.7% comp in the second quarter last year, and it was driven principally by increases in traffic. Total sales for the quarter grew 10.5% to $1.705 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance. Earnings for the second quarter were $0.51 per diluted share. This represents a 30.8% increase over last year's $0.39 per share. Operating margin for the quarter was 10.8%, an increase of 80 basis points over the second quarter last year and another record quarter. Just to note, this is our second -- this is our highest second quarter operating margin ever as a public company.
Operating income was $184.4 million, an increase of $30.9 million or 20.1% over last year. And net income rose 25.6% to $119.2 million. For the first half of 2012, compared with last year, sales were $3.43 billion, an increase of 11%, and comp store sales increased 5.1%. First half 2012 earnings per share were $1.01, an increase of 27.8% compared with $0.79 per share in the first half last year. Operating income increased by $57.2 million. Operating margin was 10.9%, an increase of 70 basis points compared with the first half 2011, and net income rose 20.1% to $235.3 million.
I'm pleased with our performance in the second quarter, both top line sales and earnings exceeded the end upper end of guidance. Most importantly, we provided value to our customers and brought a record level of second quarter earnings to the bottom line. I'm particularly pleased by the productivity of our new stores. Our location planning is improving, the value of our merchandise has never been better and customers are responding enthusiastically. 
In our current economy with customers struggling to balance their family budgets in the face of persistently high unemployment and now unpredictable fuel prices, many people are finding Dollar Tree to be a destination for high-value consumer products. We plan to meet our customers' demand by providing these frequently purchased products consistently and at the highest value possible. It's another reason to shop at Dollar Tree. 
And when customers are in the store, shopping for the basics, we plan to give them every reason to stock up on our terrific assortment of high-value and high-margin variety merchandise. Even in a difficult economy, at Dollar Tree, you can still splurge. Everything is still $1. 
Sales increases in the second quarter came from growth in both basic and variety categories, with basic consumable categories growing at a slightly faster pace. Our top-performing categories included housewares and home products, food and beverages, health care supplies and toys. I'm extremely pleased with the continued increase in inventory productivity. Inventory turns increased once again in the second quarter as they have consistently for the past 7 years. 
Our growth strategy remains consistent: It is to open more stores, to open more productive stores and to develop and expand new formats, new markets and new channels. In regard to more stores, during the second quarter this year, we opened 77 new stores and relocated and expanded another 21 stores. Through the first half, we have added 187 new stores and expanded or relocated 65 stores. Selling square footage increased 7.1% relative to the same time last year.
We ended the quarter with 4,523 stores, and we're on track with our plan for the full year 2012, which includes 315 new stores and 75 relocations and expansions for a total of 390 projects across the U.S. and Canada.
In order to achieve consistent and profitable growth, our practice has been to add infrastructure and distribution capacity to support our growth ahead of the need. In that regard, in July, we broke ground on DC 10, a new distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut. The new distribution center will be 1 million square feet. It will be automated and highly efficient, providing capacity and cost-effective service to our stores as we continue to expand in the Northeast. Along with opening new stores, we are focused on operating more productive stores. Efforts have been concentrated on improved site selection, on rightsizing our stores, expanding our assortments, improve staffing, building the bench of qualified store management and on opening new stores earlier in the year. Average new store productivity has increased in each of the past 6 years, and the trend has continued through the second quarter of 2012. Our expansion of frozen and refrigerated product continues. We installed freezers and coolers in 60 additional stores in the second quarter and now offer frozen and refrigerated product in 2,403 stores. We intend to roll this product out to 138 additional stores by year-end for a total of approximately 325 installations for the full year.
This important category serves the current needs of our customers and it drives traffic and drive stores more frequently, which promotes incremental sales across all categories. Our overall comp sales increase has been the result of growth in both needs-base consumer products and in higher margin discretionary variety merchandise. 
The elements of our strategy to increase store productivity can be seen throughout our stores. Seasonal presentations are more powerful, we're emphasizing more effective customer engagement and we're working to drive more related sales through cross merchandising. In addition, we're expanding our assortments in many categories, including candy, stationery, health and beauty care and home and household products, which was our fastest growing category the second quarter. Another key component of our growth strategy is the development of new retail formats and the expansion of our geographic reach. Our Deal$ format extends our ability to serve more customers with more categories and increases our unit growth potential. Deal$ delivers low prices everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home product. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point at Deal$, we're able to serve more customers with more products at value prices every day.
Customers are responding favorably to the strategy, customer awareness that the Deal$ brand is growing, and the concept is building momentum. In the second quarter, Deal$ had strong sales across a wide variety of merchandise categories. To give you an idea, in May, we broke our Summer Fun promotion, featuring the most relevant products for the summer season. This included snacks, beverage, picnic supplies, as well as lawn and garden and patio products. Deal$ outdoor products were very popular, led by lawn and garden, patio solar lights, decorations and lawn ornaments. As temperature soared sometimes into the triple digits, Deal$ selection of summer hats, shoes, beach bags, beach towels and summer toys sold particularly well. And our selection of electric fans were a great value and a big hit. 
Overall in the second quarter, as in the past several quarters, traffic, average ticket and average unit retail all continued to increase at our Deal$ stores. Comp store sales in our Deal$ stores have led the company in recent quarters. We're excited about the growth potential of Deal$ and particularly the opportunity that it provides to grow profitably in the higher cost of operation urban markets. We ended the quarter with a total of 190 Deal$ stores.
Our Canadian integration and expansion continues. As a reminder, we initially entered the Canadian market through the acquisition of Dollar Giant stores in November of 2010. Our primary focus in the first year in 2011 was to install and train Dollar Tree retail systems to integrate processes, to align merchandise assortments and store teams and to lay the foundation for future profitable growth in the Canadian market. This year, we're working to make use of the new systems, build history and to leverage the investment. Our focus is on developing efficiency in store operations, improving the flow of product to the stores and the continued building and training of our store teams. We're working very hard to increase the service level and in-stock positions of basic products while improving the shopping experience through a more powerful seasonal presence and a higher level of merchandise energy. Our goal, over time, is to be the largest retailer in Canada at the single price point of $1.25, just as we've done in the U.S. at the $1 price.
We began the year with a plan to grow our Canadian store base approximately 25% under the Dollar Tree brand, and we will likely exceed this plan by 10 or 12 stores. We opened 10 stores in the second quarter, 18 stores year-to-date, and we ended the quarter with 117 Canadian stores. We have a lot of room to grow at Dollar Tree. As we grow and improve, we believe the Canadian market can support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores. This is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States, plus additional growth in our Deal$ format.
Dollar Tree Direct, our online business, continues to expand and development -- and develop. DTD is providing an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand the brand and attract more customers into our stores. Dollar Tree Direct now offers more than 2,500 items online. Traffic exceeded 4 million visitors in the second quarter, a 14% increase over the second quarter of last year. Of special note, we now have more than a 0.5 million friends on Facebook, and more than 1 million customers logged on via their smartphones. We're gaining customers every quarter, and I'm pleased with the progress. 
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin, who will give you more detail on our financial metrics and provide guidance."

As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 30.8% in the second quarter to $0.51. The increase resulted from our strong sales and expense controls, which drove an 80 basis point improvement in operating profit margin compared t",1088,"Thanks, Bob. As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 30.8% in the second quarter to $0.51. The increase resulted from our strong sales and expense controls, which drove an 80 basis point improvement in operating profit margin compared to the second quarter last year. Our gross profit margin was 35.2% during the second quarter, consistent with the 35.2% reported in the second quarter last year. Several factors contributed to this performance. We leveraged occupancy and distribution expenses, reflecting the 4.5% comp store sales growth. Second, IMU on many categories increased in the second quarter, reflecting continued improvements in sourcing and the flexibility of our merchandise model. Third, we achieved small reductions in shrink and markdowns compared with the second quarter 2011. These factors were offset principally by 2 items: Our product mix continue to shift in the second quarter, but to a lesser degree than we have seen in several years; basic consumable products increased by 45 basis points as a percentage of sales in the second quarter. 
Also, as we have previously disclosed, in the second quarter last year, we recorded a favorable inventory adjustment related to immaterial corrections to prior period, which benefited gross profit last year. SG&A expenses were 24.4% of sales for the quarter, an 80 basis point improvement from the second quarter last year. Payroll-related expenses declined by 60 basis points, driven by leverage on payroll and lower expenses for stock compensation, incentive compensation and worker's compensation. Health insurance benefit expenses increased relative to the second quarter last year.
Operating expenses declined by about 20 basis points due to lower costs for utilities, repairs and maintenance, as well as leverage on sales. Operating income increased $31 million compared to the second quarter last year. Operating margin for the quarter was 10.8%, an 80 basis point improvement compared to the second quarter last year. Tax rate for the quarter was 35% compared to 37.7% in the second quarter last year. The lower rate is primarily a result of statute expirations in the settlement of a state tax audit. The lower tax rate represented about a $0.025 per share benefit to second quarter earnings per share. 
Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow, our cash and investments at quarter end totaled $379.8 million versus $545.4 million at the end of the second quarter 2011. Cash net of debt was $115.5 million at the end of the second quarter. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of Dollar Tree stock for $80.9 million. At quarter end, we had $1.1 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. The diluted weighted average share that's outstanding for the second quarter was 232.6 million.
We continue to view share repurchase as a good use of capital. Over the past 4 quarters, we have invested $634.6 million for share repurchase. We will update you on additional share repurchases, if any, at the end of the quarter in which they may occur. 
Also, during the second quarter, we entered into a new $750 million unsecured credit agreement. The previous $550 million credit agreement was terminated concurrent with entering into the new agreement. The company has drawn $250 million under the new revolving credit line. This amount is reflected as long-term debt on the balance sheet. Our consolidated inventory at quarter end was 9.6% greater than it was at the same time last year. Selling square footage increased 7.1%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot increased by 2.3%. The increase reflects an increase in goods, on the water and in the distribution centers at the end of the second quarter as we continue to execute our smoothing of inventory flow throughout our logistics network. 
Inventory turns increased in the second quarter, and we expect this trend to continue for the full year 2012 as it has for the past 7 years.
Capital expenditures were $74.7 million in the second quarter of 2012 versus $63 million in the second quarter last year. For the full year, we are planning consolidated capital expenditures to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 325 stores, IT system enhancements and approximately $70 million towards a new distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut. The total capital investment anticipated for this facility is approximately $100 million. 
Depreciation and amortization was $43 million compared to $39.6 million in the second quarter last year. We expect depreciation expense of $170 million to $180 million for the year. 
Our guidance for the second half of 2012 includes several assumptions. First, Halloween shifts 2 days deeper into the fourth quarter this year, from the first Monday of the quarter last year to the first Wednesday this year. We believe that this will shift approximately $5 million of sales for the third quarter into the fourth quarter compared to last year. Second, due to the retail calendar, 2012 will include 53 weeks, and the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. This is expected to add the $120 million to $130 million of incremental sales and $0.07 to $0.08 of earnings per diluted share to the fourth quarter and the full year.
Our guidance assumes a tax rate of 38.2% for the third quarter and 37.6% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 231.7 million shares for the third quarter and 232.2 million shares for the full year. As always, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase. 
With this in mind, for the third quarter of 2012, we are forecasting sales in the range of $1.71 billion to $1.75 billion, based on a low to mid-single digit comparable store sales increase and 7.2% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share expected to be in the range of $0.47 to $0.51, an increase of 9.3% to 18.6%.
For the full fiscal year of 2012, we are raising our guidance. We are now forecasting sales in the range of $7.36 billion to $7.45 billion, based on a low to mid-single digit increase in comparable store sales and 7.2% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.54, representing an increase of between 21.9% and 26.4%, over our record earnings per share of $2.01 in fiscal 2011, and that does take into account the 53rd week that will be included in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

As I said in May, at our last call, we entered this year with goals to drive more customer traffic, to thrill our customers with surprising values on merchandise they need and want, to improve our shopping experience and to build market share. We continue to make progress toward accomplishing all of these goals. First half sales grew 11% to a record $3.43 billion. Comp store sales increased 5.1% on top of a 5.9% comp last year, driven by increased customer traffic. Our inventory is balanced and more productive than ever. Our turns increased again in the first half, and we enter third quarter well prepared for new store growth and customer demand. 
Our operating margin increased by 70 basis points to 10.9%, the all-time highest first half operating margin in our history. Net income grew 20.1% to $235.3 million, and earnings per share increased by 27.8% to $1.01 per share. In addition, we opened 187 new stores across the U.S. and Canada, and so far, the productivity of the new store class has been performing ahead of last year. 
Looking forward, I believe that we're positioned to do even better in the future. The focus is on our customer and our stores and our products. They're strategically located to serve Middle America. They're bright, convenient and fun to shop. Our business model is powerful and flexible. We can adapt through a changing environment. This has been tested by time and validated over the company's 26-year history. Our balance mix of high-value consumer basics and our unique assortment of fun and compelling discretionary product positions us to be relevant to customers in all economic circumstances. 
Dollar Tree has a solid and scalable infrastructure that we're expanding and leveraging for better inventory management, increasingly efficient supply chain logistics, more productive stores and crisper execution overall. The Deal$ brand is gaining traction, both traffic and average ticket are growing. Dollar Tree Direct continues to broaden its reach. And we're working diligently to build and expand our Canadian business. We have plenty of opportunities to grow our business, a vision of where we want to go and the infrastructure and capital to make it happen. We continue to generate substantial free cash, and we use our capital for the long-term benefit of shareholders. 
It's really exciting to be at Dollar Tree. We had a great first half. Our merchandise values are better than ever, and our future has never been brighter. As we enter the third quarter, our shelf is full of the right products, our stock rooms are in great shape and our values have never been higher.

And I would tell you that where we saw the biggest benefits, as we called out, was in -- due to payroll line items. And as you well know, our biggest SG&A line item is our store payroll and our field payroll for those teams. And they did a very, very good job in the quarter of being efficient, and we leverage those costs very, very well. And so as you think about it, I've spoken a lot over the last couple of years about the idea of flowing inventory in a much more efficient manner through our system, and I would say this is one of the aspects of it in affecting labor. So this year, we'll basically have about 300 million cases of products flow through our distribution centers, which ultimately get to our stores. The average store would get about 70,000 cases. Obviously, we have many stores that do well above average sales. We're having a lot more cases. So a lot of work has been done as we've spoken in regards to how we're flowing these goods. So the logistics folks starts with the buy and how it's then flowed through the distribution centers and then to the stores. And we do believe that we're making gains there. At the same time, we do believe there's more to be gained in the long run as we continue to go down that path. As far as Canadian SG&A, honestly, we did a lot of work last year with infrastructure and so we haven't seen the same leverage there, and we don't necessarily expect to see the same leverage in the near term as we continue to build out our teams. The other thing that we have going on up there is relaying these stores that are in the Ontario province, relaying them and rebranding them as Dollar Tree stores. So there's extra labor that goes into that. So we've not -- at this point, we've not seen that. Obviously, longer term, we do believe that there are -- there will be benefits from the infrastructure, the changes that we're making as well as productivity of the stores."

We get a lot of questions about the penetration of consumer products to our overall mix. And, of course, consumer products are really important to our traffic because customers buy them more frequently, everybody needs them, they shop more frequently for them. So it helps increase our traffic. But there's always a balance. But they're a lower -- little lower margin, higher turns, a little bit lower margin. So there's always a balance between that and our -- what we call our variety merchandise, which is the fun and the seasonal and all the things at surprising values to find at Dollar Tree -- discretionary products, higher-margin-type products. So we're always talking about the balance. And if you look at past several quarters, there's been an increase in the consumer products as a percent of our total, driven by the down economy, the dire straits that a lot of people are in with: high unemployment, with uncertainty of fuel prices, with any uncertainties that there is out there. So that was really all I was speaking to about it. We're not really changing our distribution strategy. I'm just speaking to the fact that we still can set -- we still see continued penetration from the consumer products driven by the customers' need. And our intent is to continue to serve our customers. Sometimes, I ask -- I'm asked questions about, ""Well, how far do you think that is?"" Well, we're really following our customers' lead, and we're going to continue to do that. If you look at second quarter, it was really a very good balance. I think the penetration of consumer products increased about 45 basis points, which gave us a little bit of about a 22 basis point headwind on gross profit during the quarter, and we still ended up with gross profit flat to last year. So we're really pleased with the performance in that regard. That's what I was speaking to, though, was the mix."

We've always said that we're in charge, we're in control of our gross margins, and I will tell you that we still are. As prices go up, we change the product, not the retail price, and we drive to get the best cost, the best value for the customer at $1, and at a price that fits our gross margin. And as prices can -- maybe price is a little bit down, we tend to invest more in the product. We get better products for the same $1 price because we're still striving to get -- give the customer the most value for $1 and at a cost that fits our budget. So that's our strategy. It has been. It's worked for us that's why we are still in that tight range there over the past 10 years, and I expect we'll continue to be there.

And -- but I would expect it to continue to increase slightly year-over-year as we go forward. As far as it relates then to the ticket, again, obviously, traffic is up. Now we're generating a lot of traffic. Maybe the average ticket isn't going up significantly, but it has gone up a little bit last year, and it's been up just slightly this year. And again, as to what Bob has spoken about, there's a lot of focus from our group internally to look at impulse items in the front end of our stores and how do you get that person to put one more item in their basket. Because, obviously, our comp is all driven off units. There is no price inflation built into our comps, so it's all about getting people to pick up one more item, putting it in the basket. And -- but at this point in time, we're obviously going to take advantage of the traffic. And if that's what they need, it's -- under the current economic circumstances, they're just going to come more frequently and spend a similar dollar amount, that's okay, too."

But look, we always watching them. We watch all the competition. We stay more focused on what we're doing than what they're doing though. If you look at the stores where they've opened up in California, excuse me, there's no visible negative impact from their opening that we can see. We had them around for a long time though, you got to understand. They're a lot older than we are and their model is just different. It's different when everything is not $1, it's just a different model. It's a different customer. It's different store layout, different pricing. So we really stay focused on our position on the marketplace. About half of our stores are within 3 miles of a Dollar General anyway. About 1/4 of our stores are within 1 mile of a Dollar General. They're a much larger company than we are, so we see them all over the country. California is no different. Actually, in California, we have a lot more stores. And basically, California is one of our more populous states in regard to stores. But we've seen no impact from them. We have great respect for them, we're just a different model. When everything is at $1, it's just different than they are. So we don't see the impact there.

Our merchants recently returned from Asia, where they're replacing orders for our needs for the summer of next year, the summer of 2013. And as I said earlier, and as you've heard me say frequently, we have a flexible model. We're not -- we don't set planograms. We're not stuck on any one item. Our merchants go to market, whether it's in the U.S. or in China or wherever else in the world, with really 2 goals: one, to give the most value to our customers for $1; and number two, at the margin that we need for our financials. They can always change an item. They can drop an item. They can add an item. But at the end of the day, we're always in control of our margin for that reason, and this trip was no different in that regard. I would tell you, just to characterize the pricing, it's -- overall, the input, the down look from the merchants upon return was that it was a real -- a terrific trip, one of the best environments that they've seen in quite some time. The nonfood commodity prices were down and in some cases significantly down over a year ago. Cotton prices, for instance, were much more favorable. The currency seems to be stable. A year ago, there was a lot of anxiety and talk in the market on the part of Chinese vendors over -- more appreciation versus the U.S. dollar. Not so much talk this year, so that's all settled down. A lot of this is driven, of course, by the slower Chinese domestic growth in conjunction with the slower worldwide demand basically in Europe, as you hear a lot of talk in China about the slowdown in Europe. That's put downward pressure on prices. And when Dollar Tree and you're open to buy and you're growing and you have cash, then that's a real advantage is when you go -- as we go to China. Our assortments from the trip are compelling, fresh, a lot of new product purchased on this trip, value is the best ever, and I just can't wait to see it on the shelf. So not much talk about inflation, I guess, on this trip."

We had a solid growth on our top line, 10.5%. Our stores tells me -- our stores are seen as more relevant than ever. Our customers responding favorably. As example, our new store productivity, I keep telling them, it's right now, the highest in over 10 years. The comp increase of 4.5% is consistent and in line with our guidance. It's actually well above the midpoint and toward the top end of our guidance. Last year, comps in same quarter was 4.7%, this year 4.5%. And we continue to comp year-over-year. And our 4-year comp is 22% plus. And now, we're comping on a much larger comp base than before, so I see 4.5%. We got leverage on our occupancy. We've got leverage on expenses. Our gross profit percent was 35.2%, flat to last year, which means we overcame some of the hurdles of the more consumer products that we're selling, and so gross profit was terrific. It was -- our business is well managed. SG&A as a percentage sales decreased 80 basis points, so just a lot of good news in this quarter. Inventory is up. Productivity is up, our returns are up year-over-year for 7 years, consistent, strong and growing. That's what we always talk about here. So, yes, you've got to look at the comps, but 4.5% is a good comp. It's consistent comp. And on this 4.5% comp, we've got a lot of leverage and we got -- we dropped just a whole lot to the bottom line with the -- and the EPS increased over 30%, 30.8%. So that's how I look at second quarter. And we still view Dollar Tree as having a lot of room to grow. We have a growth strategy that includes more Dollar Tree stores. We have deals, which is gaining traction, another way to grow, a different model. We've got Dollar Tree Canada, new geography, huge opportunities for growth in Canada. It's got to take some time, as we have in all acquisitions, to get them up to the productivity standards that we want. But we're doing that, we're making investments. I'm just really jazzed about where we're going with our Canadian stores and the opportunity for the future. So that, along with our direct business, we've got just a ton of opportunities to look forward."

This morning, we announced our sales and earnings for the second quarter of 2012. Comparable store sales increased 4.5%. This increase was on top of a 4.7% comp in the second quarter last year, and it was driven principally by increases in traffic. Total sales for the quarter grew 10.5% to $1.705 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance. Earnings for the second quarter were $0.51 per diluted share. This represents a 30.8% increase over last year's $0.39 per share. Operating margin for the quarter was 10.8%, an increase of 80 basis points over the second quarter last year and another record quarter. Just to note, this is our second -- this is our highest second quarter operating margin ever as a public company.
Operating income was $184.4 million, an increase of $30.9 million or 20.1% over last year. And net income rose 25.6% to $119.2 million. For the first half of 2012 compared with last year, sales were $3.43 billion, an increase of 11% and comp store sales increased 5.1%. First half 2012 earnings per share were $1.01, an increase of 27.8% compared with $0.79 per share in the first half last year. Operating income increased by $57.2 million. Operating margin was 10.9%, an increase of 70 basis points compared with the first half 2011, and net income rose 20.1% to $235.3 million.
I'm pleased with our performance in the second quarter, both top line sales and earnings exceeded the end upper end of guidance. Most importantly, we provided value to our customers and brought a record level of second quarter earnings to the bottom line. I'm particularly pleased by the productivity of our new stores. Our location planning is improving, the value of our merchandise has never been better and customers are responding enthusiastically. 
In our current economy with customers struggling to balance their family budgets in the face of persistently high unemployment and now unpredictable fuel prices, many people are finding Dollar Tree to be a destination for high-value consumer products. We plan to meet our customers' demand by providing these frequently purchased products consistently and at the highest value possible. It's another reason to shop at Dollar Tree. 
And when customers are in the store shopping for the basics, we plan to give them every reason to stock up on our terrific assortment of high-value and high-margin variety merchandise. Even in a difficult economy, at Dollar Tree you can still splurge. Everything is still $1. 
Sales increases in the second quarter came from growth in both basic and variety categories, with basic consumable categories growing at a slightly faster pace. Our top-performing categories included housewares and home products, food and beverages, health care supplies and toys. I'm extremely pleased with the continued increase in inventory productivity. Inventory turns increased once again in the second quarter as they have consistently for the past 7 years. 
Our growth strategy remains consistent: It is to open more stores, to open more productive stores and to develop and expand new formats, new markets and new channels. In regard to more stores, during the second quarter this year we opened 77 new stores and relocated and expanded another 21 stores. Through the first half, we have added 187 new stores and expanded or relocated 65 stores. Selling square footage increased 7.1% relative to the same time last year.
We ended the quarter with 4,523 stores, and we're on track with our plan for the full year 2012, which includes 315 new stores and 75 relocations and expansions for a total of 390 projects across the U.S. and Canada.
In order to achieve consistent and profitable growth, our practice has been to add infrastructure and distribution capacity to support our growth ahead of the need. In that regard, in July we broke ground on DC 10, a new distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut. The new distribution center will be 1 million square feet. It will be automated and highly efficient, providing capacity and cost-effective service to our stores as we continue to expand in the Northeast. Along with opening new stores, we are focused on operating more productive stores. Efforts have been concentrated on improved site selection, on rightsizing our stores, expanding our assortments, improve staffing, building the bench of qualified store management and on opening new stores earlier in the year. Average new store productivity has increased in each of the past 6 years, and the trend has continued through the second quarter of 2012. Our expansion of frozen and refrigerated product continues. We installed freezers and coolers in 60 additional stores in the second quarter and now offer frozen and refrigerated product in 2,403 stores. We intend to roll this product out to 138 additional stores by year-end for a total of approximately 325 installations for the full year.
This important category serves the current needs of our customers and it drives traffic into our stores more frequently, which promotes incremental sales across all categories. Our overall comp sales increase has been the result of growth in both needs-base consumer products and in higher margin discretionary variety merchandise. 
The elements of our strategy to increase store productivity can be seen throughout our stores. Seasonal presentations are more powerful, we're emphasizing more effective customer engagement and we're working to drive more related sales through cross merchandising. In addition, we're expanding our assortments in many categories including candy, stationery, health and beauty care and home and household products, which was our fastest growing category the second quarter. Another key component of our growth strategy is the development of new retail formats and the expansion of our geographic reach. Our Deal$ format extends our ability to serve more customers with more categories and increases our unit growth potential. Deal$ delivers low prices everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home product. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point at Deal$, we're able to serve more customers with more products at value prices every day.
Customers are responding favorably to the strategy, customer awareness that the Deal$ brand is growing, and the concept is building momentum. In the second quarter, Deal$ had strong sales across a wide variety of merchandise categories. To give you an idea, in May we broke our Summer Fun promotion, featuring the most relevant products for the summer season. This included snacks, beverage, picnic supplies, as well as lawn and garden and patio products. Deal$ outdoor products were very popular, led by lawn and garden, patio solar lights, decorations and lawn ornaments. As temperatures soared sometimes into the triple digits, Deal$ selection of summer hats, shoes, beach bags, beach towels and summer toys sold particularly well. And our selection of electric fans were a great value and a big hit. 
Overall in the second quarter as in the past several quarters, traffic, average ticket and average unit retail all continued to increase at our Deal$ stores. Comp store sales in our Deal$ stores have led the company in recent quarters. We're excited about the growth potential of Deal$ and particularly the opportunity that it provides to grow profitably in the higher cost of operation urban markets. We ended the quarter with a total of 190 Deal$ stores.
Our Canadian integration and expansion continues. As a reminder, we initially entered the Canadian market through the acquisition of Dollar Giant stores in November of 2010. Our primary focus in the first year in 2011 was to install and train Dollar Tree retail systems to integrate processes, to align merchandise assortments and store teams and to lay the foundation for future profitable growth in the Canadian market. This year we're working to make use of the new systems, build history and to leverage the investment. Our focus is on developing efficiency in store operations, improving the flow of product to the stores and the continued building and training of our store teams. We're working very hard to increase the service level and in-stock positions of basic products while improving the shopping experience through a more powerful seasonal presence and a higher level of merchandise energy. Our goal over time is to be the largest retailer in Canada at the single price point of $1.25, just as we've done in the U.S. at the $1 price.
We began the year with a plan to grow our Canadian store base approximately 25% under the Dollar Tree brand, and we will likely exceed this plan by 10 or 12 stores. We opened 10 stores in the second quarter, 18 stores year-to-date, and we ended the quarter with 117 Canadian stores. We have a lot of room to grow at Dollar Tree. As we grow and improve, we believe the Canadian market can support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores. This is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States, plus additional growth in our Deal$ format.
Dollar Tree Direct, our online business, continues to expand and development -- and develop. DTD is providing an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand the brand and attract more customers into our stores. Dollar Tree Direct now offers more than 2,500 items online. Traffic exceeded 4 million visitors in the second quarter, a 14% increase over the second quarter of last year. Of special note, we now have more than a 0.5 million friends on Facebook, and more than 1 million customers logged on via their smartphones. We're gaining customers every quarter, and I'm pleased with the progress. 
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin, who will give you more detail on our financial metrics and provide guidance."

As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 30.8% in the second quarter to $0.51. The increase resulted from our strong sales and expense controls, which drove an 80 basis point improvement in operating profit margin compared to the second quarter last year. Our gross profit margin was 35.2% during the second quarter, consistent with the 35.2% reported in the second quarter last year. Several factors contributed to this performance. We leveraged occupancy and distribution expenses, reflecting the 4.5% comp store sales growth. Second, IMU on many categories increased in the second quarter, reflecting continued improvements in sourcing and the flexibility of our merchandise model. Third, we achieved small reductions in shrink and markdowns compared with the second quarter 2011. These factors were offset principally by 2 items: Our product mix continued to shift in the second quarter, but to a lesser degree than we have seen in several years; basic consumable products increased by 45 basis points as a percentage of sales in the second quarter. 
Also as we have previously disclosed, in the second quarter last year, we recorded a favorable inventory adjustment related to immaterial corrections to prior period, which benefited gross profit last year. SG&A expenses were 24.4% of sales for the quarter, an 80 basis point improvement from the second quarter last year. Payroll-related expenses declined by 60 basis points, driven by leverage on payroll and lower expenses for stock compensation, incentive compensation and worker's compensation. Health insurance benefit expenses increased relative to the second quarter last year.
Operating expenses declined by about 20 basis points due to lower costs for utilities, repairs and maintenance, as well as leverage on sales. Operating income increased $31 million compared to the second quarter last year. Our Operating margin for the quarter was 10.8%, an 80 basis point improvement compared to the second quarter last year. The tax rate for the quarter was 35% compared to 37.7% in the second quarter last year. The lower rate is primarily a result of statute expirations in the settlement of a state tax audit. The lower tax rate represented about a $0.025 per share benefit to second quarter earnings per share. 
Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow, our cash and investments at quarter end totaled $379.8 million versus $545.4 million at the end of the second quarter 2011. Cash net of debt was $115.5 million at the end of the second quarter. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of Dollar Tree stock for $80.9 million. At quarter end, we had $1.1 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. The diluted weighted average share that's outstanding for the second quarter was 232.6 million.
We continue to view share repurchase as a good use of capital. Over the past 4 quarters, we have invested $634.6 million for share repurchase. We will update you on additional share repurchases, if any, at the end of the quarter in which they may occur. 
Also during the second quarter, we entered into a new $750 million unsecured credit agreement. The previous $550 million credit agreement was terminated concurrent with entering into the new agreement. The company has drawn $250 million under the new revolving credit line. This amount is reflected as long-term debt on the balance sheet. Our consolidated inventory at quarter end was 9.6% greater than it was at the same time last year. Selling square footage increased 7.1%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot increased by 2.3%. The increase reflects an increase in goods on the water and in the distribution centers at the end of the second quarter as we continue to execute our smoothing of inventory flow throughout our logistics network. 
Inventory turns increased in the second quarter, and we expect this trend to continue for the full year 2012 as it has for the past 7 years.
Capital expenditures were $74.7 million in the second quarter of 2012 versus $63 million in the second quarter last year. For the full year, we are planning consolidated capital expenditures to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 325 stores, IT system enhancements and approximately $70 million towards a new distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut. The total capital investment anticipated for this facility is approximately $100 million. 
Depreciation and amortization was $43 million compared to $39.6 million in the second quarter last year. We expect depreciation expense of $170 million to $180 million for the year. 
Our guidance for the second half of 2012 includes several assumptions. First, Halloween shifts 2 days deeper into the fourth quarter this year, from the first Monday of the quarter last year to the first Wednesday this year. We believe that this will shift approximately $5 million of sales for the third quarter into the fourth quarter compared to last year. Second, due to the retail calendar, 2012 will include 53 weeks and the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. This is expected to add the $120 million to $130 million of incremental sales and $0.07 to $0.08 of earnings per diluted share to the fourth quarter and the full year.
Our guidance assumes a tax rate of 38.2% for the third quarter and 37.6% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 231.7 million shares for the third quarter and 232.2 million shares for the full year. As always, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase. 
With this in mind, for the third quarter of 2012, we are forecasting sales in the range of $1.71 billion to $1.75 billion, based on a low to mid-single digit comparable store sales increase and 7.2% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share expected to be in the range of $0.47 to $0.51, an increase of 9.3% to 18.6%.
For the full fiscal year of 2012, we are raising our guidance. We are now forecasting sales in the range of $7.36 billion to $7.45 billion, based on a low to mid-single digit increase in comparable store sales and 7.2% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.54, representing an increase of between 21.9% and 26.4%, over our record earnings per share of $2.01 in fiscal 2011, and that does take into account the 53rd week that will be included in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

As I said in May at our last call, we entered this year with goals to drive more customer traffic, to thrill our customers with surprising values on merchandise they need and want, to improve our shopping experience and to build market share. We continue to make progress toward accomplishing all of these goals. First half sales grew 11% to a record $3.43 billion. Comp store sales increased 5.1% on top of a 5.9% comp last year, driven by increased customer traffic. Our inventory is balanced and more productive than ever. Our turns increased again in the first half, and we enter third quarter well prepared for new store growth and customer demand. 
Our operating margin increased by 70 basis points to 10.9%, the all-time highest first half operating margin in our history. Net income grew 20.1% to $235.3 million, and earnings per share increased by 27.8% to $1.01 per share. In addition, we opened 187 new stores across the U.S. and Canada and so far, the productivity of the new store class has been performing ahead of last year. 
Looking forward, I believe that we're positioned to do even better in the future. The focus is on our customer and our stores and our products. They're strategically located to serve Middle America. They're bright, convenient and fun to shop. Our business model is powerful and flexible. We can adapt through a changing environment. This has been tested by time and validated over the company's 26-year history. Our balance mix of high-value consumer basics and our unique assortment of fun and compelling discretionary product positions us to be relevant to customers in all economic circumstances. 
Dollar Tree has a solid and scalable infrastructure that we're expanding and leveraging for better inventory management, increasingly efficient supply chain logistics, more productive stores and crisper execution overall. The Deal$ brand is gaining traction, both traffic and average ticket are growing. Dollar Tree Direct continues to broaden its reach, and we're working diligently to build and expand our Canadian business. We have plenty of opportunities to grow our business, a vision of where we want to go and the infrastructure and capital to make it happen. We continue to generate substantial free cash, and we use our capital for the long-term benefit of shareholders. 
It's really exciting to be at Dollar Tree. We had a great first half. Our merchandise values are better than ever, and our future has never been brighter.

And I would tell you that where we saw the biggest benefits, as we called out, was in -- through the payroll line items. And as you well know, our biggest SG&A line item is our store payroll and our field payroll for those teams. And they did a very, very good job in the quarter of being efficient and we leveraged those costs very, very well. And so as you think about it, I've spoken a lot over the last couple of years about the idea of flowing inventory in a much more efficient manner through our system, and I would say this is one of the aspects of it in affecting labor. So this year, we'll basically have about 300 million cases of product flow through our distribution centers, which ultimately get to our stores. The average store would get about 70,000 cases. Obviously, we have many stores that do well above average sales are getting a lot more cases. So a lot of work has been done as we've spoken in regards to how we're flowing these goods. So the logistics folks starts with the buy and how it's then flowed through the distribution centers and then to the stores. And we do believe that we're making gains there. At the same time, we do believe there's more to be gained in the long run as we continue to go down that path. As far as Canadian SG&A, honestly, we did a lot of work last year with infrastructure and so we haven't seen the same leverage there, and we don't necessarily expect to see the same leverage in the near term as we continue to build out our teams. The other thing that we have going on up there is relaying these stores that are in the Ontario province, relaying them and rebranding them as Dollar Tree stores. So there's extra labor that goes into that. So we've not -- at this point, we've not seen that. Obviously longer term, we do believe that there are -- there will be benefits from the infrastructure, the changes that we're making as well as productivity in the stores."

We get a lot of questions about the penetration of consumer products to our overall mix. And of course, consumer products are really important to our traffic because customers buy them more frequently, everybody needs them, they shop more frequently for them. So it helps increase our traffic. But there's always a balance. But they're a lower -- little lower margin, higher turns, a little bit lower margin. So there's always a balance between that and our -- what we call our variety merchandise, which is the fun and the seasonal and all the things at surprising values that you find at Dollar Tree -- discretionary products, higher-margin-type products. So we're always talking about the balance. And if you look at the past several quarters, there's been an increase in the consumer products as a percent of our total driven by the down economy, the dire straits that a lot of people are in with high unemployment, with uncertainty of fuel prices, with any uncertainties that there is out there. So that was really all I was speaking to about it. We're not really changing our distribution strategy. I'm just speaking to the fact that we still can set -- we still see continued penetration from the consumer products driven by the customers' need. And our intent is to continue to serve our customers. Sometimes I ask -- I'm asked questions about, ""Well, how far do you think that is?"" Well, we're really following our customers' lead, and we're going to continue to do that. If you look at second quarter, it was really a very good balance. I think the penetration of consumer products increased about 45 basis points, which gave us a little bit of about a 22 basis point headwind on gross profit during the quarter, and we still ended up with gross profit flat to last year. So we're really pleased with the performance in that regard. That's what I was speaking to, though, was the mix."

So we always manage within a very tight range. And a lot of that, all of that, much of that is due to our flexible strategy. We've always said that we're in charge, we're in control of our gross margins, and I will tell you that we still are. As prices go up, we change the product, not the retail price, and we drive to get the best cost, the best value for the customer at $1, and at a price that fits our gross margin. And as prices can -- maybe price is a little bit down, we tend to invest more in the product. We get better products for the same $1 price because we're still striving to get -- give the customer the most value for $1 and at a cost that fits our budget. So that's our strategy. It has been. It's worked for us that's why we are still in that tight range there over the past 10 years, and I expect we'll continue to be there.

But look, we’re always watching them. We watch all the competition. We stay more focused on what we're doing than what they're doing, though. If you look at the stores where they've opened up in California, excuse me, there's no visible negative impact from their opening that we can see. We had them around for a long time though, you’ve got to understand. They're a lot older than we are and their model is just different. It's different when everything is not $1, it's just a different model. It's a different customer. It's different store layout, different pricing. So we really stay focused on our position on the marketplace. About half of our stores are within 3 miles of a Dollar General anyway. About 1/4 of our stores are within 1 mile of a Dollar General. They're a much larger company than we are, so we see them all over the country. California is no different. Actually in California, we have a lot more stores. And basically, California is one of our more populous states in regard to stores. But we've seen no impact from them. We have great respect for them, we're just a different model. When everything is at $1, it's just different than they are. So we don't see the impact there. As far as looking at, again, at the landscape of competition, we're really just staying focused on what we do best, and that's providing the most value for the dollar, giving the customer what they want, things they need, things you want, reacting to the current opportunities. We don't -- we're not stuck on any one item, on any one assortment. We don't set planograms, and that gives us the ability to react quickly when there's an opportunity to take advantage of a category or an item. And we try to do that as cost effectively as we possibly can, so that's how we sort of defend our turf."

Our merchants recently returned from Asia, where they were placing orders for our needs for the summer of next year, the summer of 2013. And as I said earlier, and as you've heard me say frequently, we have a flexible model. We're not -- we don't set planograms. We're not stuck on any one item. Our merchants go to market, whether it's in the U.S. or in China or wherever else in the world with really 2 goals: one, to give the most value to our customers for $1; and number two, at the margin that we need for our financials. They can always change an item. They can drop an item. They can add an item. But at the end of the day, we're always in control of our margin for that reason, and this trip was no different in that regard. I would tell you, just to characterize the pricing, it's -- overall the input, the down look from the merchants upon return was that it was a real -- a terrific trip, one of the best environments that they've seen in quite some time. The nonfood commodity prices were down and in some cases significantly down over a year ago. Cotton prices, for instance, were much more favorable. The currency seems to be stable. A year ago, there was a lot of anxiety and talk in the market on the part of Chinese vendors over -- more appreciation versus the U.S. dollar. Not so much talk this year, so that's all settled down. A lot of this is driven, of course, by the slower Chinese domestic growth in conjunction with the slower worldwide demand basically in Europe. You hear a lot of talk in China about the slowdown in Europe. That's put downward pressure on prices. And when you’re Dollar Tree and you're open to buy and you're growing and you have cash, then that's a real advantage is when you go -- as we go to China. Our assortments from the trip are compelling, fresh, a lot of new product purchased on this trip, value is the best ever, and I just can't wait to see it on the shelf. So not much talk about inflation, I guess, on this trip."

As example, our new store productivity, I keep telling them is up right now, the highest in over 10 years. The comp increase of 4.5% is consistent and in line with our guidance. It's actually well above the midpoint and toward the top end of our guidance. Last year comps in same quarter was 4.7%, this year 4.5%. And we continue to comp year-over-year. And our 4-year comp is 22% plus. And now we're comping on a much larger comp base than before, so I see 4.5%. We got leverage on our occupancy. We've got leverage on expenses. Our gross profit percent was 35.2%, flat to last year, which means we overcame some of the hurdles of the more consumer products that we're selling, and so gross profit was terrific. It was -- our business is well managed. SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 80 basis points, so just a lot of good news in this quarter. Inventory is up. Productivity is up, our returns are up year-over-year for 7 years, consistent, strong and growing. That's what we always talk about here. So yes, you've got to look at the comps, but 4.5% is a good comp. It's a consistent comp.

Total sales increased 7.8% to $1.72 billion, driven principally by increases in traffic. Our comparable store sales increased 1.6% compared with a 4.8% increase last year and an 8.7% comp the previous year. Earnings for the third quarter were $0.68 per diluted share. This includes $0.17 from the sale of our interest in Ollie's. Excluding the sale of Ollie's, our earnings for the third quarter were $0.51 per share. This represents an 18.6% increase over last year's $0.43 per share and was at the high-end of our $0.47 to $0.51 range of guidance. 
Operating margin for the third quarter 2012 was 10.7%, an increase of 40 basis points over the third quarter last year. Net income rose 48.6% to $155.4 million versus $104.5 million last year, excluding the income derived from the sale of Ollie's, net income rose 12.2% to $117.3 million.
Year-to-date through 3 quarters of 2012, total sales were $5.15 billion, an increase of 9.9% and comp store sales increased 3.9%. Year-to-date, operating income has increased by $76.5 million, operating margin was 10.8%, an increase of 60 basis points compared with the same period of last year. Net income rose 30.0% to $390.7 million and earnings per share were $1.69, an increase of 37.4% compared with $1.23 per share reported last year. Excluding the income derived from the sale of Ollie's, net income rose 17.4% to $352.6 million, and earnings per share were $1.53, an increase of 24.4% compared with $1.23 per share reported last year.
Sales increases in the third quarter came from growth in both basic and variety categories with basic, consumable categories growing at a slightly faster pace. Our top-performing categories included housewares and home products, Health Care Products and food and beverages. Customers responded enthusiastically to our Halloween seasonal product and our sales in third quarter met expectations. Sales were particularly strong in Halloween home decor. Seasonal changes were executed in a timely manner and we're now ready for fall, Thanksgiving and the holiday seasons.
In terms of the sales cadence of third quarter, comps were positive every month, and we saw sequential improvement from August through October. In terms of geography, performance in the third quarter was relatively consistent across the country, with the highest comps coming from the mid-Atlantic, Midwest and New England, followed closely by the Southwest and the Southeast. 
Dollar Tree remains a destination for high-value consumer products and customer traffic was up throughout the quarter. When customers are in our store, shopping for the basics, we give them every reasons to stock up on our terrific assortment of high-value and high-margin variety merchandise. Even in a difficult economy, at Dollar Tree, you can still splurge. Everything is only $1. Looking to the future, we are excited about our growth potential and continued relevance to the customer. Over the next several years, it's likely that consumers demand for value will continue to grow and intensify. Dollar Tree' is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the stranded. Our goal is to provide more value through a broader range of customers.
And we're doing this in many ways, by opening more stores, by opening better, more productive stores and by developing new formats, new markets and new channels. During the third quarter this year, we opened 111 new stores and relocated and expanded another 16 stores. Through 3 quarters of 2012, we have added 298 new stores and expanded or relocated 81 stores. Selling square footage has increased 7.1%, and we ended the quarter with 4,630 stores. We're on track with our new store opening plan for the full year 2012, which includes 315 new stores. And we have surpassed our plan for 75 relocations and expansions in 2012. We now expect to complete more than 395 total projects across the U.S. and Canada in fiscal 2012.
I'm particularly pleased by the productivity of our new stores, sustained improvement requires a coordinated effort across the organization. It requires a strategy and requires teamwork between real estate, merchants, planning, stores and logistics. Our teams are concentrated on improved site selection, on rightsizing our stores, expanding our assortments, improving staffing and building the bench of qualified store management and on opening new stores earlier in the year. We believe these are the key elements to increasing our new store productivity, and we're having success. I'm very pleased to report that average new store productivity has increased in each of the past 6 years and the trend has continued through the third quarter 2012.
Efforts to increase sales per square foot are not limited to new stores and elements of the strategy to increase store productivity can be seen throughout the chain. In all stores, we're developing more powerful seasonal presentations. Stores are emphasizing more effective customer engagement and working to drive sales of related items across merchandising and suggestive selling. We are expanding at the front end of our stores to create more merchandise energy and to drive impulse sales and merchants are expanding our assortments in candy, stationery, health and beauty care and home and household products, which was our fastest growing category in the third quarter.
As part of our strategy to broaden the assortments, our expansion of frozen and refrigerated product continues. We installed freezers and coolers in 67 additional stores in the third quarter and now offer frozen and refrigerated products in 2,467 stores. We remain on schedule to roll this product out to a total approximately 325 installations for the full year. 
Another key component of our growth strategy is to develop new retail formats, the expansion of our geographic reach and the development of additional channels of distribution to serve more customers. Specifically, that means Deal$, Dollar Tree Canada and Dollar Tree Direct. Our Deal$ format, extends our ability to serve more customers with more categories and increases our unit growth potential.
Deal$ delivers low prices and everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home products. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point, at Deal$ we're were able to say more customers with more products and value prices everyday. Customers are responding favorably to the strategy, customer awareness of the Deal$ brand is a growing and the concept is building momentum. Overall, in the third quarter, as in the past several quarters, comp store sales in our Deal$ stores continue to lead the company. We're excited about the growth potential of Deal$ and particularly the opportunity that it provides to grow profitably in the higher cost of operation urban markets. We ended the quarter with a total of 194 Deal$ stores.
Our Canadian integration and expansion continues. We initially entered the Canadian market through the acquisition of Dollar Giant stores in November of 2010. Our goal is to be the leading retailer in Canada at the single price point of $1.25, just as we are in the U.S. at the $1 price point. Last year, our first full year, we installed retail systems, we integrated cumulative processes, merchandise assortments and store teams and laid the foundation for future profitable growth in the Canadian market. Just 1-year ago, in the third quarter of 2011, we completed the installation and training of store level POS and enterprise-level merchandise systems. Today, for the first time, we have consistent year-on-year data on which to base our sales and assortment planning. We have visibility to our own hand, own order and sales by store and buy SKU. These are all key factors in the management for an efficient supply chain and improving customer satisfaction. 
The merchandising teams are integrated to leverage Dollar Tree buying power. This has been a big transition but customers are beginning to buy broader, more exciting assortments and better values for the stores. We expect the pace to gain momentum as we move through the holiday season and beyond. 
Our focus is on more efficient store operations, continued building of store teams and improve product flow to the stores. We're working very hard to increase service level and in-stock positions of basic products, while improving the shopping experience through a more powerful seasonal presence and a higher level of merchandise energy. Meanwhile, we're expanding our Canadian store base. We opened 12 new stores in the third quarter, 30 stores year-to-date, and we ended the quarter with 129 Canadian stores. We have begun the year with a plan to grow our Canadian store base approximately 25% under the Dollar Tree brand. We will likely exceed this plan and end the year with 135 stores in Canada.
In addition, we've rebranded all of the former Dollar Giant stores in Ontario to Dollar Tree Canada this year and we will do the same for stores in the Western provinces in 2013. As we go and improve, we will believe the Canadian market can support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores. This is an addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States, plus additional growth in our Deal$ format. 
I'm extremely excited about the opportunity for Dollar Tree in Canada and proud of what has been accomplished in a short period of time. Our current commitment to build infrastructure, develop store teams and improve the consistency of our offering across the chain will be worth the effort.
Dollar Tree Direct, our E-Commerce business, continues to grow. This additional channel of distribution provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand the brand and attract more customers into the stores. Traffic exceeded 4.5 million unique visitors in the third quarter. That's a 19% increase over the third quarter last year. Additionally, over 28 million e-mails were sent to individual consumers, businesses and organizations. We are expanding the available market to more consumers in several ways. First, Dollar Tree Direct now has over 2,600 items available online, including 825 items for sale via our website that can be purchased in less than case quantities, an increase of over 65% versus the same time last year. 
Additionally, we continue to work on an enhance the customers' experience on their mobile devices, improving the ease of navigation and speed on our mobile E-Commerce site. Over 1.5 million people chose to interact Dollar Tree via the mobile devices during the third quarter. Through these initiatives, Dollar Tree Direct is gaining customers every quarter, and I'm pleased with their progress.
Investments in new stores, more productive stores, additional formats and expanded geography all increased our ability to grow our business, expand our concept and serve more customers in more ways. In order to achieve consistent and profitable growth, our practice is to add infrastructure and distribution capacity to support our growth ahead of the need. In that regard, construction is proceeding according to schedule on our new distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut. DC-10 [ph] will be 1 million square feet. It will automated and highly efficient, providing capacity and cost-effective service to our stores as we continue to expand in the Northeast. We're on schedule for a third quarter 2013 completion.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin who will give you more detail on our financial metrics and provide guidance."

As Bob mentioned, excluding the nonoperating income from the Ollie's transaction, our diluted earnings per share increased 18.6%  in the third quarter to $0.51. The increase resulted from our sales growth and expense control, which resulted in a 40 basis point improvement in operating profit margin compared to the third quarter last year. Our gross profit margin was 34.9% during the third quarter compared with the 35.1% reported in the third quarter last year. Several factors contributed to this performance. 
Freight costs increased, driven by higher trucking rates and diesel fuel prices that averaged $0.23 per gallon above the same period last year. Our product mix continued to shift in the third quarter as basic consumable products increased by 32 basis points as a percentage of sales. In addition, markdown expense increased slightly as a percentage of sales relative to the third quarter last year. These factors were partially offset by higher initial mark-up across many categories. Occupancy and distribution expenses were flat as a percentage of sales, reflecting the 1.6% comp store sales growth and the addition of 295 new stores compared with the same period last year. SG&A expenses were 24.2% of sales for the quarter, which is a 60 basis point improvement from the third quarter last year. Operating expenses declined by about 45 basis points. This was driven by a realized gain of $3.8 million relating to the favorable resolution for legal matter and reductions in legal fees, advertising expense, repairs and maintenance, utilities and debit and credit card fees as a percentage of sales. 
Payroll-related expenses declined by approximately 15 basis points due to lower incentive compensation expense compared with last year. We expect the credit card penetration will go into the fourth quarter. We have just completed the rollout of Mastercard acceptance to an additional 3,500 stores pick we now accept Visa and MasterCard in all of our stores, chainwide, and we also accept American Express and Discover in all our stores in the United States. 
Operating income increased $19.3 million compared with the third quarter last year. Our operating margin for the quarter was 10.7%, a 40 basis point improvement compared to the third quarter last year. Year-to-date, to the third quarter, operating margin is 10.8%, an increase of 50 basis points from the same period last year.
The tax rate for the quarter was basically unchanged to 36.3% compared with the third quarter last year at 36.4%. The tax rate was lower than the tax rate anticipated in our guidance for the quarter due to favorable provisions to return reconciliation adjustments and the lower tax rate on the Ollie's gains. 
Cash and investment at the quarter ended -- at quarter end totaled $222.4 million versus $280.2 million at the end of third quarter 2011. During the third quarter, we invested $149.8 million for share repurchases repurchased 3.3 million shares. During the first 3 quarters, we invested $235.3 million for share repurchases and repurchased 5 million shares on the open market. At quarter end, we had $965 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. The diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter was $230.0 million. Over the past 4 quarters, we have invested $535.3 million for share repurchase. We will update you on additional share repurchases, if any, at the end of the quarter in which they may occur. 
Our consolidated inventory at quarter end was 12.7% greater than it was at the same time last year. Selling square footage increased 7.1%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot increased by 5.2%. The increase reflects a higher amount of inventory in our distribution centers at the end of the third quarter and an increase in goods on the water. This is to support plan holiday and post-Christmas sales to new store openings. And it is consistent with our strategy to move the flow of inventory through our logistics network. Inventory turns increased in 2012 through 3 quarters and we expect this trend to continue for the full year as it has for the past 7 years.
Capital expenditures were $96.6 million in the third quarter of 2012 versus $75.5 million in the third quarter last year. For the full year, we are planning consolidated capital expenditures to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million. Capital expenditures are focused on new stores and remodels, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately to 325 stores, IT system enhancements and approximately $70 million towards our new distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut. The total capital investment anticipated for this facility is approximately $100 million. Depreciation and amortization was $43.6 million for the third quarter versus $41.1 million in the third quarter last year. For the full year, we expect depreciation expense of $170 million to $173 million.
Our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012 includes several assumptions. First, Halloween shifted 2 days deeper into the fourth quarter this year. From the first Monday of the quarter last year to the first Wednesday this year. We believe that this did, in fact, shift approximately $5 million of sales from the third quarter into the fourth quarter compared to last year. Second, we have been asked about the impact of Hurricane Sandy on our fourth quarter. We are grateful to report that it appears the storm will not have a material impact on our fourth quarter results. Also, as previously disclosed, due to the retail calendar, 2012 will include 53 weeks and the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. This is expected to add $120 million to $130 million of incremental sales and $0.07 to $0.08 earnings per share for the fourth quarter and full year. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 38.1% for the fourth quarter and 37.2% for full year. Weighted average diluted share count are assumed to be 228.6 million shares for the fourth quarter and 231 million shares for the full year. As always, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase.
With this in mind, for the fourth quarter of 2012, we are forecasting sales in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.26 billion based on a flat to a low-single digit comparable store sales increase and 7.2% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.97 to $1.02, an increase of 21.3% to 27.5%. This fourth quarter guidance includes the impact of the extra week working. For the full fiscal year of 2012, we are now forecasting sales in the range of $7.35 billion to $7.41 billion based on a low to mid-single digit in comparable stores that sales and 7.2% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.70, representing an increase of 31.8% to 34.3% over our record earnings per share of $2.01 in fiscal 2011. And this includes the impact of the 53rd week. The full year guidance also includes $0.16 earnings per share from the Ollie's sale in the third quarter. 
Excluding the impact of the Ollie's transaction we would expect full year earnings per share to be in the range of $2.49 to $2.54, representing an increase of 23.9% to 26.4% over last year. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

Our inventories balanced and more productive than ever. Our turns increased again through the first 3 quarters of the and we entered the fourth quarter well prepared for new store growth and customer demand. Through the third quarter this year, we've opened 298 new stores across the U.S. and in Canada and the productivity of the new store class has been performing ahead of last year. In addition, the company invested $235 million for share repurchase, buying back 5 million shares over the first 3 quarters, including 3.3 million shares for $150 million in the third quarter alone. 
I believe that Dollar Tree is singularly positioned to do even better in the future. The customers are focused in our stores are product. They are strategically-located to serve middle America. They're bright, they're convenient and they're fun to shop. Our balance mix of filing Valley consumer basics and our unique assortment of fun, compelling seasonally correct there products positions us to be relevant to customers of all economic circumstances.
Dollar Tree has a solid and scalable infrastructure that we're expanding and leveraging for better inventory management, increasingly efficient supply chain logistics, more productive stores and crisper execution overall.

Our comp sales grew 1.6% and that was as a result of -- driven by traffic. Our sales were within our range of guidance and it was an extremely profitable quarter. Our operating margin was the highest ever in Q3 at 10.7%. So it was really a strong quarter. Net income up 12.2%, EPS up 18.6% and again, earnings at the high-end of our guidance. So as I sit here talking about pressures in our business, I am struck a little bit by the exceptional profitability of our quarter. The pressure on sales were basically, I think, you put them in 3 buckets was number one, consumer anxiety from just the continuation of a difficult macroenvironment, was stubbornly high unemployment and continuing high gas prices and the key pricing and continued concerns about the economy and the fiscal cliff. And all of these was magnified everyday as we went through the election and that created anxiety and uncertainty in the consumer. That was one. Secondly, we had calender shift with Halloween from Monday to Wednesday, we've moved 2 more Halloween selling days into fourth quarter. That was about a $5 million headwind and we saw that. And the third reason is the difficult comparisons. If you look at what we're up against, we're against a 2-year stack comp of 13.5%. As a comparison in Q2 this year, we were against the 2-year stack of 11.4%. And if you look at the 3-year stack and the 4-year stack, you find pretty much the same spread. So it was a pretty difficult comparison this year in third quarter and especially difficult comparison in our consumable business, which grew as a percentage of total by 170 basis points last year and we were up against that this year. This year, consumables grew 32 basis points on top of that. We had a good quarter, as I said. We're pleased with the profitability. We're now focused on fourth quarter.

My point is all the anxiety played out on TV, 24/7 with the election about the fiscal cliff, about the unemployment, about all the economic concerns, I believe, put pressure on sales in the third quarter.

But overall, we feel good about where we've positioned ourselves. And we are a variety store, first and foremost.

Obviously, there was some freight their and we really, as we talked about that comments about trucking rates and the fact that if you look at the industry, in general, since the economic downturn, there has been many trucking businesses go out, less competition, obviously. If you keep up in that industry, there's a nationwide shortage of truck drivers out there. So there's definitely some pressure there. Fuel, 23 basis points -- or $0.23 up, I mean, for the quarter. The metric there, as we've always said is feel, diesel fuel is $1 higher for the full year, will be about $0.05 hit to us. So you can kind of back into what that means to us. So I don't know that -- expect there still some pressure as we go forward into Q4 in that area. I don't -- we've really seen it all year and I think we'll continue to see continue a little bit as we continue to go through the fourth quarter as well."

So there's a big difference in the last year's performance than we were up against in third quarter. And a lot of that was consumer products. Again, grew our consumer goods 170 basis points in third quarter last year. This year, we grew it again but it was 32 basis points on top of the 170. So those were the facts that did start off -- every month was positive. Every month grew. August, September improved over August, October over September. So it grew through the quarter. All in all, it was a 1.6 comp at the end of the day. So the 3 pressures that I listed are the 3 that we can identify and those are the things that we see.

As we expanded the size of our stores, one thing I used like to talk about and still to do is we expanded our open to sell, which serve the customer better, gave us the ability to serve -- offer more products of more categories are more customers and more broader appeal and we have that. I think your point about since 2007 through 2012, some of our highest comps is valid and I think what you're looking at is short-term versus long-term. I still believe what I told you back in 1999 about the largest store, where we can go where the opportunity to serve more customers and better serve our customers and increase our same-store sales on our productivity. I still believe in that. But we are going to go through swings from time-to-time from year-to-year from quarter-to-quarter. And, frankly, short term, you're going to have a quarter that's up against a really big quarter or really big 2 [ph] or in this case 5 quarters and the comparison is going to go difficult and what bad weather by the way get sentimental out of their own way. I don't see that as long-term though, yes we can still comp on higher rate tend to come but I rates account very pleased with the 1.6%  I know that sounds funny, maybe to when I say that because we're always looking for more. But in this quarter at 1.6% comp and the way we converted and leverage that and converting that to open margin. The highest operating margin ever in third quarter from a company that has high operating margins, I think, is pretty I'm proud of what our folks have done with that. Can we do better? Absolutely. We could do a lot of things to continue to engage our customers. We can sell more, we can increase our productivity in all our stores. It's going in the right direction. You hear me praising that. Directionally, we're going in the right way. We are not at the top. We're not where we're going to be. There are still things we can do to drive productivity and our teams are working and focused. So looking a little bit longer than one quarter and I still believe in the concept. I believe that we're more relevant today than we've ever been to our customer. Back in 1999, we really didn't have much that we needed. It was everything that you wanted for the most part, small stores. Now with our mix, when times are tough, we got things to sell in tough times and you can see the growth in our consumer products from that. When times aren't so tough, we have discretionary product. I talk about like in our customers jingle in their pocket it's because I really want to sell the full mix and that's what we strive to do at Dollar Tree. It's not just one or the other, it's selling the mix and it's selling the shopping experience. And I still believe that when everything a $1 in a store that mix is different our customers love it and they react to them that going to for many years."

Look at the long time ago, and I don't mean long-term next century, I'm talking about just look at the long-term future of our company. We're the best positioned. We've got the most growth we've got the most tools to grow. We have Dollar Tree. We have Deal$, we have Dollar Tree Canada, we have Dollar Tree Direct. We have the infrastructure to support that growth. We know how to run it and I'm really pleased about where we are. if I could -- I tell folks if I could take my drives instead of driving -- place my ball out in the fairway where I wanted, this is where I want to place it. we are exactly what we need to be as regard to relevant store customer.

We're always looking though we do usually 5-year leases with 3, 5-year term, something like that, sometimes longer if we know the market that it's a bit better. The idea being that as the market changes, we can move the market. Back in the earlier days as we were transitioning from the small store to the large store, our relocation was strategic for the market but it was also an increase usually of the store size. Today, our relocations are typically to stores, strictly for strategic reasons maybe the anchor and the center move, maybe the population has changed, maybe we've just run out of and the need to move maybe the landlord is not going to scrape the centers something like that. The size of the store we're moving from is about the same as the size of the store that we are building. So there is not much of a difference in that strictly a relocation based on strategy base on where we want to be in the market and how many stores and we talk about planning the market. It's not just one store. It's in the entire market that we're looking at. So your question, I would say that the pipeline, we start looking at opportunities to relocate several years before the lease time expires. And we're always out there looking on the market moving things around to be optimal. I would say that most of the time, we relocate strategically. We're finding the space to move to. We're buying in the right kinds of product and again, we're -- we have the ability to take what's there as is, and turn it into a nice Dollar Tree store. Sometimes, we can work where there is a developer, sometimes, not as much since 2008. But a little more now than it has been to build the right Dollar Tree store for us. So the relocations are generally there. And it the idea of planning out the market and moving them around is typically the reason we do with, not to get to a bigger store as much."

Total sales increased 7.8% to $1.72 billion, driven principally by increases in traffic. Our comparable store sales increased 1.6% compared with a 4.8% increase last year and an 8.7% comp the previous year. Earnings for the third quarter were $0.68 per diluted share. This includes $0.17 from the sale of our interest in Ollie's. Excluding the sale of Ollie's, our earnings for the third quarter were $0.51 per share. This represents an 18.6% increase over last year's $0.43 per share and was at the high end of our $0.47 to $0.51 range of guidance. 
Operating margin for the third quarter 2012 was 10.7%, an increase of 40 basis points over the third quarter last year. Net income rose 48.6% to $155.4 million versus $104.5 million last year. Excluding the income derived from the sale of Ollie's, net income rose 12.2% to $117.3 million.
Year-to-date through 3 quarters of 2012, total sales were $5.15 billion, an increase of 9.9%, and comp store sales increased 3.9%. Year-to-date, operating income has increased by $76.5 million. Operating margin was 10.8%, an increase of 60 basis points compared with the same period of last year. Net income rose 30.0% to $390.7 million, and earnings per share were $1.69, an increase of 37.4% compared with $1.23 per share reported last year. Excluding the income derived from the sale of Ollie's, net income rose 17.4% to $352.6 million, and earnings per share were $1.53, an increase of 24.4% compared with $1.23 per share reported last year.
Sales increases in the third quarter came from growth in both basic and variety categories, with basic consumable categories growing at a slightly faster pace. Our top-performing categories included housewares and home products, health care products and food and beverages. Customers responded enthusiastically to our Halloween seasonal product, and our sales in the third quarter met expectations. Sales were particularly strong in Halloween home décor. Seasonal changes were executed in a timely manner, and we're now ready for fall, Thanksgiving and the holiday seasons.
In terms of the sales cadence in third quarter, comps were positive every month, and we saw sequential improvement from August through October. In terms of geography, performance in the third quarter was relatively consistent across the country, with the highest comps coming from the mid-Atlantic, Midwest and New England, followed closely by the Southwest and the Southeast. 
Dollar Tree remains a destination for high-value consumer products, and customer traffic was up throughout the quarter. When customers are in our stores, shopping for the basics, we give them every reason to stock up on our terrific assortment of high-value and high-margin variety merchandise. Even in a difficult economy, at Dollar Tree, you can still splurge. Everything is only $1. 
Looking to the future, we're excited about our growth potential and continued relevance to the customer. Over the next several years, it's likely that consumers' demand for value will continue to grow and intensify. Dollar Tree is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this trend. Our goal is to provide more value through a broader range of customers. And we're doing this in many ways: by opening more stores; by opening better, more productive stores; and by developing new formats, new markets and new channels. 
During the third quarter this year, we opened 111 new stores and relocated and expanded another 16 stores. Through 3 quarters of 2012, we have added 298 new stores and expanded or relocated 81 stores. Selling square footage has increased 7.1%, and we ended the quarter with 4,630 stores. We're on track with our new store opening plan for the full year 2012, which includes 315 new stores. And we have surpassed our plan for 75 relocations and expansions in 2012. We now expect to complete more than 395 total projects across the U.S. and Canada in fiscal 2012.
I'm particularly pleased by the productivity of our new stores. Sustained improvement requires a coordinated effort across the organization. It requires a strategy and requires teamwork between real estate, merchants planning, stores and logistics. Our teams are concentrated on improved site selection, on rightsizing our stores, expanding our assortments, improving staffing and building the bench of qualified store management and on opening new stores earlier in the year. We believe these are the key elements to increasing our new store productivity, and we're having success. I'm very pleased to report that average new store productivity has increased in each of the past 6 years, and the trend has continued through the third quarter 2012.
Efforts to increase sales per square foot are not limited to new stores, and elements of the strategy to increase store productivity can be seen throughout the chain. In all stores, we're developing more powerful seasonal presentations. Stores are emphasizing more effective customer engagement and working to drive sales of related items through cross merchandising and suggestive selling. We are expanding assortments at the front end of our stores to create more merchandise energy and to drive impulse sales. And merchants are expanding our assortments in candy, stationery, health and beauty care and home and household products, which was our fastest growing category in the third quarter.
As part of our strategy to broaden assortments, our expansion of frozen and refrigerated product continues. We installed freezers and coolers in 67 additional stores in the third quarter and now offer frozen and refrigerated products in 2,467 stores. We remain on schedule to roll this product out to a total of approximately 325 installations for the full year. 
Another key component of our growth strategy is the development of new retail formats, the expansion of our geographic reach and the development of additional channels of distribution to serve more customers. Specifically, that means Deal$, Dollar Tree Canada and Dollar Tree Direct. 
Our Deal$ format extends our ability to serve more customers with more categories and increases our unit growth potential. Deal$ delivers low prices on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home products. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point, at Deal$ we're able to serve more customers with more products and value prices everyday. Customers are responding favorably to the strategy, customer awareness of the Deal$ brand is growing, and the concept is building momentum. Overall, in the third quarter, as in the past several quarters, comp store sales in our Deal$ stores continue to lead the company. We're excited about the growth potential of Deal$ and particularly, the opportunity that it provides to grow profitably in the higher costs of operation urban markets. We ended the quarter with a total of 194 Deal$ stores.
Our Canadian integration and expansion continues. We initially entered the Canadian market through the acquisition of Dollar Giant stores in November of 2010. Our goal is to be the leading retailer in Canada at the single price point of $1.25, just as we are in the U.S. at the $1 price point. Last year, our first full year, we installed retail systems; we integrated processes, merchandise assortments and store teams; and we laid the foundation for future profitable growth in the Canadian market. Just 1 year ago, in the third quarter of 2011, we completed the installation and training of store-level POS and enterprise-level merchandising systems. Today, for the first time, we have consistent year-on-year data on which to base our sales and assortment planning. We have visibility to our own hand, own order and sales, along with the trailing history by store and by SKU. These are all key factors in the management for an efficient supply chain and improving customer satisfaction. 
The merchandising teams are integrated to leverage Dollar Tree buying power. This has been a big transition, but customers are beginning to buy in broader, more exciting assortments and better values in the stores. We expect this to gain momentum as we move through the holiday season and beyond. 
Our focus is on more efficient store operations, continued building of store teams and improved product flow to the stores. We're working very hard to increase the service level and in-stock position of basic products while improving the shopping experience through a more powerful seasonal presence and a higher level of merchandise energy. 
Meanwhile, we're expanding our Canadian store base. We opened 12 new stores in the third quarter, 30 stores year-to-date, and we ended the quarter with 129 Canadian stores. We had begun the year with a plan to grow our Canadian store base approximately 25% under the Dollar Tree brand. We will likely exceed this plan and end the year with 135 stores in Canada.
In addition, we've rebranded all of the former Dollar Giant stores in Ontario to Dollar Tree Canada this year, and we'll do the same for stores in the Western provinces in 2013. As we grow and improve, we believe the Canadian market can support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores. This is an addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States, plus additional growth in our Deal$ format. I'm extremely excited about the opportunity for Dollar Tree in Canada and proud of what has been accomplished in a short period of time. Our current commitment to build infrastructure, develop store teams and improve the consistency of our offering across the chain will be worth the efforts.
Dollar Tree Direct, our e-commerce business, continues to grow. This additional channel of distribution provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand the brand and attract more customers into the stores. Traffic exceeded 4.5 million unique visitors in the third quarter. That's a 19% increase over the third quarter last year. Additionally, over 28 million e-mails were sent to individual consumers, businesses and organizations. 
We are expanding the available market to more consumers in several ways. First, Dollar Tree Direct now has over 2,600 items available online, including 825 items for sale via our website that can be purchased in less than case quantities, an increase of over 65% versus the same time last year. Additionally, we continue to work on an -- to enhance the customers' experience on their mobile devices, improving the ease of navigation and speed on our mobile e-commerce site. Over 1.5 million people chose to interact with Dollar Tree via their mobile devices during the third quarter. Through these initiatives, Dollar Tree Direct is gaining customers every quarter, and I'm pleased with their progress.
Investments in new stores, more productive stores, additional formats and expanded geography, all increased our ability to grow our business, expand our concept and serve more customers in more ways. In order to achieve consistent and profitable growth, our practice has been to add infrastructure and distribution capacity to support our growth ahead of the need. In that regard, construction is proceeding according to schedule on our new distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut. DC10 will be 1 million square feet. It will automated and highly efficient, providing capacity and cost-effective service to our stores as we continue to expand in the Northeast. We're on schedule for a third quarter 2013 completion.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin, who will give you more detail on our financial metrics and provide guidance."
27685,170941703,387960,"Dollar Tree, Inc., Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2012",2012-11-15,"Earnings Calls","Dollar Tree, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob. As Bob mentioned, excluding the nonoperating income from the Ollie's transaction, our diluted earnings per share increased 18.6% in the third quarter to $0.51.

As Bob mentioned, excluding the nonoperating income from the Ollie's transaction, our diluted earnings per share increased 18.6% in the third quarter to $0.51. The increase resulted from our sales growth and expense control, which resulted in a 40-basis-point improvement in operating profit margin compared to the third quarter last year. Our gross profit margin was 34.9% during the third quarter compared with the 35.1% reported in the third quarter last year. 
Several factors contributed to this performance. Freight costs increased, driven by higher trucking rates and diesel fuel prices that averaged $0.23 per gallon above the same period last year. Our product mix continued to shift in the third quarter, as basic consumable products increased by 32 basis points as a percentage of sales. In addition, markdown expense increased slightly as a percentage of sales relative to the third quarter last year. These factors were partially offset by higher initial mark-up across many categories. 
Occupancy and distribution expenses were flat as a percentage of sales, reflecting the 1.6% comp store sales growth and the addition of 295 new stores compared with the same period last year. SG&A expenses were 24.2% of sales for the quarter, which is a 60-basis-point improvement from the third quarter last year. Operating expenses declined by about 45 basis points. This was driven by a realized gain of $3.8 million relating to the favorable resolution to a legal matter and reductions in legal fees, advertising expense, repairs and maintenance utilities and debit and credit card fees as a percentage of sales. Payroll-related expenses declined by approximately 15 basis points due to lower incentive compensation expense compared with last year. 
We expect the credit card penetration will grow in the fourth quarter. We have just completed the rollout of MasterCard acceptance to an additional 3,500 stores. We now accept Visa and MasterCard in all of our stores, chain-wide, and we also accept American Express and Discover in all of our stores in the United States. 
Operating income increased $19.3 million compared with the third quarter last year. Our operating margin for the quarter was 10.7%, a 40-basis-point improvement compared to the third quarter last year. Year-to-date through the third quarter, operating margin is 10.8%, an increase of 50 basis points from the same period last year.
The tax rate for the quarter was basically unchanged at 36.3% compared with the third quarter last year at 36.4%. The tax rate was lower than the tax rate anticipated in our guidance for the quarter due to favorable provision to return reconciliation adjustments and the lower tax rate on the Ollie's gain.
Cash and investments at the quarter ended -- at quarter-end totaled $222.4 million versus $280.2 million at the end of third quarter 2011. During the third quarter, we invested $149.8 million for share repurchase and repurchased 3.3 million shares. During the first 3 quarters, we invested $235.3 million for share repurchase and repurchased 5 million shares on the open market. At quarter-end, we had $965 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. The diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter was $230.0 million. Over the past 4 quarters, we have invested $535.3 million for share repurchase. We will update you on additional share repurchases, if any, at the end of the quarter in which they may occur. 
Our consolidated inventory at quarter-end was 12.7% greater than it was at the same time last year. Selling square footage increased 7.1%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot increased by 5.2%. The increase reflects a higher amount of inventory in our distribution centers at the end of the third quarter and an increase in goods on the water. This is to support planned holiday and post-Christmas sales and new store openings. And it is consistent with our strategy to just move the flow of inventory through our logistics network. Inventory turns increased in 2012 through 3 quarters, and we expect this trend to continue for the full year as it has for the past 7 years.
Capital expenditures were $96.6 million in the third quarter of 2012 versus $75.5 million in the third quarter last year. For the full year, we are planning consolidated capital expenditures to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million. Capital expenditures are focused on new stores and remodels, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 325 stores, IT system enhancements and approximately $70 million towards our new distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut. The total capital investment anticipated for this facility is approximately $100 million. 
Depreciation and amortization was $43.6 million for the third quarter versus $41.1 million in the third quarter last year. For the full year, we expect depreciation expense of $170 million to $173 million.
Our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012 includes several assumptions. First, Halloween shifted 2 days deeper into the fourth quarter this year, from the first Monday of the quarter last year to the first Wednesday this year. We believe that this did, in fact, shift approximately $5 million of sales from the third quarter into the fourth quarter compared to last year. Second, we have been asked about the impact of Hurricane Sandy on our fourth quarter. We are grateful to report that it appears the storm will not have a material impact on our fourth quarter results. Also, as previously disclosed, due to the retail calendar, 2012 will include 53 weeks, and the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. This is expected to add $120 million to $130 million of incremental sales and $0.07 to $0.08 earnings per share for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 38.1% for the fourth quarter and 37.2% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 228.6 million shares for the fourth quarter and 231 million shares for the full year. As always, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase.
With this in mind, for the fourth quarter of 2012, we are forecasting sales in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.26 billion based on a flat to a low single-digit comparable store sales increase and 7.2% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.97 to $1.02, an increase of 21.3% to 27.5%. This fourth quarter guidance includes the impact of the extra week. For the full fiscal year of 2012, we are now forecasting sales in the range of $7.35 billion to $7.41 billion based on a low to mid-single-digit increase in comparable store sales and 7.2% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.70, representing an increase of 31.8% to 34.3% over our record earnings per share of $2.01 in fiscal 2011. And this includes the impact of the 53rd week. The full year guidance also includes $0.16 earnings per share from the Ollie's sale in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of the Ollie's transaction, we would expect full year earnings per share to be in the range of $2.49 to $2.54, representing an increase of 23.9% to 26.4% over last year. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

In the face of a very challenging and uncertain environment, Dollar Tree's traffic grew, our reach is expanding, and we continue to deliver record profitability. Operating margin increased by 40 basis points to 10.7%. And I'd like to point out that's the highest third quarter operating margin in the history of our company. Earnings per share increased by 18.6% on top of a 19.2% increase last year. Our inventory is balanced and more productive than ever. Our turns increased again through the first 3 quarters of the year, and we entered the fourth quarter well prepared for new store growth and customer demand. Through the third quarter this year, we've opened 298 new stores across the U.S. and Canada, and the productivity of the new store class has been performing ahead of last year. In addition, the company invested $235 million for share repurchase, buying back 5 million shares over the first 3 quarters, including 3.3 million shares for $150 million in the third quarter alone. 
I believe that Dollar Tree is singularly positioned to do even better in the future. The customers are focused in our stores and our products. They are strategically located to serve middle America. They're bright, they're convenient, and they're fun to shop at. Our balanced mix of high-value consumer basics and our unique assortment of fun, compelling seasonally correct discretionary products positions us to be relevant to customers at all economic circumstances.
Dollar Tree has a solid and scalable infrastructure that we're expanding and leveraging for better inventory management, increasingly efficient supply chain logistics, more productive stores and crisper execution overall. The Deal$ brand is gaining traction. Both traffic and average ticket are growing. Dollar Tree Direct continues to broaden its reach, and we are building and expanding our Canadian business. 
We have plenty of opportunities to grow our business, a vision of where we want to go and the infrastructure and capital to make it happen while generating substantial free cash, which we use for the long-term benefit of shareholders. We're having a great year. We've transitioned quickly from Halloween, and our stores are now set with our best merchandise value ever for Thanksgiving and the Christmas holiday season.

Our comp sales grew 1.6%, and that was as a result of -- that's driven by traffic. Our sales were within our range of guidance, and it was an extremely profitable quarter. Our operating margin was the highest ever in Q3 at 10.7%. So it was really a strong quarter: net income, up 12.2%; EPS, up 18.6%; and again, earnings at the high end of our guidance. So as I sit here talking about pressures on our business, I am struck a little bit by the exceptional profitability of our quarter. The pressure on sales were basically -- I think you can put them in 3 buckets. It was, number one, consumer anxiety from just the continuation of a difficult macro environment, with stubbornly high unemployment and continuing high gas prices, and they keep rising, and continued concerns about the economy and the fiscal cliff. And all of these was magnified everyday as we went through the election, and that created anxiety and uncertainty in the consumer. That was one. Secondly, we had a calender shift with Halloween from Monday to Wednesday. We've moved 2 more Halloween selling days into fourth quarter. That was about a $5 million headwind, and we saw that. And the third reason is the difficult comparisons. If you look at what we're up against, we're against the 2-year stack comp of 13.5%. As a comparison, in Q2 this year, we were against the 2-year stack of 11.4%. And if you look at the 3-year stack and the 4-year stack, you'll find pretty much the same spread. So it was a pretty difficult comparison this year in third quarter and especially difficult comparison in our consumable business, which grew as a percentage of total by 170 basis points last year, and we were up against that this year. This year, consumables grew 32 basis points on top of that. We had a good quarter, as I said. We're pleased with the profitability. We're now focused on fourth quarter. Our stores are well prepared for the holiday sales. We're in stock. We're in business with the best value as ever, and we're looking forward to a good fourth quarter."

I think that as we go forward, we would expect that to continue. We're well positioned. We think that as we go forward that maybe there will -- maybe we've seen a slowdown, I guess, in a sense as far as the delta between growth in consumables. If you look at the quarters this year, Q1, I think, were up about 110 bps in consumables; Q2 was 40; and then Q3, 30. So we've seen that moderate a little bit. But overall, we feel good about where we've positioned ourselves. We are a variety store, first and foremost, and that's what our heritage is, and that's what we want to be known as, and that is very important to us. So as we'd continue to go forward, we think that's good. Gross profit, otherwise, as we look at -- I'll talk maybe to some of the pressures from Q3. Obviously, there was some freight pressure there. And we really -- as we've talked in the prepared comments about trucking rates and the fact that if you look at the industry, in general, since the economic downturn, there has been many trucking businesses go out, less competition, obviously. If you keep up in that industry, there's a nationwide shortage of truck drivers out there, so there's definitely some pressure there. Fuel, 23 basis points -- or $0.23 up, I mean, for the quarter. The metric there, as we've always said, if fuel -- diesel fuel is $1 higher for the full year, it would be about a $0.05 hit to us. So you can -- I mean, kind of back into what that means to us. So I don't know that -- I expect there still will be some pressure as we go forward into Q4 in that area. I don't -- we've really seen it all year, and I think we'll continue to see a little bit of it as we go through the fourth quarter as well."

So there's a big difference than the last year's performance, that we were up against in third quarter, and a lot of that was consumer products. Again, we grew our consumer goods 170 basis points in third quarter last year. This year, we grew it again, but it was 32 basis points on top of the 170. So those were the facts that did start off -- every month was positive. Every month grew. August -- September, we improved over August; October over September. So it grew through the quarter.

As we expanded the size of our stores, one thing I used to like to talk, and still do, is we expanded our open to sell, which serve the customer better, gave us the ability to serve -- offer more products and more categories and serve more customers in a more broad appeal, and we've that. I think your point about it, since 2007 through 2012, some of our highest comps is valid, and I think what you're looking at is short term versus long term. I still believe what I told you back in 1999 about the largest store, where we can go where the opportunity to serve more customers and better serve our customers and increase our same-store sales on our productivity. I still believe in that. But we are going to go through swings from time-to-time, from year-to-year from quarter-to-quarter. And, frankly, short term, you're going to have a quarter that's up against a really big quarter or really big 2 or, in this case, 5 quarters, and the comparison is going to get a little difficult, and what a bad -- to get a little bad weather. And by the way, who are better if you get a little cinematic [ph] run in the wrong way. I don't see that as long term though, so yes, we can still comp at higher rates, and we intend to comp at higher rates. I'm really pleased with the 1.6%. I know that sounds funny maybe to -- when I say that because we're always looking for more. But in this quarter a 1.6% comp and the way we converted and leveraged that and converted that to operating margin, the highest operating margin ever in third quarter. From a company that has high operating margins, I think, it's -- I'm pretty proud of what our folks have done with that. Can we do better? Absolutely. We can do a lot of things to continue to engage our customers, we can sell more, we can increase our productivity in all our stores. It's going in the right direction. You hear me praising that. Directionally, we're going in the right way. We're not where we're going to be. There are still things that we can do to drive productivity, and our teams are working and focused. And so look a little bit longer than one quarter, and I still believe in the concept. I believe that we're more relevant today than we've ever been to our customer. Back in 1999, we really didn't have much that you needed. It was everything that you wanted for the most part, small stores. Now with our mix, when times are tough, we got things to sell in tough times, and you can see the growth in our consumer products from that. When times aren't so tough, we have discretionary product. I talk about like in our customers having jingle in their pockets because I really want to sell the full mix. And that's what we strive to do at Dollar Tree. It's not just one or the other, it's selling the mix, and it's selling the shopping experience. And I still believe that when everything is $1 in a store, that makes us different. And our customers love it, and they react to it, and they're going to for many years."

Like I said, they're good retailers, I have great respect for all of them, but we're different. It's just not -- we're not the same. We're not a Coke, Pepsi predominantly driven name brand, predominantly driven assortment. And when we do have name brands, we're usually a little different. And I think our value on our front end, we only sell Coke products at the front end for the most part. From time to time, we'll have it somewhere else, but it's always impulse, it's always out of the cooler, mostly out of the cooler. You need one to drink, you pull it out, it's a great value for $1. By the way, you can by the Pepsi, and it's a bigger bottle than the Coke product, for $1. That's a position that Coke has chosen to take. And so we're just like everybody else. We're out there. Whatever size they're willing to sell for that price. So I can't tell you that -- I will tell you that there is no data that supports the fact that the competition is taking away our consumer products business. It is more us, it is more we started from 0 to whatever we have now in the last several years. And now we're starting to year-over-year run up against those big, big numbers. And we can continue to grow, but we intend to grow the whole mix, not just one side or the other. And as you'll go into our stores, hopefully, this Christmas, you'll go into our stores, take a look, and when you walk in, what you're going to see is Christmas. And you're going to see fun, and you're going to see toys, and you're going to see all the things to decorate your house and wrap it with boxes and give your presents and stocking stuffers and all those kinds of things because that is what we think as excitement, merchandise energy, ever-changing mix of product, so what makes us different than the rest of the folks in our sector. So that's the facts. We're in control of our destiny. We are going to have times where the comps are more and times when the comps are less.

We've got the more -- most tools to grow. We have Dollar Tree, we have Deal$, we have Dollar Tree Canada, we have Dollar Tree Direct. We have the infrastructure to support that growth. We know how to run it, and I'm really pleased about where we are. If I could -- like playing golf, I tell folks, if I could take my drive -- instead of driving, if I could place my ball out in the fairway where I wanted, this is where I want to place it.

We rarely close a store, and we're always looking, though we do usually 5-year leases with 3 5-year terms, something like that, sometimes longer if we know the market a little better, but the idea being that as the market changes, we can move with the markets. Back in the earlier days, as we were transitioning from the small store to the large store, our relocation was strategic for the market, but it was also an increase usually of the store size. Today, our relocations are typically to stores, strictly for strategic reasons, maybe the anchor and the center moved, maybe the population has changed, maybe we just ran out of term and we need to move, maybe the landlord is not going to scrape the centers, something like that. But the size of the store we're moving from is about the same as the size of the store that we're building, so there is not much of a difference, and that is strictly a relocation based on strategy, based on where we want to be in the market, how many stores. And we talk about planning the market. It's not just one store, it's the entire market that we're looking at. So in trying to answer your question, I would say that the pipeline, we start looking at opportunities to relocate several years before the lease term expires. And we're always out there looking at the market and moving things around to be optimal. I would say that most of the time, we relocate strategically. We're finding the space to move to. We're buying in the right kinds of product. And again, we're -- we have the ability to take what's there as is and turn it into a nice Dollar Tree store. Sometimes, we can work with, say, a developer sometimes, not as much since 2008, but a little more now than it has been to build the right Dollar Tree store for us. So the relocations are generally there. And the idea of planning out the market and moving them around is typically the reason we do it, not to get to a bigger store as much."

Our goal is to drive sales, drive productivity, leverage fixed costs, leverage our infrastructure and make money for our shareholders. And we're going to do that the best way. Sales is not something that we do -- we don't do. Clearance is the only thing we do. After Christmas, we'll sell some things 2 for $1, but Christmas items. But no, we don't plan any price promotion. We're already a price promotion. The whole store, 10,000 square feet, is $1."

Productivity, sales per square foot are up, and we think we can drive that higher. So our returns should be going up. And we're happy with continuing to grow and open more stores. The number of stores that we're opening are the number of stores that we think we can open profitably with the infrastructure that we've built, with the people and the store teams that we have and that we can develop profitably. So we're subject -- we have plenty of room for growth. We can run, we think, 7,000 Dollar Tree stores. We got a lot of room to go towards getting that number. And our goal is to continue growing pretty much at this rate. We haven't announced what next year's rate is, but I'm still bullish on Dollar Tree. So we still have the same idea, we're going to grow what we think we can do based on our ability to do it profitably and not get ahead of ourselves."

The company originally acquired its Ollie's ownership and interest in 2003. The sale had a favorable impact on our third quarter earnings, with an increase to net income of $0.17 per diluted share.

Total sales increased 7.8% to $1.72 billion, driven principally by increases in traffic. Our comparable store sales increased 1.6% compared with a 4.8% increase last year and an 8.7% comp the previous year. Earnings for the third quarter were $0.68 per diluted share. This includes $0.17 from the sale of our interest in Ollie's. Excluding the sale of Ollie's, our earnings for the third quarter were $0.51 per share. This represents an 18.6% increase over last year's $0.43 per share and was at the high end of our $0.47 to $0.51 range of guidance. 
Operating margin for the third quarter 2012 was 10.7%, an increase of 40 basis points over the third quarter last year. Net income rose 48.6% to $155.4 million versus $104.5 million last year. Excluding the income derived from the sale of Ollie's, net income rose 12.2% to $117.3 million.
Year-to-date through 3 quarters of 2012, total sales were $5.15 billion, an increase of 9.9%, and comp store sales increased 3.9%. Year-to-date, operating income has increased by $76.5 million. Operating margin was 10.8%, an increase of 60 basis points compared with the same period last year. Net income rose 30.0% to $390.7 million and earnings per share were $1.69, an increase of 37.4% compared with $1.23 per share reported last year. Excluding the income derived from the sale of Ollie's, net income rose 17.4% to $352.6 million and earnings per share were $1.53, an increase of 24.4% compared with $1.23 per share reported last year.
Sales increases in the third quarter came from growth in both basic and variety categories, with basic consumable categories growing at a slightly faster pace. Our top-performing categories included housewares and home products, health care products and food and beverages. Customers responded enthusiastically to our Halloween seasonal product, and our sales in the third quarter met expectations. Sales were particularly strong in Halloween home décor. Seasonal changes were executed in a timely manner, and we're now ready for fall, Thanksgiving and the holiday season.
In terms of the sales cadence in third quarter, comps were positive every month and we saw sequential improvement from August through October. In terms of geography, performance in the third quarter was relatively consistent across the country, with the highest comps coming from the mid-Atlantic, Midwest and New England, followed closely by the Southwest and the Southeast. 
Dollar Tree remains a destination for high-value consumer products, and customer traffic was up throughout the quarter. When customers are in our stores shopping for the basics, we give them every reason to stock up on our terrific assortment of high-value and high-margin variety merchandise. Even in a difficult economy, at Dollar Tree you can still splurge. Everything is only $1. 
Looking to the future, we're excited about our growth potential and continued relevance to the customer. Over the next several years, it's likely that consumers' demand for value will continue to grow and intensify. Dollar Tree is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this trend. Our goal is to provide more value through a broader range of customers. And we're doing this in many ways: by opening more stores; by opening better, more productive stores; and by developing new formats, new markets and new channels. 
During the third quarter this year, we opened 111 new stores and relocated and expanded another 16 stores. Through 3 quarters of 2012, we have added 298 new stores and expanded or relocated 81 stores. Selling square footage has increased 7.1%, and we ended the quarter with 4,630 stores. We're on track with our new store opening plan for the full year 2012, which includes 315 new stores. And we have surpassed our plan for 75 relocations and expansions in 2012. We now expect to complete more than 395 total projects across the U.S. and Canada in fiscal 2012.
I'm particularly pleased by the productivity of our new stores. Sustained improvement requires a coordinated effort across the organization. It requires a strategy and requires teamwork between real estate, merchants planning, stores and logistics. Our teams are concentrated on improved site selection, on rightsizing our stores, expanding our assortments, improving staffing and building the bench of qualified store management and on opening new stores earlier in the year. We believe these are the key elements to increasing our new store productivity, and we're having success. I'm very pleased to report that average new store productivity has increased in each of the past 6 years, and the trend has continued through the third quarter 2012.
Efforts to increase sales per square foot are not limited to new stores, and elements of the strategy to increase store productivity can be seen throughout the chain. In all stores, we're developing more powerful seasonal presentations. Stores are emphasizing more effective customer engagement and working to drive sales of related items through cross merchandising and suggestive selling. We are expanding assortments at the front end of our stores to create more merchandise energy and to drive impulse sales. And merchants are expanding our assortments in candy, stationery, health and beauty care and home and household products, which was our fastest growing category in the third quarter.
As part of our strategy to broaden assortments, our expansion of frozen and refrigerated product continues. We installed freezers and coolers in 67 additional stores in the third quarter and now offer frozen and refrigerated products in 2,467 stores. We remain on schedule to roll this product out to a total of approximately 325 installations for the full year. 
Another key component of our growth strategy is the development of new retail formats, the expansion of our geographic reach and the development of additional channels of distribution to serve more customers. Specifically, that means Deal$, Dollar Tree Canada and Dollar Tree Direct. 
Our Deal$ format extends our ability to serve more customers with more categories and increases our unit growth potential. Deal$ delivers low prices on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home products. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point, at Deal$ we're able to serve more customers with more products and value prices everyday. Customers are responding favorably to the strategy, customer awareness of the Deal$ brand is growing, and the concept is building momentum. Overall in the third quarter, as in the past several quarters, comp store sales in our Deal$ stores continue to lead the company. We're excited about the growth potential of Deal$, and particularly the opportunity that it provides to grow profitably in the higher costs of operation urban markets. We ended the quarter with a total of 194 Deal$ stores.
Our Canadian integration and expansion continues. We initially entered the Canadian market through the acquisition of Dollar Giant stores in November of 2010. Our goal is to be the leading retailer in Canada at the single price point of $1.25, just as we are in the U.S. at the $1 price point. Last year, our first full year, we installed retail systems; we integrated processes, merchandise assortments and store teams; and we laid the foundation for future profitable growth in the Canadian market. Just 1 year ago, in the third quarter of 2011, we completed the installation and training of store-level POS and enterprise-level merchandising systems. Today for the first time, we have consistent year-on-year data on which to base our sales and assortment planning. We have visibility to our own hand, own order and sales, along with the trailing history by store and by SKU. These are all key factors in the management for an efficient supply chain and improving customer satisfaction. 
The merchandising teams are integrated to leverage Dollar Tree buying power. This has been a big transition, but customers are beginning to buy in broader, more exciting assortments and better values in the stores. We expect this to gain momentum as we move through the holiday season and beyond. 
Our focus is on more efficient store operations, continued building of store teams and improved product flow to the stores. We're working very hard to increase the service level and in-stock position of basic products while improving the shopping experience through a more powerful seasonal presence and a higher level of merchandise energy. 
Meanwhile, we're expanding our Canadian store base. We opened 12 new stores in the third quarter, 30 stores year-to-date, and we ended the quarter with 129 Canadian stores. We had begun the year with a plan to grow our Canadian store base approximately 25% under the Dollar Tree brand. We will likely exceed this plan and end the year with 135 stores in Canada.
In addition, we've rebranded all of the former Dollar Giant stores in Ontario to Dollar Tree Canada this year, and we'll do the same for stores in the Western provinces in 2013. As we grow and improve, we believe the Canadian market can support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores. This is an addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States, plus additional growth in our Deal$ format. I'm extremely excited about the opportunity for Dollar Tree in Canada and proud of what has been accomplished in a short period of time. Our current commitment to build infrastructure, develop store teams and improve the consistency of our offering across the chain will be worth the effort.
Dollar Tree Direct, our e-commerce business, continues to grow. This additional channel of distribution provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand the brand and attract more customers into the stores. Traffic exceeded 4.5 million unique visitors in the third quarter. That's a 19% increase over the third quarter last year. Additionally, over 28 million e-mails were sent to individual consumers, businesses and organizations. 
We are expanding the available market to more consumers in several ways. First, Dollar Tree Direct now has over 2,600 items available online, including 825 items for sale via our website that can be purchased in less than case quantities, an increase of over 65% versus the same time last year. Additionally, we continue to work on an -- to enhance the customers' experience on their mobile devices, improving the ease of navigation and speed on our mobile e-commerce site. Over 1.5 million people chose to interact with Dollar Tree via their mobile devices during the third quarter. Through these initiatives, Dollar Tree Direct is gaining customers every quarter, and I'm pleased with their progress.
Investments in new stores, more productive stores, additional formats and expanded geography all increased our ability to grow our business, expand our concept and serve more customers in more ways. In order to achieve consistent and profitable growth, our practice has been to add infrastructure and distribution capacity to support our growth ahead of the need. In that regard, construction is proceeding according to schedule on our new distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut. DC10 will be 1 million square feet. It will automated and highly efficient, providing capacity and cost-effective service to our stores as we continue to expand in the Northeast. We're on schedule for a third quarter 2013 completion.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin, who will give you more detail on our financial metrics and provide guidance."
27685,170941703,388068,"Dollar Tree, Inc., Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2012",2012-11-15,"Earnings Calls","Dollar Tree, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob.

As Bob mentioned, excluding the nonoperating income from the Ollie's transaction, our diluted earnings per share increased 18.6% in the third quarter to $0.51. The increase resulted from our sales growth and expense control, which resulted in a 40-basis-point improvement in operating profit margin compared to the third quarter last year. Our gross profit margin was 34.9% during the third quarter compared with the 35.1% reported in the third quarter last year. 
Several factors contributed to this performance. Freight costs increased, driven by higher trucking rates and diesel fuel prices that averaged $0.23 per gallon above the same period last year. Our product mix continued to shift in the third quarter, as basic consumable products increased by 32 basis points as a percentage of sales. In addition, markdown expense increased slightly as a percentage of sales relative to the third quarter last year. These factors were partially offset by higher initial mark-up across many categories. 
Occupancy and distribution expenses were flat as a percentage of sales, reflecting the 1.6% comp store sales growth and the addition of 295 new stores compared with the same period last year. SG&A expenses were 24.2% of sales for the quarter, which is a 60-basis-point improvement from the third quarter last year. Operating expenses declined by about 45 basis points. This was driven by a realized gain of $3.8 million relating to the favorable resolution to a legal matter and reductions in legal fees, advertising expense, repairs and maintenance utilities and debit and credit card fees as a percentage of sales. Payroll-related expenses declined by approximately 15 basis points due to lower incentive compensation expense compared with last year. 
We expect the credit card penetration will grow in the fourth quarter. We have just completed the rollout of MasterCard acceptance to an additional 3,500 stores. We now accept Visa and MasterCard in all of our stores, chain-wide, and we also accept American Express and Discover in all of our stores in the United States. 
Operating income increased $19.3 million compared with the third quarter last year. Our operating margin for the quarter was 10.7%, a 40-basis-point improvement compared to the third quarter last year. Year-to-date through the third quarter operating margin is 10.8%, an increase of 50 basis points from the same period last year.
The tax rate for the quarter was basically unchanged at 36.3% compared with the third quarter last year at 36.4%. The tax rate was lower than the tax rate anticipated in our guidance for the quarter due to favorable provision to return reconciliation adjustments and the lower tax rate on the Ollie's gain.
Cash and investments at the quarter ended -- at quarter-end totaled $222.4 million versus $280.2 million at the end of third quarter 2011. During the third quarter, we invested $149.8 million for share repurchase and repurchased 3.3 million shares. During the first 3 quarters, we invested $235.3 million for share repurchase and repurchased 5 million shares on the open market. At quarter-end, we had $965 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. The diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter was $230.0 million. Over the past 4 quarters, we have invested $535.3 million for share repurchase. We will update you on additional share repurchases, if any, at the end of the quarter in which they may occur. 
Our consolidated inventory at quarter-end was 12.7% greater than it was at the same time last year. Selling square footage increased 7.1%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot increased by 5.2%. The increase reflects a higher amount of inventory in our distribution centers at the end of the third quarter and an increase in goods on the water. This is to support planned holiday and post-Christmas sales and new store openings. And it is consistent with our strategy to just move the flow of inventory through our logistics network. Inventory turns increased in 2012 through 3 quarters, and we expect this trend to continue for the full year as it has for the past 7 years.
Capital expenditures were $96.6 million in the third quarter of 2012 versus $75.5 million in the third quarter last year. For the full year, we are planning consolidated capital expenditures to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million. Capital expenditures are focused on new stores and remodels, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 325 stores, IT system enhancements and approximately $70 million towards our new distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut. The total capital investment anticipated for this facility is approximately $100 million. 
Depreciation and amortization was $43.6 million for the third quarter versus $41.1 million in the third quarter last year. For the full year, we expect depreciation expense of $170 million to $173 million.
Our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012 includes several assumptions. First, Halloween shifted 2 days deeper into the fourth quarter this year, from the first Monday of the quarter last year to the first Wednesday this year. We believe that this did, in fact, shift approximately $5 million of sales from the third quarter into the fourth quarter compared to last year. Second, we have been asked about the impact of Hurricane Sandy on our fourth quarter. We are grateful to report that it appears the storm will not have a material impact on our fourth quarter results. Also as previously disclosed, due to the retail calendar, 2012 will include 53 weeks and the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. This is expected to add $120 million to $130 million of incremental sales and $0.07 to $0.08 earnings per share for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 38.1% for the fourth quarter and 37.2% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 228.6 million shares for the fourth quarter and 231 million shares for the full year. As always, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase.
With this in mind, for the fourth quarter of 2012, we are forecasting sales in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.26 billion based on a flat to a low single-digit comparable store sales increase and 7.2% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.97 to $1.02, an increase of 21.3% to 27.5%. This fourth quarter guidance includes the impact of the extra week. For the full fiscal year of 2012, we are now forecasting sales in the range of $7.35 billion to $7.41 billion based on a low to mid-single-digit increase in comparable store sales and 7.2% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.70, representing an increase of 31.8% to 34.3% over our record earnings per share of $2.01 in fiscal 2011. And this includes the impact of the 53rd week. The full year guidance also includes $0.16 earnings per share from the Ollie's sale in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of the Ollie's transaction, we would expect full year earnings per share to be in the range of $2.49 to $2.54, representing an increase of 23.9% to 26.4% over last year. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

In the face of a very challenging and uncertain environment, Dollar Tree's traffic grew, our reach is expanding, and we continue to deliver record profitability.

Earnings per share increased by 18.6% on top of a 19.2% increase last year. Our inventory is balanced and more productive than ever. Our turns increased again through the first 3 quarters of the year, and we entered the fourth quarter well prepared for new store growth and customer demand. Through the third quarter this year, we've opened 298 new stores across the U.S. and Canada, and the productivity of the new store class has been performing ahead of last year. In addition, the company invested $235 million for share repurchase, buying back 5 million shares over the first 3 quarters, including 3.3 million shares for $150 million in the third quarter alone. 
I believe that Dollar Tree is singularly positioned to do even better in the future. The customers are focused in our stores and our products. They are strategically located to serve middle America. They're bright, they're convenient, and they're fun to shop. Our balanced mix of high-value consumer basics and our unique assortment of fun, compelling seasonally correct discretionary products positions us to be relevant to customers at all economic circumstances.
Dollar Tree has a solid and scalable infrastructure that we're expanding and leveraging for better inventory management, increasingly efficient supply chain logistics, more productive stores and crisper execution overall. The Deal$ brand is gaining traction. Both traffic and average ticket are growing. Dollar Tree Direct continues to broaden its reach, and we are building and expanding our Canadian business. 
We have plenty of opportunities to grow our business, a vision of where we want to go and the infrastructure and capital to make it happen while generating substantial free cash, which we use for the long-term benefit of shareholders. We're having a great year. We've transitioned quickly from Halloween, and our stores are now set with our best merchandise value ever for Thanksgiving and the Christmas holiday season.

It was number one, consumer anxiety from just the continuation of a difficult macro environment with stubbornly high unemployment and continuing high gas prices, and they keep rising, and continued concerns about the economy and the fiscal cliff. And all of these was magnified everyday as we went through the election, and that created anxiety and uncertainty in the consumer. That was one. Secondly, we had a calendar shift with Halloween from Monday to Wednesday. We've moved 2 more Halloween selling days into fourth quarter. That was about a $5 million headwind, and we saw that. And the third reason is the difficult comparisons. If you look at what we're up against, we're against the 2-year stack comp of 13.5%. As a comparison, in Q2 this year, we were against the 2-year stack of 11.4%. And if you look at the 3-year stack and the 4-year stack, you'll find pretty much the same spread. So it was a pretty difficult comparison this year in third quarter and especially difficult comparison in our consumable business, which grew as a percentage of total by 170 basis points last year, and we were up against that this year. This year, consumables grew 32 basis points on top of that. We had a good quarter, as I said. We're pleased with the profitability. We're now focused on fourth quarter. Our stores are well prepared for the holiday sales. We're in stock. We're in business with the best values ever, and we're looking forward to a good fourth quarter."

I think that as we go forward, we would expect that to continue. We're well positioned. We think that as we go forward that maybe there will -- maybe we've seen a slowdown, I guess, in a sense as far as the delta between growth in consumables. If you look at the quarters this year, Q1, I think we’re up about 110 bps in consumables; Q2 was 40; and then Q3, 30. So we've seen that moderate a little bit. But overall, we feel good about where we've positioned ourselves. We are a variety store, first and foremost, and that's what our heritage is, and that's what we want to be known as, and that is very important to us. So as we'd continue to go forward, we think that's good. Gross profit, otherwise, as we look at -- I'll talk maybe to some of the pressures from Q3. Obviously, there was some freight pressure there. And we really -- as we've talked in the prepared comments about trucking rates and the fact that if you look at the industry in general, since the economic downturn, there have been many trucking businesses go out, less competition, obviously. If you keep up in that industry, there's a nationwide shortage of truck drivers out there, so there's definitely some pressure there. Fuel, 23 basis points -- or $0.23 up, I mean, for the quarter. The metric there, as we've always said, if fuel -- diesel fuel is $1 higher for the full year, it would be about a $0.05 hit to us. So you can -- I mean, kind of back into what that means to us. So I don't know that -- I expect there still will be some pressure as we go forward into Q4 in that area. I don't -- we've really seen it all year, and I think we'll continue to see a little bit of it as we go through the fourth quarter as well."

It was the largest 2-year stack that we -- that when you look at the difference in this 2-year stack between second and third quarter, it's about a 200-basis-point difference. So there's a big difference than the last year's performance, that we were up against in third quarter, and a lot of that was consumer products. Again, we grew our consumer goods 170 basis points in third quarter last year. This year we grew it again, but it was 32 basis points on top of the 170. So those were the facts that did start off -- every month was positive. Every month grew. August -- September, we improved over August; October over September. So it grew through the quarter. All in all, it was a 1.6% comp at the end of the day. So the 3 pressures that I listed are the 3 that we can identify, and those are the things that we see. And again I'll just point, the 1.6% comp delivered a lot of leverage still on fixed costs, and it was an extremely profitable quarter for us."

As we expanded the size of our stores, one thing I used to like to talk about and still do is we expanded our open to sell, which served the customer better, gave us the ability to serve -- offer more products and more categories and serve more customers in a more broad appeal, and we've had that. I think your point about it, since 2007 through 2012 some of our highest comps is valid, and I think what you're looking at is short term versus long term. I still believe what I told you back in 1999 about the largest store and where we could go and the opportunity to serve more customers and better serve our customers and increase our same-store sales on our productivity. I still believe in that. But we are going to go through swings from time-to-time, from year-to-year, from quarter-to-quarter. And frankly, short term, you're going to have a quarter that's up against a really big quarter or really big 2 or, in this case, 5 quarters, and the comparison is going to get a little difficult, and what about if you get a little bad weather. And by the way, what about if you get a little sentiment running the wrong way. I don't see that as long term, though.  So yes, we can still comp at higher rates and we intend to comp at higher rates. I'm really pleased with the 1.6%. I know that sounds funny maybe to -- when I say that because we're always looking for more. But in this quarter, a 1.6% comp and the way we convert it and leverage that and convert it to operating margin, the highest operating margin ever in third quarter. From a company that has high operating margins, I think, it's -- I'm pretty proud of what our folks have done with that. Can we do better? Absolutely. We can do a lot of things to continue to engage our customers.  We can sell more, we can increase our productivity in all our stores. It's going in the right direction. You hear me praising that. Directionally, we're going in the right way. We're not at the top, we’re not where we're going to be. There are still things that we can do to drive productivity, and our teams are working and focused. And so look a little bit longer than one quarter, and I still believe in the concept. I believe that we're more relevant today than we've ever been to our customer. Back in 1999, we really didn't have much that you needed. It was everything that you wanted for the most part, small stores. Now with our mix, when times are tough, we got things to sell in tough times, and you can see the growth in our consumer products from that. When times aren't so tough, we have discretionary product. I talk about liking our customers having jingle in their pockets because I really want to sell the full mix and that's what we strive to do at Dollar Tree. It's not just one or the other, it's selling the mix, and it's selling the shopping experience. And I still believe that when everything is $1 in a store, that makes us different.

It does appear that Dollar Tree's momentum and consumables began to slow about the same time that Family Dollar began to make a bigger investment in consumable products, whether it's the Pepsi product or the McLane product. And also it appears that maybe the business began to decelerate after Coke started downsizing the Coke bottles at Dollar Tree from 20 ounces down to 14 ounces. And I know that there's a lot of leakage in that part of the business based on pricing and value. Maybe you could talk about those 2 issues."

As we'd look at our stores that are in the competitors' areas, we're seeing no difference. We see nothing from what they're doing that is affecting our stores on a store-by-store or market-by-market basis. Like I said, they're good retailers; I have great respect for all of them, but we're different. It's just not -- we're not the same. We're not a Coke, Pepsi predominantly driven name brand, predominantly driven assortment. And when we do have name brands, we're usually a little different. And I think our value on our front end, we only sell Coke products at the front end for the most part. From time to time, we'll have it somewhere else, but it's always impulse, it's always out of the cooler, mostly out of the cooler. You need one to drink, you pull it out, it's a great value for $1. By the way, you can by the Pepsi, and it's a bigger bottle than the Coke product, for $1. That's a position that Coke has chosen to take. And so we're just like everybody else. We're out there. Whatever size they're willing to sell for that price. So I can't tell you that -- I will tell you that there is no data that supports the fact that the competition is taking away our consumer products business. It is more us, it is more we started and went from 0 to whatever we have now in the last several years. And now we're starting to year-over-year run up against those big, big numbers. And we can continue to grow, but we intend to grow the whole mix, not just one side or the other. And as you'll go into our stores, hopefully this Christmas you'll go into our stores, take a look, and when you walk in what you're going to see is Christmas. And you're going to see fun, and you're going to see toys, and you're going to see all the things to decorate your house and wrap your boxes and give your presents and stocking stuffers and all of those kinds of things because that is what we think as excitement, merchandise energy, ever-changing mix of product, so what makes us different than the rest of the folks in our sector. So that's the facts. We're in control of our destiny. We are going to have times where the comps are more and times when the comps are less. And year over year over year, there are going to be times when you have a little different set of circumstances after 5 years of progressively increasing comps. Look at the long term, though, and I don't mean long term next century, I'm talking about just look at the long-term future of our company. We're the best positioned. We've got the most growth. We've got the more -- most tools to grow. We have Dollar Tree, we have Deal$, we have Dollar Tree Canada, we have Dollar Tree Direct. We have the infrastructure to support that growth. We know how to run it, and I'm really pleased about where we are. If I could – it’s like playing golf.  I tell folks if I could take my drive -- instead of driving, if I could place my ball out in the fairway where I wanted, this is where I want to place it. We're exactly where we need to be as regard to -- in regard to relevance to our customer. And that's the answer."

We've said for a long time, the return on another Dollar Tree store is the best thing we can do, and we look to continue to grow our business. We're investing in our infrastructure with our new distribution center, a $100 million project, so not a small project. And we'll continue to look at those type of things. We continue to be a buyer of our stock in Q3, with $149 million of stock repurchased in Q3. So those are the ways we look at continuing to invest in our business.

We rarely close a store, and we're always looking, though we do usually 5-year leases with 3 5-year terms, something like that, sometimes longer if we know the market a little better, but the idea being that as the market changes, we can move with the markets. Back in the earlier days as we were transitioning from the small store to the large store, our relocation was strategic for the market, but it was also an increase usually of the store size. Today, our relocations are typically to stores, strictly for strategic reasons, maybe the anchor in the center moved, maybe the population has changed, maybe we just ran out of term and we need to move, maybe the landlord is not going to scrape the center, something like that. But the size of the store we're moving from is about the same as the size of the store that we're building, so there is not much of a difference, and that is strictly a relocation based on strategy, based on where we want to be in the market, how many stores. And we talk about planning the market. It's not just one store, it's the entire market that we're looking at. So in trying to answer your question, I would say that the pipeline, we start looking at opportunities to relocate several years before the lease term expires. And we're always out there looking at the market and moving things around to be optimal. I would say that most of the time, we relocate strategically. We're finding the space to move to. We're buying in the right kinds of product. And again, we're -- we have the ability to take what's there as is and turn it into a nice Dollar Tree store. Sometimes we can work with a developer, sometimes not as much since 2008, but a little more now than it has been to build the right Dollar Tree store for us. So the relocations are generally there. And the idea of planning out the market and moving them around is typically the reason we do it now, not to get to a bigger store as much."
