We thank everyone in our global audience for joining us this morning at The McGraw-Hill Companies' fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings call. I'm Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for The McGraw-Hill Companies. This morning, we issued a news release with our fourth quarter results. We trust you've all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of it, the financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mcgraw-hill.com. Once again, that is www.mcgraw-hill.com. 
In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we are providing adjusted revenue and free cash flow information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparison of the company's operating performance between periods and to view the company's business from the same perspective as management's. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the differences between the non-GAAP measures and comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The results we are reporting also reflect the reclassification of the Broadcasting Group as a discontinued operation following the signing of the definitive agreement in October 2011 to sell this business to E.W. Scripps. 
In today's news release and on the conference call, we are introducing new names for some operations to reflect changes being created by our Growth and Value Plan. In each case, more information about the new entity is being provided to investors. Under the separation plan, the newly named McGraw-Hill Financial company includes 5 lines of business. They are S&P Ratings, S&P Capital IQ, S&P Indices and Commodities and commercial operations. The segment previously named McGraw-Hill Financial now becomes S&P Capital/S&P Indices. We are providing revenue for both S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices. And over time, additional financial information will be provided on these operations. Information & Media becomes Commodities and Commercial. We are providing revenue for both Commodities and Commercial operations, and, over time, more information will be provided about them as well. 
Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities and Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. In this regard, we direct listeners to the cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Patti Rockenwagner in our New York office at area code (212) 512-3533 subsequent to this call. That's (212) 512-3533. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Harold McGraw III, Chairman, President and CEO of The McGraw-Hill Companies. Terry?"

With me today, besides Don, is Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. And this morning, I will briefly review our results for the fourth quarter and the full year, and Jack will provide some additional detail. We're going to discuss the 2011, and 2011 was a milestone year for The McGraw-Hill Companies. I will provide an overview of the accomplishments of our businesses, both across the newly formed McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education, and then we'll take a look into 2012, which promises to be 1 of the most momentous periods in our 24-year, 124-year history of the company. As always, after our prepared remarks, we will be pleased to answer any questions that you may have about The McGraw-Hill Companies. 
All right, in the fourth quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 17% year-over-year to $0.63. That includes $66 million in restructuring charges for severance related to a workforce reduction of approximately 800 positions and $10 million for onetime separation expenses necessary to implement the Growth and Value Plan. Revenue was up 2% and adjusted operating profit grew 8% as results across the portfolio were mixed. Looking at the year in its entirety, 2011 was the second best year in our history for revenue, operating profit and earnings per share. Only 2007 topped our performance in 2011. Revenue increased by 3% to $6.2 billion. On an adjusted basis, 2011 net income from continuing operations grew by 6% to $883 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 9% to $2.91. 
Let me spend a few minutes reflecting on this past year. 2011 was beyond a doubt a landmark year for The McGraw-Hill Companies. We produced a strong performance in the face of the volatile market conditions and we made important decisions that will better position the company for the future and, we believe, increase returns to our shareholders. Over 9 milestones, 9 major milestones during the year, and they included, first, the announcement last September of a Growth and Value Plan, whose centerpiece is the creation of 2 strong public companies, McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education. Secondly, significant and rapid progress in realizing the promise of the Growth and Value Plan, including fourth quarter restructuring and realignment of our benefit plans. Third was the targeting of at least $100 million in cost reductions. Fourth was the divestiture of the Broadcasting Group at a very attractive price. Fifth was the expansion of the core Commodities franchise with a strategic acquisition of 2 new companies in natural gas and steel. Sixth was the partnership with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the CME, to drive future growth of S&P Indices. Seventh was the successful combination in 2011 of S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices and a new segment that leverages resources, creates scale, produces solid growth and will be a source of new growth opportunities in financial markets. Eighth is the rapid growth of digital products and services that are transforming the education market and creating enormous new opportunities for McGraw-Hill Education. And finally, ninth, was $1.5 billion of share repurchases in 2011. 
We are moving quickly to unlock the value inherent in our Growth and Value Plan. Jack Callahan, our CFO, will provide more detail in just a moment on the restructuring to date, but we have already taken significant actions to create 2 efficiently sized corporate structures and separate shared services. 
We have established and staffed a program management office, PMO, with 17 work streams. It is a massive global effort. Teams are focusing on growth opportunities, transaction management and cost reductions across the enterprise, including business support services and information technology. They are identifying growth synergies and scalable capabilities. We are using the most seasoned and experienced staffers to help us start realizing the benefits of all this work later this year. It is another reason why we're more confident than ever that at least $100 million in cost savings will be realized. 
As part of the Growth and Value Plan, we sought opportunities to monetize assets that do not fit with our strategic thrust. That is why we sold our Broadcasting Group to E.W. Scripps at the end of 2011. We generated excellent value for this asset, $212 million in cash and a pretax gain of $123 million. We also want to make strategic investments in areas that we believe will drive future growth. A common theme is our creation of valuable benchmarks for participants in capital, commercial and commodity markets that become deeply embedded in the workflow of our customers. There are a few better examples than Platts and its role in global oil markets. And with new growth opportunities in the trading of gas, steel and iron ore, we expanded the Platts platform by acquiring BENTEK Energy and Steel Business Briefing in 2011. And in November, we announced another important strategic milestone for our Growth and Value Plan, and that was the joint venture partnership with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange that brings together S&P Indices with Dow Jones Indexes once the deal is closed. The new venture provides S&P Indices with a more diversified and enhanced revenue stream. And instead of paying S&P Indices a fixed fee per trade, the CME will pay a share of the profits that it makes on trading and clearing of equity-based futures, swaps and options on the futures. The proposed joint venture is currently undergoing review by the Department of Justice. Subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions, we expect the joint venture to close by the end of the second quarter. 
In the midst of all this activity, we continue to return wealth to shareholders through the payment of dividends and an active share repurchase program. We completed $1 billion in share repurchases over the course of 2011, and late in the year, we initiated an accelerated $500 million repurchase transaction. That adds up to $1.5 billion for the year, including $845 million in the fourth quarter. 
As you can see, we covered a lot of ground in a short period, so we can create later this year 2 independent public companies that as standalones will increase their respective growth prospects and deliver shareholder value. In recent months, the board of directors of The McGraw-Hill Companies has been engaged in a number of important initiatives as part of this Growth and Value Plan and has been taking into consideration constructive input for major shareholders, including Jana Partners, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan among others. The company is committed to continue working to deliver value to all shareholders by continually evaluating opportunities to improve its corporate structure and portfolio of businesses, aggressively pursuing additional cost reduction initiatives, accelerating growth and returning substantial value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Now I want to discuss the performance of McGraw-Hill Financial in a little bit more depth. A highlight of 2011 is the demonstrated ability of the operating company that we will call McGraw-Hill Financial to navigate successfully through the volatility that characterized capital markets for most of the year and still deliver a solid performance. Revenue for the recently named McGraw-Hill Financial increased 9% and adjusted operating profits improved by 7% in 2011. A growth driver is the operation we now call S&P Capital IQ/S&P Indices. We have succeeded in creating a scalable organization with a unique integrated offering for global financial markets. In 2011, it proved to be a resilient revenue and earnings generator and we expect another good year in 2012. Incremental value is being created by leveraging scale, improving the vertical operations and creating horizontal solutions. S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices, which was formerly known as McGraw-Hill Financial segment, grew its top line at a double-digit rate in 2011. Revenue was up 14% for the year and grew by 11%, excluding the acquisitions of TheMarkets.com. The operating margin expanded to 30%, up from 26.5% in 2010. 
Subscriptions account for 73% of the total revenue and grew by 13% in 2011, which is a good sign for performance in 2012. One of the crown jewels is S&P Indices which produced revenue of $323 million in 2011, an 18% year-over-year increase. S&P Indices generates revenue from a variety of sources. There are fees based on asset under management in exchange-traded funds that are linked to S&P Indices. At year-end 2011, there were $314 billion in assets under management in exchange-traded funds based on S&P Indices, and that's a year-over-year increase up 4.5%. There are royalties based on the trading volume of derivative contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board options exchange, the Australian securities exchange and the Montréal exchange. In the fourth quarter, the average yearly volume of more than 3.7 million contracts for the major exchange-traded derivatives represented a 26% year-over-year increase and we're paid every time a contract is trading. 
There are also fees for over-the-counter derivatives and retail-structured products. And finally, there are data subscriptions for our information and research. Revenue for S&P Capital IQ, which includes the Integrated Desktop Solutions, Enterprise Solutions and Research & Analytics, increased by 13% in 2011 compared to 2010. Capital IQ, the Global Credit Portal and the Global Data Solutions all grew in 2011. Capital IQ gained share and increased its number of clients to more than 3,800, and that's a 14% year-over-year increase. 
Let me move over to Standard & Poor's Ratings, and at Standard & Poor's Ratings, despite lackluster new issue dollar volume in the closing months of 2011, for the most part, in the face of the European debt crisis and concerns over an economic downturn, we still produced a 4% increase in revenue for the year. Indeed, the first half of 2011 was quite strong with revenue growth of 14%. But revenue did tail off in the second half, declining by 5%. Excluding fourth quarter restructuring charges, operating profit in 2011 declined by 4% to $728 million, with an operating margin of 41%. Once again, nontransaction revenue proved its durability, growing by 8% in 2011 to $1.1 billion and accounting for 63% of Standard & Poor's Ratings total revenue. Nontransaction revenue includes annual contracts, surveillance fees and a royalty from S&P Capital IQ S&P Indices to distribute the content. But the growth of nontransaction revenue is partially offset by a 2% decline in transaction revenue in 2011. We expect nontransaction revenue to grow again in 2012, and transaction revenue faces some challenging comparisons after a very, very strong first half in 2011. 
We note that regulatory costs for our QCCR program came in essentially on target in 2011 and we're expected to increase just slightly this year for 2012. Looking forward, we remain encouraged by the longer-term outlook for the bond market. There's a huge pipeline of maturing global corporate debt that will need to be refinanced over the next several years. In Europe, increasing bank capital requirements will continue to shift corporate financing from bank loans to the public debt markets. Recovery of structured finance markets remains problematic. Most activity in residential mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities depends on the recovery of the residential and commercial real estate markets, but we do expect a pickup in auto and credit card issuance to lead the improvement in the asset-backed securities market in both in the United States and in Europe. 
We do anticipate continued volatility in 2012, but we remain optimistic about the growth potential longer-term. We continue to make progress in regulatory, in legal matters. In Europe, there is mounting criticism on some of the features of CRA 3. Now that's the European Commission's latest proposal for regulating rating agencies. Significantly, the pushback is coming from market participants, and the European Securities and Markets Authority or ESMA. A lot of criticisms focused on the proposed mandatory rotation of coverage among rating agencies for certain periods. It's still early days in this latest round with the European Commission, but it is already clear that its new proposals are coming under significant criticism from a wide range of parties. We're concerned about the potential for market disruption and obviously unintended consequences. 
Since our last report, the number of lawsuits that have been dismissed outright has grown to 24, and 10 have been voluntarily withdrawn. Seven dismissals by lower courts have been reaffirmed by higher courts. We will be appealing the latest court decision in the CalPERS case. We strongly disagree with the court's ruling earlier this month that CalPERS had made a sufficient showing to allow the case to proceed. There will be no pretrial discovery while the appeal is pending, and the process could take another 12 to 18 months. On January 23, we filed a motion for summary judgment in the Abu Dhabi case. Any decision on our motion is probably many months away. And as we said consistently from the very beginning and it is proving out, we continue to believe that the legal risk is low. 
Consistent with the Growth and Value Plan strategy and the divestiture of Broadcasting, we report results for Commodities and Commercial brands, which were formerly named in the Information & Media segment. Revenue for all of these brands grew by 10% in 2011, and, excluding restructuring charges, operating profit was up 13% with an operating margin of 21%. These operations are increasingly digital, and based on subscriptions, total subscription to revenue grew by 13% in 2011 and now accounts for 63% of the revenue. In Commodities, Platts completed another strong year by growing 22% to $419 million. Excluding the acquisition of BENTEK Energy and Steel Business Briefing, revenue was up 15% for 2011. Volatility in energy prices drives demand for Platts' proprietary content, including news, price assessments and analytics for trading decisions. Platts, obviously, is 1 of our gems. We have steadily built this business over the years, creating high value and double-digit growth. In fact, Platts has produced a compound annual growth rate since 1994 of 12% at 17 years with a compound annual growth rate of 12%. We like the outlook for this business. 
Revenue for Commercial, which includes J.D. Power, McGraw-Hill Construction and Aviation Week, grew by 2% in 2011 to $477 million. Continued strength in emerging markets, including China, recovery in the Western Europe and growth in the U.S. is increasing demand for automotive studies. New digital products like spec share, build share and BidPro, will be key factors in the recovery of the McGraw-Hill Construction. More are on the way. We expect another year of growth in commodities and commercial markets in 2012. These highlights will begin to give you some indication of what we are planning overall for McGraw-Hill Financial. 
As this slide illustrates, we plan to report results for 5 lines of business. In today's earnings release, we provided tables recapping quarterly revenue for 2011 and 2010 for each of these 5 lines of business. As we move closer to separation, close our deal with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and realign our cost structure, we will provide greater transparency on the bottom line contribution from these 5 lines of businesses as well. 
Let me hold it there and let me move over to McGraw-Hill Education. In 2011, we have a tale of 2 markets and repositioning of education for the digital world. Both in Higher Education, Professional and International spurred by digital products and services and a decline in elementary high school education. A strong finish in the U.S. higher education marketplace helped produce 4% revenue growth for us to $516 million for McGraw-Hill Education in the fourth quarter. Revenue for the year declined by 6% to $2.3 billion. Tight expense controls, lower prepublication amortization, lower reserve requirements and reduced selling and marketing expenses were all factors in McGraw-Hill Education's 2011 performance. The growth of digital products and services fundamentally changed in Higher Education and Professional markets. In U.S. Higher Education, our sales of digital products and services grew by more than 40% and enabled us to gain share in 2011. Digital sales now account for about 20% of our Higher Education revenue. Homework management products for students are key to this rapid growth. In professional markets, we are also experiencing strong double-digit growth for eBooks and for subscriptions to online professional products. In 2011, nearly 30% of our revenue in professional markets came from eBooks, online subscriptions and apps for mobile devices. The digital integration of curricula, technology and distribution is creating significant new global growth opportunities for McGraw-Hill Education by providing new revenue streams, including more subscription-based businesses while lowering our cost. 
The digital evolution is moving more slowly in the elementary and high school market, but it is picking up speed. Last June, we became the first educational publisher to launch completely digital, cloud-based curriculums with our CINCH, that's C-I-N-C-H, learning programs for science and math. These programs are device-agnostic, accessible on any computer, tablet or mobile service, and as announced earlier this month, we are working with Apple to create enhanced interactive program specifically for the iPad. Five high school math and science titles are already available and we expect to double this number during the year. Our goal is to improve learning outcomes by making learning more accessible, personalized and engaging. These dynamics should help McGraw-Hill Education improve its results in 2012. 
The decline in school education reflects historically low funding for U.S. elementary and high school markets. Sales in the market in 2011 decreased by 9.4% to about $3.3 billion. According to the Association of American publishers, our performance was heavily influenced by a decision not to participate in several stated options due to the uncertainty over funding and to challenging comparisons in Texas and Florida, where large orders in 2010 did not repeat due to changes in subject categories being purchased. We will ramp up our participation in the new state adoption market in 2012 to 96%. That's an increase of 75% in 2011. But we expect another challenging year for el-hi publishing as the size of state new adoption markets will decline by an estimated 40%. 
So let's sum up. In 2011, we produced enormous change in a short period of time and recorded our second best results in our history. This year promises to be even more momentous as we prepare for the introduction of 2 separate companies. We see another challenging and volatile year in our markets, but I'm confident in the strength of our businesses and the leadership team that was tested in 2011. 
On a consolidated basis for the McGraw-Hill Companies, our baseline earnings per share outlook for 2012 is $3.25 to $3.35. Actual results will be significantly influenced by the timing of separation and the additional cost reduction actions that are still ahead of us, at $3.25 to $3.35 representing 12% to 15% over 2011. We will provide regular updates on our progress throughout the year. 
Now, at this point, let me turn it over to Jack Callahan, and he's going to give us a few more details on our financial performance. Jack?"
21719,145550361,212808,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. 2011 was certainly an active and productive year at the McGraw-Hill Companies. Let's start off with a review of fourth quarter segment operating performance. I want to provide additional detail to the summary Terry provided. McGraw-Hil",1748,"Thank you, Terry. 2011 was certainly an active and productive year at the McGraw-Hill Companies. Let's start off with a review of fourth quarter segment operating performance. I want to provide additional detail to the summary Terry provided. 
McGraw-Hill Education had an outstanding quarter, with revenue growing 4% or $20 million and expenses declining $37 million, yielding adjusted operating profit of $72 million, an increase year-on-year of $57 million. This step-up in performance was led by the Higher Education, Professional and International Group, with a revenue increase of 8% or $27 million in the quarter. This was partially offset by a modest decline at the School Education Group. Fourth quarter revenue growth was particularly strong in Higher Ed, aided by custom publishing and strong digital sales, with Higher Ed digital sales growing more than 40%. Additionally, Higher Ed and Professional both benefited from significant decline in returns. Expenses benefited from tight overall expense control, lower prepublication amortization, lower reserve requirements and lower selling and marketing expense. 
Turning now to McGraw-Hill Financial. The volatility on the global credit markets certainly had an impact on quarterly results. Revenue was essentially flat and adjusted operating profit declined 8%. Let's take a look at the fourth quarter results across McGraw-Hill Financial. Overall, a decline at Standard & Poor's ratings offset continued growth at the other lines of business. The global credit markets were down definitely in the fourth quarter. For example, the high-yield market globally was down by almost 2/3. As a result, S&P Ratings revenue declined 8%, driven by a 26% decline in transaction revenue. This resulted in a $49 million decline in adjusted operating profit. 
S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices had another strong quarter. Revenue grew 8% versus the toughest comps of the year and the lapping of TheMarkets.com acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter a year ago. Operating profit, driven in part by the continued leverage of increasing integration across these businesses, grew 29%. The Commodities and Commercial lines of business revenue also grew 8%, driven by continued momentum in Platts, aided by the acquisitions of BENTEK Energy and Steel Business Briefing Group. Commercial revenue declined modestly in the quarter, largely due to the construction business, although the introduction of new Digital Products has begun to mitigate the contraction. Overall, Commodities and Commercial adjusted operating profit grew 2% for the quarter. Margins were impacted a bit by the integration of the acquisitions and the timing of investments. 
Let's now review the drivers of consolidated profit growth both for the fourth quarter and the full year. Adjusted corporate expense was $54 million in the quarter, an increase of $7 million from the prior year, largely driven by increased professional fees and incentive compensation. For the full year, adjusted corporate expense increased $9 million or 5% to $173 million. 2011 adjusted corporate expense excludes $17 million in restructuring charges for a workforce reduction of approximately 120 positions as we begin to realign corporate costs. 2011 adjusted corporate expense also excludes $10 million for onetime separation-related expenses. 
The excellent results for McGraw-Hill Education drove an increase in the fourth quarter consolidated adjusted operating profit of 8%. For the full year, consolidated adjusted operating profit was $1.5 billion, up 5% from last year. Net interest expense was $18 million in Q4, a modest decline versus prior year. For the full year, net interest expense was $75 million, a decline of $7 million from the prior year. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 36.3% both for the fourth quarter and the full year, flat versus 2010. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $7 million in the fourth quarter and $23 million for the year. CRISIL represents the overwhelming majority of this number. Adjusted net income from continuing operations grew 10% in the fourth quarter to $184 million. Full year adjusted net income was $883 million, an increase of 6%. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter was $292.4 million, a $17.9 million decrease from the prior year and $11.3 million decrease from the third quarter. This decline is due to share repurchases which more than offset equity-related awards. The $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction that we entered into on December 7 had a minimal impact on the fourth quarter shares outstanding. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter grew 17% to $0.63. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $2.91, up 9% versus 2010. 
Let me spend a minute discussing several onetime items related to the Growth and Value Plan. We completed the sale of noncore Broadcasting Group to E.W. Scripps for $212 million in cash, providing a onetime pretax gain of $123 million. This is shown as part of discontinued operations. We also implemented wave 1 of targeted cost reductions by eliminating approximately 800 positions, including activities at education, corporate and shared services and selected businesses with McGraw-Hill Financial. We incurred $66 million in restructuring charges with these actions. Lastly, we incurred $10 million in onetime separations costs. These costs are professional fees tied directly to the work underway to separate the 2 businesses. Restructuring charges and onetime separation costs are both excluded from adjusted earnings. We anticipate additional restructuring and separation costs throughout 2012. 
Now let me turn to cash flow. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as GAAP cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends. A computation of free cash flow also excludes $48 million in taxes paid on the gain from the disposition of the Broadcasting Group. We generated cash flow of $1.1 billion before dividends. After dividends, free cash flow was $807 million versus $881 million in 2010. The modest decline was driven by challenging end-of-year working capital comparison. 
Turning now to capital allocation. We spent $1.7 billion on acquisitions and share repurchases in 2011, $200 million for acquisitions, $1.5 billion for share repurchases. The most notable acquisitions were BENTEK Energy and Steel Business Briefing Group. Both acquisitions added to Platts' growing platform, adding critical capability on our natural gas and iron ore markets. Share repurchases were $845 million in the fourth quarter, including $500 million through an accelerated share repurchase program. Excluding the accelerated share program, we spent $1 billion on share repurchases in 2011, acquiring 24.7 million shares at an average price of $40.48 per share. We have received a substantial majority of the shares underlying the accelerated share repurchase transaction. This transaction will be complete in early 2012. The corporation finished the year with 276 million basic shares outstanding. Fully diluted shares outstanding at December 31, 2011, were approximately 283 million. Adjusted for the estimated full impact of the accelerated share repurchase transaction, approximately 23 million shares remain under our existing share repurchase authorization. 
I'll now provide an update on separation. Focus on separation before the end of 2012 requires coordination of multiple complex work streams. Our cost reduction program involves disaggregating shared services in establishing 2 appropriately sized corporate centers. Wave 1 of the cost reductions are well underway based on Q4 restructuring and the benefit plan realignment. Additional waves of cost reduction are anticipated during 2012, targeting at least $100 million in cost reductions on a run rate basis by the end of the year. As I mentioned earlier, restructuring and onetime separation costs should be anticipated in 2012. 
Let me provide some additional color on our guidance for 2012. Our 2012 baseline guidance provided on a growing-concern basis. It includes the benefits of the wave 1 cost reduction program. It excludes the impact of additional restructuring and onetime separation costs. Our EPS guidance is not dependent on additional share repurchase. We will provide regular updates as new leadership teams are formed and implementation plans are finalized. 
More specifically, let me provide some details on our growth expectations for 2012. For McGraw-Hill Financial overall, we expect high single-digit revenue and adjusted operating profit growth. S&P Capital IQ and Indices, and Commodities and Commercial expected to continue to grow strongly, consistent with our expectations for McGraw-Hill Financial overall. Our current guidance for S&P Ratings is mid-single-digit growth. S&P Ratings will benefit from continued growth in nontransaction revenue. Transaction revenue will benefit from the pipeline of maturing global corporate debt that will need to be refinanced. The volatility in the capital markets makes quarterly timing difficult to project. As Terry indicated earlier, first half comparisons for the Ratings business will be challenging. 
McGraw-Hill Education revenue and profit are expected to be relatively flat versus 2011 as a result of the challenging el-hi market. Restructuring savings from 2011 actions will offset market softness and enable reinvestment and digital capability, positioning the business well as the market recovers. Benefiting from strong growth at McGraw-Hill Financial augmented by the impact of share repurchases, earnings per share is expected to be $3.25 to $3.35, representing 12% to 15% growth versus 2011's adjusted earnings per share of $2.91. Obviously, actual results will be impacted by the timing of separation. 
Let me just add a number of other items. On corporate expense, benefiting from the restructuring actions in 2011, we expect a single-digit decline in corporate expense. Our effective tax rate and interest should be comparable to 2011. This guidance that we're providing today is based on a fully diluted weighted shares outstanding of approximately 284 million, which includes the completion of the accelerated share repurchase transaction, as well as the impact of equity-related awards. 2012 cash flow is expected to be approximately $750 million after dividends despite modest increases in reinvestment. Capital expenditures are projected to be $125 million to $150 million versus the $119 million in 2011. And prepublication investment is projected to be $160 million to $190 million versus the $158 million in 2011. 
As we prepare for the separation of McGraw-Hill Financial and Education business in 2012, we are extremely well capitalized, with cash and short-term investments at the end of the year of approximately $973 million. Cash and short-term investments decreased $575 million from December 31, 2010, largely due to acquisitions and share repurchase. Gross debt was comprised of approximately $1.2 billion unsecured senior notes. No commercial paper is outstanding. 
So in closing, the McGraw-Hill Companies finished a strong 2011 despite challenges in some of our key markets. We anticipate continued growth into 2012. And overall, 2012 promises to be a momentous year as we prepare for the introduction of 2 stand-alone companies, each with industry-leading positions. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Terry"

And so as we get into those and breaking those down, we'll see. And I think that going into this Growth and Value Plan saying at least $100 million is the right thing. As we get through the work streams, in terms of the separation, we'll see what's what on that 1. We get a lot of questions. Could it be $150 million? Could it be even a higher and all those kinds of things. We're going to do whatever it takes to be able to get the right cost structure so that from a value standpoint, we're getting the recognition for that.

And I would say as that starts to pick up and we hope for some more recovery, not just the asset-backed area, but as we see probably more on the commercial mortgage-backed market a little bit, I think residential mortgage-backed is going to stay softer for a while. That would improve a little bit. But on the other areas, we're in really good shape. As you asked on 2012 and the start of the year, again, remembering that the first half of last year was so strong and the second half was weaker. We're starting on a weaker demand pipeline at this point. Obviously, the refinancings and some of the infrastructure financings that are going on are going to have some pickup in all of that. We'll have to see as the year starts to unfold. But I think that from an activity level overall, the market activity is little softer getting started. Longer-term targets on margins really are going to be influenced more by the cost basis. Increasingly, as some of the legal and regulatory cost issues subside, I think that we will definitely see margin improvement on that part. But we're very pleased with the margin levels that we're at now year but we just think that with some of the expense issues starting to subside, that'll give us some benefit."

But every effort is being made to speed that along, but clearly, in the second half of 2012. And in terms of share repurchases, well, yes, we did $1.5 billion in 2011 and we're still completing a little bit more of the accelerated share repurchase of the $500 million. We have a little more to go on that. We have 23 million shares authorized left in the current authorization, and then we'll be watching market activity levels and the like. You know we're very strong on share repurchase and believe in it. And therefore, we're just going to complete the $500 million accelerated portion and then we'll gauge market conditions early on in the year and we'll make an assessment on that, but we're very favorable to it."

We thank everyone in our global audience for joining us this morning at The McGraw-Hill Companies' Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Call. I'm Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for The McGraw-Hill Companies. 
This morning, we issued a news release with our fourth quarter results. We trust you've all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of it and the financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mcgraw-hill.com. Once again, that is www.mcgraw-hill.com. 
In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we are providing adjusted revenue and free cash flow information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparison of the company's operating performance between periods and to view the company's business from the same perspective as management's. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the differences between the non-GAAP measures and comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The results we are reporting also reflect the reclassification of the Broadcasting Group as a discontinued operation following the signing of a definitive agreement in October 2011 to sell this business to E.W. Scripps. 
In today's news release and on the conference call, we are introducing new names for some operations to reflect changes being created by our Growth and Value Plan. In each case, more information about the new entity is being provided to investors. Under the separation plan, the newly named McGraw-Hill Financial company includes 5 lines of business. They are S&P Ratings, S&P Capital IQ, S&P Indices and Commodities and Commercial Operations. The segment previously named McGraw-Hill Financial now becomes S&P Capital/S&P Indices. We are providing revenue for both S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices. And over time, additional financial information will be provided on these operations. Information & Media becomes Commodities and Commercial. We are providing revenue for both Commodities and Commercial operations and, over time, more information will be provided about them as well. 
Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities and Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. In this regard, we direct listeners to the cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Patti Rockenwagner in our New York office at area code (212) 512-3533 subsequent to this call. That's (212) 512-3533. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Harold McGraw III, Chairman, President and CEO of The McGraw-Hill Companies. Terry?"

With me today, besides Don, is Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. 
And this morning, I will briefly review our results for the fourth quarter and the full year, and Jack will provide some additional detail. We're going to discuss the 2011, and 2011 was a milestone year for The McGraw-Hill Companies. I will provide an overview of the accomplishments of our businesses, both across the newly formed McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education, and then we'll take a look into 2012, which promises to be one of the most momentous periods in our 24-year -- 124-year history of the company. As always, after our prepared remarks, we will be pleased to answer any questions that you may have about The McGraw-Hill Companies. 
All right. In the fourth quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 17% year-over-year to $0.63. That includes $66 million in restructuring charges for severance related to a workforce reduction of approximately 800 positions and $10 million for onetime separation expenses necessary to implement the Growth and Value Plan. Revenue was up 2% and adjusted operating profit grew 8% as results across the portfolio were mixed. Looking at the year in its entirety, 2011 was the second best year in our history for revenue, operating profit and earnings per share. Only 2007 topped our performance in 2011. Revenue increased by 3% to $6.2 billion. On an adjusted basis, 2011 net income from continuing operations grew by 6% to $883 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 9% to $2.91. 
Let me spend a few minutes reflecting on this past year. 2011 was, beyond a doubt, a landmark year for The McGraw-Hill Companies. We produced a strong performance in the face of volatile market conditions and we made important decisions that will better position the company for the future and, we believe, increase returns to our shareholders. 
They were 9 milestones -- 9 major milestones during the year and they included: First, the announcement last September of a Growth and Value Plan whose centerpiece is the creation of 2 strong public companies, McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education. 
Secondly, significant and rapid progress in realizing the promise of the Growth and Value Plan, including fourth quarter restructuring and realignment of our benefit plans. 
Third was the targeting of at least $100 million in cost reductions. 
Fourth was the divestiture of the Broadcasting Group at a very attractive price. 
Fifth was the expansion of the core Commodities franchise with a strategic acquisition of 2 new companies in natural gas and steel. 
Sixth was the partnership with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the CME, to drive future growth of S&P Indices. 
Seventh was the successful combination in 2011 of S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices in a new segment that leverages resources, creates scale, produces solid growth and will be a source of new growth opportunities in financial markets. 
Eighth is the rapid growth of digital products and services that are transforming the education market and creating enormous new opportunities for McGraw-Hill Education. 
And finally, ninth, was $1.5 billion of share repurchases in 2011. 
We are moving quickly to unlock the value inherent in our Growth and Value Plan. Jack Callahan, our CFO, will provide more detail in just a moment on the restructuring to date, but we have already taken significant actions to create 2 efficiently sized corporate structures and separate shared services. 
We have established and staffed a Program Management Office, PMO, with 17 work streams. It is a massive global effort. Teams are focusing on growth opportunities, transaction management and cost reductions across the enterprise, including business support services and information technology. They are identifying growth synergies and scalable capabilities. We are using the most seasoned and experienced staffers to help us start realizing the benefits of all this work later this year. It is another reason why we're more confident than ever that at least $100 million in cost savings will be realized. 
As part of the Growth and Value Plan, we sought opportunities to monetize assets that do not fit with our strategic thrust. That is why we sold our Broadcasting Group to E.W. Scripps at the end of 2011. We generated excellent value for this asset, $212 million in cash and a pretax gain of $123 million. We also want to make strategic investments in areas that, we believe, will drive future growth. A common theme is our creation of valuable benchmarks for participants in capital, commercial and commodity markets that become deeply embedded in the workflow of our customers. There are a few better examples than Platts and its role in global oil markets. And with new growth opportunities in the trading of gas, steel and iron ore, we expanded the Platts platform by acquiring BENTEK Energy and Steel Business Briefing in 2011. And in November, we announced another important strategic milestone for our Growth and Value Plan, and that was the joint venture partnership with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange that brings together S&P Indices with Dow Jones Indexes once the deal is closed. The new venture provides S&P Indices with a more diversified and enhanced revenue stream. And instead of paying S&P Indices a fixed fee per trade, the CME will pay a share of the profits that it makes on trading and clearing of equity-based futures, swaps and options on the futures. The proposed joint venture is currently undergoing review by the Department of Justice. Subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions, we expect the joint venture to close by the end of the second quarter. 
In the midst of all this activity, we continue to return wealth to shareholders through the payment of dividends and an active share repurchase program. We completed $1 billion in share repurchases over the course of 2011. And late in the year, we initiated an accelerated $500 million repurchase transaction. That adds up to $1.5 billion for the year, including $845 million in the fourth quarter. 
As you can see, we covered a lot of ground in a short period, so we can create later this year 2 independent public companies that, as stand-alones, will increase their respective growth prospects and deliver shareholder value. 
In recent months, the Board of Directors of The McGraw-Hill Companies has been engaged in a number of important initiatives as part of this Growth and Value Plan and has been taking into consideration constructive input for major shareholders, including JANA Partners, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan among others. The company is committed to continue working to deliver value to all shareholders by continually evaluating opportunities to improve its corporate structure and portfolio of businesses, aggressively pursuing additional cost reduction initiatives, accelerating growth and returning substantial value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Now I want to discuss the performance of McGraw-Hill Financial in a little bit more depth. A highlight of 2011 is the demonstrated ability of the operating company, that we will call McGraw-Hill Financial, to navigate successfully through the volatility that characterized capital markets for most of the year and still deliver a solid performance. 
Revenue for the recently named McGraw-Hill Financial increased 9%, and adjusted operating profits improved by 7% in 2011. A growth driver is the operation we now call S&P Capital IQ/S&P Indices. We have succeeded in creating a scalable organization with a unique integrated offering for global financial markets. In 2011, it proved to be a resilient revenue and earnings generator and we expect another good year in 2012. Incremental value is being created by leveraging scale, improving the vertical operations and creating horizontal solutions. S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices, which was formerly known as McGraw-Hill Financial segment, grew its top line at a double-digit rate in 2011. Revenue was up 14% for the year and grew by 11%, excluding the acquisitions of TheMarkets.com. The operating margin expanded to 30%, up from 26.5% in 2010. 
Subscriptions account for 73% of the total revenue and grew by 13% in 2011, which is a good sign for performance in 2012. One of the crown jewels is S&P Indices which produced revenue of $323 million in 2011, an 18% year-over-year increase. S&P Indices generates revenue from a variety of sources. There are fees based on asset under management in exchange-traded funds that are linked to S&P Indices. At year-end 2011, there were $314 billion in assets under management in exchange-traded funds based on S&P Indices, and that's a year-over-year increase up 4.5%. There are royalties based on the trading volume of derivative contacts -- contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Australian Securities Exchange and the Montréal Exchange. In the fourth quarter, the average yearly volume of more than 3.7 million contracts for the major exchange-traded derivatives represented a 26% year-over-year increase and we're paid every time a contract is trading. 
There are also fees for over-the-counter derivatives and retail-structured products. And finally, there are data subscriptions for our information and research. 
Revenue for S&P Capital IQ, which includes the Integrated Desktop Solutions, Enterprise Solutions and Research & Analytics, increased by 13% in 2011 compared to 2010. Capital IQ, the Global Credit Portal and the Global Data Solutions all grew in 2011. Capital IQ gained share and increased its number of clients to more than 3,800, and that's a 14% year-over-year increase. 
Let me move over to Standard & Poor's Ratings. And at Standard & Poor's Ratings, despite lackluster new-issue dollar volume in the closing months of 2011, for the most part, in the face of the European debt crisis and concerns over an economic downturn, we still produced a 4% increase in revenue for the year. Indeed, the first half of 2011 was quite strong with revenue growth of 14%. But revenue did tail off in the second half, declining by 5%. Excluding fourth quarter restructuring charges, operating profit in 2011 declined by 4% to $728 million with an operating margin of 41%. Once again, non-transaction revenue proved its durability, growing by 8% in 2011 to $1.1 billion and accounting for 63% of Standard & Poor's Ratings' total revenue. Non-transaction revenue includes annual contracts, surveillance fees and a royalty from S&P Capital IQ/S&P Indices to distribute the content. But the growth of non-transaction revenue is partially offset by a 2% decline in transaction revenue in 2011. We expect non-transaction revenue to grow again in 2012, and transaction revenue faces some challenging comparisons after a very, very strong first half in 2011. 
We note that regulatory costs for our QCCR program came in essentially on target in 2011 and we're expected to increase just slightly this year for 2012. 
Looking forward, we remain encouraged by the longer-term outlook for the bond market. There's a huge pipeline of maturing global corporate debt that will need to be refinanced over the next several years. In Europe, increasing bank capital requirements will continue to shift corporate financing from bank loans to the public debt markets. Recovery of structured finance markets remains problematic. Most activity in residential mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities depends on the recovery of the residential and commercial real estate market, but we do expect a pickup in auto and credit card issuance to lead the improvement in the asset-backed securities market in both in the United States and in Europe. 
We do anticipate continued volatility in 2012, but we remain optimistic about the growth potential longer-term. We continue to make progress in regulatory and legal matters. In Europe, there is mounting criticism on some of the features of CRA 3. Now that's the European Commission's latest proposal for regulating rating agencies. Significantly, the pushback is coming from market participants and the European Securities and Markets Authority or ESMA. A lot of criticism is focused on the issue of proposed mandatory rotation of coverage among rating agencies for certain periods. It's still early days in this latest round with the European Commission, but it is already clear that its new proposals are coming under significant criticism from a wide range of parties, but we're concerned about the potential for market disruption and obviously unintended consequences. 
Since our last report, the number of lawsuits that have been dismissed outright has grown to 24, and 10 have been voluntarily withdrawn. Seven dismissals by lower courts have been reaffirmed by higher courts. We will be appealing the latest court decision in the CalPERS case. We strongly disagree with the court's ruling earlier this month that CalPERS had made a sufficient showing to allow the case to proceed. There will be no pretrial discovery while the appeal is pending. And the process could take another 12 to 18 months. On January 23, we filed a motion for summary judgment in the Abu Dhabi case. Any decision on our motion is probably many months away. And as we said consistently from the very beginning and it is proving out, we continue to believe that the legal risk is low. 
Consistent with the Growth and Value Plan strategy and the divestiture of Broadcasting, we report results for Commodities and Commercial brands, which were formerly named in the Information & Media segment. Revenue for all of these brands grew by 10% in 2011, and excluding restructuring charges, operating profit was up 13% with an operating margin of 21%. These operations are increasingly digital and based on subscriptions. Total subscription revenue grew by 13% in 2011 and now accounts for 63% of the revenue. In Commodities, Platts completed another strong year by growing 22% to $419 million. Excluding the acquisition of BENTEK Energy and Steel Business Briefing, revenue was up 15% for 2011. Volatility in energy prices drives demand for Platts' proprietary content, including news, price assessments and analytics for trading decisions. Platts, obviously, is one of our gems. We have steadily built this business over the years, creating high value and double-digit growth. In fact, Platts has produced a compound annual growth rate since 1994 of 12% at 17 years with a compound annual growth rate of 12%. We like the outlook for this business. 
Revenue for Commercial, which includes J.D. Power, McGraw-Hill Construction and Aviation Week, grew by 2% in 2011 to $477 million. Continued strength in emerging markets, including China, recovery in the Western Europe and growth in the U.S. is increasing demand for automotive studies. New digital products like SpecShare, BuildShare and BidPro, will be key factors in the recovery of the McGraw-Hill Construction. More are on the way. 
We expect another year of growth in Commodities and Commercial markets in 2012. These highlights will begin to give you some indication of what we are planning overall for McGraw-Hill Financial. 
As this slide illustrates, we plan to report results for 5 lines of business. In today's earnings release, we provided tables recapping quarterly revenue for 2011 and 2010 for each of these 5 lines of business. As we move closer to separation, close our deal with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and realign our cost structure, we will provide greater transparency on the bottom line contribution from these 5 lines of businesses as well. 
Let me hold it there and let me move over to McGraw-Hill Education. In 2011, we have a tale of 2 markets and repositioning of Education for the digital world: Growth in Higher Education, Professional and International spurred by digital products and services and a decline in elementary-high school education. A strong finish in the U.S. higher education marketplace helped produce 4% revenue growth for us to $516 million for McGraw-Hill Education in the fourth quarter. Revenue for the year declined by 6% to $2.3 billion. Tight expense controls, lower prepublication amortization, lower reserve requirements and reduced selling and marketing expenses were all factors in McGraw-Hill Education's 2011 performance. The growth of digital products and services is fundamentally changing higher education and professional markets. In U.S. higher education, our sales of digital products and services grew by more than 40% and enabled us to gain share in 2011. Digital sales now account for about 20% of our Higher Education revenue. Homework management products for students are key to this rapid growth. 
In professional markets, we are also experiencing strong double-digit growth for eBooks and for subscriptions to online professional products. In 2011, nearly 30% of our revenue in professional markets came from eBooks, online subscriptions and apps for mobile devices. The digital integration of curricula, technology and distribution is creating significant new global growth opportunities for McGraw-Hill Education by providing new revenue streams, including more subscription-based businesses while lowering our costs. 
The digital evolution is moving more slowly in the elementary and high school market, but it is picking up speed. Last June, we became the first educational publisher to launch completely digital, cloud-based curriculums with our CINCH, that's C-I-N-C-H, CINCH Learning programs for science and math. These programs are device-agnostic, accessible on any computer, tablet or mobile service. And as announced earlier this month, we are working with Apple to create enhanced interactive program specifically for the iPad. Five high school math and science titles are already available, and we expect to double this number during the year. Our goal is to improve learning outcomes by making learning more accessible, personalized and engaging. These dynamics should help McGraw-Hill Education improve its results in 2012. 
The decline in school education reflects historically low funding for U.S. elementary and high school markets. Sales in the el-hi market in 2011 decreased by 9.4% to about $3.3 billion according to the Association of American publishers. Our performance was heavily influenced by a decision not to participate in several stated adoptions due to the uncertainty over funding and to challenging comparisons in Texas and Florida where large orders in 2010 did not repeat due to changes in subject categories being purchased. 
We will ramp up our participation in the new state adoption market in 2012 to 96%. That's an increase from 75% in 2011. But we expect another challenging year for el-hi publishing as the size of state new adoption markets will decline by an estimated 40%. 
So let's sum up. In 2011, we produced enormous change in a short period of time and recorded the second best results in our history. This year promises to be even more momentous as we prepare for the introduction of 2 separate companies. We see another challenging and volatile year in our markets, but I'm confident in the strength of our businesses and the leadership team that was tested in 2011. 
On a consolidated basis for the McGraw-Hill Companies, our baseline earnings per share outlook for 2012 is $3.25 to $3.35. Actual results will be significantly influenced by the timing of separation and the additional cost-reduction actions that are still ahead of us, at $3.25 to $3.35 representing 12% to 15% over 2011. We will provide regular updates on our progress throughout the year. 
Now, at this point, let me turn it over to Jack Callahan, and he's going to give us a few more details on our financial performance. Jack?"
21719,145550361,212953,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. 2011 was certainly an active and productive year at the McGraw-Hill Companies. Let's start off with a review of fourth quarter segment operating performance. I want to provide additional detail to the summary Terry provided. McGraw-Hil",1748,"Thank you, Terry. 2011 was certainly an active and productive year at the McGraw-Hill Companies. Let's start off with a review of fourth quarter segment operating performance. I want to provide additional detail to the summary Terry provided. 
McGraw-Hill Education had an outstanding quarter with revenue growing 4% or $20 million and expenses declining $37 million, yielding adjusted operating profit of $72 million, an increase year-on-year of $57 million. This step-up in performance was led by the Higher Education, Professional and International Group with a revenue increase of 8% or $27 million in the quarter. This was partially offset by a modest decline at the School Education Group. Fourth quarter revenue growth was particularly strong in Higher Ed, aided by custom publishing and strong digital sales with Higher Ed digital sales growing more than 40%. Additionally, Higher Ed and Professional both benefited from significant decline in returns. Expenses benefited from tight overall expense control, lower prepublication amortization, lower reserve requirements and lower selling and marketing expense. 
Turning now to McGraw-Hill Financial. The volatility on the global credit markets certainly had an impact on quarterly results. Revenue was essentially flat and adjusted operating profit declined 8%. 
Let's take a look at the fourth quarter results across McGraw-Hill Financial. Overall, a decline at Standard & Poor's Ratings offset continued growth at the other lines of business. The global credit markets were down significantly in the fourth quarter. For example, the high-yield market globally was down by almost 2/3. As a result, S&P Ratings revenue declined 8%, driven by a 26% decline in transaction revenue. This resulted in a $49 million decline in adjusted operating profit. 
S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices had another strong quarter. Revenue grew 8% versus the toughest comps of the year and the lapping of TheMarkets.com acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter a year ago. Operating profit, driven in part by the continued leverage of increasing integration across these businesses, grew 29%. The Commodities and Commercial lines of business revenue also grew 8%, driven by continued momentum in Platts, aided by the acquisitions of BENTEK Energy and Steel Business Briefing Group. Commercial revenue declined modestly in the quarter, largely due to the construction business although the introduction of new digital products has begun to mitigate the contraction. Overall, Commodities and Commercial adjusted operating profit grew 2% for the quarter. Margins were impacted a bit by the integration of the acquisitions and the timing of investments. 
Let's now review the drivers of consolidated profit growth both for the fourth quarter and the full year. Adjusted corporate expense was $54 million in the quarter, an increase of $7 million from the prior year, largely driven by increased professional fees and incentive compensation. For the full year, adjusted corporate expense increased $9 million or 5% to $173 million. 2011 adjusted corporate expense excludes $17 million in restructuring charges for a workforce reduction of approximately 120 positions as we begin to realign corporate costs. 2011 adjusted corporate expense also excludes $10 million for onetime separation-related expenses. 
The excellent results for McGraw-Hill Education drove an increase in the fourth quarter consolidated adjusted operating profit of 8%. For the full year, consolidated adjusted operating profit was $1.5 billion, up 5% from last year. Net interest expense was $18 million in Q4, a modest decline versus prior year. For the full year, net interest expense was $75 million, a decline of $7 million from the prior year. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 36.3% both for the fourth quarter and the full year, flat versus 2010. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $7 million in the fourth quarter and $23 million for the year. CRISIL represents the overwhelming majority of this number. Adjusted net income from continuing operations grew 10% in the fourth quarter to $184 million. Full year adjusted net income was $883 million, an increase of 6%. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter was $292.4 million, a $17.9 million decrease from the prior year and $11.3 million decrease from the third quarter. This decline is due to share repurchases, which more than offset equity-related awards. The $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction that we entered into on December 7 had a minimal impact on the fourth quarter shares outstanding. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter grew 17% to $0.63. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $2.91, up 9% versus 2010. 
Let me spend a minute discussing several onetime items related to the Growth and Value Plan. We completed the sale of non-core Broadcasting Group to E.W. Scripps for $212 million in cash, providing a onetime pretax gain of $123 million. This is shown as part of discontinued operations. We also implemented Wave 1 of targeted cost reductions by eliminating approximately 800 positions, including activities at Education, corporate and shared services and selected businesses with the McGraw-Hill Financial. We incurred $66 million in restructuring charges with these actions. Lastly, we incurred $10 million in onetime separations costs. These costs are professional fees tied directly to the work underway to separate the 2 businesses. Restructuring charges and onetime separation costs are both excluded from adjusted earnings. We anticipate additional restructuring and separation costs throughout 2012. 
Now let me turn to cash flow. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as GAAP cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends. A computation of free cash flow also excludes $48 million in taxes paid on the gain from the disposition of the Broadcasting Group. We generated cash flow of $1.1 billion before dividends. After dividends, free cash flow was $807 million versus $881 million in 2010. The modest decline was driven by challenging end-of-year working capital comparison. 
Turning now to capital allocation. We spent $1.7 billion on acquisitions and share repurchases in 2011, $200 million for acquisitions, $1.5 billion for share repurchases. The most notable acquisitions were BENTEK Energy and Steel Business Briefing Group. Both acquisitions added to Platts' growing platform, adding critical capability in the natural gas and iron ore markets. Share repurchases were $845 million in the fourth quarter, including $500 million through an accelerated share repurchase program. Excluding the accelerated share program, we spent $1 billion on share repurchases in 2011, acquiring 24.7 million shares at an average price of $40.48 per share. We have received a substantial majority of the shares underlying the accelerated share repurchase transaction. This transaction will be complete in early 2012. The corporation finished the year with 276 million basic shares outstanding. Fully diluted shares outstanding at December 31, 2011, were approximately 283 million. Adjusted for the estimated full impact of the accelerated share repurchase transaction, approximately 23 million shares remain under our existing share repurchase authorization. 
I'll now provide an update on separation. Focus on separation before the end of 2012 requires coordination of multiple complex work streams. Our cost-reduction program involves disaggregating shared services in establishing 2 appropriately sized corporate centers. Wave 1 of the cost reductions are well underway based on Q4 restructuring and the benefit plan realignment. Additional waves of cost reduction are anticipated during 2012, targeting at least $100 million in cost reductions on a run rate basis by the end of the year. As I mentioned earlier, restructuring and onetime separation costs should be anticipated in 2012. 
Let me provide some additional color on our guidance for 2012. Our 2012 baseline guidance provided on a growing-concern basis. It includes the benefits of the Wave 1 cost-reduction program. It excludes the impact of additional restructuring and onetime separation costs. Our EPS guidance is not dependent on additional share repurchase. We will provide regular updates as new leadership teams are formed and implementation plans are finalized. 
More specifically, let me provide some details on our growth expectations for 2012. 
For McGraw-Hill Financial overall, we expect high single-digit revenue and adjusted operating profit growth. S&P Capital IQ and Indices and Commodities and Commercial are expected to continue to grow strongly, consistent with our expectations for McGraw-Hill Financial overall. Our current guidance for S&P Ratings is mid-single-digit growth. S&P Ratings will benefit from continued growth in non-transaction revenue. Transaction revenue will benefit from the pipeline of maturing global corporate debt that will need to be refinanced, though volatility in the capital markets makes quarterly timing difficult to project. As Terry indicated earlier, first half comparisons for the Ratings business will be challenging. 
McGraw-Hill Education revenue and profit are expected to be relatively flat versus 2011 as a result of the challenging el-hi market. Restructuring savings from 2011 actions will offset market softness and enable reinvestment in digital capability, positioning the business well as the market recovers. 
Benefiting from strong growth at McGraw-Hill Financial, augmented by the impact of share repurchases, earnings per share is expected to be $3.25 to $3.35, representing 12% to 15% growth versus 2011's adjusted earnings per share of $2.91. Obviously, actual results will be impacted by the timing of separation. 
Let me just add a number of other items. On corporate expense, benefiting from the restructuring actions in 2011, we expect a single-digit decline in corporate expense. Our effective tax rate and interest should be comparable to 2011. This guidance that we're providing today is based on a fully diluted weighted shares outstanding of approximately 284 million, which includes the completion of the accelerated share repurchase transaction as well as the impact of equity-related awards. 2012 cash flow is expected to be approximately $750 million after dividends despite modest increases in reinvestment. Capital expenditures are projected to be $125 million to $150 million versus the $119 million in 2011. And prepublication investment is projected to be $160 million to $190 million versus the $158 million in 2011. 
As we prepare for the separation of McGraw-Hill Financial and Education business in 2012, we are extremely well capitalized with cash and short-term investments at the end of the year of approximately $973 million. Cash and short-term investments decreased $575 million from December 31, 2010, largely due to acquisitions and share repurchase. Gross debt was comprised of approximately $1.2 billion unsecured senior notes. No commercial paper is outstanding. 
So in closing, the McGraw-Hill Companies finished a strong 2011 despite challenges in some of our key markets. We anticipate continued growth into 2012. And overall, 2012 promises to be a momentous year as we prepare for the introduction of 2 stand-alone companies, each with industry-leading positions. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Terry."

As we get through the work streams in terms of the separation, we'll see what's what on that one. We get a lot of questions. Could it be $150 million, could it be even a higher and all those kinds of things. We're going to do whatever it takes to be able to get the right cost structure so that from a value standpoint, we're getting the recognition for that.

That would improve a little bit. But on the other areas, we're in really good shape. As you asked on 2012 and the start of the year, again remembering that the first half of last year was so strong and the second half was weaker, we're starting on a weaker demand pipeline at this point. Obviously, the refinancings and some of the infrastructure financings that are going on are going to have some pickup in all of that. We'll have to see as the year starts to unfold. But I think that from an activity level overall, the market activity is a little softer getting started. Longer-term targets on margins really are going to be influenced more by the cost basis. Increasingly, as some of the legal and regulatory cost issues subside, I think that we will definitely see margin improvement on that part.

Again, the S&P Indices focus on the institutional investor market and the Dow Jones more retail-oriented, so you've got a wonderful platform in a combination there. And there's endless permutations to the exchange-traded funds that you can develop. And therefore, we're benefiting from that kind of growth and that's why I think that, from an expense standpoint, it's pretty modest and therefore you can expect further growth."

So our sense is the pipeline is quite good. And then whenever capital markets appear to open, there seems to be a pretty good flood of interest into the market. So what makes it challenging looking forward is exactly when it's going to happen. I mean if you look at 2011, first half of the year was actually quite good, back half really challenging. So that's why we've kind of landed because we've gone back and forth on sort of that mid-single digit, pretty much in line with what we saw this year.

Clearly, we're talking 2012 and we're going to do everything we can to accelerate this as best we can. As Jack was talking about, looking at early April for the Form 10, once we get those notions completed, then it's execution of the cost structure. So it will be in the second half of 2012. But every effort is being made to speed that along, but clearly in the second half of 2012. And in terms of share repurchases, well, yes, we did $1.5 billion in 2011 and we're still completing a little bit more of the accelerated share repurchase of the $500 million. We have a little left to go on that. We have 23 million shares authorized left in the current authorization and then we'll be watching market activity levels and the like. You know we're very strong on share repurchase and believe in it. And therefore, we're just going to complete the $500 million accelerated portion and then we'll gauge market conditions early on in the year and we'll make an assessment on that.

This morning, we issued a news release with our fourth quarter results. We trust you've all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of it and for the financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mcgraw-hill.com. Once again, that is www.mcgraw-hill.com. 
In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we are providing adjusted revenue and free cash flow information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparison of the company's operating performance between periods and to view the company's business from the same perspective as management's. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the differences between the non-GAAP measures and comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The results we are reporting also reflect the reclassification of the Broadcasting Group as a discontinued operation following the signing of a definitive agreement in October 2011 to sell this business to E.W. Scripps. 
In today's news release and on the conference call, we are introducing new names for some operations to reflect changes being created by our Growth and Value Plan. In each case, more information about the new entity is being provided to investors. Under the separation plan, the newly named McGraw-Hill Financial company includes 5 lines of business. They are S&P Ratings, S&P Capital IQ, S&P Indices and Commodities and Commercial Operations. The segment previously named McGraw-Hill Financial now becomes S&P Capital/S&P Indices. We are providing revenue for both S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices. And over time, additional financial information will be provided on these operations. Information & Media becomes Commodities and Commercial. We are providing revenue for both Commodities and Commercial operations and, over time, more information will be provided about them as well.

And this morning, I will",3197,"Okay, thank you very much, Don, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to our conference call today on the fourth quarter and on the full year results. With me today, besides Don, is Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. 
And this morning, I will briefly review our results for the fourth quarter and the full year, and Jack will provide some additional detail. We're going to discuss the 2011, and 2011 was a milestone year for The McGraw-Hill Companies. I will provide an overview of the accomplishments of our businesses, both across the newly formed McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education, and then we'll take a look into 2012, which promises to be one of the most momentous periods in our 24-year -- 124-year history of the company. As always, after our prepared remarks, we will be pleased to answer any questions that you may have about The McGraw-Hill Companies. 
All right. In the fourth quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 17% year-over-year to $0.63. That includes $66 million in restructuring charges for severance related to a workforce reduction of approximately 800 positions and $10 million for onetime separation expenses necessary to implement the Growth and Value Plan. Revenue was up 2% and adjusted operating profit grew 8% as results across the portfolio were mixed. Looking at the year in its entirety, 2011 was the second best year in our history for revenue, operating profit and earnings per share. Only 2007 topped our performance in 2011. Revenue increased by 3% to $6.2 billion. On an adjusted basis, 2011 net income from continuing operations grew by 6% to $883 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 9% to $2.91. 
Let me spend a few minutes reflecting on this past year. 2011 was, beyond a doubt, a landmark year for The McGraw-Hill Companies. We produced a strong performance in the face of volatile market conditions and we made important decisions that will better position the company for the future and, we believe, increase returns to our shareholders. 
There were 9 milestones -- 9 major milestones during the year and they included: First, the announcement last September of a Growth and Value Plan whose centerpiece is the creation of 2 strong public companies, McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education. 
Secondly, significant and rapid progress in realizing the promise of the Growth and Value Plan, including fourth quarter restructuring and realignment of our benefit plans. 
Third was the targeting of at least $100 million in cost reductions. 
Fourth was the divestiture of the Broadcasting Group at a very attractive price. 
Fifth was the expansion of the core Commodities franchise with a strategic acquisition of 2 new companies in natural gas and steel. 
Sixth was the partnership with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the CME, to drive future growth of S&P Indices. 
Seventh was the successful combination in 2011 of S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices in a new segment that leverages resources, creates scale, produces solid growth and will be a source of new growth opportunity in financial markets. 
Eighth is the rapid growth of digital products and services that are transforming the education market and creating enormous new opportunities for McGraw-Hill Education. 
And finally, ninth, was $1.5 billion of share repurchases in 2011. 
We are moving quickly to unlock the value inherent in our Growth and Value Plan. Jack Callahan, our CFO, will provide more detail in just a moment on the restructuring to date, but we have already taken significant actions to create 2 efficiently sized corporate structures and separate shared services. 
We have established and staffed a Program Management Office, PMO, with 17 work streams. It is a massive global effort. Teams are focusing on growth opportunities, transaction management and cost reductions across the enterprise, including business support services and information technology. They are identifying growth synergies and scalable capabilities. We are using the most seasoned and experienced staffers to help us start realizing the benefits of all this work later this year. It is another reason why we're more confident than ever that at least $100 million in cost savings will be realized. 
As part of the Growth and Value Plan, we sought opportunities to monetize assets that do not fit with our strategic thrust. That is why we sold our Broadcasting Group to E.W. Scripps at the end of 2011. We generated excellent value for this asset, $212 million in cash and a pretax gain of $123 million. We also want to make strategic investments in areas that we believe will drive future growth. A common theme is our creation of valuable benchmarks for participants in capital, commercial and commodity markets that become deeply embedded in the workflow of our customers. There are few better examples than Platts and its role in global oil markets. And with new growth opportunities in the trading of gas, steel and iron ore, we expanded the Platts platform by acquiring BENTEK Energy and Steel Business Briefing in 2011. And in November, we announced another important strategic milestone for our Growth and Value Plan, and that was the joint venture partnership with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange that brings together S&P Indices with Dow Jones Indexes once the deal is closed. The new venture provides S&P Indices with a more diversified and enhanced revenue stream. And instead of paying S&P Indices a fixed fee per trade, the CME will pay a share of the profits that it makes on trading and clearing of equity-based futures, swaps and options on the futures. The proposed joint venture is currently undergoing review by the Department of Justice. Subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions, we expect the joint venture to close by the end of the second quarter. 
In the midst of all this activity, we continue to return wealth to shareholders through the payment of dividends and an active share repurchase program. We completed $1 billion in share repurchases over the course of 2011. And late in the year, we initiated an accelerated $500 million repurchase transaction. That adds up to $1.5 billion for the year, including $845 million in the fourth quarter. 
As you can see, we covered a lot of ground in a short period, so we can create later this year 2 independent public companies that, as stand-alones, will increase their respective growth prospects and deliver shareholder value. 
In recent months, the Board of Directors of The McGraw-Hill Companies has been engaged in a number of important initiatives as part of this Growth and Value Plan and has been taking into consideration constructive input from major shareholders, including JANA Partners, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan among others. The company is committed to continue working to deliver value to all shareholders by continually evaluating opportunities to improve its corporate structure and portfolio of businesses, aggressively pursuing additional cost reduction initiatives, accelerating growth and returning substantial value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Now I want to discuss the performance of McGraw-Hill Financial in a little bit more depth. A highlight of 2011 is the demonstrated ability of the operating company, that we will call McGraw-Hill Financial, to navigate successfully through the volatility that characterized capital markets for most of the year and still deliver a solid performance. 
Revenue for the recently named McGraw-Hill Financial increased 9%, and adjusted operating profits improved by 7% in 2011. A growth driver is the operation we now call S&P Capital IQ/S&P Indices. We have succeeded in creating a scalable organization with a unique integrated offering for global financial markets. In 2011, it proved to be a resilient revenue and earnings generator and we expect another good year in 2012. Incremental value is being created by leveraging scale, improving the vertical operations and creating horizontal solutions. S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices, which was formerly known as McGraw-Hill Financial segment, grew its top line at a double-digit rate in 2011. Revenue was up 14% for the year and grew by 11%, excluding the acquisitions of TheMarkets.com. The operating margin expanded to 30%, up from 26.5% in 2010. 
Subscriptions account for 73% of the total revenue and grew by 13% in 2011, which is a good sign for performance in 2012. One of the crown jewels is S&P Indices which produced revenue of $323 million in 2011, an 18% year-over-year increase. S&P Indices generates revenue from a variety of sources. There are fees based on assets under management in exchange-traded funds that are linked to S&P Indices. At year-end 2011, there were $314 billion in assets under management in exchange-traded funds based on S&P Indices, and that's a year-over-year increase of 4.5%. There are royalties based on the trading volume of derivative contacts -- contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Australian Securities Exchange and the Montréal Exchange. In the fourth quarter, the average daily volume of more than 3.7 million contracts for the major exchange-traded derivatives represented a 26% year-over-year increase and we're paid every time a contract is traded. 
There are also fees for over-the-counter derivatives and retail-structured products. And finally, there are data subscriptions for our information and research. 
Revenue for S&P Capital IQ, which includes the Integrated Desktop Solutions, Enterprise Solutions and Research & Analytics, increased by 13% in 2011 compared to 2010. Capital IQ, the Global Credit Portal and the Global Data Solutions all grew in 2011. Capital IQ gained share and increased its number of clients to more than 3,800, and that's a 14% year-over-year increase. 
Let me move over to Standard & Poor's Ratings. And at Standard & Poor's Ratings, despite lackluster new-issue dollar volume in the closing months of 2011, for the most part, in the face of the European debt crisis and concerns over an economic downturn, we still produced a 4% increase in revenue for the year. Indeed, the first half of 2011 was quite strong with revenue growth of 14%. But revenue did tail off in the second half, declining by 5%. Excluding fourth quarter restructuring charges, operating profit in 2011 declined by 4% to $728 million with an operating margin of 41%. Once again, non-transaction revenue proved its durability, growing by 8% in 2011 to $1.1 billion and accounting for 63% of Standard & Poor Ratings' total revenue. Non-transaction revenue includes annual contracts, surveillance fees and a royalty from S&P Capital IQ/S&P Indices to distribute the content. But the growth of non-transaction revenue is partially offset by a 2% decline in transaction revenue in 2011. We expect non-transaction revenue to grow again in 2012, and transaction revenue faces some challenging comparisons after a very, very strong first half in 2011. 
We note that regulatory costs for our QCCR program came in essentially on target in 2011 and we're expected to increase just slightly this year for 2012. 
Looking forward, we remain encouraged by the longer-term outlook for the bond market. There is a huge pipeline of maturing global corporate debt that will need to be refinanced over the next several years. In Europe, increasing bank capital requirements will continue to shift corporate financing from bank loans to the public debt market. The recovery of structured finance markets remains problematic. Most activity in residential mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities depends on the recovery of the residential and commercial real estate market, but we do expect a pickup in auto and credit card issuance to lead to improvement in the asset-backed securities market in both in the United States and in Europe. 
We do anticipate continued volatility in 2012, but we remain optimistic about the growth potential longer-term. We continue to make progress in regulatory and legal matters. In Europe, there is mounting criticism of some of the features of CRA 3. Now that's the European Commission's latest proposal for regulating rating agencies. Significantly, the pushback is coming from market participants and the European Securities and Markets Authority or ESMA. A lot of criticism is focused on the issue of proposed mandatory rotation of coverage among rating agencies for certain periods. It is still early days in this latest round with the European Commission, but it is already clear that its new proposals are coming under significant criticism from a wide range of parties who are concerned about the potential for market disruption and obviously unintended consequences. 
Since our last report, the number of lawsuits that have been dismissed outright has grown to 24, and 10 have been voluntarily withdrawn. Seven dismissals by lower courts have been reaffirmed by higher courts. We will be appealing the latest court decision in the CalPERS case. We strongly disagree with the court's ruling earlier this month that CalPERS had made a sufficient showing to allow the case to proceed. There will be no pretrial discovery while the appeal is pending. And the process could take another 12 to 18 months. On January 23, we filed a motion for summary judgment in the Abu Dhabi case. Any decision on our motion is probably many months away. And as we said consistently from the very beginning and it is proving out, we continue to believe that the legal risk is low. 
Consistent with the Growth and Value Plan strategy and the divestiture of Broadcasting, we report results for Commodities and Commercial brands, which were formerly named in the Information & Media segment. Revenue for all of these brands grew by 10% in 2011, and excluding restructuring charges, operating profit was up 13% with an operating margin of 21%. These operations are increasingly digital and based on subscriptions. Total subscription revenue grew by 13% in 2011 and now accounts for 63% of the revenue. In Commodities, Platts completed another strong year by growing 22% to $419 million. Excluding the acquisition of BENTEK Energy and Steel Business Briefing, revenue was up 15% for 2011. Volatility in energy prices drives demand for Platts' proprietary content, including news, price assessments and analytics for trading decisions. Platts, obviously, is one of our gems. We have steadily built this business over the years, creating high value and double-digit growth. In fact, Platts has produced a compound annual growth rate since 1994 of 12%. That’s 17 years with a compound annual growth rate of 12%. We like the outlook for this business. 
Revenue for Commercial, which includes J.D. Power, McGraw-Hill Construction and Aviation Week, grew by 2% in 2011 to $477 million. Continued strength in emerging markets, including China, recovery in the Western Europe and growth in the U.S. is increasing demand for automotive studies. New digital products like SpecShare, BuildShare and BidPro, will be key factors in the recovery of the McGraw-Hill Construction. More are on the way. 
We expect another year of growth in Commodities and Commercial markets in 2012. These highlights will begin to give you some indication of what we are planning overall for McGraw-Hill Financial. 
As this slide illustrates, we plan to report results for 5 lines of business. In today's earnings release, we provided tables recapping quarterly revenue for 2011 and 2010 for each of these 5 lines of business. As we move closer to separation, close our deal with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and realign our cost structure, we will provide greater transparency on the bottom line contribution from these 5 lines of businesses as well. 
Let me hold it there and let me move over to McGraw-Hill Education. In 2011, we have a tale of 2 markets and repositioning of Education for the digital world; Growth in Higher Education, Professional and International spurred by digital products and services and a decline in elementary-high school education. A strong finish in the U.S. higher education marketplace helped produce 4% revenue growth for us to $516 million for McGraw-Hill Education in the fourth quarter. Revenue for the year declined by 6% to $2.3 billion. Tight expense controls, lower prepublication amortization, lower reserve requirements and reduced selling and marketing expenses were all factors in McGraw-Hill Education's 2011 performance. The growth of digital products and services is fundamentally changing the higher education and professional market. In U.S. higher education, our sales of digital products and services grew by more than 40% and enabled us to gain share in 2011. Digital sales now account for about 20% of our Higher Education revenue. Homework management products for students are key to this rapid growth. 
In professional markets, we are also experiencing strong double-digit growth for eBooks and for subscriptions to online professional products. In 2011, nearly 30% of our revenue in professional markets came from eBooks, online subscriptions and apps for mobile devices. The digital integration of curricula, technology and distribution is creating significant new global growth opportunities for McGraw-Hill Education by providing new revenue streams, including more subscription-based businesses while lowering our costs. 
The digital evolution is moving more slowly in the elementary and high school market, but it is picking up speed. Last June, we became the first educational publisher to launch completely digital, cloud-based curriculums with our CINCH, that's C-I-N-C-H, CINCH Learning programs for science and math. These programs are device-agnostic, accessible on any computer, tablet or mobile service. And as announced earlier this month, we are working with Apple to create enhanced interactive program specifically for the iPad. Five high school math and science titles are already available, and we expect to double this number during the year. Our goal is to improve learning outcomes by making learning more accessible, personalized and engaging. These dynamics should help McGraw-Hill Education improve its results in 2012. 
The decline in school education reflects historically low funding for U.S. elementary and high school markets. Sales in the el-hi market in 2011 decreased by 9.4% to about $3.3 billion according to the Association of American publishers. Our performance was heavily influenced by a decision not to participate in several state adoptions due to the uncertainty over funding and to challenging comparisons in Texas and Florida where large orders in 2010 did not repeat due to changes in subject categories being purchased. 
We will ramp up our participation in the new state adoption market in 2012 to 96%. That's an increase from 75% in 2011. But we expect another challenging year for el-hi publishing as the size of state new adoption markets will decline by an estimated 40%. 
So let's sum up. In 2011, we produced enormous change in a short period of time and recorded the second best results in our history. This year promises to be even more momentous as we prepare for the introduction of 2 separate companies. We see another challenging and volatile year in our markets, but I'm confident in the strength of our businesses and the leadership team that was tested in 2011. 
On a consolidated basis for the McGraw-Hill Companies, our baseline earnings per share outlook for 2012 is $3.25 to $3.35. Actual results will be significantly influenced by the timing of separation and the additional cost-reduction actions that are still ahead of us, but $3.25 to $3.35 representing 12% to 15% over 2011. We will provide regular updates on our progress throughout the year. 
Now, at this point, let me turn it over to Jack Callahan, and he's going to give us a few more details on our financial performance. Jack?"
21719,145550361,213044,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. 2011 was certainly an active and productive year at the McGraw-Hill Companies. Let's start off with a review of fourth quarter segment operating performance. I want to provide additional detail to the summary Terry provided. McGraw-Hil",1751,"Thank you, Terry. 2011 was certainly an active and productive year at the McGraw-Hill Companies. Let's start off with a review of fourth quarter segment operating performance. I want to provide additional detail to the summary Terry provided. 
McGraw-Hill Education had an outstanding quarter with revenue growing 4% or $20 million and expenses declining $37 million, yielding adjusted operating profit of $72 million, an increase year-on-year of $57 million. This step-up in performance was led by the Higher Education, Professional and International Group with a revenue increase of 8% or $27 million in the quarter. This was partially offset by a modest decline at the School Education Group. Fourth quarter revenue growth was particularly strong in Higher Ed, aided by custom publishing and strong digital sales with Higher Ed digital sales growing more than 40%. Additionally, Higher Ed and Professional both benefited from significant decline in returns. Expenses benefited from tight overall expense control, lower prepublication amortization, lower reserve requirements and lower selling and marketing expense. 
Turning now to McGraw-Hill Financial. The volatility on the global credit markets certainly had an impact on quarterly results. Revenue was essentially flat and adjusted operating profit declined 8%. 
Let's take a look at the fourth quarter results across McGraw-Hill Financial. Overall, a decline at Standard & Poor's Ratings offset continued growth at the other lines of business. The global credit markets were down significantly in the fourth quarter. For example, the high-yield market globally was down by almost 2/3. As a result, S&P Ratings revenue declined 8%, driven by a 26% decline in transaction revenue. This resulted in a $49 million decline in adjusted operating profit. 
S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices had another strong quarter. Revenue grew 8% versus the toughest comps of the year and the lapping of TheMarkets.com acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter a year ago. Operating profit, driven in part by the continuing leverage of increasing integration across these businesses, grew 29%. The Commodities and Commercial lines of business revenue also grew 8%, driven by continued momentum in Platts, aided by the acquisitions of BENTEK Energy and Steel Business Briefing Group. Commercial revenue declined modestly in the quarter, largely due to the construction business although the introduction of new digital products has begun to mitigate the contraction. Overall, Commodities and Commercial adjusted operating profit grew 2% for the quarter. Margins were impacted a bit by the integration of the acquisitions and the timing of investments. 
Let's now review the drivers of consolidated profit growth both for the fourth quarter and the full year. Adjusted corporate expense was $54 million in the quarter, an increase of $7 million from the prior year, largely driven by increased professional fees and incentive compensation. For the full year, adjusted corporate expense increased $9 million or 5% to $173 million. 2011 adjusted corporate expense excludes $17 million in restructuring charges for a workforce reduction of approximately 120 positions as we begin to realign corporate costs. 2011 adjusted corporate expense also excludes $10 million for onetime separation-related expenses. 
The excellent results for McGraw-Hill Education drove an increase in the fourth quarter consolidated adjusted operating profit of 8%. For the full year, consolidated adjusted operating profit was $1.5 billion, up 5% from last year. Net interest expense was $18 million in Q4, a modest decline versus prior year. For the full year, net interest expense was $75 million, a decline of $7 million from the prior year. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 36.3% both for the fourth quarter and the full year, flat versus 2010. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $7 million in the fourth quarter and $23 million for the year. CRISIL represents the overwhelming majority of this number. Adjusted net income from continuing operations grew 10% in the fourth quarter to $184 million. Full year adjusted net income was $883 million, an increase of 6%. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter was $292.4 million, a $17.9 million decrease from the prior year and $11.3 million decrease from the third quarter. This decline is due to share repurchases, which more than offset equity-related awards. The $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction that we entered into on December 7 had a minimal impact on the fourth quarter shares outstanding. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter grew 17% to $0.63. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $2.91, up 9% versus 2010. 
Let me spend a minute discussing several onetime items related to the Growth and Value Plan. We completed the sale of non-core Broadcasting Group to E.W. Scripps for $212 million in cash, providing a onetime pretax gain of $123 million. This is shown as part of discontinued operations. We also implemented Wave 1 of targeted cost reductions by eliminating approximately 800 positions, including activities at Education, corporate and shared services and selected businesses with the McGraw-Hill Financial. We incurred $66 million in restructuring charges with these actions. Lastly, we incurred $10 million in onetime separations costs. These costs are professional fees tied directly to the work underway to separate the 2 businesses. Restructuring charges and onetime separation costs are both excluded from adjusted earnings. We anticipate additional restructuring and separation costs throughout 2012. 
Now let me turn to cash flow. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as GAAP cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends. Our computation of free cash flow also excludes $48 million in taxes paid on the gain from a disposition of the Broadcasting Group. We generated cash flow of $1.1 billion before dividends. After dividends, free cash flow was $807 million versus $881 million in 2010. The modest decline was driven by challenging end-of-year working capital comparison. 
Turning now to capital allocation. We spent $1.7 billion on acquisitions and share repurchases in 2011, $200 million for acquisitions, $1.5 billion for share repurchases. The most notable acquisitions were BENTEK Energy and Steel Business Briefing Group. Both acquisitions added to Platts' growing platform, adding critical capability in the natural gas and iron ore markets. Share repurchases were $845 million in the fourth quarter, including $500 million through an accelerated share repurchase program. Excluding the accelerated share program, we spent $1 billion on share repurchases in 2011, acquiring 24.7 million shares at an average price of $40.48 per share. We have received a substantial majority of the shares underlying the accelerated share repurchase transaction. This transaction will be complete in early 2012. The corporation finished the year with 276 million basic shares outstanding. Fully diluted shares outstanding at December 31, 2011, were approximately 283 million. Adjusted for the estimated full impact of the accelerated share repurchase transaction, approximately 23 million shares remain under our existing share repurchase authorization. 
I'll now provide an update on separation. Focus on separation before the end of 2012 requires coordination of multiple complex work streams. Our cost-reduction program involves disaggregating shared services and establishing 2 appropriately sized corporate centers. Wave 1 of the cost reductions are well underway based on Q4 restructuring and the benefit plan realignment. Additional waves of cost reduction are anticipated during 2012, targeting at least $100 million in total cost reductions on a run rate basis by the end of the year. As I mentioned earlier, restructuring and onetime separation costs should be anticipated in 2012. 
Let me provide some additional color on our guidance for 2012. Our 2012 baseline guidance provided on a going-concern basis. It includes the benefits of the Wave 1 cost-reduction program. It excludes the impact of additional restructuring and onetime separation costs. Our EPS guidance is not dependent on additional share repurchase. We will provide regular updates as new leadership teams are formed and implementation plans are finalized. 
More specifically, let me provide some details on our growth expectations for 2012. 
For McGraw-Hill Financial overall, we expect high-single digit revenue and adjusted operating profit growth. S&P Capital IQ and Indices and Commodities and Commercial are expected to continue to grow strongly, consistent with our expectations for McGraw-Hill Financial overall. Our current guidance for S&P Ratings is mid-single digit growth. S&P Ratings will benefit from continued growth in non-transaction revenue. Transaction revenue will benefit from the pipeline of maturing global corporate debt that will need to be refinanced, though volatility in the capital markets makes quarterly timing difficult to project. As Terry indicated earlier, first half comparisons for the Ratings business will be challenging. 
McGraw-Hill Education revenue and profit are expected to be relatively flat versus 2011 as a result of the challenging el-hi market. Restructuring savings from 2011 actions will offset the market softness and enable reinvestment in digital capability, positioning the business well as the market recovers. 
Benefiting from strong growth at McGraw-Hill Financial, augmented by the impact of share repurchases, earnings per share is expected to be $3.25 to $3.35, representing 12% to 15% growth versus 2011's adjusted earnings per share of $2.91. Obviously, actual results will be impacted by the timing of separation. 
Let me just add a number of other items. On corporate expense, benefiting from the restructuring actions in 2011, we expect a single-digit decline in corporate expense. Our effective tax rate and interest should be comparable to 2011. This guidance that we're providing today is based on a fully diluted weighted shares outstanding of approximately 284 million, which includes the completion of the accelerated share repurchase transaction as well as the impact of equity-related awards. 2012 cash flow is expected to be approximately $750 million after dividends despite modest increases in reinvestment. Capital expenditures are projected to be $125 million to $150 million versus the $119 million in 2011. And prepublication investment is projected to be $160 million to $190 million versus the $158 million in 2011. 
As we prepare for the separation of McGraw-Hill Financial and Education business in 2012, we are extremely well capitalized with cash and short-term investments at the end of the year of approximately $973 million. Cash and short-term investments decreased $575 million from December 31, 2010, largely due to acquisitions and share repurchase. Gross debt was comprised of approximately $1.2 billion unsecured senior notes. No commercial paper is outstanding. 
So in closing, the McGraw-Hill Companies finished a strong 2011 despite challenges in some of our key markets. We anticipate continued growth into 2012. And overall, 2012 promises to be a momentous year as we prepare for the introduction of 2 stand-alone companies, each with industry-leading positions. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Terry."

As we get through the work streams in terms of the separation, we'll see what's what on that one. We get a lot of questions. Could it be $150 million, could it be even higher and all those kind of things.

But on the other areas, we're in really good shape. As you asked on 2012 and the start of the year, again remembering that the first half of last year was so strong and the second half was weaker, we're starting on a weaker demand pipeline at this point. Obviously, the refinancings and some of the infrastructure financings that are going on are going to have some pickup in all of that. We'll have to see as the year starts to unfold. But I think that from an activity level overall, the market activity is a little softer getting started. Longer-term targets on margins really are going to be influenced more by the cost basis. Increasingly, as some of the legal and regulatory cost issues subside, I think that we will definitely see margin improvement on that part. But we're very pleased with the margin levels that we're at now. But we just think that with some of the expense issues starting to subside that, that'll give us some benefit."

So we're going to be a part of it and we're going to be putting our comments in, but also you can expect a lot of market reaction. And everybody doesn't want to see the market wounded or unintended consequences associated with that. So I think it's very early on."

We thank everyone in our global audience for joining us this morning at The McGraw-Hill Companies' Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Call. I'm Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for The McGraw-Hill Companies. 
This morning, we issued a news release with our fourth quarter results. We trust you've all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of it and for the financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mcgraw-hill.com. Once again, that is www.mcgraw-hill.com. 
In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we are providing adjusted revenue and free cash flow information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparison of the company's operating performance between periods and to view the company's business from the same perspective as management's. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the differences between the non-GAAP measures and comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The results we are reporting also reflect the reclassification of the Broadcasting Group as a discontinued operation following the signing of a definitive agreement in October 2011 to sell this business to E.W. Scripps. 
In today's news release and on the conference call, we are introducing new names for some operations to reflect changes being created by our Growth and Value Plan. In each case, more information about the new entity is being provided to investors. Under the separation plan, the newly named McGraw-Hill Financial company includes 5 lines of business. They are S&P Ratings, S&P Capital IQ, S&P Indices and Commodities and Commercial Operations. The segment previously named McGraw-Hill Financial now becomes S&P Capital/S&P Indices. We are providing revenue for both S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices. And over time, additional financial information will be provided on these operations. Information & Media becomes Commodities and Commercial. We are providing revenue for both Commodities and Commercial operations and, over time, more information will be provided about them as well. 
Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities and Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. In this regard, we direct listeners to the cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Patti Rockenwagner in our New York office at area code (212) 512-3533 subsequent to this call. That's (212) 512-3533. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Harold McGraw III, Chairman, President and CEO of The McGraw-Hill Companies. Terry?"

With me today, besides Don, is Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. 
And this morning, I will briefly review our results for the fourth quarter and the full year, and Jack will provide some additional detail. We're going to discuss the 2011, and 2011 was a milestone year for The McGraw-Hill Companies. I will provide an overview of the accomplishments of our businesses, both across the newly formed McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education, and then we'll take a look into 2012, which promises to be one of the most momentous periods in our 24-year -- 124-year history of the company. As always, after our prepared remarks, we will be pleased to answer any questions that you may have about The McGraw-Hill Companies. 
All right. In the fourth quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 17% year-over-year to $0.63. That includes $66 million in restructuring charges for severance related to a workforce reduction of approximately 800 positions and $10 million for onetime separation expenses necessary to implement the Growth and Value Plan. Revenue was up 2% and adjusted operating profit grew 8% as results across the portfolio were mixed. Looking at the year in its entirety, 2011 was the second best year in our history for revenue, operating profit and earnings per share. Only 2007 topped our performance in 2011. Revenue increased by 3% to $6.2 billion. On an adjusted basis, 2011 net income from continuing operations grew by 6% to $883 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 9% to $2.91. 
Let me spend a few minutes reflecting on this past year. 2011 was, beyond a doubt, a landmark year for The McGraw-Hill Companies. We produced a strong performance in the face of volatile market conditions and we made important decisions that will better position the company for the future and, we believe, increase returns to our shareholders. 
There were 9 milestones -- 9 major milestones during the year and they included: First, the announcement last September of a Growth and Value Plan whose centerpiece is the creation of 2 strong public companies, McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education. 
Secondly, significant and rapid progress in realizing the promise of the Growth and Value Plan, including fourth quarter restructuring and realignment of our benefit plans. 
Third was the targeting of at least $100 million in cost reductions. 
Fourth was the divestiture of the Broadcasting Group at a very attractive price. 
Fifth was the expansion of the core Commodities franchise with a strategic acquisition of 2 new companies in natural gas and steel. 
Sixth was the partnership with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the CME, to drive future growth of S&P Indices. 
Seventh was the successful combination in 2011 of S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices in a new segment that leverages resources, creates scale, produces solid growth and will be a source of new growth opportunity in financial markets. 
Eighth is the rapid growth of digital products and services that are transforming the education market and creating enormous new opportunities for McGraw-Hill Education. 
And finally, ninth, was $1.5 billion of share repurchases in 2011. 
We are moving quickly to unlock the value inherent in our Growth and Value Plan. Jack Callahan, our CFO, will provide more detail in just a moment on the restructuring to date, but we have already taken significant actions to create 2 efficiently sized corporate structures and separate shared services. 
We have established and staffed a Program Management Office, PMO, with 17 work streams. It is a massive global effort. Teams are focusing on growth opportunities, transaction management and cost reductions across the enterprise, including business support services and information technology. They are identifying growth synergies and scalable capabilities. We are using the most seasoned and experienced staffers to help us start realizing the benefits of all this work later this year. It is another reason why we're more confident than ever that at least $100 million in cost savings will be realized. 
As part of the Growth and Value Plan, we sought opportunities to monetize assets that do not fit with our strategic thrust. That is why we sold our Broadcasting Group to E.W. Scripps at the end of 2011. We generated excellent value for this asset, $212 million in cash and a pretax gain of $123 million. We also want to make strategic investments in areas that we believe will drive future growth. A common theme is our creation of valuable benchmarks for participants in capital, commercial and commodity markets that become deeply embedded in the workflow of our customers. There are few better examples than Platts and its role in global oil markets. And with new growth opportunities in the trading of gas, steel and iron ore, we expanded the Platts platform by acquiring BENTEK Energy and Steel Business Briefing in 2011. And in November, we announced another important strategic milestone for our Growth and Value Plan, and that was the joint venture partnership with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange that brings together S&P Indices with Dow Jones Indexes once the deal is closed. The new venture provides S&P Indices with a more diversified and enhanced revenue stream. And instead of paying S&P Indices a fixed fee per trade, the CME will pay a share of the profits that it makes on trading and clearing of equity-based futures, swaps and options on the futures. The proposed joint venture is currently undergoing review by the Department of Justice. Subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions, we expect the joint venture to close by the end of the second quarter. 
In the midst of all this activity, we continue to return wealth to shareholders through the payment of dividends and an active share repurchase program. We completed $1 billion in share repurchases over the course of 2011. And late in the year, we initiated an accelerated $500 million repurchase transaction. That adds up to $1.5 billion for the year, including $845 million in the fourth quarter. 
As you can see, we covered a lot of ground in a short period, so we can create later this year 2 independent public companies that, as stand-alones, will increase their respective growth prospects and deliver shareholder value. 
In recent months, the Board of Directors of The McGraw-Hill Companies has been engaged in a number of important initiatives as part of this Growth and Value Plan and has been taking into consideration constructive input from major shareholders, including JANA Partners, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan among others. The company is committed to continue working to deliver value to all shareholders by continually evaluating opportunities to improve its corporate structure and portfolio of businesses, aggressively pursuing additional cost reduction initiatives, accelerating growth and returning substantial value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Now I want to discuss the performance of McGraw-Hill Financial in a little bit more depth. A highlight of 2011 is the demonstrated ability of the operating company, that we will call McGraw-Hill Financial, to navigate successfully through the volatility that characterized capital markets for most of the year and still deliver a solid performance. 
Revenue for the recently named McGraw-Hill Financial increased 9%, and adjusted operating profits improved by 7% in 2011. A growth driver is the operation we now call S&P Capital IQ/S&P Indices. We have succeeded in creating a scalable organization with a unique integrated offering for global financial markets. In 2011, it proved to be a resilient revenue and earnings generator and we expect another good year in 2012. Incremental value is being created by leveraging scale, improving the vertical operations and creating horizontal solutions. S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices, which was formerly known as McGraw-Hill Financial segment, grew its top line at a double-digit rate in 2011. Revenue was up 14% for the year and grew by 11%, excluding the acquisitions of TheMarkets.com. The operating margin expanded to 30%, up from 26.5% in 2010. 
Subscriptions account for 73% of the total revenue and grew by 13% in 2011, which is a good sign for performance in 2012. One of the crown jewels is S&P Indices which produced revenue of $323 million in 2011, an 18% year-over-year increase. S&P Indices generates revenue from a variety of sources. There are fees based on assets under management in exchange-traded funds that are linked to S&P Indices. At year-end 2011, there were $314 billion in assets under management in exchange-traded funds based on S&P Indices, and that's a year-over-year increase of 4.5%. There are royalties based on the trading volume of derivative contacts -- contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Australian Securities Exchange and the Montréal Exchange. In the fourth quarter, the average daily volume of more than 3.7 million contracts for the major exchange-traded derivatives represented a 26% year-over-year increase and we're paid every time a contract is traded. 
There are also fees for over-the-counter derivatives and retail-structured products. And finally, there are data subscriptions for our information and research. 
Revenue for S&P Capital IQ, which includes the Integrated Desktop Solutions, Enterprise Solutions and Research & Analytics, increased by 13% in 2011 compared to 2010. Capital IQ, the Global Credit Portal and the Global Data Solutions all grew in 2011. Capital IQ gained share and increased its number of clients to more than 3,800, and that's a 14% year-over-year increase. 
Let me move over to Standard & Poor's Ratings. And at Standard & Poor's Ratings, despite lackluster new-issue dollar volume in the closing months of 2011, for the most part, in the face of the European debt crisis and concerns over an economic downturn, we still produced a 4% increase in revenue for the year. Indeed, the first half of 2011 was quite strong with revenue growth of 14%. But revenue did tail off in the second half, declining by 5%. Excluding fourth quarter restructuring charges, operating profit in 2011 declined by 4% to $728 million with an operating margin of 41%. Once again, non-transaction revenue proved its durability, growing by 8% in 2011 to $1.1 billion and accounting for 63% of Standard & Poor Ratings' total revenue. Non-transaction revenue includes annual contracts, surveillance fees and a royalty from S&P Capital IQ/S&P Indices to distribute the content. But the growth of non-transaction revenue is partially offset by a 2% decline in transaction revenue in 2011. We expect non-transaction revenue to grow again in 2012, and transaction revenue faces some challenging comparisons after a very, very strong first half in 2011. 
We note that regulatory costs for our QCCR program came in essentially on target in 2011 and we're expected to increase just slightly this year for 2012. 
Looking forward, we remain encouraged by the longer-term outlook for the bond market. There is a huge pipeline of maturing global corporate debt that will need to be refinanced over the next several years. In Europe, increasing bank capital requirements will continue to shift corporate financing from bank loans to the public debt market. The recovery of structured finance markets remains problematic. Most activity in residential mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities depends on the recovery of the residential and commercial real estate market, but we do expect a pickup in auto and credit card issuance to lead to improvement in the asset-backed securities market in both in the United States and in Europe. 
We do anticipate continued volatility in 2012, but we remain optimistic about the growth potential longer-term. We continue to make progress in regulatory and legal matters. In Europe, there is mounting criticism of some of the features of CRA 3. Now that's the European Commission's latest proposal for regulating rating agencies. Significantly, the pushback is coming from market participants and the European Securities and Markets Authority or ESMA. A lot of criticism is focused on the issue of proposed mandatory rotation of coverage among rating agencies for certain periods. It is still early days in this latest round with the European Commission, but it is already clear that its new proposals are coming under significant criticism from a wide range of parties who are concerned about the potential for market disruption and obviously unintended consequences. 
Since our last report, the number of lawsuits that have been dismissed outright has grown to 24, and 10 have been voluntarily withdrawn. Seven dismissals by lower courts have been reaffirmed by higher courts. We will be appealing the latest court decision in the CalPERS case. We strongly disagree with the court's ruling earlier this month that CalPERS had made a sufficient showing to allow the case to proceed. There will be no pretrial discovery while the appeal is pending. And the process could take another 12 to 18 months. On January 23, we filed a motion for summary judgment in the Abu Dhabi case. Any decision on our motion is probably many months away. And as we said consistently from the very beginning and it is proving out, we continue to believe that the legal risk is low. 
Consistent with the Growth and Value Plan strategy and the divestiture of Broadcasting, we report results for Commodities and Commercial brands, which were formerly named in the Information & Media segment. Revenue for all of these brands grew by 10% in 2011, and excluding restructuring charges, operating profit was up 13% with an operating margin of 21%. These operations are increasingly digital and based on subscriptions. Total subscription revenue grew by 13% in 2011 and now accounts for 63% of the revenue. In Commodities, Platts completed another strong year by growing 22% to $419 million. Excluding the acquisition of BENTEK Energy and Steel Business Briefing, revenue was up 15% for 2011. Volatility in energy prices drives demand for Platts' proprietary content, including news, price assessments and analytics for trading decisions. Platts, obviously, is one of our gems. We have steadily built this business over the years, creating high value and double-digit growth. In fact, Platts has produced a compound annual growth rate since 1994 of 12%. That’s 17 years with a compound annual growth rate of 12%. We like the outlook for this business. 
Revenue for Commercial, which includes J.D. Power, McGraw-Hill Construction and Aviation Week, grew by 2% in 2011 to $477 million. Continued strength in emerging markets, including China, recovery in the Western Europe and growth in the U.S. is increasing demand for automotive studies. New digital products like SpecShare, BuildShare and BidPro, will be key factors in the recovery of the McGraw-Hill Construction. More are on the way. 
We expect another year of growth in Commodities and Commercial markets in 2012. These highlights will begin to give you some indication of what we are planning overall for McGraw-Hill Financial. 
As this slide illustrates, we plan to report results for 5 lines of business. In today's earnings release, we provided tables recapping quarterly revenue for 2011 and 2010 for each of these 5 lines of business. As we move closer to separation, close our deal with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and realign our cost structure, we will provide greater transparency on the bottom line contribution from these 5 lines of businesses as well. 
Let me hold it there and let me move over to McGraw-Hill Education. In 2011, we have a tale of 2 markets and repositioning of Education for the digital world; Growth in Higher Education, Professional and International spurred by digital products and services and a decline in elementary-high school education. A strong finish in the U.S. higher education marketplace helped produce 4% revenue growth for us to $516 million for McGraw-Hill Education in the fourth quarter. Revenue for the year declined by 6% to $2.3 billion. Tight expense controls, lower prepublication amortization, lower reserve requirements and reduced selling and marketing expenses were all factors in McGraw-Hill Education's 2011 performance. The growth of digital products and services is fundamentally changing the higher education and professional market. In U.S. higher education, our sales of digital products and services grew by more than 40% and enabled us to gain share in 2011. Digital sales now account for about 20% of our Higher Education revenue. Homework management products for students are key to this rapid growth. 
In professional markets, we are also experiencing strong double-digit growth for eBooks and for subscriptions to online professional products. In 2011, nearly 30% of our revenue in professional markets came from eBooks, online subscriptions and apps for mobile devices. The digital integration of curricula, technology and distribution is creating significant new global growth opportunities for McGraw-Hill Education by providing new revenue streams, including more subscription-based businesses while lowering our costs. 
The digital evolution is moving more slowly in the elementary and high school market, but it is picking up speed. Last June, we became the first educational publisher to launch completely digital, cloud-based curriculums with our CINCH, that's C-I-N-C-H, CINCH Learning programs for science and math. These programs are device-agnostic, accessible on any computer, tablet or mobile service. And as announced earlier this month, we are working with Apple to create enhanced interactive program specifically for the iPad. Five high school math and science titles are already available, and we expect to double this number during the year. Our goal is to improve learning outcomes by making learning more accessible, personalized and engaging. These dynamics should help McGraw-Hill Education improve its results in 2012. 
The decline in school education reflects historically low funding for U.S. elementary and high school markets. Sales in the el-hi market in 2011 decreased by 9.4% to about $3.3 billion according to the Association of American publishers. Our performance was heavily influenced by a decision not to participate in several state adoptions due to the uncertainty over funding and to challenging comparisons in Texas and Florida where large orders in 2010 did not repeat due to changes in subject categories being purchased. 
We will ramp up our participation in the new state adoption market in 2012 to 96%. That's an increase from 75% in 2011. But we expect another challenging year for el-hi publishing as the size of state new adoption markets will decline by an estimated 40%. 
So let's sum up. In 2011, we produced enormous change in a short period of time and recorded the second best results in our history. This year promises to be even more momentous as we prepare for the introduction of 2 separate companies. We see another challenging and volatile year in our markets, but I'm confident in the strength of our businesses and the leadership team that was tested in 2011. 
On a consolidated basis for the McGraw-Hill Companies, our baseline earnings per share outlook for 2012 is $3.25 to $3.35. Actual results will be significantly influenced by the timing of separation and the additional cost-reduction actions that are still ahead of us, but $3.25 to $3.35 representing 12% to 15% over 2011. We will provide regular updates on our progress throughout the year. 
Now, at this point, let me turn it over to Jack Callahan, and he's going to give us a few more details on our financial performance. Jack?"
21719,145550361,213511,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. 2011 was certainly an active and productive year at the McGraw-Hill Companies. Let's start off with a review of fourth quarter segment operating performance. I want to provide additional detail to the summary Terry provided. McGraw-Hil",1751,"Thank you, Terry. 2011 was certainly an active and productive year at the McGraw-Hill Companies. Let's start off with a review of fourth quarter segment operating performance. I want to provide additional detail to the summary Terry provided. 
McGraw-Hill Education had an outstanding quarter with revenue growing 4% or $20 million and expenses declining $37 million, yielding adjusted operating profit of $72 million, an increase year-on-year of $57 million. This step-up in performance was led by the Higher Education, Professional and International Group with a revenue increase of 8% or $27 million in the quarter. This was partially offset by a modest decline at the School Education Group. Fourth quarter revenue growth was particularly strong in Higher Ed, aided by custom publishing and strong digital sales with Higher Ed digital sales growing more than 40%. Additionally, Higher Ed and Professional both benefited from significant decline in returns. Expenses benefited from tight overall expense control, lower prepublication amortization, lower reserve requirements and lower selling and marketing expense. 
Turning now to McGraw-Hill Financial. The volatility on the global credit markets certainly had an impact on quarterly results. Revenue was essentially flat and adjusted operating profit declined 8%. 
Let's take a look at the fourth quarter results across McGraw-Hill Financial. Overall, a decline at Standard & Poor's Ratings offset continued growth at the other lines of business. The global credit markets were down significantly in the fourth quarter. For example, the high-yield market globally was down by almost 2/3. As a result, S&P Ratings revenue declined 8%, driven by a 26% decline in transaction revenue. This resulted in a $49 million decline in adjusted operating profit. 
S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices had another strong quarter. Revenue grew 8% versus the toughest comps of the year and the lapping of TheMarkets.com acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter a year ago. Operating profit, driven in part by the continuing leverage of increasing integration across these businesses, grew 29%. The Commodities and Commercial lines of business revenue also grew 8%, driven by continued momentum in Platts, aided by the acquisitions of BENTEK Energy and Steel Business Briefing Group. Commercial revenue declined modestly in the quarter, largely due to the construction business although the introduction of new digital products has begun to mitigate the contraction. Overall, Commodities and Commercial adjusted operating profit grew 2% for the quarter. Margins were impacted a bit by the integration of the acquisitions and the timing of investments. 
Let's now review the drivers of consolidated profit growth both for the fourth quarter and the full year. Adjusted corporate expense was $54 million in the quarter, an increase of $7 million from the prior year, largely driven by increased professional fees and incentive compensation. For the full year, adjusted corporate expense increased $9 million or 5% to $173 million. 2011 adjusted corporate expense excludes $17 million in restructuring charges for a workforce reduction of approximately 120 positions as we begin to realign corporate costs. 2011 adjusted corporate expense also excludes $10 million for onetime separation-related expenses. 
The excellent results for McGraw-Hill Education drove an increase in the fourth quarter consolidated adjusted operating profit of 8%. For the full year, consolidated adjusted operating profit was $1.5 billion, up 5% from last year. Net interest expense was $18 million in Q4, a modest decline versus prior year. For the full year, net interest expense was $75 million, a decline of $7 million from the prior year. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 36.3% both for the fourth quarter and the full year, flat versus 2010. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $7 million in the fourth quarter and $23 million for the year. CRISIL represents the overwhelming majority of this number. Adjusted net income from continuing operations grew 10% in the fourth quarter to $184 million. Full year adjusted net income was $883 million, an increase of 6%. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter was $292.4 million, a $17.9 million decrease from the prior year and $11.3 million decrease from the third quarter. This decline is due to share repurchases, which more than offset equity-related awards. The $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction that we entered into on December 7 had a minimal impact on the fourth quarter shares outstanding. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter grew 17% to $0.63. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $2.91, up 9% versus 2010. 
Let me spend a minute discussing several onetime items related to the Growth and Value Plan. We completed the sale of non-core Broadcasting Group to E.W. Scripps for $212 million in cash, providing a onetime pretax gain of $123 million. This is shown as part of discontinued operations. We also implemented Wave 1 of targeted cost reductions by eliminating approximately 800 positions, including activities at Education, corporate and shared services and selected businesses with the McGraw-Hill Financial. We incurred $66 million in restructuring charges with these actions. Lastly, we incurred $10 million in onetime separations costs. These costs are professional fees tied directly to the work underway to separate the 2 businesses. Restructuring charges and onetime separation costs are both excluded from adjusted earnings. We anticipate additional restructuring and separation costs throughout 2012. 
Now let me turn to cash flow. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as GAAP cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends. Our computation of free cash flow also excludes $48 million in taxes paid on the gain from a disposition of the Broadcasting Group. We generated cash flow of $1.1 billion before dividends. After dividends, free cash flow was $807 million versus $881 million in 2010. The modest decline was driven by challenging end-of-year working capital comparison. 
Turning now to capital allocation. We spent $1.7 billion on acquisitions and share repurchases in 2011, $200 million for acquisitions, $1.5 billion for share repurchases. The most notable acquisitions were BENTEK Energy and Steel Business Briefing Group. Both acquisitions added to Platts' growing platform, adding critical capability in the natural gas and iron ore markets. Share repurchases were $845 million in the fourth quarter, including $500 million through an accelerated share repurchase program. Excluding the accelerated share program, we spent $1 billion on share repurchases in 2011, acquiring 24.7 million shares at an average price of $40.48 per share. We have received a substantial majority of the shares underlying the accelerated share repurchase transaction. This transaction will be complete in early 2012. The corporation finished the year with 276 million basic shares outstanding. Fully diluted shares outstanding at December 31, 2011, were approximately 283 million. Adjusted for the estimated full impact of the accelerated share repurchase transaction, approximately 23 million shares remain under our existing share repurchase authorization. 
I'll now provide an update on separation. Focus on separation before the end of 2012 requires coordination of multiple complex work streams. Our cost-reduction program involves disaggregating shared services and establishing 2 appropriately sized corporate centers. Wave 1 of the cost reductions are well underway based on Q4 restructuring and the benefit plan realignment. Additional waves of cost reduction are anticipated during 2012, targeting at least $100 million in total cost reductions on a run rate basis by the end of the year. As I mentioned earlier, restructuring and onetime separation costs should be anticipated in 2012. 
Let me provide some additional color on our guidance for 2012. Our 2012 baseline guidance provided on a going-concern basis. It includes the benefits of the Wave 1 cost-reduction program. It excludes the impact of additional restructuring and onetime separation costs. Our EPS guidance is not dependent on additional share repurchase. We will provide regular updates as new leadership teams are formed and implementation plans are finalized. 
More specifically, let me provide some details on our growth expectations for 2012. 
For McGraw-Hill Financial overall, we expect high-single digit revenue and adjusted operating profit growth. S&P Capital IQ and Indices and Commodities and Commercial are expected to continue to grow strongly, consistent with our expectations for McGraw-Hill Financial overall. Our current guidance for S&P Ratings is mid-single digit growth. S&P Ratings will benefit from continued growth in non-transaction revenue. Transaction revenue will benefit from the pipeline of maturing global corporate debt that will need to be refinanced, though volatility in the capital markets makes quarterly timing difficult to project. As Terry indicated earlier, first half comparisons for the Ratings business will be challenging. 
McGraw-Hill Education revenue and profit are expected to be relatively flat versus 2011 as a result of the challenging el-hi market. Restructuring savings from 2011 actions will offset the market softness and enable reinvestment in digital capability, positioning the business well as the market recovers. 
Benefiting from strong growth at McGraw-Hill Financial, augmented by the impact of share repurchases, earnings per share is expected to be $3.25 to $3.35, representing 12% to 15% growth versus 2011's adjusted earnings per share of $2.91. Obviously, actual results will be impacted by the timing of separation. 
Let me just add a number of other items. On corporate expense, benefiting from the restructuring actions in 2011, we expect a single-digit decline in corporate expense. Our effective tax rate and interest should be comparable to 2011. This guidance that we're providing today is based on a fully diluted weighted shares outstanding of approximately 284 million, which includes the completion of the accelerated share repurchase transaction as well as the impact of equity-related awards. 2012 cash flow is expected to be approximately $750 million after dividends despite modest increases in reinvestment. Capital expenditures are projected to be $125 million to $150 million versus the $119 million in 2011. And prepublication investment is projected to be $160 million to $190 million versus the $158 million in 2011. 
As we prepare for the separation of McGraw-Hill Financial and Education business in 2012, we are extremely well capitalized with cash and short-term investments at the end of the year of approximately $973 million. Cash and short-term investments decreased $575 million from December 31, 2010, largely due to acquisitions and share repurchase. Gross debt was comprised of approximately $1.2 billion unsecured senior notes. No commercial paper is outstanding. 
So in closing, the McGraw-Hill Companies finished a strong 2011 despite challenges in some of our key markets. We anticipate continued growth into 2012. And overall, 2012 promises to be a momentous year as we prepare for the introduction of 2 stand-alone companies, each with industry-leading positions. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Terry."

As we get through the work streams in terms of the separation, we'll see what's what on that one. We get a lot of questions. Could it be $150 million, could it be even higher and all those kind of things.

But on the other areas, we're in really good shape. As you asked on 2012 and the start of the year, again remembering that the first half of last year was so strong and the second half was weaker, we're starting on a weaker demand pipeline at this point. Obviously, the refinancings and some of the infrastructure financings that are going on are going to have some pickup in all of that. We'll have to see as the year starts to unfold. But I think that from an activity level overall, the market activity is a little softer getting started. Longer-term targets on margins really are going to be influenced more by the cost basis. Increasingly, as some of the legal and regulatory cost issues subside, I think that we will definitely see margin improvement on that part.

So our sense is the pipeline’s quite good. And then whenever the capital markets appear to open, there seems to be a pretty good flood of interest into the market. So what makes it challenging looking forward is exactly when that's going to happen. I mean if you look at 2011, first half of the year was actually quite good, back half really challenging. So that's why we've kind of landed so we've gone back and forth on sort of that mid-single digit, pretty much in line with what we saw this year.

About 1/2 of that is coming out of Asia, and so those are big numbers as well. And so we're tracking a lot of the bigger pools on that part.

Clearly, we're talking 2012 and we're going to do everything we can to accelerate this as best we can. As Jack was talking about, looking at early April for the Form 10. Once we get those notions completed, then it's execution of the cost structure. So it will be in the second half of 2012. But every effort is being made to speed that along, but clearly in the second half of 2012. And in terms of share repurchases, well, yes, we did $1.5 billion in 2011 and we're still completing a little bit more of the accelerated share repurchase of the $500 million. We have a little left to go on that. We have 23 million shares authorized left in the current authorization and we'll be watching market activity levels and the like. You know we're very strong on share repurchase and believe in it. And therefore, we're just going to complete the $500 million accelerated portion and then we'll gauge market conditions early on in the year and we'll make an assessment on that.

For the last 73 quarters, Don Rubin introduced our earnings conference calls. On February 20, 2012, our Senior Vice President for Investor Relations, Don Rubin, passed away after only recently announcing his retirement from McGraw-Hill. His distinguished career was 52 years long. He was a manager, a thought leader, a mentor and a beloved friend to all, and his legacy has been one of growth, purpose, passion, trust and relevance. I had the distinct honor of working closely with Don for many, many of those years. With Don's passing, McGraw-Hill has lost a leader, and personally, we have lost a very close and dear friend. And I know this is true for many of you on the earnings call today. 
Don began his career as a sports writer and was a journalist at heart. And to honor Don's rich legacy at McGraw-Hill, the corporation has established a scholarship at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism and I can think of no better way to say goodbye to our dear friend than to say hello to future Rubin scholars in the lifetime ahead. 
All right, joining me on today's conference call is Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Jack and I will review first quarter results, provide an update on our Growth and Value Plan progress and give the outlook for the balance of the year. 
There are a couple of themes that permeate today's discussion and are at the core of our focus here at the company. Obviously, number one is delivering top and bottom line growth; and the other is executing upon our Growth and Value Plan. 
These are at the forefront of our strategy to transform McGraw-Hill into 2 powerful new companies, and we're pleased with the progress made thus far in 2012. We see incredible opportunity ahead as we create McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education. Both companies share a common promise and a common purpose. We're about helping our customers find new ways to succeed and to prosper in a rapidly changing world where information is often conflicting, confounding and sometimes confusing. The bottom line is that we help make sense of it all. 
To be clear, our mission is never, nor never will be, about us. It will always be about our customers, and if we remain focused on them, solid business results will follow. Therefore, we are very pleased to begin the year with a record first quarter. $1.3 billion is a record for the first quarter revenue and $0.51 is a record for first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
What makes these results all the more impressive is that they occurred during the quarter in which so many of our employees were focused on the work streams necessary for the separation of the company. 
As you will see momentarily, the 3 segments that will comprise McGraw-Hill Financial delivered strong top line growth. This performance, coupled with success of cost reduction efforts associated with our restructuring and the recent substantial share repurchases, led to record first quarter profitability. What is also notable is that on a pro forma basis, McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education both delivered increased year-over-year adjusted operating profits. 
Steady progress has been made on the Growth and Value Plan during the first quarter. We remain on track for separation into the 2 industry-leading companies by year end. We have filed a request with the Internal Revenue Service for a ruling that the spinoff of McGraw-Hill Education is tax-free to the corporation and its shareholders. And I'm very pleased to inform you that as of late last night, we have received that favorable ruling from the IRS agreeing to the tax-free status for the spinoff of McGraw-Hill Education. 
The corporation also plans to file the Form 10 in the coming weeks. We remain on track to deliver an excess of $100 million on a run-rate [ph] basis and cost savings by year end. These cost savings are also seen across the corporation with first quarter expense growth on an adjusted basis of only 3%, which expanded the consolidated margin by approximately 200 basis points. 
Implementation is well underway on the Growth and Value Plan. Globally, there are more than 100 people supporting more than 15 work streams to drive separation and to reduce costs, and we will continue to invest in McGraw-Hill Financial through targeted acquisitions. 
So far this year, we have acquired 2 companies, both adding capability to S&P Capital IQ's platform. The first was R2 Financial Technologies. With this addition, S&P Capital IQ will now be able to offer clients an integrated view of market and credit risk across asset classes in a unique solution. This is increasingly important for financial institutions that are looking to manage complex and diverse portfolios across the globe. By combining R2, Clarify [ph] and risk solutions development teams, we have the foundation to build a powerful and innovative new offering for professional investors. 
The second acquisition was QuantHouse. QuantHouse provides S&P Capital IQ clients with a global integrated low-latency [ph] distribution network. They will develop a new generation of desktop monitoring and display applications, alpha generation tools and integrated low-latency [ph] data feeds, moving S&P Capital IQ closer to becoming a one-stop shop for all financial industry professionals. 
With that, let me now turn to the business results. McGraw-Hill Financial, on a pro forma basis, delivered a very solid quarter with revenue up 8% and operating profit up 10%. While all 3 segments delivered revenue growth, it was clearly Commodities & Commercial that led the operating profit growth. McGraw-Hill Financial derives 40% of its revenues from outside the United States. And during this first quarter, the International business growth of 12% outpaced domestic [ph] growth of 5%. 
The Standard & Poor's Ratings segment led the way as the most influential on the International side, with 47% of its first quarter revenue from sales outside of the United States. S&P Ratings is the largest business segment within McGraw-Hill Financial. Revenue for this segment grew 5%, driven predominantly by transaction revenue, which increased 10%. 
The key drivers to the increase in transaction revenue were: one, the U.S. public finance issuance, which increased to 1%. But recall now that the muni market was adversely impacted back in the first quarter of 2011 by weak municipal economies and the perceived risk of a wave of muni defaults, which did not come to fruition. Secondly is the U.S. corporate issuance increased 8%, driven by record speculative-grade issuance, which increased 14%. During the quarter, risk aversion waned due to the European Central Bank liquidity. But in the global capital markets and a temporary resolution of the European sovereign situation, this resulted in a quest for yield by investors and European nonfinancial corporate issuance, which increased 31%. 
Nontransaction revenue, which represents 58% of first quarter revenue, increased by 2%. The macro themes that we have shared with you in the past relating to the ratings market remain in place, namely: a large pipeline of maturing global corporate debt that will need to be refinanced. Another would be the shift in Europe from bank loans to the public debt markets. In fact, during the first quarter, European companies borrowed more from the bond market than they did from banks. This trend was highlighted in The Wall Street Journal article written earlier this month entitled, Bonds With Banks Fraying. European Companies' Move Into Debt Markets Bucks Direct-Lending Tradition.
And finally, the structured finance market recovery remains beholden to improved activity in the residential and commercial real estate markets. 
Operating profit was down slightly in the quarter as we made targeted investments in new employees to reinforce growth of corporate and government ratings, as well as growth in emerging markets. In addition, legal expenses were up versus a year ago, but were more modestly down on a sequential basis versus the fourth quarter of 2011. 
While certainly expensive, our success on the litigation front has been encouraging. Three additional cases were dismissed in the first quarter, bringing the total to date to 27. Seven dismissals by the lower courts have been affirmed by higher courts and 10 cases have been voluntarily withdrawn. 
One very important case was the Reese case. Earlier this month, the judge granted our motion to dismiss all claims against the corporation. This was important because it was 1 of 4 purported class actions stock [ph] dropped [ph] cases filed against the corporation associated with the financial crisis, and now all 4 have been dismissed. 
The Ratings business remains an area of focus for regulators. While I recognize that the suggested regulations in Europe continue to evolve, I'm increasingly encouraged by some of the more pragmatic views that have been expressed more recently. All in all, I'm encouraged by Ratings' start to the year. I believe that we are investing appropriately within the business to enable continued growth. And as the credit markets continue to normalize, we are well positioned for success. 
Let me now turn to S&P Capital IQ/S&P Indices, the second-largest segment within McGraw-Hill Financial. It delivered top -- solid top and bottom line results with revenue and operating profit increasing 9% and 11%, respectively. Both S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices delivered year-over-year revenue growth with 75% of revenue coming from subscriptions, up from 74% a year ago. 
Looking at S&P Capital IQ alone, revenue increased 10% and a key driver of this growth was the 11% increase in Capital IQ clients year-over-year. However, both RatingsXpress and RatingsDirect also contributed to the double-digit revenue growth. This was in part due to the cross-selling opportunities that are being realized as both the Global Credit Portal and TheMarkets.com are migrating onto the Capital IQ platform. 
Another driver of subscriber growth is the continuous enhancements to the platform. A few examples include the iPhone and BlackBerry apps that are now available and an enterprise solutions software development kit that was launched in January that will allow our clients, IP personnel, to pull just the data they need when they need it. 
With the acquisitions of R2 and QuantHouse, along with internal capabilities, S&P Capital IQ is well poised now to deliver further competitive capabilities to offer our clients the most comprehensive market data and risk analytics platform in the industry. 
S&P Indices revenue increased 5%. The key contributor to this was an 11% increase in assets under management in exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices. During the quarter, 10 brand new indices and 23 variants to existing indices were launched. Also, during the quarter, 41 new exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices were launched, bringing the total to 419 ETFs. These new additions bode well for the continued growth of S&P Indices. 
Another area of excitement within S&P Indices is the pending joint venture with the CME Group. We continue to anticipate completing this transaction by midyear.
Clearly, the highlight of the quarter was the performance of the Commodities & Commercial segment. While the smallest segment within McGraw-Hill Financial, it delivered year-over-year operating profit gains that led all the other segments. Revenue growth was 13% with International revenue up 23%. Not only was there strong top line growth, but the expense control was outstanding, resulting in impressive segment operating profit margin expanding to over 27%. 
Within Commodities, subscriptions for petroleum and national -- natural gas products drove the 22% increase in revenue. Since the acquisition of BENTEK Energy, we have been leveraging our Platts sales force to drive increases in our natural gas business. 
Because of the growth in our Commodities business, I thought it would be instructive to spend a few minutes discussing our hidden gem, Platts. Platts is a leading provider of oil, natural gas, electrical power, coal, shipping, petrochemicals and metals information. Importantly, more than 90% of revenues is derived from subscriptions. That results in a business with very little volatility. 
Market Data is Platts' largest product. It is a subscription service that provides access to the latest price data, including end-of-day assessments, third-party data and access to a complete historical database. Platts' price data is highly valuable to traders, risk managers, analysts and others who seek unbiased price assessments. Because of the importance that the market participants place on Platts' price assessments, they are frequently utilized as reference points in long-term contracts between 2 parties. As such, Platts has become integral to the functioning of the industries in which its serves. We believe that Platts can continue to deliver meaningful growth by focusing on extending capabilities within markets it already serves and expanding into new market areas. 
With Commercial, J.D. Power delivered significant year-over-year revenue growth. While all industry sectors delivered growth, automotive led the way both domestically and internationally. 
With that, let me move over to McGraw-Hill Education. McGraw-Hill Education reported a 2% decline in revenue, yet delivered a 13% increase in segment operating profit. By now, everyone is very familiar with the weakness in the el-hi market. In contrast, both Higher Education and Professional delivered nice revenue growth. Also, quite encouraging were the cost reductions that the segment delivered, most notably as a result of the restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2011. We want to ensure that our cost structure is optimal for the new market realities and that we make the appropriate investments in the digital products that our customers demand. 
Because the first quarter is such a seasonally light quarter, I'm not going to get into detailed discussions regarding adoption in open territory progress, but we'll be doing that as we go forward. Instead, I'd like to focus on digital progress. As I've said before, I believe that the digitization of education represents the opportunity of the century. As McGraw-Hill Education is formally launched later this year as an independent company, it will be one of the market's commanding leaders with a brand name that's already universally recognized and respected for past accomplishments. We are targeting new achievements in a changing educational landscape that's limited only by our imagination. 
Currently, Professional and Higher Education are leading our efforts in delivering digital solutions to address customer needs in the marketplace. Nearly 40% of Professional revenue came from digital products during the quarter. This shift is also happening in our larger Higher Education arena, which realized a roughly 50% increase in digital revenue year-over-year. 
Since digital products are often subscription-based, another way to measure the traction that these products are making to our product portfolio is to take a look at deferred revenue. Deferred revenue grew 63% compared to the end of the first quarter of 2011 to $106 million. This gain was largely driven by the sales of CINCH Science, an all-digital curriculum for the school market; and McGraw-Hill Connect, a homework management and study system for the higher education market. 
The Higher Education, Professional and International Group reported a 2% increase in revenue. We were excited to see a continuation of the recent strength in Higher Education and Professional with revenues up from the prior year by mid-single digits. These increases were partially offset by a decline in international results. 
The School Education Group reported a 10% decline in revenue from the prior year, with decrease occurring in both the instructional materials and testing businesses. The first quarter is the smallest in the el-hi market, representing approximately 11% of annual sale, and results are not predictive of full year trends. Those trends are being determined now as school districts across the country decide which materials they will order later in the year for use beginning next fall. So far, the spring selling season appears to be progressing well for McGraw-Hill and the industry in terms of district level activity. However, funding concerns remain acute in many areas. We will have a better view on the full year el-hi market at the end of the second quarter. 
We are setting up Education business to thrive as a stand-alone company. We are putting in place the cost structure and digital capabilities necessary for McGraw-Hill Education to lead the transformation of the industry. 
And therefore, in summary, McGraw-Hill Companies is off a record start to the year. McGraw-Hill Financial should continue to deliver solid growth. With bolt-on acquisitions and our in-house capabilities, we plan to continue to deliver increased capabilities to our customers. McGraw-Hill Education will focus on capitalizing on the opportunity of the century by driving unique, new digital product offerings to satisfy changing educational landscape while simultaneously creating a cost structure that is rightsized to serve the market. The corporation will remain focused on delivering on our Growth and Value Plan and continue to work towards the completion of the spinoff of McGraw-Hill Education by year end. 
Okay. That completes our review of operations. I will now ask Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, to update you on some key financials. Jack?"
21719,183268782,287392,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2012",2012-04-24,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. Let me begin this morning by discussing our consolidated results. Terry has just discussed the record first quarter revenue that we delivered, which represented 6% growth versus 2011. The solid revenue performance was leveraged by limiti",796,"Thank you, Terry. Let me begin this morning by discussing our consolidated results. Terry has just discussed the record first quarter revenue that we delivered, which represented 6% growth versus 2011. The solid revenue performance was leveraged by limiting our adjusted expense growth to just 3%, essentially 1/2 of our revenue growth. As a result, we were able to realize adjusted operating profit growth of 18% and delivered a consolidated adjusted operating margin of 19%. This resulted in margin improvement of approximately 200 basis points versus last year. 
We are beginning to see the benefits from the multiple initiatives underway across the organization to improve expense productivity as we separate the company and prepare for the spinoff of Education. 
In addition, we were able to leverage the strong growth with substantial share repurchases. The result was to turn the 18% growth in adjusted operating profit into a 30% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our share repurchase program is an important part of the Growth and Value Plan. Since the beginning of 2011, the corporation has repurchased nearly 36 million shares at a weighted average price of $42.05. This is a reduction of approximately 12% of the shares outstanding at that time. 
Apart from the completion of the accelerated share repurchase program, no other shares were repurchased so far in 2012. As we get closer to separation and accumulate additional cash, we will consider when to resume share repurchases. 
We have a very strong balance sheet with cash and short-term investments of $932 million. Year-over-year, our adjusted free cash flow was down $44 million. The first quarter is the seasonally weakest cash flow quarter. This was exaggerated this year by the timing of some working capital and tax payment items. We fully expect to deliver another year of solid adjusted free cash flow growth, with guidance of approximately $750 million. 
Now let me provide some additional details around the execution of the Growth and Value Plan. During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our target of at least $100 million in run rate cost savings by the end of 2012. The margin expansion that we delivered in the first quarter was, in part, due to these efforts. We have already taken some actions that deliver cost saving, and as the year progresses, we plan to take more. Therefore, the cost savings from these initiatives should step up throughout the year. However, we are not solely focused on reducing costs. We continue to make targeted investments in the business to support global growth and enhanced capability. 
We do want to give you our current outlook with regard to the onetime costs in support of the separation and the cost reduction plan. Please keep in mind that these are estimates and timing has not been finalized. We will update you as we progress through the year. 
During the first quarter, we incurred $33 million of onetime Growth and Value Plan costs that we noted in this morning's press release. We anticipate that for the remainder of the year, we will incur an additional $100 million of onetime separation expenses necessary to implement the Growth and Value Plan. These onetime expenses are largely professional fees as we need to support the various consultants, business process and information technology firms and financial advisors. Please keep in mind this is the working estimate. 
In addition, we anticipate that during 2012, we will continue to incur restructuring costs as part of our ongoing cost reduction initiatives as we did during the fourth quarter of 2011. While the timing of these actions are still fluid, restructuring expense for 2012 could be approximately up to $75 million. 
As we prepare to file the Form 10 necessary for a tax-free spin of the Education business, I want to update you with some high-level thoughts with regards to the capital structure of the 2 new companies. We expect that McGraw-Hill Financial will carry a strong investment-grade rating and continue to be committed to a strong dividend. 
With McGraw-Hill Education, we are targeting a more flexible investment-grade rating and a modest dividend. We will ensure that at the time of the spin-off, that there is adequate liquidity to meet business needs and to manage the seasonal fluctuations in working capital. And as Terry mentioned, we have received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service agreeing to the tax-free status for the spin-off of McGraw-Hill Education. 
All in all, we are off to a terrific start with a record first quarter. Our guidance remains unchanged, separation activities are accelerating, our cost reduction programs are on track and we are focused on the mission to establish 2 powerful industry leaders by year end. 
With that, now let me turn the call back over to Terry McGraw."

As we see more local bond markets cropping up, note whether it be Tel Aviv or Johannesburg or Jakarta or any of these places, they are all trying to develop the capability of being able to establish more robust capital markets. And increasingly, for us, besides the more developed countries, a lot of activity is going to develop partnerships and developing stronger relationships in those markets. So a great example of that is in India. It's the whole CRISIL operation which is doing exceptionally well and growing at a fabulous rate, but also because of the fact that with infrastructure, financing and so forth, in India alone, over the next 5 years, they're going to need $1 trillion of infrastructure financing. So that's where some of that kind of growth is coming from. So again, especially driven off of infrastructure, the emerging markets represent an increasingly very important opportunity for us."

By the way, just in terms of the Apple relationship, Ed, we've got 50 programs on the iPad in the Professional area now, this having to do with science, engineering, medical, these areas, fabulous programs. And we have 70 titles at the Higher Ed side on the iPads now and it's getting increasing receptivity in going that direction.

So I mean you can extrapolate it out, but the digital component of this is just growing ever so quickly and the capability that we have gratifies us on this.

For the last 73 quarters, Don Rubin introduced our earnings conference calls. On February 20, 2012, our Senior Vice President for Investor Relations, Don Rubin, passed away after only recently announcing his retirement from McGraw-Hill. His distinguished career was 52 years long. He was a manager, a thought leader, a mentor and a beloved friend to all, and his legacy has been one of growth, purpose, passion, trust and relevance. I had the distinct honor of working closely with Don for many, many of those years. With Don's passing, McGraw-Hill has lost a leader, and personally, we have lost a very close and dear friend. And I know this is true for many of you on the earnings call today. 
Don began his career as a sports writer and was a journalist at heart. And to honor Don's rich legacy at McGraw-Hill, the corporation has established a scholarship at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism, and I can think of no better way to say goodbye to our dear friend than to say hello to future Rubin scholars in the lifetime ahead. 
All right, joining me on today's conference call is Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Jack and I will review first quarter results, provide an update on our Growth and Value Plan progress and give the outlook for the balance of the year. 
There are a couple of themes that permeate today's discussion and are at the core of our focus here at the company. Obviously, number one is delivering top and bottom line growth; and the other is executing upon our Growth and Value Plan. 
These are at the forefront of our strategy to transform McGraw-Hill into 2 powerful new companies, and we're pleased with the progress made thus far in 2012. We see incredible opportunity ahead as we create McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education. Both companies share a common promise and a common purpose. We're about helping our customers find new ways to succeed and to prosper in a rapidly changing world where information is often conflicting, confounding and sometimes confusing. The bottom line is that we help make sense of it all. 
To be clear, our mission is never, nor never will be, about us. It will always be about our customers, and if we remain focused on them, solid business results will follow. Therefore, we are very pleased to begin the year with a record first quarter. $1.3 billion is a record for the first quarter revenue and $0.51 is a record for first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
What makes these results all the more impressive is that they occurred during the quarter in which so many of our employees were focused on the work streams necessary for the separation of the company. 
As you will see momentarily, the 3 segments that will comprise McGraw-Hill Financial delivered strong top line growth. This performance, coupled with success of cost reduction efforts associated with our restructuring and the recent substantial share repurchases, led to record first quarter profitability. What is also notable is that on a pro forma basis, McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education both delivered increased year-over-year adjusted operating profits. 
Steady progress has been made on the Growth and Value Plan during the first quarter. We remain on track for separation into the 2 industry-leading companies by year end. We have filed a request with the Internal Revenue Service for a ruling that the spin-off of McGraw-Hill Education is tax-free to the corporation and its shareholders. And I'm very pleased to inform you that as of late last night, we have received that favorable ruling from the IRS agreeing to the tax-free status for the spin-off of McGraw-Hill Education. 
The corporation also plans to file the Form 10 in the coming weeks. We remain on track to deliver an excess of $100 million on a run rate basis and cost savings by year end. These cost savings are also seen across the corporation with first quarter expense growth on an adjusted basis of only 3%, which expanded the consolidated margin by approximately 200 basis points. 
Implementation is well underway on the Growth and Value Plan. Globally, there are more than 100 people supporting more than 15 work streams to drive separation and to reduce costs, and we will continue to invest in McGraw-Hill Financial through targeted acquisitions. 
So far this year, we have acquired 2 companies, both adding capability to S&P Capital IQ's platform. The first was R2 Financial Technologies. With this addition, S&P Capital IQ will now be able to offer clients an integrated view of market and credit risk across asset classes in a unique solution. This is increasingly important for financial institutions that are looking to manage complex and diverse portfolios across the globe. By combining R2, clarify and risk solutions development teams, we have the foundation to build a powerful and innovative new offering for professional investors. 
The second acquisition was QuantHouse. QuantHouse provides S&P Capital IQ clients with a global integrated low-latency distribution network. They will develop a new generation of desktop monitoring and display applications, alpha generation tools and integrated low-latency data feeds, moving S&P Capital IQ closer to becoming a one-stop shop for all financial industry professionals. 
With that, let me now turn to the business results. McGraw-Hill Financial, on a pro forma basis, delivered a very solid quarter with revenue up 8% and operating profit up 10%. While all 3 segments delivered revenue growth, it was clearly Commodities & Commercial that led the operating profit growth. McGraw-Hill Financial derives 40% of its revenues from outside the United States. And during this first quarter, the international business growth of 12% outpaced domestic growth of 5%. 
The Standard & Poor's Ratings segment led the way as the most influential on the international side, with 47% of its first quarter revenue from sales outside of the United States. S&P Ratings is the largest business segment within McGraw-Hill Financial. Revenue for this segment grew 5%, driven predominantly by transaction revenue, which increased 10%. 
The key drivers to the increase in transaction revenue were: one, the U.S. public finance issuance, which increased 61%. But recall now that the muni market was adversely impacted back in the first quarter of 2011 by weak municipal economies and the perceived risk of a wave of muni defaults, which did not come to fruition. Secondly is the U.S. corporate issuance increased 8%, driven by record speculative-grade issuance, which increased 14%. During the quarter, risk aversion waned due to the European Central Bank liquidity. But in the global capital markets and a temporary resolution of the European sovereign situation, this resulted in a quest for yield by investors and European nonfinancial corporate issuance, which increased 31%. 
Non-transaction revenue, which represents 58% of first quarter revenue, increased by 2%. 
The macro themes that we have shared with you in the past relating to the ratings market remain in place, namely: a large pipeline of maturing global corporate debt that will need to be refinanced. Another would be the shift in Europe from bank loans to the public debt markets. In fact, during the first quarter, European companies borrowed more from the bond market than they did from banks. This trend was highlighted in The Wall Street Journal article written earlier this month entitled, Bonds With Banks Fraying. European Companies' Move Into Debt Markets Bucks Direct-Lending Tradition.
And finally, the structured finance market recovery remains beholden to improved activity in the residential and commercial real estate markets. 
Operating profit was down slightly in the quarter as we made targeted investments in new employees to reinforce growth of corporate and government ratings, as well as growth in emerging markets. In addition, legal expenses were up versus a year ago, but were more modestly down on a sequential basis versus the fourth quarter of 2011. 
While certainly expensive, our success on the litigation front has been encouraging. Three additional cases were dismissed in the first quarter, bringing the total to date to 27. Seven dismissals by the lower courts have been affirmed by higher courts and 10 cases have been voluntarily withdrawn. 
One very important case was the Reese case. Earlier this month, the judge granted our motion to dismiss all claims against the corporation. This was important because it was 1 of 4 purported class actions stock drop cases filed against the corporation associated with the financial crisis, and now all 4 have been dismissed. 
The Ratings business remains an area of focus for regulators. While I recognize that the suggested regulations in Europe continue to evolve, I'm increasingly encouraged by some of the more pragmatic views that have been expressed more recently. All in all, I'm encouraged by Ratings' start to the year. I believe that we are investing appropriately within the business to enable continued growth. And as the credit markets continue to normalize, we are well positioned for success. 
Let me now turn to S&P Capital IQ/S&P Indices, the second-largest segment within McGraw-Hill Financial. It delivered top -- solid top and bottom line results with revenue and operating profit increasing 9% and 11%, respectively. Both S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices delivered year-over-year revenue growth with 75% of revenue coming from subscriptions, up from 74% a year ago. 
Looking at S&P Capital IQ alone, revenue increased 10% and a key driver of this growth was the 11% increase in Capital IQ clients year-over-year. However, both RatingsXpress and RatingsDirect also contributed to the double-digit revenue growth. This was in part due to the cross-selling opportunities that are being realized as both the Global Credit Portal and TheMarkets.com are migrating onto the Capital IQ platform. 
Another driver of subscriber growth is the continuous enhancements to the platform. A few examples include the iPhone and BlackBerry apps that are now available and an enterprise solutions software development kit that was launched in January that will allow our clients, IT personnel to pull just the data they need when they need it. 
With the acquisitions of R2 and QuantHouse, along with internal capabilities, S&P Capital IQ is well poised now to deliver further competitive capabilities to offer our clients the most comprehensive market data and risk analytics platform in the industry. 
S&P Indices revenue increased 5%. The key contributor to this was an 11% increase in assets under management in exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices. During the quarter, 10 brand new indices and 23 variants to existing indices were launched. Also, during the quarter, 41 new exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices were launched, bringing the total to 419 ETFs. These new additions bode well for the continued growth of S&P Indices. 
Another area of excitement within S&P Indices is the pending joint venture with the CME Group. We continue to anticipate completing this transaction by midyear.
Clearly, the highlight of the quarter was the performance of the Commodities & Commercial segment. While the smallest segment within McGraw-Hill Financial, it delivered year-over-year operating profit gains that led all the other segments. Revenue growth was 13% with international revenue up 23%. Not only was there strong top line growth, but the expense control was outstanding, resulting in impressive segment operating profit margin expanding to over 27%. 
Within Commodities, subscriptions for petroleum and national -- natural gas products drove the 22% increase in revenue. Since the acquisition of BENTEK Energy, we have been leveraging our Platts sales force to drive increases in our natural gas business. 
Because of the growth in our Commodities business, I thought it would be instructive to spend a few minutes discussing our hidden gem, Platts. Platts is a leading provider of oil, natural gas, electrical power, coal, shipping, petrochemicals and metals information. Importantly, more than 90% of revenues is derived from subscriptions. That results in a business with very little volatility. 
Market Data is Platts' largest product. It is a subscription service that provides access to the latest price data, including end-of-day assessments, third-party data and access to a complete historical database. Platts' price data is highly valuable to traders, risk managers, analysts and others who seek unbiased price assessments. Because of the importance that the market participants place on Platts' price assessments, they are frequently utilized as reference points in long-term contracts between 2 parties. As such, Platts has become integral to the functioning of the industries in which its serves. We believe that Platts can continue to deliver meaningful growth by focusing on extending capabilities within markets it already serves and expanding into new market areas. 
With Commercial, J.D. Power delivered significant year-over-year revenue growth. While all industry sectors delivered growth, automotive led the way both domestically and internationally. 
With that, let me move over to McGraw-Hill Education. McGraw-Hill Education reported a 2% decline in revenue, yet delivered a 13% increase in segment operating profit. By now, everyone is very familiar with the weakness in the el-hi market. In contrast, both Higher Education and Professional delivered nice revenue growth. Also, quite encouraging were the cost reductions that the segment delivered, most notably as a result of the restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2011. We want to ensure that our cost structure is optimal for the new market realities and that we make the appropriate investments in the digital products that our customers demand. 
Because the first quarter is such a seasonally light quarter, I'm not going to get into detailed discussions regarding adoption in open territory progress, but we'll be doing that as we go forward. Instead, I'd like to focus on digital progress. As I've said before, I believe that the digitization of education represents the opportunity of the century. As McGraw-Hill Education is formally launched later this year as an independent company, it will be one of the market's commanding leaders with a brand name that's already universally recognized and respected for past accomplishments. We are targeting new achievements in a changing educational landscape that's limited only by our imagination. 
Currently, Professional and Higher Education are leading our efforts in delivering digital solutions to address customer needs in the marketplace. Nearly 40% of Professional revenue came from digital products during the quarter. This shift is also happening in our larger Higher Education arena, which realized a roughly 50% increase in digital revenue year-over-year. 
Since digital products are often subscription-based, another way to measure the traction that these products are making to our product portfolio is to take a look at deferred revenue. Deferred revenue grew 63% compared to the end of the first quarter of 2011 to $106 million. This gain was largely driven by the sales of CINCH Science, an all-digital curriculum for the school market; and McGraw-Hill Connect, a homework management and study system for the higher education market. 
The Higher Education, Professional and International Group reported a 2% increase in revenue. We were excited to see a continuation of the recent strength in Higher Education and Professional with revenues up from the prior year by mid-single digits. These increases were partially offset by a decline in international results. 
The School Education Group reported a 10% decline in revenue from the prior year, with decrease occurring in both the instructional materials and testing businesses. The first quarter is the smallest in the el-hi market, representing approximately 11% of annual sale, and results are not predictive of full year trends. Those trends are being determined now as school districts across the country decide which materials they will order later in the year for use beginning next fall. So far, the spring selling season appears to be progressing well for McGraw-Hill and the industry in terms of district level activity. However, funding concerns remain acute in many areas. We will have a better view on the full year el-hi market at the end of the second quarter. 
We are setting up the Education business to thrive as a stand-alone company. We are putting in place the cost structure and digital capabilities necessary for McGraw-Hill Education to lead the transformation of the industry. 
And therefore, in summary, McGraw-Hill Companies is off a record start to the year. McGraw-Hill Financial should continue to deliver solid growth. With bolt-on acquisitions and our in-house capabilities, we plan to continue to deliver increased capabilities to our customers. McGraw-Hill Education will focus on capitalizing on the opportunity of the century by driving unique, new digital product offerings to satisfy changing educational landscape while simultaneously creating a cost structure that is rightsized to serve the market. The corporation will remain focused on delivering on our Growth and Value Plan and continue to work towards the completion of the spin-off of McGraw-Hill Education by year end. 
Okay. That completes our review of operations. I will now ask Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, to update you on some key financials. Jack?"

Terry has just discussed the record first quarter revenue that we delivered, which represented 6% growth versus 2011. The solid revenue performance was leveraged by limiting our adjusted expense growth to just 3%, essentially 1/2 of our revenue growth. As a result, we were able to realize adjusted operating profit growth of 18% and delivered a consolidated adjusted operating margin of 19%. This resulted in margin improvement of approximately 200 basis points versus last year. 
We are beginning to see the benefits from the multiple initiatives underway across the organization to improve expense productivity as we separate the company and prepare for the spin-off of Education. 
In addition, we were able to leverage the strong growth with substantial share repurchases. The result was to turn the 18% growth in adjusted operating profit into a 30% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our share repurchase program is an important part of the Growth and Value Plan. Since the beginning of 2011, the corporation has repurchased nearly 36 million shares at a weighted average price of $42.05. This is a reduction of approximately 12% of the shares outstanding at that time. 
Apart from the completion of the accelerated share repurchase program, no other shares were repurchased so far in 2012. As we get closer to separation and accumulate additional cash, we will consider when to resume share repurchases. 
We have a very strong balance sheet with cash and short-term investments of $932 million. Year-over-year, our adjusted free cash flow was down $44 million. The first quarter is the seasonally weakest cash flow quarter. This was exaggerated this year by the timing of some working capital and tax payment items. We fully expect to deliver another year of solid adjusted free cash flow growth, with guidance of approximately $750 million. 
Now let me provide some additional details around the execution of the Growth and Value Plan. During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our target of at least $100 million in run rate cost savings by the end of 2012. The margin expansion that we delivered in the first quarter was, in part, due to these efforts. We have already taken some actions that deliver cost saving, and as the year progresses, we plan to take more. Therefore, the cost savings from these initiatives should step up throughout the year. However, we are not solely focused on reducing costs. We continue to make targeted investments in the business to support global growth and enhanced capability. 
We do want to give you our current outlook with regard to the onetime costs in support of the separation and the cost reduction plan. Please keep in mind that these are estimates and timing has not been finalized. We will update you as we progress through the year. 
During the first quarter, we incurred $33 million of onetime Growth and Value Plan costs that we noted in this morning's press release. We anticipate that for the remainder of the year, we will incur an additional $100 million of onetime separation expenses necessary to implement the Growth and Value Plan. These onetime expenses are largely professional fees as we need to support the various consultants, business process and information technology firms and financial advisors. Please keep in mind this is the working estimate. 
In addition, we anticipate that during 2012, we will continue to incur restructuring costs as part of our ongoing cost reduction initiatives as we did during the fourth quarter of 2011. While the timing of these actions are still fluid, restructuring expense for 2012 could be approximately up to $75 million. 
As we prepare to file the Form 10 necessary for a tax-free spin of the Education business, I want to update you with some high-level thoughts with regards to the capital structure of the 2 new companies. We expect that McGraw-Hill Financial will carry a strong investment-grade rating and continue to be committed to a strong dividend. 
With McGraw-Hill Education, we are targeting a more flexible investment-grade rating and a modest dividend. We will ensure that at the time of the spin-off, that there is adequate liquidity to meet business needs and to manage the seasonal fluctuations in working capital. And as Terry mentioned, we have received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service agreeing to the tax-free status for the spin-off of McGraw-Hill Education. 
All in all, we are off to a terrific start with a record first quarter. Our guidance remains unchanged, separation activities are accelerating, our cost reduction programs are on track and we are focused on the mission to establish 2 powerful industry leaders by year end. 
With that, now let me turn the call back over to Terry McGraw."

And you're right. Who knows and what comes around. And we will deal with everything as we go. But right now, the legal risk is low and we're very pleased with the reaction that we're getting in the system."

As we see more local bond markets cropping up, whether it be Tel Aviv or Johannesburg or Jakarta or any of these places, they are all trying to develop the capability of being able to establish more robust capital markets. And increasingly, for us, besides the more developed countries, a lot of activity is going to develop partnerships and developing stronger relationships in those markets. A great example of that is in India is the whole CRISIL operation, which is doing exceptionally well and growing at a fabulous rate. But also because of the fact that with infrastructure, financing and so forth, in India alone, over the next 5 years, they're going to need $1 trillion of infrastructure financing. So that's where some of that kind of growth is coming from. So again, especially driven off of infrastructure, the emerging markets represent an increasingly very important opportunity for us."

You just heard, once again, from Chip Merritt. He's our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Chip joined us about a month ago, and we certainly are glad to have him aboard. 
For the last 73 quarters, Don Rubin introduced our earnings conference calls. On February 20, 2012, our Senior Vice President for Investor Relations, Don Rubin, passed away after only recently announcing his retirement from McGraw-Hill. His distinguished career was 52 years long. He was a manager, a thought leader, a mentor and a beloved friend to all, and his legacy has been one of growth, purpose, passion, trust and relevance. I had the distinct honor of working closely with Don for many, many of those years. With Don's passing, McGraw-Hill has lost a leader, and personally, we have lost a very close and dear friend. And I know this is true for many of you on the earnings call today. 
Don began his career as a sports writer and was a journalist at heart. And to honor Don's rich legacy at McGraw-Hill, the corporation has established a scholarship at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism, and I can think of no better way to say goodbye to our dear friend than to say hello to future Rubin scholars in the lifetime ahead. 
All right, joining me on today's conference call is Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Jack and I will review first quarter results, provide an update on our Growth and Value Plan progress and give the outlook for the balance of the year. 
There are a couple of themes that permeate today's discussion and are at the core of our focus here at the company. Obviously, number one is delivering top and bottom line growth; and the other is executing upon our Growth and Value Plan. 
These are at the forefront of our strategy to transform McGraw-Hill into 2 powerful new companies, and we're pleased with the progress made thus far in 2012. We see incredible opportunity ahead as we create McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education. Both companies share a common promise and a common purpose. We're about helping our customers find new ways to succeed and to prosper in a rapidly changing world where information is often conflicting, confounding and sometimes confusing. The bottom line is that we help make sense of it all. 
To be clear, our mission is never, nor never will be, about us. It will always be about our customers, and if we remain focused on them, solid business results will follow. Therefore, we are very pleased to begin the year with a record first quarter. $1.3 billion is a record for the first quarter revenue and $0.51 is a record for first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
What makes these results all the more impressive is that they occurred during the quarter in which so many of our employees were focused on the work streams necessary for the separation of the company. 
As you will see momentarily, the 3 segments that will comprise McGraw-Hill Financial delivered strong top line growth. This performance, coupled with success of cost reduction efforts associated with our restructuring and the recent substantial share repurchases, led to record first quarter profitability. What is also notable is that on a pro forma basis, McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education both delivered increased year-over-year adjusted operating profits. 
Steady progress has been made on the Growth and Value Plan during the first quarter. We remain on track for separation into the 2 industry-leading companies by year end. We have filed a request with the Internal Revenue Service for a ruling that the spin-off of McGraw-Hill Education is tax-free to the corporation and its shareholders. And I'm very pleased to inform you that as of late last night, we have received a favorable ruling from the IRS agreeing to the tax-free status for the spin-off of McGraw-Hill Education. 
The corporation also plans to file the Form 10 in the coming weeks. We remain on track to deliver in excess of $100 million on a run rate basis and cost savings by year end. These cost savings are also seen across the corporation with first quarter expense growth on an adjusted basis of only 3%, which expanded the consolidated margin by approximately 200 basis points. 
Implementation is well underway on the Growth and Value Plan. Globally, there are more than 100 people supporting more than 15 work streams to drive separation and to reduce costs, and we will continue to invest in McGraw-Hill Financial through targeted acquisitions. 
So far this year, we have acquired 2 companies, both adding capability to S&P Capital IQ's platform. The first was R2 Financial Technologies. With this addition, S&P Capital IQ will now be able to offer clients an integrated view of market and credit risk across asset classes in a unique solution. This is increasingly important for financial institutions that are looking to manage complex and diverse portfolios across the globe. By combining R2, clarify and risk solutions development teams, we have the foundation to build a powerful and innovative new offering for professional investors. 
The second acquisition was QuantHouse. QuantHouse provides S&P Capital IQ clients with a global integrated low-latency distribution network. They will develop a new generation of desktop monitoring and display applications, alpha generation tools and integrated low-latency data feeds, moving S&P Capital IQ closer to becoming a one-stop shop for all financial industry professionals. 
With that, let me now turn to the business results. McGraw-Hill Financial, on a pro forma basis, delivered a very solid quarter with revenue up 8% and operating profit up 10%. While all 3 segments delivered revenue growth, it was clearly Commodities & Commercial that led the operating profit growth. McGraw-Hill Financial derives 40% of its revenues from outside the United States. And during this first quarter, the international business growth of 12% outpaced domestic growth of 5%. 
The Standard & Poor's Ratings segment led the way as the most influential on the international side, with 47% of its first quarter revenue from sales outside of the United States. S&P Ratings is the largest business segment within McGraw-Hill Financial. Revenue for this segment grew 5%, driven predominantly by transaction revenue, which increased 10%. 
The key drivers to the increase in transaction revenue were: one, the U.S. public finance issuance, which increased 61%. But recall now that the muni market was adversely impacted back in the first quarter of 2011 by weak municipal economies and the perceived risk of a wave of muni defaults, which did not come to fruition. Secondly is the U.S. corporate issuance increased 8%, driven by record speculative-grade issuance, which increased 14%. During the quarter, risk aversion waned due to the European Central Bank liquidity. But in the global capital markets and a temporary resolution of the European sovereign situation, this resulted in a quest for yield by investors and European nonfinancial corporate issuance, which increased 31%. 
Non-transaction revenue, which represents 58% of first quarter revenue, increased by 2%. 
The macro themes that we have shared with you in the past relating to the ratings market remain in place, namely: a large pipeline of maturing global corporate debt that will need to be refinanced. Another would be the shift in Europe from bank loans to the public debt markets. In fact, during the first quarter, European companies borrowed more from the bond market than they did from banks. This trend was highlighted in a Wall Street Journal article written earlier this month entitled, Bonds With Banks Fraying. European Companies' Move Into Debt Markets Bucks Direct-Lending Tradition.
And finally, the structured finance market recovery remains beholden to improved activity in the residential and commercial real estate markets. 
Operating profit was down slightly in the quarter as we made targeted investments in new employees to reinforce growth of corporate and government ratings, as well as growth in emerging markets. In addition, legal expenses were up versus a year ago, but were more modestly down on a sequential basis versus the fourth quarter of 2011. 
While certainly expensive, our success on the litigation front has been encouraging. Three additional cases were dismissed in the first quarter, bringing the total to date to 27. Seven dismissals by the lower courts have been affirmed by higher courts and 10 cases have been voluntarily withdrawn. 
One very important case was the Reese case. Earlier this month, the judge granted our motion to dismiss all claims against the corporation. This was important because it was 1 of 4 purported class actions stock drop cases filed against the corporation associated with the financial crisis, and now all 4 have been dismissed. 
The Ratings business remains an area of focus for regulators. While I recognize that the suggested regulations in Europe continue to evolve, I'm increasingly encouraged by some of the more pragmatic views that have been expressed more recently. All in all, I'm encouraged by Ratings' start to the year. I believe that we are investing appropriately in the business to enable continued growth. And as the credit markets continue to normalize, we are well positioned for success. 
Let me now turn to S&P Capital IQ/S&P Indices, the second-largest segment within McGraw-Hill Financial. It delivered top -- solid top and bottom line results with revenue and operating profit increasing 9% and 11%, respectively. Both S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices delivered year-over-year revenue growth with 75% of revenue coming from subscriptions, up from 74% a year ago. 
Looking at S&P Capital IQ alone, revenue increased 10% and a key driver of this growth was the 11% increase in Capital IQ clients year-over-year. However, both RatingsXpress and RatingsDirect also contributed to the double-digit revenue growth. This was in part due to the cross-selling opportunities that are being realized as both the Global Credit Portal and TheMarkets.com are migrating onto the Capital IQ platform. 
Another driver of subscriber growth is the continuous enhancements to the platform. A few examples include the iPhone and BlackBerry apps that are now available and an enterprise solutions software development kit that was launched in January that will allow our clients, IT personnel to pull just the data they need when they need it. 
With the acquisitions of R2 and QuantHouse, along with internal capabilities, S&P Capital IQ is well poised now to deliver further competitive capabilities to offer our clients the most comprehensive market data and risk analytics platform in the industry. 
S&P Indices revenue increased 5%. The key contributor to this was an 11% increase in assets under management in exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices. During the quarter, 10 brand new indices and 23 variants to existing indices were launched. Also, during the quarter, 41 new exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices were launched, bringing the total to 419 ETFs. These new additions bode well for the continued growth of S&P Indices. 
Another area of excitement within S&P Indices is the pending joint venture with the CME Group. We continue to anticipate completing this transaction by midyear.
Clearly, the highlight of the quarter was the performance of the Commodities & Commercial segment. While the smallest segment within McGraw-Hill Financial, it delivered year-over-year operating profit gains that led all the other segments. Revenue growth was 13% with international revenue up 23%. Not only was there strong top line growth, but the expense control was outstanding, resulting in impressive segment operating profit margin expanding to over 27%. 
Within Commodities, subscriptions for petroleum and national -- natural gas products drove the 22% increase in revenue. Since the acquisition of BENTEK Energy, we have been leveraging our Platts sales force to drive increases in our natural gas business. 
Because of the growth in our Commodities business, I thought it would be instructive to spend a few minutes discussing our hidden gem, Platts. Platts is a leading provider of oil, natural gas, electric power, coal, shipping, petrochemicals and metals information. Importantly, more than 90% of revenue is derived from subscriptions. That results in a business with very little volatility. 
Market Data is Platts' largest product. It is a subscription service that provides access to the latest price data, including end-of-day assessments, third-party data and access to a complete historical database. Platts' price data is highly valuable to traders, risk managers, analysts and others who seek unbiased price assessments. Because of the importance that the market participants place on Platts' price assessments, they are frequently utilized as reference points in long-term contracts between 2 parties. As such, Platts has become integral to the functioning of the industries in which it serves. We believe that Platts can continue to deliver meaningful growth by focusing on extending capabilities within markets it already serves and expanding into new market areas. 
With Commercial, J.D. Power delivered significant year-over-year revenue growth. While all industry sectors delivered growth, automotive led the way both domestically and internationally. 
With that, let me move over to McGraw-Hill Education. McGraw-Hill Education reported a 2% decline in revenue, yet delivered a 13% increase in segment operating profit. By now, everyone is very familiar with the weakness in the el-hi market. In contrast, both Higher Education and Professional delivered nice revenue growth. Also, quite encouraging were the cost reductions that the segment delivered, most notably as a result of the restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2011. We want to ensure that our cost structure is optimal for the new market realities and that we make the appropriate investments in the digital products that our customers demand. 
Because the first quarter is such a seasonally light quarter, I'm not going to get into detailed discussions regarding adoption in open territory progress, but we'll be doing that as we go forward. Instead, I'd like to focus on digital progress. As I've said before, I believe that the digitization of education represents the opportunity of the century. As McGraw-Hill Education is formally launched later this year as an independent company, it will be one of the market's commanding leaders with a brand name that's already universally recognized and respected for past accomplishments. We are targeting new achievements in a changing educational landscape that's limited only by our imagination. 
Currently, Professional and Higher Education are leading our efforts in delivering digital solutions to address customer needs in the marketplace. Nearly 40% of Professional revenue came from digital products during the quarter. This shift is also happening in our larger Higher Education arena, which realized a roughly 50% increase in digital revenue year-over-year. 
Since digital products are often subscription-based, another way to measure the traction that these products are making to our product portfolio is to take a look at deferred revenue. Deferred revenue grew 63% compared to the end of the first quarter of 2011 to $106 million. This gain was largely driven by the sales of CINCH Science, an all-digital curriculum for the school market; and McGraw-Hill Connect, a homework management and study system for the higher education market. 
The Higher Education, Professional and International Group reported a 2% increase in revenue. We were excited to see a continuation of the recent strength in Higher Education and Professional with revenues up from the prior year by mid-single digits. These increases were partially offset by a decline in international results. 
The School Education Group reported a 10% decline in revenue from the prior year, with decrease occurring in both the instructional materials and testing businesses. The first quarter is the smallest in the el-hi market, representing approximately 11% of annual sales, and results are not predictive of full year trends. Those trends are being determined now as school districts across the country decide which materials they will order later in the year for use beginning next fall. So far, the spring selling season appears to be progressing well for McGraw-Hill and the industry in terms of district level activity. However, funding concerns remain acute in many areas. We will have a better view on the full year el-hi market at the end of the second quarter. 
We are setting up the Education business to thrive as a stand-alone company. We are putting in place the cost structure and digital capabilities necessary for McGraw-Hill Education to lead the transformation of the industry. 
And therefore, in summary, McGraw-Hill Companies is off to a record start to the year. McGraw-Hill Financial should continue to deliver solid growth. With bolt-on acquisitions and our in-house capabilities, we plan to continue to deliver increased capabilities to our customers. McGraw-Hill Education will focus on capitalizing on the opportunity of the century by driving unique, new digital product offerings to satisfy a changing educational landscape while simultaneously creating a cost structure that is rightsized to serve the market. The corporation will remain focused on delivering on our Growth and Value Plan and continue to work towards the completion of the spin-off of McGraw-Hill Education by year end. 
Okay. That completes our review of operations. I will now ask Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, to update you on some key financials. Jack?"
21719,183268782,287565,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2012",2012-04-24,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. Let me begin this morning by discussing our consolidated results. Terry has just discussed the record first quarter revenue that we delivered, which represented 6% growth versus 2011. The solid revenue performance was leveraged by limiti",796,"Thank you, Terry. Let me begin this morning by discussing our consolidated results. Terry has just discussed the record first quarter revenue that we delivered, which represented 6% growth versus 2011. The solid revenue performance was leveraged by limiting our adjusted expense growth to just 3%, essentially 1/2 of our revenue growth. As a result, we were able to realize adjusted operating profit growth of 18% and delivered a consolidated adjusted operating margin of 19%. This resulted in margin improvement of approximately 200 basis points versus last year. 
We are beginning to see the benefits from the multiple initiatives underway across the organization to improve expense productivity as we separate the company and prepare for the spin-off of Education. 
In addition, we were able to leverage this strong growth with substantial share repurchases. The result was to turn the 18% growth in adjusted operating profit into a 30% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our share repurchase program is an important part of the Growth and Value Plan. Since the beginning of 2011, the corporation has repurchased nearly 36 million shares at a weighted average price of $42.05. This is a reduction of approximately 12% of the shares outstanding at that time. 
Apart from the completion of the accelerated share repurchase program, no other shares were repurchased so far in 2012. As we get closer to separation and accumulate additional cash, we will consider when to resume share repurchases. 
We have a very strong balance sheet with cash and short-term investments of $932 million. Year-over-year, our adjusted free cash flow was down $44 million. The first quarter is the seasonally weakest cash flow quarter. This was exaggerated this year by the timing of some working capital and tax payment items. We fully expect to deliver another year of solid adjusted free cash flow growth, with guidance of approximately $750 million. 
Now let me provide some additional details around the execution of the Growth and Value Plan. During the quarter, we continued to make progress on our target of at least $100 million in run rate cost savings by the end of 2012. The margin expansion that we delivered in the first quarter was, in part, due to these efforts. We have already taken some actions that deliver cost saving, and as the year progresses, we plan to take more. Therefore, the cost savings from these initiatives should step up throughout the year. However, we are not solely focused on reducing costs. We continue to make targeted investments in the business to support global growth and enhanced capability. 
We do want to give you our current outlook with regard to the onetime costs in support of the separation and the cost reduction plan. Please keep in mind that these are estimates and timing has not been finalized. We will update you as we progress through the year. 
During the first quarter, we incurred $33 million of onetime Growth and Value Plan costs that we noted in this morning's press release. We anticipate that for the remainder of the year, we will incur an additional $100 million of onetime separation expenses necessary to implement the Growth and Value Plan. These onetime expenses are largely professional fees as we need to support the various consultants, business process and information technology firms and financial advisors. Please keep in mind this is the working estimate. 
In addition, we anticipate that during 2012, we will continue to incur restructuring costs as part of our ongoing cost reduction initiatives as we did during the fourth quarter of 2011. While the timing of these actions are still fluid, restructuring expense for 2012 could be approximately up to $75 million. 
As we prepare to file the Form 10 necessary for a tax-free spin of the Education business, I want to update you with some high-level thoughts with regards to the capital structure of the 2 new companies. We expect that McGraw-Hill Financial will carry a strong investment-grade rating and continue to be committed to a strong dividend. 
With McGraw-Hill Education, we are targeting a more flexible investment-grade rating and a modest dividend. We will ensure that at the time of the spin-off, that there is adequate liquidity to meet business needs and to manage the seasonal fluctuations in working capital. And as Terry mentioned, we have received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service agreeing to the tax-free status for the spin-off of McGraw-Hill Education. 
All in all, we are off to a terrific start with a record first quarter. Our guidance remains unchanged, separation activities are accelerating, our cost reduction programs are on track and we are focused on the mission to establish 2 powerful industry leaders by year end. 
With that, now let me turn the call back over to Terry McGraw."

As we see more local bond markets cropping up, whether it be Tel Aviv or Johannesburg or Jakarta or any of these places, they are all trying to develop the capability of being able to establish more robust capital markets. And increasingly, for us, besides the more developed countries, a lot of activity is going to develop partnerships and developing stronger relationships in those markets. A great example of that is in India, is the whole CRISIL operation, which is doing exceptionally well and growing at a fabulous rate. But also because of the fact that with infrastructure financing and so forth, in India alone, over the next 5 years, they're going to need $1 trillion of infrastructure financing. So that's where some of that kind of growth is coming from. So again, especially driven off of infrastructure, the emerging markets represent an increasingly very important opportunity for us."

Fabulous programs. And we have 70 titles at the Higher Ed side on the iPad now and it's getting increasing receptivity in going in that direction.

These have all been direct solutions to specific, either home study or homework helping or actually curriculum-support initiatives. So I mean you can extrapolate it out, but the digital component of this is just growing ever so quickly, and the capability that we have gratifies us on this.

For the last 73 quarters, Don Rubin introduced our earnings conference calls. On February 20, 2012, our Senior Vice President for Investor Relations, Don Rubin, passed away after only recently announcing his retirement from McGraw-Hill. His distinguished career was 52 years long. He was a manager, a thought leader, a mentor and a beloved friend to all, and his legacy has been one of growth, purpose, passion, trust and relevance. I had the distinct honor of working closely with Don for many, many of those years. With Don's passing, McGraw-Hill has lost a leader, and personally, we have lost a very close and dear friend. And I know this is true for many of you on the earnings call today. 
Don began his career as a sports writer and was a journalist at heart. And to honor Don's rich legacy at McGraw-Hill, the corporation has established a scholarship at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism, and I can think of no better way to say goodbye to our dear friend than to say hello to future Rubin scholars in the lifetime ahead. 
All right, joining me on today's conference call is Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Jack and I will review first quarter results, provide an update on our Growth and Value Plan progress and give the outlook for the balance of the year. 
There are a couple of themes that permeate today's discussion and are at the core of our focus here at the company. Obviously, number one is delivering top and bottom line growth; and the other is executing upon our Growth and Value Plan. 
These are at the forefront of our strategy to transform McGraw-Hill into 2 powerful new companies, and we're pleased with the progress made thus far in 2012. We see incredible opportunity ahead as we create McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education. Both companies share a common promise and a common purpose. We're about helping our customers find new ways to succeed and to prosper in a rapidly changing world where information is often conflicting, confounding and sometimes confusing. The bottom line is that we help make sense of it all. 
To be clear, our mission is never, nor never will be, about us. It will always be about our customers, and if we remain focused on them, solid business results will follow. Therefore, we are very pleased to begin the year with a record first quarter. $1.3 billion is a record for the first quarter revenue and $0.51 is a record for first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
What makes these results all the more impressive is that they occurred during the quarter in which so many of our employees were focused on the work streams necessary for the separation of the company. 
As you will see momentarily, the 3 segments that will comprise McGraw-Hill Financial delivered strong top line growth. This performance, coupled with success of cost reduction efforts associated with our restructuring and the recent substantial share repurchases, led to record first quarter profitability. What is also notable is that on a pro forma basis, McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education both delivered increased year-over-year adjusted operating profits. 
Steady progress has been made on the Growth and Value Plan during the first quarter. We remain on track for separation into the 2 industry-leading companies by year end. We have filed a request with the Internal Revenue Service for a ruling that the spin-off of McGraw-Hill Education is tax-free to the corporation and its shareholders. And I'm very pleased to inform you that as of late last night, we have received a favorable ruling from the IRS agreeing to the tax-free status for the spin-off of McGraw-Hill Education. 
The corporation also plans to file the Form 10 in the coming weeks. We remain on track to deliver in excess of $100 million on a run rate basis and cost savings by year end. These cost savings are also seen across the corporation with first quarter expense growth on an adjusted basis of only 3%, which expanded the consolidated margin by approximately 200 basis points. 
Implementation is well underway on the Growth and Value Plan. Globally, there are more than 100 people supporting more than 15 work streams to drive separation and to reduce costs, and we will continue to invest in McGraw-Hill Financial through targeted acquisitions. 
So far this year, we have acquired 2 companies, both adding capability to S&P Capital IQ's platform. The first was R2 Financial Technologies. With this addition, S&P Capital IQ will now be able to offer clients an integrated view of market and credit risk across asset classes in a unique solution. This is increasingly important for financial institutions that are looking to manage complex and diverse portfolios across the globe. By combining R2, clarify and risk solutions development teams, we have the foundation to build a powerful and innovative new offering for professional investors. 
The second acquisition was QuantHouse. QuantHouse provides S&P Capital IQ clients with a global integrated low-latency distribution network. They will develop a new generation of desktop monitoring and display applications, alpha generation tools and integrated low-latency data feeds, moving S&P Capital IQ closer to becoming a one-stop shop for all financial industry professionals. 
With that, let me now turn to the business results. McGraw-Hill Financial, on a pro forma basis, delivered a very solid quarter with revenue up 8% and operating profit up 10%. While all 3 segments delivered revenue growth, it was clearly Commodities & Commercial that led the operating profit growth. McGraw-Hill Financial derives 40% of its revenues from outside the United States. And during this first quarter, the international business growth of 12% outpaced domestic growth of 5%. 
The Standard & Poor's Ratings segment led the way as the most influential on the international side, with 47% of its first quarter revenue from sales outside of the United States. S&P Ratings is the largest business segment within McGraw-Hill Financial. Revenue for this segment grew 5%, driven predominantly by transaction revenue, which increased 10%. 
The key drivers to the increase in transaction revenue were: one, the U.S. public finance issuance, which increased 61%. But recall now that the muni market was adversely impacted back in the first quarter of 2011 by weak municipal economies and the perceived risk of a wave of muni defaults, which did not come to fruition. Secondly is the U.S. corporate issuance increased 8%, driven by record speculative-grade issuance, which increased 14%. During the quarter, risk aversion waned due to the European Central Bank liquidity. But in the global capital markets and a temporary resolution of the European sovereign situation, this resulted in a quest for yield by investors and European nonfinancial corporate issuance, which increased 31%. 
Non-transaction revenue, which represents 58% of first quarter revenue, increased by 2%. 
The macro themes that we have shared with you in the past relating to the ratings market remain in place, namely: a large pipeline of maturing global corporate debt that will need to be refinanced. Another would be the shift in Europe from bank loans to the public debt markets. In fact, during the first quarter, European companies borrowed more from the bond market than they did from banks. This trend was highlighted in a Wall Street Journal article written earlier this month entitled, Bonds With Banks Fraying. European Companies' Move Into Debt Markets Bucks Direct-Lending Tradition.
And finally, the structured finance market recovery remains beholden to improved activity in the residential and commercial real estate markets. 
Operating profit was down slightly in the quarter as we made targeted investments in new employees to reinforce growth of corporate and government ratings, as well as growth in emerging markets. In addition, legal expenses were up versus a year ago, but were more modestly down on a sequential basis versus the fourth quarter of 2011. 
While certainly expensive, our success on the litigation front has been encouraging. Three additional cases were dismissed in the first quarter, bringing the total to date to 27. Seven dismissals by the lower courts have been affirmed by higher courts and 10 cases have been voluntarily withdrawn. 
One very important case was the Reese case. Earlier this month, the judge granted our motion to dismiss all claims against the corporation. This was important because it was 1 of 4 purported class actions stock drop cases filed against the corporation associated with the financial crisis, and now all 4 have been dismissed. 
The Ratings business remains an area of focus for regulators. While I recognize that the suggested regulations in Europe continue to evolve, I'm increasingly encouraged by some of the more pragmatic views that have been expressed more recently. All in all, I'm encouraged by Ratings' start to the year. I believe that we are investing appropriately in the business to enable continued growth. And as the credit markets continue to normalize, we are well positioned for success. 
Let me now turn to S&P Capital IQ/S&P Indices, the second-largest segment within McGraw-Hill Financial. It delivered top -- solid top and bottom line results with revenue and operating profit increasing 9% and 11%, respectively. Both S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices delivered year-over-year revenue growth with 75% of revenue coming from subscriptions, up from 74% a year ago. 
Looking at S&P Capital IQ alone, revenue increased 10% and a key driver of this growth was the 11% increase in Capital IQ clients year-over-year. However, both RatingsXpress and RatingsDirect also contributed to the double-digit revenue growth. This was in part due to the cross-selling opportunities that are being realized as both the Global Credit Portal and TheMarkets.com are migrating onto the Capital IQ platform. 
Another driver of subscriber growth is the continuous enhancements to the platform. A few examples include the iPhone and BlackBerry apps that are now available and an enterprise solutions software development kit that was launched in January that will allow our clients, IT personnel to pull just the data they need when they need it. 
With the acquisitions of R2 and QuantHouse, along with internal capabilities, S&P Capital IQ is well poised now to deliver further competitive capabilities to offer our clients the most comprehensive market data and risk analytics platform in the industry. 
S&P Indices revenue increased 5%. The key contributor to this was an 11% increase in assets under management in exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices. During the quarter, 10 brand new indices and 23 variants to existing indices were launched. Also, during the quarter, 41 new exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices were launched, bringing the total to 419 ETFs. These new additions bode well for the continued growth of S&P Indices. 
Another area of excitement within S&P Indices is the pending joint venture with the CME Group. We continue to anticipate completing this transaction by midyear.
Clearly, the highlight of the quarter was the performance of the Commodities & Commercial segment. While the smallest segment within McGraw-Hill Financial, it delivered year-over-year operating profit gains that led all the other segments. Revenue growth was 13% with international revenue up 23%. Not only was there strong top line growth, but the expense control was outstanding, resulting in impressive segment operating profit margin expanding to over 27%. 
Within Commodities, subscriptions for petroleum and national -- natural gas products drove the 22% increase in revenue. Since the acquisition of BENTEK Energy, we have been leveraging our Platts sales force to drive increases in our natural gas business. 
Because of the growth in our Commodities business, I thought it would be instructive to spend a few minutes discussing our hidden gem, Platts. Platts is a leading provider of oil, natural gas, electric power, coal, shipping, petrochemicals and metals information. Importantly, more than 90% of revenue is derived from subscriptions. That results in a business with very little volatility. 
Market Data is Platts' largest product. It is a subscription service that provides access to the latest price data, including end-of-day assessments, third-party data and access to a complete historical database. Platts' price data is highly valuable to traders, risk managers, analysts and others who seek unbiased price assessments. Because of the importance that the market participants place on Platts' price assessments, they are frequently utilized as reference points in long-term contracts between 2 parties. As such, Platts has become integral to the functioning of the industries in which it serves. We believe that Platts can continue to deliver meaningful growth by focusing on extending capabilities within markets it already serves and expanding into new market areas. 
With Commercial, J.D. Power delivered significant year-over-year revenue growth. While all industry sectors delivered growth, automotive led the way both domestically and internationally. 
With that, let me move over to McGraw-Hill Education. McGraw-Hill Education reported a 2% decline in revenue, yet delivered a 13% increase in segment operating profit. By now, everyone is very familiar with the weakness in the el-hi market. In contrast, both Higher Education and Professional delivered nice revenue growth. Also, quite encouraging were the cost reductions that the segment delivered, most notably as a result of the restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2011. We want to ensure that our cost structure is optimal for the new market realities and that we make the appropriate investments in the digital products that our customers demand. 
Because the first quarter is such a seasonally light quarter, I'm not going to get into detailed discussions regarding adoption in open territory progress, but we'll be doing that as we go forward. Instead, I'd like to focus on digital progress. As I've said before, I believe that the digitization of education represents the opportunity of the century. As McGraw-Hill Education is formally launched later this year as an independent company, it will be one of the market's commanding leaders with a brand name that's already universally recognized and respected for past accomplishments. We are targeting new achievements in a changing educational landscape that's limited only by our imagination. 
Currently, Professional and Higher Education are leading our efforts in delivering digital solutions to address customer needs in the marketplace. Nearly 40% of Professional revenue came from digital products during the quarter. This shift is also happening in our larger Higher Education arena, which realized a roughly 50% increase in digital revenue year-over-year. 
Since digital products are often subscription-based, another way to measure the traction that these products are making to our product portfolio is to take a look at deferred revenue. Deferred revenue grew 63% compared to the end of the first quarter of 2011 to $106 million. This gain was largely driven by the sales of CINCH Science, an all-digital curriculum for the school market; and McGraw-Hill Connect, a homework management and study system for the higher education market. 
The Higher Education, Professional and International Group reported a 2% increase in revenue. We were excited to see a continuation of the recent strength in Higher Education and Professional with revenues up from the prior year by mid-single digits. These increases were partially offset by a decline in international results. 
The School Education Group reported a 10% decline in revenue from the prior year, with decrease occurring in both the instructional materials and testing businesses. The first quarter is the smallest in the el-hi market, representing approximately 11% of annual sales, and results are not predictive of full year trends. Those trends are being determined now as school districts across the country decide which materials they will order later in the year for use beginning next fall. So far, the spring selling season appears to be progressing well for McGraw-Hill and the industry in terms of district level activity. However, funding concerns remain acute in many areas. We will have a better view on the full year el-hi market at the end of the second quarter. 
We are setting up the Education business to thrive as a stand-alone company. We are putting in place the cost structure and digital capabilities necessary for McGraw-Hill Education to lead the transformation of the industry. 
And therefore, in summary, McGraw-Hill Companies is off to a record start to the year. McGraw-Hill Financial should continue to deliver solid growth. With bolt-on acquisitions and our in-house capabilities, we plan to continue to deliver increased capabilities to our customers. McGraw-Hill Education will focus on capitalizing on the opportunity of the century by driving unique, new digital product offerings to satisfy a changing educational landscape while simultaneously creating a cost structure that is rightsized to serve the market. The corporation will remain focused on delivering on our Growth and Value Plan and continue to work towards the completion of the spin-off of McGraw-Hill Education by year end. 
Okay. That completes our review of operations. I will now ask Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, to update you on some key financials. Jack?"
21719,183268782,287849,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2012",2012-04-24,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. Let me begin this morning by discussing our consolidated results. Terry has just discussed the record first quarter revenue that we delivered, which represented 6% growth versus 2011. The solid revenue performance was leveraged by limiti",796,"Thank you, Terry. Let me begin this morning by discussing our consolidated results. Terry has just discussed the record first quarter revenue that we delivered, which represented 6% growth versus 2011. The solid revenue performance was leveraged by limiting our adjusted expense growth to just 3%, essentially 1/2 of our revenue growth. As a result, we were able to realize adjusted operating profit growth of 18% and delivered a consolidated adjusted operating margin of 19%. This resulted in margin improvement of approximately 200 basis points versus last year. 
We are beginning to see the benefits from the multiple initiatives underway across the organization to improve expense productivity as we separate the company and prepare for the spin-off of Education. 
In addition, we were able to leverage this strong growth with substantial share repurchases. The result was to turn the 18% growth in adjusted operating profit into a 30% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our share repurchase program is an important part of the Growth and Value Plan. Since the beginning of 2011, the corporation has repurchased nearly 36 million shares at a weighted average price of $42.05. This is a reduction of approximately 12% of the shares outstanding at that time. 
Apart from the completion of the accelerated share repurchase program, no other shares were repurchased so far in 2012. As we get closer to separation and accumulate additional cash, we will consider when to resume share repurchases. 
We have a very strong balance sheet with cash and short-term investments of $932 million. Year-over-year, our adjusted free cash flow was down $44 million. The first quarter is the seasonally weakest cash flow quarter. This was exaggerated this year by the timing of some working capital and tax payment items. We fully expect to deliver another year of solid adjusted free cash flow growth, with guidance of approximately $750 million. 
Now let me provide some additional details around the execution of the Growth and Value Plan. During the quarter, we continued to make progress on our target of at least $100 million in run rate cost savings by the end of 2012. The margin expansion that we delivered in the first quarter was, in part, due to these efforts. We have already taken some actions that deliver cost saving, and as the year progresses, we plan to take more. Therefore, the cost savings from these initiatives should step up throughout the year. However, we are not solely focused on reducing costs. We continue to make targeted investments in the business to support global growth and enhanced capability. 
We do want to give you our current outlook with regard to the onetime costs in support of the separation and the cost reduction plan. Please keep in mind that these are estimates and timing has not been finalized. We will update you as we progress through the year. 
During the first quarter, we incurred $33 million of onetime Growth and Value Plan costs that we noted in this morning's press release. We anticipate that for the remainder of the year, we will incur an additional $100 million of onetime separation expenses necessary to implement the Growth and Value Plan. These onetime expenses are largely professional fees as we need to support the various consultants, business process and information technology firms and financial advisors. Please keep in mind this is the working estimate. 
In addition, we anticipate that during 2012, we will continue to incur restructuring costs as part of our ongoing cost reduction initiatives as we did during the fourth quarter of 2011. While the timing of these actions are still fluid, restructuring expense for 2012 could be approximately up to $75 million. 
As we prepare to file the Form 10 necessary for a tax-free spin of the Education business, I want to update you with some high-level thoughts with regards to the capital structure of the 2 new companies. We expect that McGraw-Hill Financial will carry a strong investment-grade rating and continue to be committed to a strong dividend. 
With McGraw-Hill Education, we are targeting a more flexible investment-grade rating and a modest dividend. We will ensure that at the time of the spin-off, that there is adequate liquidity to meet business needs and to manage the seasonal fluctuations in working capital. And as Terry mentioned, we have received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service agreeing to the tax-free status for the spin-off of McGraw-Hill Education. 
All in all, we are off to a terrific start with a record first quarter. Our guidance remains unchanged, separation activities are accelerating, our cost reduction programs are on track and we are focused on the mission to establish 2 powerful industry leaders by year end. 
With that, now let me turn the call back over to Terry McGraw."

And it takes about 2.5 years from when you get a suit before you get before a federal judge. So the time part is there. So I think the overall picture and the success that we said is in keeping with exactly what I said back about 1.5 years, a couple of years ago, which is that the risk is relatively low and it's bearing out.

Joining me today on the conference call is Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Jack and I will review our corporate results, provide an update on our Growth and Value Plan progress, provide a detailed look at the segment results that make up what will be McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education and then provide an outlook for the balance of the year. 
Three months ago, I was able to share record first quarter earnings. I couldn't be more pleased today to share with you our record second quarter earnings. What makes these results particularly noteworthy is that they occurred during a period of tremendous volatility in the debt markets as a result of the European debt crisis and in a year in which we're experiencing the weakest state funding for textbooks in the past decade. To say the least, our employees are to be commended for delivering these results in today's very challenging global economic environment while simultaneously advancing the separation and implementing major cost reduction programs. 
During the second quarter, despite revenue that was modestly below a year ago, we delivered adjusted operating profit growth of 14% from both increased revenue in Commodities & Commercial, S&P Capital IQ/S&P Indices, as well as an acceleration of cost reductions that were realized during the quarter. 
Our recent aggressive share repurchase program amplified this growth and we delivered 25% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth, and Jack will provide additional detail on that in just a moment. 
The primary focus of the company remains this, on delivering on the Growth and Value Plan. As part of this effort, we continue to progress toward the creation of 2 powerful new companies: one, McGraw-Hill Education; and the other, McGraw-Hill Financial, and doing so in 2012. 
Steady progress has been made on the Growth and Value Plan during the second quarter. Key management has been put in place at McGraw-Hill Education, and that includes Buzz Waterhouse as President and CEO, and Pat Milano as CFO and Chief Administrative Officer. Buzz brings a wealth of both technology and education experience, while Pat brings the financial expertise, coupled with a deep knowledge of McGraw-Hill given his long tenure. Both are terrific leaders and I can't say enough about them and the team that we've put in place. 
The Form 10 Registration Statement was filed with the SEC several weeks ago. Consolidated cost reductions accelerated in the second quarter with total company adjusted expenses decreasing 5% versus the second quarter of 2011, resulting in an increase in margins. These cost reduction actions and others currently underway keep us on track to delivering at least $100 million in cost savings on a run-rate basis by year end. 
Also, as part of the Growth and Value Plan, we are working on more than just cost reduction and separation. Strategic investments are an important component and we made several during the quarter to accelerate long-term growth. We launched the S&P Dow Jones Indices, combining 2 iconic brands that will continue to deliver index-based solutions for global investors. It is a very exciting joint venture with a wonderful partner in the CME and should deliver annual revenues in 2013 in its first full year of approximately $0.5 billion with great margins. 
Since the deal closed in late June, the impact on the second quarter earnings was minimal. We acquired Credit Market Analysis Limited, or CMA, a leading provider of clear, reliable over-the-counter credit pricing and related information from the CME. This adds another foundational benchmark capability to our portfolio. The business will be reported within S&P Capital IQ. 
Our India-based credit rating agency, CRISIL, announced the acquisition of Coalition Development Limited. Coalition provides high-end analytics primarily to global investment banks. It is a London-based company with considerable operations in India. From a corporate development standpoint, we have been very active in adding new capabilities to the company. Along with S&P Dow Jones Indices, CMA and Coalition, which I just discussed, we had acquisitions of R2 and QuantHouse earlier this year, both in S&P Capital IQ. 
Overall, the Growth and Value Plan has a comprehensive set of integrated initiatives which includes separation, cost reduction, share repurchases, as well as funding, both organic growth and tuck-in acquisitions. I am pleased with the progress so far this year and I'm excited about the prospects for the future of both companies as we complete this process. 
With that, let me turn to the business results and I'll go through each of the various business areas. Let me start, McGraw-Hill Financial, on a pro forma basis, delivered a 5% increase in revenue and a 9% increase in adjusted operating profit during the quarter. While all 3 segments delivered revenue growth, it was S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices, along with Commodities & Commercial, that provided the operating profit growth. Cost-reduction benefits were realized across all segments. McGraw-Hill Financial derived 40% of its revenues from outside the United States during the second quarter. Domestic revenue growth of 7% outpaced International growth of 3%, which was impacted by volatile conditions in Europe and adverse foreign exchange rates. 
Standard & Poor's Ratings continues to be the segment with the largest international presence in terms of dollars with 46% of revenue coming from outside the United States. Standard & Poor's Ratings is the largest business segment within McGraw-Hill Financial. Revenue for the segment grew 1% with a 7% increase in domestic revenue and a 6% decrease in International revenue. Nearly all of the decrease in International revenue was a result of foreign exchange rates. However, these rate changes had a negligible impact on operating profit. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, total revenue for the segment would've increased 3%. The operating margin was down year-over-year, but improved versus the first quarter. 
Transaction revenue increased 4% to $203 million. The key drivers to the increase in transaction revenue were the U.S. public finance issuance which increased 58%. You may recall that the muni market was adversely impacted back in the second quarter of 2011 by the perceived risk of a wave of muni defaults which did not come to fruition. The U.S. structured finance issuance, which increased 22%, due to the growth in asset-backed securities; and also CLOs, collateralized loan obligations. It is certainly encouraging to see the growth in structured products and we look for that to continue. U.S. corporate investment-grade issuance, which remain resilient and increased 7%. Offsetting this growth was U.S. corporate speculative grade issuance which decreased 39% as investments became more risk-averse. European corporate issuance, which decreased 36% and European structured finance issuance which decreased 60%. 
Nontransaction revenue, which represents 58% of second quarter revenue, decreased 2% primarily due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, nontransaction revenue increased 2%. 
It is becoming increasingly apparent that global debt issuance trends are diverging. While trends in the United States are increasingly encouraging, the picture in Europe continues to be quite volatile. With the exception of strong issuance in January and February as a result of the injection of liquidity into the Eurozone banking system by the ECB, issuance activity has been rather subdued. However, over the long term, the Ratings business outlook appears very encouraging, with numerous secular drivers of growth, including a large pipeline of maturing global corporate debt that will need to be refinanced; the shift in Europe from bank loans to public debt markets as banks face new regulations, as well as capital requirements; and finally, the structured finance market, which should recover with improved activity in the residential and the commercial real estate markets. 
However, there are a number of issues that continue to create considerable volatility, and these include the European financial crisis, risk aversion among some investors, sovereign debt levels and pending government regulations which create uncertainty. 
Our success on the litigation front has been encouraging. The trends that we have discussed in the past orderly conference calls continue. Two additional cases were dismissed in the second quarter, bringing the total dismissed to date at 29 cases. Seven dismissals by lower courts have been affirmed by higher courts and 10 cases have been voluntarily withdrawn. Among the dismissals was the litigation which was affirmed by the highest court in New York. Several dozen cases remain outstanding. We continue to believe that the legal risk of pending litigation remains low. 
On the regulatory and government front, the Ratings business remains an area of focus for regulators both in the United States and Europe. There are 3 principal items that we are monitoring. The first is CRA 3 in Europe. There remains the possibility of a mandatory rotation of rating agencies for structured finance products or a subset of these products. There's also a proposal for a new EU-wide liability standard, enabling investors who purchased investments to sue a credit rating agency that breaches the EU regulations intentionally or through gross negligence. 
Next is Dodd-Frank, which requires all U.S. regulations be changed to remove any reference to, or requirement of, reliance on credit ratings. Last is the Franklin amendment, which is being studied by the SEC. This amendment recommends establishing an organization to assign which NRSRO will provide the initial rating on each new structured finance product. 
As new regulations are considered in the global markets that we serve, we will continue to provide investors with high-quality forward-looking opinions about creditworthiness. In addition, the civil division of the Department of Justice and the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating potential violation of civil provisions of federal law regarding and relating to S&P's ratings of structured products. Of course, we have been in discussions with representatives of both the DOJ and the SEC and presenting our position on those issues. 
The Ratings segment is now past as its toughest revenue comparisons over the year, although we have a difficult expense comparison ahead of us in the third quarter, especially with exchange rate issues. With the investments that we have made in the business, along with our repositioning of our commercial mortgage-backed securities offering, we continue to work towards improvement improved performance of this very, very important business. 
Okay, with that, let me now turn to S&P Capital IQ/S&P Indices, the second largest segment within McGraw-Hill Financial. It delivered solid top and bottom line results with revenue and adjusted operating profit increasing 10% and 17%, respectively. Both S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices delivered year-over-year revenue growth with 74% of revenue coming from subscriptions, the same as a year ago. 
Looking at S&P Capital IQ alone, revenue increased 9%. A key driver of this growth was double-digit growth in S&P Capital IQ subscriptions, with solid growth at both Desktop Solutions, as well as Enterprise Solutions. In addition, both RatingsXpress and Global Credit Portal contributed to the growth. And as I mentioned, earlier during the quarter, we acquired Credit Market Analysis or CMA, and with CMA, we significant expanded our asset class coverage for data and pricing and added technology to move into live, intraday coverage of derivatives and other over-the-counter securities. 
We are continuously working to upgrade the S&P Capital IQ platform and there've been a number of new products and capabilities that have been launched recently. One that I would like to touch on briefly is in the area of counterparty risk. We have expanded the capabilities for measuring counterparty risk in the S&P Capital IQ platform. S&P Capital IQ credit analytics offers new capabilities for clients to produce even more dynamic risk measures to support their counterparty analysis with new and enhanced features for credit model, credit pro and credit risk tractor products, clients can stay on top of market movements in the credit risk space quickly and efficiently. 
And lastly, the integration of our recent acquisitions of R2 and QuantHouse are progressing well. We have effectively empowered R2 and QuantHouse to lead our efforts in the development of next-generation cross asset class portfolio analytics and low latency data capabilities, respectively. 
S&P Indices revenues increased 12%. We realized growth in trading volume of exchange-traded derivatives, as well as in assets under management for both mutual funds and exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices. Despite a turbulent stock market during the quarter, assets under management in the exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices increased 7% to $349 billion. This was driven by a 10% increase in a number of exchange-traded fund units which more than offset a decline in the net asset value per unit. 
During the quarter, 17 brand-new indices and 27 variants to existing indices were launched. Also, during the quarter, 11 new exchange-traded funds linked S&P Indices were launched, bringing the total of exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices to 430. These additions create new alternatives for investors and greater liquidity, obviously, to markets. 
At the end of the quarter, we launched the S&P Dow Jones Indices. This is our new joint venture with the CME Group. Here, you can see the full-page ad that ran in the Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal announcing the launch. Alex Matturri, a veteran of the index industry, who has been running our index business for a number of years, was named the CEO of S&P Dow Jones Indices. This joint venture will enable our clients to create investment products that offer new choices to investors. As a result of our 73% ownership of the joint venture, we will, for the first time, participate in the profitability of CME's execution and clearing. 
With the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture now in place, there are approximately $1.5 trillion directly linked to our indices and over 400 financial institutions that use our indices to build or price funds, swaps, notes, options, forwards and futures. We are proud that the S&P Dow Jones Indices is home to some of the most widely followed and most trusted indices in the world. 
Now let me turn to the Commodities & Commercial group, which delivered year-over-year operating profit gains that led all segments. Revenue growth was 9% with International revenue up 16%. The leverage of the business is very evident and along with cost reductions, resulted in an operating margins that increased almost 700 basis points to over 29%. 
Within Commodities, subscriptions for petroleum, natural gas and steel products drove the 19% increase in revenue. We have capitalized on the acquisitions of BENTEK Energy and the Steel Business Briefing Group to take advantage of cross-selling opportunities. In addition, due to volatility in the oil markets, we realized revenue growth from increased trading of future contracts linked to Platts pricing. Our Commodities business is now approaching $0.5 billion on an annualized basis and is poised for further growth. 
Commercial's revenue decreased 1%. J.D. Power's revenue growth was offset by modest declines in the remainder of the portfolio. The revenue growth at J.D. Power was a result of growth in the power information network or PIN, and claims in syndicated reports. The widely followed J.D. Power initial quality study was released this quarter in its 26th year. The study is purchased by virtually all of the world's major automotive manufacturers and results in meaningful ad claims from many of the companies whose automobiles ranked highest in each category. I'm pleased to say J.D. Power is on its way to its best year ever. 
Okay, with that, let me turn to Education and McGraw-Hill Education. McGraw-Hill Education reported a 12% decline in revenue, yet delivered a 36% increase in segment operating profit. The revenue decline occurred largely at School Education Group. We continue to expect a 10% decline in the K-12 market this year, which will represent, in our opinion, the lowest spending level in over a decade and gives us opportunities looking ahead. 
Despite this difficult market, the segment delivered cost reductions that overcame the revenue shortfall, enabled us to deliver solid growth in operating profit. Our focus is to ensure that the business has a cost structure that is appropriate for such challenging market realities and provides the flexibility to invest to accelerate digital development. Product development continues to focus on providing innovative digital learning materials for our customers. As a result of the increased sales of digital products, many of which are subscription-based, our deferred revenue has become more pronounced, increasing by approximately $50 million year-over-year. 
The Higher Education, Professional and International Group reported a 2% decrease in revenue. Revenue growth at Higher Education was offset by declines at International, which was almost entirely due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Higher Education now has 1.4 million digital users, an increase of 40% as Digital Products continue to displace books. 
One noteworthy product, McGraw-Hill Connect, which is a homework management platform, grew by 65%. It enables instructors to create assignments and track student performance and provides a range of digital learning tools such as LearnSmart that improves student learning. LearnSmart is an adaptive learning system that is available for approximately 150 different college course titles. 
The School Education Group reported a 20% decline and that was in revenue from the prior year, with decreases occurring in both instructional materials and testing. The key third quarter selling season is underway and our view of the market, as I said a moment ago, remains unchanged. We continue to believe 2012 will be the low watermark in the K-12 space and the market should begin to show a modest recovery as we get into 2013. 
Over the next couple of years, we anticipate that demand for our Common Core compliant materials will increase as school districts prepare for the new test that take effect in the spring of 2013. 46 states have adopted the Common Core State Standards and each have prepared their students for these contests. Our testing business was selected by the smarter balanced assessment consortium to develop its suite of language, arts and mathematics test items for the new Common Core assessments. Smarter balance is 1 of 2 state web consortia funded by the U.S. Department of Education to develop assessment tools to help states gauge student progress towards meeting the new Common Core Standards. Together, with a co-contractor, we are also developing test items for the second federally funded test consortium, which is called the partnership for assessment of readiness for college and careers. 
We're setting up the Education business to thrive as a stand-alone company. We're putting in place the cost structure and digital capabilities necessary for the McGraw-Hill Education to lead the transformation of the industry, and we are absolutely thrilled to have Buzz Waterhouse and Pat Milano in place to lead this effort, along with the entire team. 
In summary, The McGraw-Hill Companies is off to a very strong start with record first half adjusted diluted earnings per share. McGraw-Hill Financial should continue to deliver solid top and bottom line growth. We continue to build new capabilities to deliver organic growth while pursuing bolt-on acquisitions to add additional expertise and capabilities or move into new markets. 
McGraw-Hill Education will focus on all that is required to become a stand-alone company. We are creating a cost structure that is rightsized to serve the education market and building out our unique set of Digital Products to meet the needs of our customers. Our intent is to position this business for longer-term growth as the market recovers and the digital shift accelerates. 
The company will remain focused on delivering on its Growth and Value Plan and continue to work towards the completion of the spinoff of McGraw-Hill Education by the end of the year. And to say the least, 2012 will be remembered as a very important inflection point in our company's history. And I'm very pleased with the results of both the first, and now, the second quarter record results. 
Okay, let me leave it there. That completes my prepared remarks, and I will now ask Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, to update you on some of our key financials. Jack?"
21719,213792787,331298,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. This morning, I want to provide additional detail on our consolidated results, including cash flow and provide additional detail on the progress in onetime costs in the implementation of the Growth and Value Plan. Let me begin by discu",1448,"Thank you, Terry. This morning, I want to provide additional detail on our consolidated results, including cash flow and provide additional detail on the progress in onetime costs in the implementation of the Growth and Value Plan. 
Let me begin by discussing our consolidated results. Revenue decreased 1% year-over-year. However, it was more than offset by a 5% year-over-year decrease in overall adjusted expenses. The decrease in expenses was primarily the result of the Growth and Value Plan cost-reduction initiatives that began in the fourth quarter of 2011 and will continue into next year. As a result, consolidated adjusted operating profit increased 14% and consolidated adjusted operating margins increased over 300 basis points to 26.3%. Obviously, we are pleased with the progress thus far in margin expansion. 
To summarize the operating results Terry just reviewed, there was continued revenue growth at McGraw-Hill Financial of 5%, with margins that expanded 140 basis points, delivering strong adjusted operating profit growth of 9%. For McGraw-Hill Education, while there was a 12% decline in revenue, margins expanded 420 basis points based on the meaningful cost initiatives that began with the significant restructuring of the business in the fourth quarter of last year. All businesses did benefit from a reduction in employee-related costs due to the realignment of our retirement programs. 
The share repurchase program remains an important aspect of the Growth and Value Plan, and the impact was evident again this quarter. Year-over-year, we reduced shares outstanding by 24 million shares. This amplified a 15% increase in adjusted net income to a 25% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share or $0.85 per share. Since the beginning of 2011 through the second quarter of 2012, the company has repurchased nearly 36 million shares at a weighted average price of $42.05. This reduced shares outstanding by approximately 12%. 
Apart from the completion of the accelerated share repurchase program in April, no other shares were repurchased in the quarter. However, we do anticipate resuming share repurchases over the back half of the year, which will provide continued EPS leverage into next year. 
We continue to have a very strong balance sheet, with approximately $840 million in cash and short-term investments. Year-over-year, our free cash flow was down. This decrease was largely the result of a temporary acceleration of payments of approximately $100 million to vendors associated with the transition to a new accounting system, as well as $65 million of cash outlays associated with the Growth and Value Plan. On a full year basis, we fully expect to deliver solid free cash flow. Our guidance of approximately $750 million, excluding cash outlays associated with the Growth and Value Plan, remains unchanged. 
Now let me provide some additional details around the execution of the Growth and Value Plan. During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our target of at least $100 million in run rate cost savings by the end of 2012. The actions taken over the last several quarters drove in part the cost reductions that were realized in the second quarter. Year-over-year, total adjusted expenses decreased 5%. As I mentioned, earlier, one important component of this was the realignment of our U.S. Pension Plan that took effect on April 1. 
As we formed 2 new companies, we need to separate several critical support operations that are currently shared. The next important round of cost savings will benefit from the realignment of these operations. We currently have 15 work streams underway to implement cost savings in the area of accounting, purchasing, information technology, human resources and real estate. We already deepened the implementation of these plans and we anticipate the realization of these cost reduction benefits by the time separation occurs in the latter part of this year. 
During the second quarter, we incurred $42 million of onetime Growth and Value Plan costs that we noted in this morning's press release. They include $19 million for Professional fees, $15 million for deal fees and $8 million for severance. We anticipate that for the remainder of the year, we will incur an additional $80 million of onetime separation expenses necessary to implement the Growth and Value Plan. These onetime expenses are largely professional fees as we need to support our various consultants, business process and information technology firms and financial advisors. Please keep in mind, this is a working estimate. 
In addition, we anticipate that during 2012, we will continue to incur restructuring costs as part of our ongoing cost reduction initiatives. While the timing of these actions is still fluid, restructuring expense for 2012 could be up to approximately $65 million over the balance of the year. 
The Form 10 was filed several weeks ago and outlined many aspects of the separation. There are a few key financial items that I would like to draw your attention to. McGraw-Hill Financial will retain all of the outstanding long-term debt, as well as substantially all of the cash on hand at the time of the spin. Concurrent with the spin, we anticipate the McGraw-Hill Education will issue up to $600 million in new debt, likely a mix of bank term loans and public debt. McGraw-Hill Education will retain approximately $100 million of cash and issue a onetime dividend to McGraw-Hill Financial for up to $500 million. McGraw-Hill Education will also establish revolving credit line. This, along with $100 million of newly raised cash, should provide McGraw-Hill Education with ample liquidity to meet its business needs. 
Along with receiving the onetime dividend of up to $500 million, McGraw-Hill Financial will retain all of the pension liabilities which are now largely frozen plans for both companies, as well as other selected liabilities to simplify separation. In the spin, our goal is to provide the Education business with balance sheet flexibility to support its long-term growth potential. 
As we now look to the back half of the year, there are a couple of items that I want to point out. First, as I mentioned earlier, we plan on resuming share repurchases. Our plan is to repurchase up to 500 million in the second half of the year. As always, share repurchases are subject to appropriate market conditions. 
Another item that I want to highlight is the financial impact of our new joint venture, S&P Dow Jones Indices. The transaction was closed at the end of June, and as such, our balance sheet reflects $792 million of additional net assets. It was closed on the last business day in the quarter, such that the income statement impact was negligible. We anticipate that by the end of the third quarter, the net income attributable to noncontrolling interest line on the income statement will become more prominent. Since we own 73% of the joint venture, we will consolidate the entire business in our income statement. 27% of the joint venture net income is then removed and recorded as net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. Obviously, we will review the impact of this exciting new venture with CMA, once there are operating results to review on the third quarter call. 
In closing, our outlook for the balance of 2012 remains positive. We're executing upon the Growth and Value Plan that we laid out late last year. At the same time, we delivered record first half adjusted earnings per share. While there is an inclination to raise guidance after such a strong first half, we need to be mindful that the third quarter, our largest of the year, is still ahead of us. This is the key quarter for McGraw-Hill Education as schools across the U.S. purchase the lion's share of educational materials for the upcoming school year. Therefore, we believe it is prudent to keep our guidance unchanged with diluted adjusted earnings per share of $3.25 to $3.35. Although based on the strong first half, we now anticipate being near the high end of that range. 
Our cost reduction efforts will continue and we fully expect to deliver on our target of at least $100 million in run rate cost savings by the end of the year. Executing on all the aspects of the Growth and Value Plan remains our highest priority and we continue to anticipate completing the separation into 2 powerful industry leaders, McGraw-Hill Education and McGraw-Hill Financial, by year end. We are doing all the work to support a spin of McGraw-Hill Education by year end. We are also evaluating other options to deliver shareholder value, including a potential sale. We will update the market as appropriate in the coming months. 
With that, thank you for joining the call this morning. And now let me turn the call back over to the Chip Merritt to moderate the Q&A."

Joining me today on the conference call is Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Jack and I will review our corporate results, provide an update on our Growth and Value Plan progress, provide a detailed look at the segment results that make up what will be McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education, and then provide an outlook for the balance of the year. 
Three months ago, I was able to share record first quarter earnings. I couldn't be more pleased today to share with you our record second quarter earnings. What makes these results particularly noteworthy is that they occurred during a period of tremendous volatility in the debt markets as a result of the European debt crisis and in a year in which we are experiencing the weakest state funding for textbooks in the past decade. To say the least, our employees are to be commended for delivering these results in today's very challenging global economic environment while simultaneously advancing the separation and implementing major cost reduction programs. 
During the second quarter, despite revenue that was modestly below a year ago, we delivered adjusted operating profit growth of 14% from both increased revenue in Commodities & Commercial, S&P Capital IQ, S&P Indices, as well as an acceleration of cost reductions that were realized during the quarter. Our recent aggressive share repurchase program amplified this growth. And we delivered 25% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth, and Jack will provide additional detail on that in just a moment. 
The primary focus of the company remains this: on delivering on the Growth and Value Plan. As part of this effort, we continue to progress toward the creation of 2 powerful new companies: one, McGraw-Hill Education; and the other, McGraw-Hill Financial, and doing so in 2012. Steady progress has been made on the Growth and Value Plan during the second quarter. Key management has been put in place at McGraw-Hill Education, and that includes Buzz Waterhouse as President and CEO, and Pat Milano as CFO and Chief Administrative Officer. Buzz brings a wealth of both technology and education experience, while Pat brings the financial expertise, coupled with a deep knowledge of McGraw-Hill given his long tenure. Both are terrific leaders, and I can't say enough about them and the team that we've put in place. 
The Form 10 registration statement was filed with the SEC several weeks ago. Consolidated cost reductions accelerated in the second quarter, with total company adjusted expenses decreasing 5% versus the second quarter of 2011, resulting in an increase in margins. These cost reduction actions and others currently underway keep us on track to delivering at least $100 million in cost savings on a run-rate basis by year-end. 
Also, as part of the Growth and Value Plan, we are working on more than just cost reduction and separation. Strategic investments are an important component, and we made several during the quarter to accelerate long-term growth. We launched the S&P Dow Jones Indices, combining 2 iconic brands that will continue to deliver index-based solutions for global investors. It is a very exciting joint venture with a wonderful partner in the CME and should deliver annual revenues in 2013, in its first full year, of approximately $0.5 billion with great margins. Since the deal closed in late June, the impact on the second quarter earnings was minimal. 
We acquired Credit Market Analysis Limited, or CMA, a leading provider of clear, reliable over-the-counter credit pricing and related information from the CME. This adds another foundational benchmark capability to our portfolio. The business will be reported within S&P Capital IQ. 
Our India-based credit rating agency, CRISIL, announced the acquisition of Coalition Development Ltd. Coalition provides high-end analytics primarily to global investment banks. It is a London-based company with considerable operations in India. 
From a corporate development standpoint, we have been very active in adding new capabilities to the company. Along with S&P Dow Jones Indices, CMA and Coalition, which I've just discussed, we had acquisitions of R2 and QuantHouse earlier this year, both in S&P Capital IQ. 
Overall, the Growth and Value Plan has a comprehensive set of integrated initiatives, which includes separation, cost reduction, share repurchases, as well as funding both organic growth and tuck-in acquisitions. I am pleased with the progress so far this year, and I'm excited about the prospects for the future of both companies as we complete this process. 
With that, let me turn to the business results, and I'll go through each of the various business areas. Let me start. 
McGraw-Hill Financial, on a pro forma basis, delivered a 5% increase in revenue and a 9% increase in adjusted operating profit during the quarter. While all 3 segments delivered revenue growth, it was S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices, along with Commodities & Commercial, that provided the operating profit growth. Cost-reduction benefits were realized across all segments. McGraw-Hill Financial derived 40% of its revenues from outside the United States during the second quarter. Domestic revenue growth of 7% outpaced international growth of 3%, which was impacted by volatile conditions in Europe and adverse foreign exchange rates. 
Standard & Poor's Ratings continues to be the segment with the largest international presence in terms of dollars, with 46% of revenue coming from outside the United States. Standard & Poor's Ratings is the largest business segment within McGraw-Hill Financial. Revenue for the segment grew 1%, with a 7% increase in domestic revenue and a 6% decrease in international revenue. Nearly all of the decrease in international revenue was a result of foreign exchange rates. However, these rate changes had a negligible impact on operating profit. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, total revenue for the segment would've increased 3%. The operating margin was down year-over-year but improved versus the first quarter. 
Transaction revenue increased 4% to $203 million. The key drivers to the increase in transaction revenue were the U.S. public finance issuance, which increased 58%. You may recall that the muni market was adversely impacted back in the second quarter of 2011 by the perceived risk of a wave of muni defaults which did not come to fruition. The U.S. structured finance issuance, which increased 22% due to the growth in asset-backed securities and also CLOs, collateralized loan obligations. It is certainly encouraging to see the growth in structured products, and we look for that to continue. U.S. corporate investment-grade issuance, which remained resilient and increased 7%. Offsetting this growth was U.S. corporate speculative-grade issuance, which decreased 39% as investments became more risk averse; European corporate issuance, which decreased 36%; and European structured finance issuance, which decreased 60%. 
Non-transaction revenue, which represents 58% of second quarter revenue, decreased 2%, primarily due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, non-transaction revenue increased 2%. 
It is becoming increasingly apparent that global debt issuance trends are diverging. While trends in the United States are increasingly encouraging, the picture in Europe continues to be quite volatile. With the exception of strong issuance in January and February as a result of the injection of liquidity into the Eurozone banking system by the ECB, issuance activity has been rather subdued. 
However, over the long term, the Ratings business outlook appears very encouraging, with numerous secular drivers of growth, including a large pipeline of maturing global corporate debt that will need to be refinanced; the shift in Europe from bank loans to public debt markets as banks face new regulations, as well as capital requirements; and finally, the structured finance market, which should recover with improved activity in the residential and the commercial real estate markets. 
However, there are a number of issues that continue to create considerable volatility, and these include the European financial crisis, risk aversion among some investors, sovereign debt levels and pending government regulations which create uncertainty. 
Our success on the litigation front has been encouraging. The trends that we have discussed in the past quarterly conference calls continue. Two additional cases were dismissed in the second quarter, bringing the total dismissed to-date at 29 cases. Seven dismissals by lower courts have been affirmed by higher courts, and 10 cases have been voluntarily withdrawn. Among the dismissals was the Oddo litigation, which was affirmed by the highest court in New York. Several dozen cases remain outstanding. We continue to believe that the legal risk of pending litigation remains low. 
On the regulatory and government front, the Ratings business remains an area of focus for regulators, both in the United States and Europe. There are 3 principal items that we are monitoring. The first is CRA3 in Europe. That -- there remains the possibility of a mandatory rotation of rating agencies for structured finance products or a subset of these products. There's also a proposal for a new EU-wide liability standard, enabling investors who purchased investments to sue a credit rating agency that breaches the EU regulations intentionally or through gross negligence. Next is Dodd-Frank, which requires all U.S. regulations be changed to remove any reference to, or requirement of, reliance on credit ratings. Last is the Franken Amendment, which is being studied by the SEC. This amendment recommends establishing an organization to assign which NRSRO will provide the initial rating on each new structured finance product. As new regulations are considered in the global markets that we serve, we will continue to provide investors with high-quality forward-looking opinions about creditworthiness. 
In addition, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice and the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating potential violation of civil provisions of federal law regarding and relating to S&P's ratings of structured products. Of course, we have been in discussions with representatives of both the DOJ and the SEC and presenting our position on those issues. 
The Ratings segment is now past its toughest revenue comparisons of the year, although we have a difficult expense comparison ahead of us in the third quarter, especially with the exchange rate issues. With the investments that we have made in the business, along with our repositioning of our commercial mortgage-backed securities offering, we continue to work towards improved performance of this very, very important business. 
Okay, with that, let me now turn to S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices, the second largest segment within McGraw-Hill Financial. It delivered solid top and bottom line results, with revenue and adjusted operating profit increasing 10% and 17%, respectively. Both S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices delivered year-over-year revenue growth, with 74% of revenue coming from subscriptions, the same as a year ago. 
Looking at S&P Capital IQ alone, revenue increased 9%. A key driver of this growth was double-digit growth in S&P Capital IQ subscriptions, with solid growth at both Desktop Solutions, as well as Enterprise Solutions. In addition, both RatingsXpress and Global Credit Portal contributed to the growth. And as I've mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we acquired Credit Market Analysis, or CMA. And with CMA, we significantly expanded our asset class coverage for data and pricing and added technology to move into live intraday coverage of derivatives and other over-the-counter securities. 
We are continuously working to upgrade the S&P Capital IQ platform. And there have been a number of new products and capabilities that have been launched recently. One that I would like to touch on briefly is in the area of counterparty risk. We have expanded the capabilities for measuring counterparty risk in the S&P Capital IQ platform. S&P Capital IQ credit analytics offers new capabilities for clients to produce even more dynamic risk measures to support their counterparty analysis. With new and enhanced features for credit model, credit pro and credit risk tractor products, clients can stay on top of market movements in the credit risk space quickly and efficiently. And lastly, the integration of our recent acquisitions of R2 and QuantHouse are progressing well. We have effectively empowered R2 and QuantHouse to lead our efforts in the development of next-generation cross-asset class portfolio analytics and low latency data capabilities, respectively. 
S&P Indices revenues increased 12%. We realized growth in trading volume of exchange-traded derivatives, as well as in assets under management, for both mutual funds and exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices. Despite a turbulent stock market during the quarter, assets under management in the exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices increased 7% to $349 billion. This was driven by a 10% increase in a number of exchange-traded fund units, which more than offset a decline in the net asset value per unit during the quarter, 17 brand-new indices and 27 variants to existing indices were launched. Also, during the quarter, 11 new exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices were launched, bringing the total of exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices to 430. These additions create new alternatives for investors and greater liquidity, obviously, to markets. 
At the end of the quarter, we launched the S&P Dow Jones Indices. This is our new joint venture with the CME Group. Here, you can see the full-page ad that ran in the Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal announcing the launch. Alex Matturri, a veteran of the index industry, who has been running our index business for a number of years, was named the CEO of S&P Dow Jones Indices. This joint venture will enable our clients to create investment products that offer new choices to investors. As a result of our 73% ownership of the joint venture, we will, for the first time, participate in the profitability of CME's execution and clearing. 
With the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture now in place, there are approximately $1.5 trillion directly linked to our indices and over 400 financial institutions that use our indices to build or price funds, swaps, notes, options, forwards and futures. We are proud that the S&P Dow Jones Indices is home to some of the most widely followed and most trusted indices in the world. 
Now let me turn to the Commodities & Commercial Group, which delivered year-over-year operating profit gains that led all segments. Revenue growth was 9%, with international revenue up 16%. The leverage of the business is very evident and, along with cost reductions, resulted in operating margins that increased almost 700 basis points to over 29%. 
Within Commodities, subscriptions for petroleum, natural gas and steel products drove the 19% increase in revenue. We have capitalized on the acquisitions of BENTEK Energy and the Steel Business Briefing Group to take advantage of cross-selling opportunities. In addition, due to volatility in the oil markets, we realized revenue growth from increased trading of future contracts linked to Platts' pricing. Our Commodities business is now approaching $0.5 billion on an annualized basis and is poised for further growth. 
Commercial's revenue decreased 1%. J.D. Power's revenue growth was offset by modest declines in the remainder of the portfolio. The revenue growth at J.D. Power was a result of growth in the Power Information Network, or PIN, Ad Claims and syndicated reports. The widely followed J.D. Power initial quality study was released this quarter in its 26th year. The study is purchased by virtually all of the world's major automotive manufacturers and results in meaningful ad claims from many of the companies whose automobiles rank highest in each category. I'm pleased to say J.D. Power is on its way to its best year ever. 
Okay, with that, let me turn to Education -- in McGraw-Hill Education. McGraw-Hill Education reported a 12% decline in revenue yet delivered a 36% increase in segment operating profit. The revenue decline occurred largely at School Education Group. We continue to expect a 10% decline in the K-12 market this year, which will represent, in our opinion, the lowest spending level in over a decade and gives us opportunities looking ahead. Despite this difficult market, the segment delivered cost reductions that overcame the revenue shortfall, enabled us to deliver solid growth in operating profit. Our focus is to ensure that the business has a cost structure that is appropriate for such challenging market realities and provides the flexibility to invest to accelerate digital development. Product development continues to focus on providing innovative digital learning materials for our customers. As a result of the increased sales of digital products, many of which are subscription-based, our deferred revenue has become more pronounced, increasing by approximately $50 million year-over-year. 
The Higher Education, Professional and International Group reported a 2% decrease in revenue. Revenue growth at Higher Education was offset by declines at International, which was almost entirely due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Higher Education now has 1.4 million digital users, an increase of 40%, as digital products continue to displace books. 
One noteworthy product, McGraw-Hill Connect, which is a homework management platform, grew by 65%. It enables instructors to create assignments and track student performance and provides a range of digital learning tools, such as LearnSmart, that improves student learning. LearnSmart is an adaptive learning system that is available for approximately 150 different college course titles. 
The School Education Group reported a 20% decline, and that was in revenue from the prior year, with decreases occurring in both instructional materials and testing. The key third quarter selling season is underway, and our view of the market, as I said a moment ago, remains unchanged. We continue to believe 2012 will be the low watermark in the K-12 space, and the market should begin to show a modest recovery as we get into 2013. 
Over the next couple of years, we anticipate that a demand for our Common Core-compliant materials will increase as school districts prepare for the new tests that take effect in the spring of 2015. 46 states have adopted the Common Core State Standards and need to prepare their students for these new tests. Our testing business was selected by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium to develop its suite of language, arts and mathematics test items for the new Common Core Assessments. Smarter Balanced is 1 of 2 state web consortia funded by the U.S. Department of Education to develop assessment tools to help states gauge student progress towards meeting the new Common Core Standards. Together, with a co-contractor, we are also developing test items for the second federally funded test consortium, which is called the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers. 
We're setting up the Education business to thrive as a stand-alone company. We're putting in place the cost structure and digital capabilities necessary for the McGraw-Hill Education to lead the transformation of the industry. And we are absolutely thrilled to have Buzz Waterhouse and Pat Milano in place to lead this effort, along with the entire team. 
In summary, The McGraw-Hill Companies is off to a very strong start with record first half adjusted diluted earnings per share. McGraw-Hill Financial should continue to deliver solid top and bottom line growth. We continue to build new capabilities to deliver organic growth while pursuing bolt-on acquisitions to add additional expertise and capabilities or move into new markets. 
McGraw-Hill Education will focus on all that is required to become a stand-alone company. We are creating a cost structure that is rightsized to serve the education market and building out our unique set of digital products to meet the needs of our customers. Our intent is to position this business for longer-term growth as the market recovers and the digital shift accelerates. 
The company will remain focused on delivering on its Growth and Value Plan and continue to work towards the completion of the spinoff of McGraw-Hill Education by the end of the year. And to say the least, 2012 will be remembered as a very important inflection point in our company's history. And I'm very pleased with the results of both the first and, now, the second quarter record results. 
Okay, let me leave it there. That completes my prepared remarks, and I will now ask Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, to update you on some of our key financials. Jack?"
21719,213792787,331501,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. This morning, I want to provide additional detail on our consolidated results, including cash flow, and provide additional detail on the progress in one-time costs in the implementation of the Growth and Value Plan. Let me begin by dis",1447,"Thank you, Terry. This morning, I want to provide additional detail on our consolidated results, including cash flow, and provide additional detail on the progress in one-time costs in the implementation of the Growth and Value Plan. 
Let me begin by discussing our consolidated results. Revenue decreased 1% year-over-year. However, it was more than offset by a 5% year-over-year decrease in overall adjusted expenses. The decrease in expenses was primarily the result of the Growth and Value Plan cost-reduction initiatives that began in the fourth quarter of 2011 and will continue into next year. As a result, consolidated adjusted operating profit increased 14% and consolidated adjusted operating margins increased over 300 basis points to 26.3%. Obviously, we are pleased with the progress thus far in margin expansion. 
To summarize the operating results Terry just reviewed, there was continued revenue growth at McGraw-Hill Financial of 5%, with margins that expanded 140 basis points, delivering strong adjusted operating profit growth of 9%. For McGraw-Hill Education, while there was a 12% decline in revenue, margins expanded 420 basis points based on the meaningful cost initiatives that began with the significant restructuring of the business in the fourth quarter of last year. All businesses did benefit from a reduction in employee-related costs due to the realignment of our retirement programs. 
The share repurchase program remains an important aspect of the Growth and Value Plan, and the impact was evident again this quarter. Year-over-year, we reduced shares outstanding by 24 million shares. This amplified a 15% increase in adjusted net income to a 25% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share or $0.85 per share. Since the beginning of 2011 through the second quarter of 2012, the company has repurchased nearly 36 million shares at a weighted average price of $42.05. This reduced shares outstanding by approximately 12%. Apart from the completion of the accelerated share repurchase program in April, no other shares were repurchased in the quarter. However, we do anticipate resuming share repurchases over the back half of the year, which will provide continued EPS leverage into next year. 
We continue to have a very strong balance sheet, with approximately $840 million in cash and short-term investments. Year-over-year, our free cash flow was down. This decrease was largely the result of a temporary acceleration of payments of approximately $100 million to the vendors associated with the transition to a new accounting system, as well as $65 million of cash outlays associated with the Growth and Value Plan. On a full year basis, we fully expect to deliver solid free cash flow. Our guidance of approximately $750 million, excluding cash outlays associated with the Growth and Value Plan, remains unchanged. 
Now let me provide some additional details around the execution of the Growth and Value Plan. During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our target of at least $100 million in run rate cost savings by the end of 2012. The actions taken over the last several quarters drove, in part, the cost reductions that were realized in the second quarter. Year-over-year, total adjusted expenses decreased 5%. As I mentioned earlier, one important component of this was the realignment of our U.S. pension plan that took effect on April 1. 
As we form 2 new companies, we need to separate several critical support operations that are currently shared. The next important round of cost savings will benefit from the realignment of these operations. We currently have 15 work streams underway to implement cost savings in the area of accounting, purchasing, information technology, human resources and real estate. We are already deepening the implementation of these plans, and we anticipate the realization of these cost reduction benefits by the time separation occurs in the latter part of this year. 
During the second quarter, we incurred $42 million of one-time Growth and Value Plan costs that we noted in this morning's press release. They include $19 million for professional fees, $15 million for deal fees and $8 million for severance. We anticipate that for the remainder of the year, we will incur an additional $80 million of one-time separation expenses necessary to implement the Growth and Value Plan. These one-time expenses are largely professional fees, as we need to support  various consultants, business process and information technology firms and financial advisors. Please keep in mind, this is a working estimate. In addition, we anticipate that during 2012, we will continue to incur restructuring costs as part of our ongoing cost reduction initiatives. While the timing of these actions is still fluid, restructuring expense for 2012 could be up to approximately $65 million over the balance of the year. 
The Form 10 was filed several weeks ago and outlined many aspects of the separation. There are a few key financial items that I would like to draw your attention to. McGraw-Hill Financial will retain all of the outstanding long-term debt, as well as substantially all of the cash on hand at the time of the spin. Concurrent with the spin, we anticipate the McGraw-Hill Education will issue up to $600 million in new debt, likely a mix of bank term loans and public debt. McGraw-Hill Education will retain approximately $100 million of cash and issue a one-time dividend to McGraw-Hill Financial for up to $500 million. McGraw-Hill Education will also establish revolving credit line. This, along with the $100 million of newly raised cash, should provide McGraw-Hill Education with ample liquidity to meet its business needs. Along with receiving the one-time dividend of up to $500 million, McGraw-Hill Financial will retain all of the pension liabilities, which are now largely frozen plans for both companies, as well as other selected liabilities, to simplify separation. In the spin, our goal is to provide the Education business with balance sheet flexibility to support its long-term growth potential. 
As we now look to the back half of the year, there are a couple items that I want to point out. First, as I mentioned earlier, we plan on resuming share repurchases. Our plan is to repurchase up to 500 million in the second half of the year. As always, share repurchases are subject to appropriate market conditions.
Another item that I want to highlight is the financial impact of our new joint venture, S&P Dow Jones Indices. The transaction was closed at the end of June, and as such, our balance sheet reflects $792 million of additional net assets. It was closed on the last business day in the quarter, such that the income statement impact was negligible. We anticipate that by the end of the third quarter, the net income attributable to noncontrolling interest line on the income statement will become more prominent. Since we own 73% of the joint venture, we will consolidate the entire business in our income statement. 27% of the joint venture net income is then removed and recorded as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Obviously, we will review the impact of this exciting new venture with CME once there are operating results to review on the third quarter call. 
In closing, our outlook for the balance of 2012 remains positive. We are executing upon the Growth and Value Plan that we laid out late last year. At the same time, we delivered record first half adjusted earnings per share. While there is an inclination to raise guidance after such a strong first half, we need to be mindful that the third quarter, our largest of the year, is still ahead of us. This is the key quarter for McGraw-Hill Education as schools across the U.S. purchase the lion's share of educational materials for the upcoming school year. Therefore, we believe it is prudent to keep our guidance unchanged, with diluted adjusted earnings per share of $3.25 to $3.35, although based on the strong first half, we now anticipate being near the high end of that range. Our cost reduction efforts will continue, and we fully expect to deliver on our target of at least $100 million in run rate cost savings by the end of the year. Executing on all the aspects of the Growth and Value Plan remains our highest priority. And we continue to anticipate completing the separation into 2 powerful industry leaders, McGraw-Hill Education and McGraw-Hill Financial, by year-end. We are doing all the work to support a spin of McGraw-Hill Education by year-end. We are also evaluating other options to deliver shareholder value, including a potential sale.

Joining me today on the conference call is Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Jack and I will review our corporate results, provide an update on our Growth and Value Plan progress, provide a detailed look at the segment results that make up what will be McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education, and then provide an outlook for the balance of the year. 
Three months ago, I was able to share record first quarter earnings. I couldn't be more pleased today to share with you our record second quarter earnings. What makes these results particularly noteworthy is that they occurred during a period of tremendous volatility in the debt markets as a result of European debt crisis and in a year in which we are experiencing the weakest state funding for textbooks in the past decade. To say the least, our employees are to be commended for delivering these results in today's very challenging global economic environment while simultaneously advancing the separation and implementing major cost reduction programs. 
During the second quarter, despite revenue that was modestly below a year ago, we delivered adjusted operating profit growth of 14% from both increased revenue in Commodities & Commercial, S&P Capital IQ, S&P Indices, as well as an acceleration of cost reductions that were realized during the quarter. Our recent aggressive share repurchase program amplified this growth. And we delivered 25% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth, and Jack will provide additional detail on that in just a moment. 
The primary focus of the company remains this: on delivering on the Growth and Value Plan. As part of this effort, we continue to progress toward the creation of 2 powerful new companies: one, McGraw-Hill Education; and the other, McGraw-Hill Financial, and doing so in 2012. Steady progress has been made on the Growth and Value Plan during the second quarter. Key management has been put in place at McGraw-Hill Education, and that includes Buzz Waterhouse as President and CEO and Pat Milano as CFO and Chief Administrative Officer. Buzz brings a wealth of both technology and education experience, while Pat brings the financial expertise, coupled with a deep knowledge of McGraw-Hill given his long tenure. Both are terrific leaders, and I can't say enough about them and the team that we've put in place. 
The Form 10 registration statement was filed with the SEC several weeks ago. Consolidated cost reductions accelerated in the second quarter, with total company adjusted expenses decreasing 5% versus the second quarter of 2011, resulting in an increase in margins. These cost reduction actions and others currently underway keep us on track to delivering at least $100 million in cost savings on a run-rate basis by year-end. 
Also, as part of the Growth and Value Plan, we are working on more than just cost reduction and separation. Strategic investments are an important component, and we made several during the quarter to accelerate long-term growth. We launched the S&P Dow Jones Indices, combining 2 iconic brands that will continue to deliver index-based solutions for global investors. It is a very exciting joint venture with a wonderful partner in the CME and should deliver annual revenues in 2013, in its first full year, of approximately $0.5 billion with great margins. Since the deal closed in late June, the impact on the second quarter earnings was minimal. 
We acquired Credit Market Analysis Limited, or CMA, a leading provider of clear, reliable over-the-counter credit pricing and related information from the CME. This adds another foundational benchmark capability to our portfolio. The business will be reported within S&P Capital IQ. 
Our India-based credit rating agency, CRISIL, announced the acquisition of Coalition Development Ltd. Coalition provides high-end analytics primarily to global investment banks. It is a London-based company with considerable operations in India. 
From a corporate development standpoint, we have been very active in adding new capabilities to the company. Along with S&P Dow Jones Indices, CMA and Coalition, which I've just discussed, we had acquisitions of R2 and QuantHouse earlier this year, both in S&P Capital IQ. 
Overall, the Growth and Value Plan is a comprehensive set of integrated initiatives which includes separation, cost reduction, share repurchases, as well as funding both organic growth and tuck-in acquisitions. I am pleased with the progress so far this year, and I'm excited about the prospects for the future of both companies as we complete this process. 
With that, let me turn to the business results, and I'll go through each of the various business areas. Let me start. 
McGraw-Hill Financial, on a pro forma basis, delivered a 5% increase in revenue and a 9% increase in adjusted operating profit during the quarter. While all 3 segments delivered revenue growth, it was S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices, along with Commodities & Commercial, that provided the operating profit growth. Cost-reduction benefits were realized across all segments. McGraw-Hill Financial derived 40% of its revenues from outside the United States during the second quarter. Domestic revenue growth of 7% outpaced international growth of 3%, which was impacted by volatile conditions in Europe and adverse foreign exchange rates. 
Standard & Poor's Ratings continues to be the segment with the largest international presence in terms of dollars, with 46% of revenue coming from outside the United States. Standard & Poor's Ratings is the largest business segment within McGraw-Hill Financial. Revenue for the segment grew 1%, with a 7% increase in domestic revenue and a 6% decrease in international revenue. Nearly all of the decrease in international revenue was a result of foreign exchange rates. However, these rate changes had a negligible impact on operating profit. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, total revenue for the segment would've increased 3%. The operating margin was down year-over-year but improved versus the first quarter. 
Transaction revenue increased 4% to $203 million. The key drivers to the increase in transaction revenue were the U.S. public finance issuance, which increased 58%. You may recall that the muni market was adversely impacted back in the second quarter of 2011 by the perceived risk of a wave of muni defaults which did not come to fruition. The U.S. structured finance issuance, which increased 22% due to the growth in asset-backed securities and also CLOs, collateralized loan obligations. It is certainly encouraging to see the growth in structured products, and we look for that to continue. U.S. corporate investment-grade issuance, which remained resilient and increased 7%. Offsetting this growth was U.S. corporate speculative-grade issuance, which decreased 39% as investments became more risk averse; European corporate issuance, which decreased 36%; and European structured finance issuance, which decreased 60%. 
Non-transaction revenue, which represents 58% of second quarter revenue, decreased 2%, primarily due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, non-transaction revenue increased 2%. 
It is becoming increasingly apparent that global debt issuance trends are diverging. While trends in the United States are increasingly encouraging, the picture in Europe continues to be quite volatile. With the exception of strong issuance in January and February as a result of the injection of liquidity into the Eurozone banking system by the ECB, issuance activity has been rather subdued. 
However, over the long term, the Ratings business outlook appears very encouraging, with numerous secular drivers of growth, including a large pipeline of maturing global corporate debt that will need to be refinanced; the shift in Europe from bank loans to public debt markets as banks face new regulations, as well as capital requirements; and finally, the structured finance market, which should recover with improved activity in the residential and the commercial real estate markets. 
However, there are a number of issues that continue to create considerable volatility, and these include the European financial crisis, risk aversion among some investors, sovereign debt levels and pending government regulations which create uncertainty. 
Our success on the litigation front has been encouraging. The trends that we have discussed in the past quarterly conference calls continue. Two additional cases were dismissed in the second quarter, bringing the total dismissed to-date at 29 cases. Seven dismissals by lower courts have been affirmed by higher courts, and 10 cases have been voluntarily withdrawn. Among the dismissals was the Oddo litigation, which was affirmed by the highest court in New York. Several dozen cases remain outstanding. We continue to believe that the legal risk of pending litigation remains low. 
On the regulatory and government front, the Ratings business remains an area of focus for regulators, both in the United States and Europe. There are 3 principal items that we are monitoring. The first is CRA3 in Europe. That -- there remains the possibility of a mandatory rotation of rating agencies for structured finance products or a subset of these products. There's also a proposal for a new EU-wide liability standard, enabling investors who purchase investments to sue a credit rating agency that breaches the EU regulations intentionally or through gross negligence. Next is Dodd-Frank, which requires all U.S. regulations be changed to remove any reference to, or requirement of, reliance on credit ratings. Last is the Franken amendment, which is being studied by the SEC. This amendment recommends establishing an organization to assign which NRSRO will provide the initial rating on each new structured finance product. As new regulations are considered in the global markets that we serve, we will continue to provide investors with high-quality forward-looking opinions about creditworthiness. 
In addition, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice and the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating potential violation of civil provisions of federal law regarding and relating to S&P's ratings of structured products. Of course, we have been in discussions with representatives of both the DOJ and the SEC and presenting our position on those issues. 
The Ratings segment is now past its toughest revenue comparisons of the year, although we have a difficult expense comparison ahead of us in the third quarter, especially with the exchange rate issues. With the investments that we have made in the business, along with our repositioning of our commercial mortgage-backed securities offering, we continue to work towards improved performance of this very, very important business. 
Okay, with that, let me now turn to S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices, the second largest segment within McGraw-Hill Financial. It delivered solid top and bottom line results, with revenue and adjusted operating profit increasing 10% and 17%, respectively. Both S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices delivered year-over-year revenue growth, with 74% of revenue coming from subscriptions, the same as a year ago. 
Looking at S&P Capital IQ alone, revenue increased 9%. A key driver of this growth was double-digit growth in S&P Capital IQ subscriptions, with solid growth at both Desktop Solutions, as well as Enterprise Solutions. In addition, both RatingsXpress and Global Credit Portal contributed to the growth. And as I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we acquired Credit Market Analysis, or CMA. And with CMA, we significantly expanded our asset class coverage for data and pricing and added technology to move into live intraday coverage of derivatives and other over-the-counter securities. 
We are continuously working to upgrade the S&P Capital IQ platform, and there have been a number of new products and capabilities that have been launched recently. One that I would like to touch on briefly is in the area of counterparty risk. We have expanded the capabilities for measuring counterparty risk in the S&P Capital IQ platform. S&P Capital IQ credit analytics offers new capabilities for clients to produce even more dynamic risk measures to support their counterparty analysis. With new and enhanced features for CreditModel, CreditPro and Credit Risk Tracker products, clients can stay on top of market movements in the credit risk space quickly and efficiently. And lastly, the integration of our recent acquisitions of R2 and QuantHouse are progressing well. We have effectively empowered R2 and QuantHouse to lead our efforts in the development of next-generation cross-asset class portfolio analytics and low latency data capabilities, respectively. 
S&P Indices revenues increased 12%. We realized growth in trading volume of exchange-traded derivatives, as well as in assets under management, for both mutual funds and exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices. Despite a turbulent stock market during the quarter, assets under management in the exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices increased 7% to $349 billion. This was driven by a 10% increase in the number of exchange-traded fund units, which more than offset a decline in the net asset value per unit. During the quarter, 17 brand-new indices and 27 variants to existing indices were launched. Also, during the quarter, 11 new exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices were launched, bringing the total of exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices to 430. These additions create new alternatives for investors and greater liquidity, obviously, to markets. 
At the end of the quarter, we launched the S&P Dow Jones Indices. This is our new joint venture with the CME Group. Here, you can see the full-page ad that ran in the Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal announcing the launch. Alex Matturri, a veteran of the index industry, who has been running our index business for a number of years, was named the CEO of S&P Dow Jones Indices. This joint venture will enable our clients to create investment products that offer new choices to investors. As a result of our 73% ownership of the joint venture, we will, for the first time, participate in the profitability of CME's execution and clearing. 
With the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture now in place, there are approximately $1.5 trillion directly linked to our indices and over 400 financial institutions that use our indices to build or price funds, swaps, notes, options, forwards and futures. We are proud that the S&P Dow Jones Indices is home to some of the most widely followed and most trusted indices in the world. 
Now let me turn to the Commodities & Commercial group, which delivered year-over-year operating profit gains that led all segments. Revenue growth was 9%, with international revenue up 16%. The leverage of the business is very evident and, along with cost reductions, resulted in operating margins that increased almost 700 basis points to over 29%. 
Within Commodities, subscriptions for petroleum, natural gas and steel products drove the 19% increase in revenue. We have capitalized on the acquisitions of BENTEK Energy and the Steel Business Briefing Group to take advantage of cross-selling opportunities. In addition, due to volatility in the oil markets, we realized revenue growth from increased trading of future contracts linked to Platts' pricing. Our Commodities business is now approaching $0.5 billion on an annualized basis and is poised for further growth. 
Commercial's revenue decreased 1%. J.D. Power's revenue growth was offset by modest declines in the remainder of the portfolio. The revenue growth at J.D. Power was a result of growth in the Power Information Network, or PIN, Ad Claims and syndicated reports. The widely followed J.D. Power initial quality study was released this quarter in its 26th year. This study is purchased by virtually all of the world's major automotive manufacturers and results in meaningful ad claims from many of the companies whose automobiles rank highest in each category. I'm pleased to say J.D. Power is on its way to its best year ever. 
Okay, with that, let me turn to Education -- in McGraw-Hill Education. McGraw-Hill Education reported a 12% decline in revenue yet delivered a 36% increase in segment operating profit. The revenue decline occurred largely at School Education Group. We continue to expect a 10% decline in the K-12 market this year, which will represent, in our opinion, the lowest spending level in over a decade and gives us opportunities looking ahead. Despite this difficult market, the segment delivered cost reductions that overcame the revenue shortfall, enabled us to deliver solid growth in operating profit. Our focus is to ensure that the business has a cost structure that is appropriate for such challenging market realities and provides the flexibility to invest to accelerate digital development. Product development continues to focus on providing innovative digital learning materials for our customers. As a result of the increased sales of digital products, many of which are subscription-based, our deferred revenue has become more pronounced, increasing by approximately $50 million year-over-year. 
The Higher Education, Professional and International Group reported a 2% decrease in revenue. Revenue growth at Higher Education was offset by declines at International, which was almost entirely due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Higher Education now has 1.4 million digital users, an increase of 40%, as digital products continue to displace books. 
One noteworthy product, McGraw-Hill Connect, which is a homework management platform, grew by 65%. It enables instructors to create assignments and track student performance and provides a range of digital learning tools, such as LearnSmart, that improves student learning. LearnSmart is an adaptive learning system that is available for approximately 150 different college course titles. 
The School Education Group reported a 20% decline, and that was in revenue from the prior year, with decreases occurring in both instructional materials and testing. The key third quarter selling season is underway, and our view of the market, as I said a moment ago, remains unchanged. We continue to believe 2012 will be the low watermark in the K-12 space, and the market should begin to show a modest recovery as we get into 2013. 
Over the next couple of years, we anticipate that a demand for our Common Core-compliant materials will increase as school districts prepare for the new tests that take effect in the spring of 2015. 46 states have adopted the Common Core State Standards and need to prepare their students for these new tests. Our testing business was selected by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium to develop its suite of language, arts and mathematics test items for the new Common Core Assessments. Smarter Balanced is 1 of 2 state web consortia funded by the U.S. Department of Education to develop assessment tools to help states gauge student progress towards meeting the new Common Core Standards. Together, with a co-contractor, we are also developing test items for the second federally funded test consortium, which is called the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers. 
We're setting up the Education business to thrive as a stand-alone company. We're putting in place the cost structure and digital capabilities necessary for the McGraw-Hill Education to lead the transformation of the industry. And we are absolutely thrilled to have Buzz Waterhouse and Pat Milano in place to lead this effort, along with the entire team. 
In summary, The McGraw-Hill Companies is off to a very strong start with record first half adjusted diluted earnings per share. McGraw-Hill Financial should continue to deliver solid top and bottom line growth. We continue to build new capabilities to deliver organic growth while pursuing bolt-on acquisitions to add additional expertise and capabilities or move into new markets. 
McGraw-Hill Education will focus on all that is required to become a stand-alone company. We are creating a cost structure that is rightsized to serve the education market and building out our unique set of digital products to meet the needs of our customers. Our intent is to position this business for longer-term growth as the market recovers and the digital shift accelerates. 
The company will remain focused on delivering on its Growth and Value Plan and continue to work towards the completion of the spinoff of McGraw-Hill Education by the end of the year. And to say the least, 2012 will be remembered as a very important inflection point in our company's history. And I'm very pleased with the results of both the first and, now, the second quarter record results. 
Okay, let me leave it there. That completes my prepared remarks, and I will now ask Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, to update you on some of our key financials. Jack?"
21719,213792787,331899,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. This morning, I want to provide additional detail on our consolidated results, including cash flow, and provide additional detail on the progress in one-time costs in the implementation of the Growth and Value Plan. Let me begin by dis",1449,"Thank you, Terry. This morning, I want to provide additional detail on our consolidated results, including cash flow, and provide additional detail on the progress in one-time costs in the implementation of the Growth and Value Plan. 
Let me begin by discussing our consolidated results. Revenue decreased 1% year-over-year. However, it was more than offset by a 5% year-over-year decrease in overall adjusted expenses. The decrease in expenses was primarily the result of the Growth and Value Plan cost-reduction initiatives that began in the fourth quarter of 2011 and will continue into next year. As a result, consolidated adjusted operating profit increased 14% and consolidated adjusted operating margins increased over 300 basis points to 26.3%. Obviously, we are pleased with the progress thus far in margin expansion. 
To summarize the operating results Terry just reviewed, there was continued revenue growth at McGraw-Hill Financial of 5%, with margins that expanded 140 basis points, delivering strong adjusted operating profit growth of 9%. For McGraw-Hill Education, while there was a 12% decline in revenue, margins expanded 420 basis points based on the meaningful cost initiatives that began with the significant restructuring of the business in the fourth quarter of last year. Both businesses did benefit from a reduction in employee-related costs due to the realignment of our retirement programs. 
The share repurchase program remains an important aspect of the Growth and Value Plan, and the impact was evident again this quarter. Year-over-year, we reduced shares outstanding by 24 million shares. This amplified a 15% increase in adjusted net income to a 25% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share or $0.85 per share. Since the beginning of 2011 through the second quarter of 2012, the company has repurchased nearly 36 million shares at a weighted average price of $42.05. This reduced shares outstanding by approximately 12%. Apart from the completion of the accelerated share repurchase program in April, no other shares were repurchased in the quarter. However, we do anticipate resuming share repurchases over the back half of the year, which will provide continued EPS leverage into next year. 
We continue to have a very strong balance sheet, with approximately $840 million in cash and short-term investments. Year-over-year, our free cash flow was down. This decrease was largely the result of a temporary acceleration of payments of approximately $100 million to the vendors associated with the transition to a new accounting system, as well as $65 million of cash outlays associated with the Growth and Value Plan. On a full year basis, we fully expect to deliver solid free cash flow. Our guidance of approximately $750 million, excluding cash outlays associated with the Growth and Value Plan, remains unchanged. 
Now let me provide some additional details around the execution of the Growth and Value Plan. During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our target of at least $100 million in run rate cost savings by the end of 2012. The actions taken over the last several quarters drove, in part, the cost reductions that were realized in the second quarter. Year-over-year, total adjusted expenses decreased 5%. As I mentioned earlier, one important component of this was the realignment of our U.S. pension plan that took effect on April 1. 
As we form 2 new companies, we need to separate several critical support operations that are currently shared. The next important round of cost savings will benefit from the realignment of these operations. We currently have 15 work streams underway to implement cost savings in the area of accounting, purchasing, information technology, human resources and real estate. We are already deep in the implementation of these plans, and we anticipate the realization of these cost reduction benefits by the time separation occurs in the latter part of this year. 
During the second quarter, we incurred $42 million of one-time Growth and Value Plan costs that we noted in this morning's press release. They include $19 million for professional fees, $15 million for deal fees and $8 million for severance. We anticipate that for the remainder of the year, we will incur an additional $80 million of one-time separation expenses necessary to implement the Growth and Value Plan. These one-time expenses are largely professional fees, as we need to support various consultants, business process and information technology firms and financial advisors. Please keep in mind, this is a working estimate. In addition, we anticipate that during 2012, we will continue to incur restructuring costs as part of our ongoing cost reduction initiatives. While the timing of these actions is still fluid, restructuring expense for 2012 could be up to approximately $65 million over the balance of the year. 
The Form 10 was filed several weeks ago and outlined many aspects of the separation. There are a few key financial items that I would like to draw your attention to. McGraw-Hill Financial will retain all of the outstanding long-term debt, as well as substantially all of the cash on hand at the time of the spin. Concurrent with the spin, we anticipate that McGraw-Hill Education will issue up to $600 million in new debt, likely a mix of bank term loans and public debt. McGraw-Hill Education will retain approximately $100 million of cash and issue a one-time dividend to McGraw-Hill Financial for up to $500 million. McGraw-Hill Education will also establish a revolving credit line. This, along with the $100 million of newly raised cash, should provide McGraw-Hill Education with ample liquidity to meet its business needs. Along with receiving the one-time dividend of up to $500 million, McGraw-Hill Financial will retain all of the pension liabilities, which are now largely frozen plans for both companies, as well as other selected liabilities, to simplify separation. In the spin, our goal is to provide the Education business with balance sheet flexibility to support its long-term growth potential. 
As we now look to the back half of the year, there are a couple items that I want to point out. First, as I mentioned earlier, we plan on resuming share repurchases. Our plan is to repurchase up to 500 million in the second half of the year. As always, share repurchases are subject to appropriate market conditions.
Another item that I want to highlight is the financial impact of our new joint venture, S&P Dow Jones Indices. The transaction was closed at the end of June, and as such, our balance sheet reflects $792 million of additional net assets. It was closed on the last business day in the quarter, such that the income statement impact was negligible. We anticipate that by the end of the third quarter, the net income attributable to noncontrolling interest line on the income statement will become more prominent. Since we own 73% of the joint venture, we will consolidate the entire business in our income statement. 27% of the joint venture net income is then removed and recorded as net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. Obviously, we will review the impact of this exciting new venture with CME once there are operating results to review on the third quarter call. 
In closing, our outlook for the balance of 2012 remains positive. We are executing upon the Growth and Value Plan that we laid out late last year. At the same time, we delivered record first half adjusted earnings per share. While there is an inclination to raise guidance after such a strong first half, we need to be mindful that the third quarter, our largest of the year, is still ahead of us. This is the key quarter for McGraw-Hill Education as schools across the U.S. purchase the lion's share of educational materials for the upcoming school year. Therefore, we believe it is prudent to keep our guidance unchanged, with diluted adjusted earnings per share of $3.25 to $3.35, although based on the strong first half, we now anticipate being near the high end of that range. Our cost reduction efforts will continue, and we fully expect to deliver on our target of at least $100 million in run rate cost savings by the end of the year. Executing on all the aspects of the Growth and Value Plan remains our highest priority. And we continue to anticipate completing the separation into 2 powerful industry leaders, McGraw-Hill Education and McGraw-Hill Financial, by year-end. We are doing all the work to support a spin of McGraw-Hill Education by year-end. We are also evaluating other options to deliver shareholder value, including a potential sale. We will update the market as appropriate in the coming months. 
With that, thank you for joining the call this morning. And now let me turn the call back over to Chip Merritt to moderate the Q&A."

Joining me on today's conference call is Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Jack and I will review our corporate results. We're going to provide an update on our Growth and Value Plan progress. We'll provide a detailed look at the segment results that make up what will be McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education and then provide an outlook for the balance of the year. 
Now like many other New York companies, we delayed our earnings report from Wednesday to today to accommodate employees and shareholders impacted by Hurricane Sandy. And thankfully, all of our employees are safe and our business continuity plans are operating effectively. Our employees have really stepped up to work through the many challenges and I'm grateful to them and to the state and city workers who have done so much to help us over this past week. And I hope those of you on the phone affected by the storm are safe and starting the process to return to some state of normality as well. 
All right, let me begin by saying that we are pleased by the success of our Growth and Value Plan and the strong results of the McGraw-Hill Financial businesses. Now while the Education company is facing some very tough current challenges in the U.S. Education sector, we feel very excited by the promise of digital learning and by our new digital products and services, which are improving learning outcomes for students everywhere. And this digital transformation is gaining momentum, and we'll talk about that in just a little bit. 
During the third quarter, the company delivered a 2% increase in revenue. McGraw-Hill Financial, which realized a boost from the robust global issuance, delivered a 15% increase in revenue. Separately, McGraw-Hill Education delivered an 11% decrease in revenue as it managed the impact of the weakest level of state funding for K-12 textbooks in the past decade. Adjusted operating profit increased 3%, and due to our aggressive share repurchase program, we delivered 10% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share, and Jack will provide a little additional financial detail on that in just a moment. 
A little over a year ago, we made a set of commitments in this Growth and Value Plan and I'm proud of the substantial progress that our employees have made on each of these commitments, and let me take a moment and just walk through these different commitments and give you an update as to where we are. 
The first and most visible commitment is the separation of the company into 2 industry-leading companies, McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education, and we are on track to do so. Amendment #2 to the Form 10 SEC Registration Statement for the potential spinoff of McGraw-Hill Education was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month and we don't anticipate any substantial issues with that. In parallel with our efforts to spin off McGraw-Hill Education, we have undertaken a thorough evaluation process of numerous options, including the option to sell the business. This process is near its conclusion and we expect to reach a decision in the coming weeks. Critical to this decision is ensuring that we choose the option that maximizes shareholder value. The timing of the ultimate separation will be dictated by which option is chosen. 
We have also committed to more than $100 million in run rate cost reductions by the end of the year. We're on track for this and Jack will provide some color on this in just a moment. We committed to aggressively repurchasing shares, and after completing the $1.5 billion share repurchase program earlier this year, we reentered the market in the third quarter and purchased an additional 295 million of McGraw-Hill stock. 
Lastly, we committed to investing for growth. Earlier this year, we formed the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture. Importantly, this is the first quarter that we have managed and reported the combined results with some of the most widely followed and trusted brands in the index space. We believe this joint venture will prove to be a great value not only to our customers, but also our shareholders. 
In addition, earlier this year, the company acquired R2 Financial Technologies, QuantHouse, Credit Market Analysis Limited and Coalition Development Limited. And most recently, we announced the acquisition of Kingsman SA, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a moment. So whether it's through the separation process, cost reductions, share repurchases or investing in growth, McGraw-McGraw-Hill is meeting its Growth and Value Plan commitments and is on target and on track to do so. 
With that, let me now turn to the business results. McGraw-Hill Financial on a pro forma basis delivered a 15% increase in revenue and a 21% increase in adjusted operating profit during the quarter. Of the 15% revenue growth, 11% was organic and 4% was from the transactions that I just mentioned. 
While all 3 segments delivered revenue growth, it was Standard & Poor's rating services and Commodities & Commercial markets that provided the most impressive adjusted operating profit growth of 28% and 29%, respectively, as well as improved adjusted operating margins. McGraw-Hill Financial delivered 40% of its revenue from outside the United States during the third quarter. Domestic revenue growth of 17% outpaced International growth of 12%, which was impacted by adverse foreign exchange rates. 
Standard & Poor's Ratings continues to be the segment with the largest International presence with 45% of its revenue coming from outside the United States. Standard & Poor's Ratings also delivered the largest revenue increase within McGraw-Hill Financial and delivered its strongest quarterly revenue since the third quarter of 2007. Revenue for this segment grew 22%, with a 33% increase in domestic revenue and a 12% increase in International revenue. The increase in International revenue occurred despite a 7% negative impact from foreign exchange rates. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 28% and the corresponding operating margin increased almost 200 basis points. 
Actions during the quarter by both the European Central Bank, the ECB and the Federal Reserve resulted in increased global bond issuance. The ECB's pledge to intervene in the sovereign bond markets and the Federal Reserves' quantitative easing 3 program caused global spreads to contract and fuel the surge in September bond issuance. These actions helped to drive U.S. speculative grade corporate bond issuance to a record $85.4 billion in the third quarter. 
Transaction revenue increased 64% to $215 million. Recall that while issuance in the first half of 2011 was quite robust, it tapered off considerably in the second half of 2011, creating less difficult year-over-year comparisons in the second half of 2012. Nevertheless, the key drivers to the increase in transaction revenue were: one, worldwide corporate issuance, which increased 81%, with a 72% increase in U.S. corporate issuance and 126% increase in European corporate issuance; and secondly, the public finance issuance which increased 9% and contributed to the growth as well. 
Additionally, worldwide structured issuance was flat, with a 65% increase in the United States' structured finance issuance offset by a 33% decline in European structured finance issuance. The European weakness was driven by a 37% decline in European covered bond issuance as issuers funded through the European Central Bank long-term refinancing option. 
Non-transaction revenue, which represented 57% of Standard & Poor's third quarter revenue, increased 3%. Now in periods of robust debt issuance, investors are frequently concerned about issuance being pulled forward. This is always a difficult point to determine until after the fact. However, a  study by Standard & Poor's global fixed income research to analyze corporate refunding needs over the next few years may be instructive. The study concluded that approximately $8 trillion in rated corporate debt will mature from 2012 to the end of 2016. Let me repeat that, that approximately $8 trillion in rated corporate debt will mature from 2012 to year-end 2016. Now the non-financial sector accounts for about $3.3 trillion of the $8 trillion in maturing debt, and financial companies, including banks and insurance companies, account for the remaining $4.8 trillion. Now this research clearly suggests that corporate debt needs will remain robust over the next several years. 
Our success on the litigation front has been encouraging. The trends that we have discussed in the past quarterly conference calls continue. To date, 30 cases have been dismissed. Nine dismissals by lower courts have been reaffirmed by higher courts and 10 cases have been voluntarily withdrawn. Again, we have said that the legal risk is low and it's bearing that out. 
While aiding and abetting and negligent misrepresentation claims have been dropped in the Abu Dhabi case, the trial over fraud claims is set to begin in May, and again, we continue to believe that the legal risk of pending litigation remains very low. 
All right, with that, let me turn now to S&P Capital IQ and the S&P Dow Jones Indices. And again, this is the second largest segment within McGraw-Hill Financial, which delivered solid top line results with revenue growth of 13%. 72% of revenue came from subscriptions, the same as a year ago. International revenue increased 10% to $117 million and that represents 30% of total segment revenue. Adjusted operating profit increased 5% and there was a modest decline in the adjusted operating margin as the segment integrates and develops newly acquired technology and products into the S&P Capital IQ offerings. 
Looking at S&P Capital IQ alone, revenue increased 9% with organic revenue growth of 5%. Two key products, S&P Capital IQ within Desktop Solutions and Global Data Solutions within Enterprise Solutions both delivered solid growth. S&P Capital IQ delivered double-digit client and subscriber growth, which reached 4,400 clients and 55,000 subscriber in growth respectively. These results were offset somewhat by revenue weakness from equity research. 
One of the top priorities at S&P Capital IQ is the execution of product innovation and driving integration of the newly acquired assets. On the innovation front, we believe that we are amassing considerable technical capabilities and are working to translate these into competitive advantage. We are pleased to have been recognized for the first time on institutional investors' annual 2012 Tech 50 list, coming in, in the 29th spot. 
In addition to integrating the technology, our strategy is to deploy an integrated sales effort that can assemble any combination of S&P Capital IQ products in a customized offering. In fact, in August, we won our first combination sale with an offering that included S&P Capital IQ, Standard & Poor's Ratings data, via express feed, and CMA credit default swaps. 
The big news is that the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture is up and it's running. What a fantastic opportunity we have with this amazing collection of world-renowned brands. This business is all about building trusted and transparent brands, and we have some of the best. 
Having a partner like the CME is also incredibly important. The relationships it maintains with the exchanges around the world provide several of our businesses with important access. This access has already been or has already enabled us a new opportunity with the BMNF [ph] BOVESPA in Brazil. The S&P 500 is being made available to them via a sublicense from the CME Group and the S&P Dow Jones Indices. The launch of a U.S. dollar-denominated S&P 500 index future settled in the Brazilian real is the first derivative of a U.S. stock index to trade on the Brazilian exchange, very first. 
S&P Indices reported revenue of $109 million in the third quarter, and excluding the addition of Dow Jones Indexes, revenue was $82 million and decreased 7%. Revenue from exchange-traded funds and mutual funds was very strong, with double-digit increases year-over-year. Assets under management in exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices grew 40% year-over-year to $390 billion, and that includes the Dow Jones Indexes. Their assets under management reached $454 billion. Revenue from derivatives declined due to incredibly difficult comparisons to the third quarter of 2011. This was driven by trading volume of exchange-traded derivatives that decreased 41% versus third quarter 2011. 
This chart should put the difficult comparison into perspective. In the third quarter of 2011, derivative volumes reached a 5-year high as investors hedged their positions due to euro crisis concerned. Please note that with the formation of S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture, there is no longer as a direct correlation between the E-mini future's trading volumes and the S&P Indices revenues as in the past. We now receive a percentage of profits from the CME equity complex rather than being paid on a per-contract basis. 
Let me now turn to the Commodities & Commercial markets segment, which delivered a year-over-year adjusted operating profit gain that, again, led all segments. Revenue growth was 5%, with International revenue up 15%. The leverage of the business is very evident. This leverage, coupled with a $5 million decrease in expenses, resulted in an adjusted operating margin that increased more than 500 basis points to 28%. 
Within Commodities, petroleum market subscriptions continued to be the primary growth driver. However, derivative trading and Bentek Energy also delivered double-digit revenue growth. And Kingsman, which I mentioned earlier, Kingsman leverages Platts' presence in biofuels to make our first foray into the agricultural commodities. The acquisition, which closed yesterday, expands Platts' biofuels position by providing additional coverage, price assessments and subscriber base for the biodiesel and ethanol markets. 
In addition, agriculture is a natural extension from the biofuels market. It is large, it's sophisticated, it's a global commodity market like the others that Platts serves. Kingsman is a great first step into this marketplace, and Kingsman is not only a leader in biofuels, it is a leader in the sugar market, a key feedstock into the biofuels complex. 
Within Commercial, revenue decreased 2%. J.D. Power's revenue growth was offset by modest declines in the remainder of the portfolio, but simply stated, J.D. Power is poised for its best year ever. This is driven in part by the continued expansion of China's domestic automotive industry, as well as J.D. Power's power information network proprietary research and automotive consulting. And as J.D. Power continues to pursue business beyond the automotive industry, there's an interesting piece of new business with the National Football League that has contracted with J.D. Power to conduct their voice of the fan tracking. 
With that, let me move over to McGraw-Hill Education. McGraw-Hill Education in the third quarter reported an 11% decline in revenue to $836 million. Revenue decreased at the Higher Education, Professional and International Group as well as the School Education Group. While both groups are operating in very difficult economic environments, the reported revenues are also impacted by increased deferred revenues resulting from growth in subscription products. 
As the Education business develops and sells more digital solutions, the traditional revenue model is changing and it's changing rapidly. Rather than booking revenue at the time of the sale, revenue has spread out and recognized over the life of the subscription. Largely because of the dramatic increases in McGraw-Hill Education subscription businesses, its third quarter deferred revenue balance increased 74% over the prior year. Excluding the impact of this increase in deferred revenue, the third quarter revenue decline was only 7%. 
To combat the difficult business environment, McGraw-Hill Education reduced expenses 9% versus the third quarter of 2011 and continues to look for additional cost reduction opportunities. 
The Higher Education, Professional and International Group reported a 6% decrease in revenue. Excluding the impact of increased deferred revenue, the decline was 5%. With difficult economic conditions around the globe, the vast majority of the revenue decline in this group was in International, with Higher Education revenue decreasing modestly. However, the continued migration to digital solution helps to mitigate these declines by offering growing revenue streams in all of its major markets. 
Student usage of our homework study solutions in the Higher Education market has grown by 67%, boosted by usage of LearnSmart, which grew 115% and now has more than 890,000 registered students. We recently launched a direct to consumer website which makes LearnSmart available for purchase by students even if their professors don't utilize it as part of their course. This is a divergence from the business-to-business model that typically has been deployed. 
The School Education Group reported a 16% decline in revenue from the prior year, and excluding the impact of increased deferred revenue, the decrease was 10%. K-12 revenue was down due to weak state funding, with 2012 expected to be the lowest funding year in the last decade. And according to the Association of American Publishers, the AAP, and their statistics, August year-to-date industry K-12 net sales were down 14%. 
McGraw-Hill Education captured a substantial share of the 2012's 2 largest stated adoption opportunities, and that's, of course, Florida's K-12 Social Studies and California's reading program but could not overcome the overall decline in the rest of U.S. state funding. 
As we look beyond the immediate challenges state funding for K-12 Education, it is important to remember that a strong and innovative education sector is critical for a healthy economy, whether in the United States around the world, so these current issues should be kept in context. That is why McGraw-Hill Education, driven by new management, is focused on responding to the critical need for education by driving operational excellence, reimagining learning and capturing the new growth opportunities. Indeed, we have made impressive progress over the last few years in developing digital learning products, and we believe there is a long runway of opportunities both in the developed and emerging countries. 
Our products are prime for the digital revolution in Education. Virtually all of our content is available in digital form to enable personalized, adaptive learning solutions and improved outcomes. The Education market will continue to grow meaningfully as digital devices of all kinds are becoming more prevalent around the world. Our Higher Education business, the CTB testing business and our Professional and International business are all well positioned to take advantage of this growth trend. 
In the K-12 market, we are encouraged that the new Common Core State Standards assessments begin in 2014. This should drive demand for both teaching materials and assessments as 46 states have formally adopted the standards of Common Core. 
There is also a greater demand by parents and educators for improved performance, which should bode well for our adaptive -- digital learning programs that have demonstrated proven advancements in learning outcomes. 
One major element that is out of our control but clearly impacts the U.S. K-12 market is home prices. We are encouraged by signs that U.S. housing prices may have finally bottomed, which eventually lead to a recovery in state revenue from property taxes. Through August 2012, the S&P Case-Shiller home price indices, the leading measure of U.S. home prices, showed that the average home price increases for both the 10-City composite and the 20-City Composites for the fourth consecutive month and those were rising. 
As we approach the separation of the Education company, I want to sincerely thank all of the Education employees for all of their extremely hard work and dedication, helping to raise Education to levels around the world. It's not only a noble calling, it's essential, and their hard work and dedication are to be commended. The past year, they have made very tough decisions on costs while building world class products and services for future growth and success. With the digital footprint that they have created and the superb new management in place under President Buzz Waterhouse, I feel truly excited about how the Education company is positioned as it becomes a standalone company. 
In summary, McGraw-Hill Financial continues to deliver solid top and bottom line growth. The separation of McGraw-Hill Education is approaching and the business is becoming an attractive standalone company with highly talented employees, innovative and essential Education products and services and an appropriate cost structure. 
In summation, McGraw-Hill is delivering on its Growth and Value Plan commitment, with the pending separation, exciting growth plans, multiple tuck-in acquisition, sizable cost reductions and aggressive share repurchase program. 
With that, that completes my comments on the third quarter. I will now ask Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, to update you on some of the key financial performance, and then I look forward to go in any direction that you would like to go. Jack?"
21719,222777903,376395,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2012",2012-11-02,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. This morning, I want to discuss several topics: our consolidated results, including cash flow; the financial impact of corporate development activities on the S&P Capital IQ Indices business; the progress of the Growth and Value Plan, in",1554,"Thank you, Terry. This morning, I want to discuss several topics: our consolidated results, including cash flow; the financial impact of corporate development activities on the S&P Capital IQ Indices business; the progress of the Growth and Value Plan, including the primary drivers of cost reduction; and lastly, our increased guidance and outlook for the balance of the year. 
Let me begin by discussing our results, which, as Terry mentioned, were quite different across the Financial and Education businesses. In the quarter, McGraw-Hill Financial delivered excellent growth, with a 15% increase in revenue and a 21% increase in pro forma operating profit. This resulted in 170 basis point improvement in the pro forma operating margins of 36%. Overall, an excellent quarter across the MHS businesses. 
On the other hand, McGraw-Hill Education revenue decreased 11% and adjusted segment operating profit decreased 15%. As Terry just discussed, the market has proven even more challenging than our original expectations. Obviously, now that the all-important third quarter is behind us, MHE will not deliver on our initial financial guidance for this year. We now expect MHE revenues to decline 7% to 8% and operating income to be $20 million to $25 million below a year ago. Taken together, total consolidated McGraw-Hill, both revenue and expenses, increased approximately 2%. This resulted in adjusted operating profit growth of 3%. 
Overall, we delivered double-digit earnings per share growth. However, there were substantive changes in below-the-line comparison due to the formation of the new S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture impacting both the tax rate and the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. 
The reduction in the effective tax rate from the prior year was due primarily to the partnership structure of the joint venture with CME combined with the modest improvement in our overall rate. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest increased largely due to the new joint venture, which I will elaborate on just a moment. 
The impact of the accelerated share repurchase program was evident again this quarter. Year-over-year, we reduced shares outstanding by 90 million shares. This leveraged the 4% increase in adjusted net income to a 10% increase in adjusted diluted earnings of $1.33 per share. It should be noted that sequentially, our fully diluted shares outstanding remained unchanged at 285 million shares as stock option exercise activity largely offset share repurchases of approximately 300 million during the quarter. 
Our share repurchase program is an important and ongoing part of the Growth and Value Plan. Since the beginning of 2011 through the third quarter of 2012, the company has repurchased nearly 42 million shares at a weighted average price of $43.22. This reduced shares outstanding by approximately 14%. We anticipate spending approximately $200 million on share repurchases in the fourth quarter. 
Now I'd like to provide additional detail regarding the significant business development impact to the S&P Capital IQ and S&P Dow Jones Indices to help you better understand the results. 
First, within S&P Capital IQ, we made several acquisitions during the year that added new capabilities. The additions of R2, QuantHouse and CME -- and CMA were all accretive to revenue growth. However, these acquisitions and the work that we are undertaking to integrate these acquisitions are somewhat dilutive to profits. We have absorbed these costs and the related noncash amortization without any negative impact to guidance. 
Secondly, the creation of S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture has important accounting implications for the company. Since we own a majority of the joint venture, 73%, we record 100% of the revenue and expenses in the company's income statement. During the third quarter, this included $82 million in revenues from S&P Indices and $27 million from the Dow Jones Indexes. Of course, the 27% of the net income representing our partner's share is excluded from the bottom line results. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest effectively removes our partner's share of the profits from our income statement. During the third quarter, our partner's share of the profits totaled $18 million. This $18 million is excluded from the company's taxes, and I will address the impact on our reported effective tax rate in more detail in just a moment. 
Taken together, these acquisitions and the formation of the joint venture had a significant impact on the segment's revenue growth. Organic growth was 3%, in part due to difficult year-on-year comparisons in the index business. The joint venture and the 3 acquisitions increased revenue growth to 13%, with approximately 75% of the incremental revenue from the joint venture and 25% from the 3 acquisitions. 
As I mentioned, earlier, the joint venture has had an impact on the company's effective tax rate that merits further explanation. For tax purposes, the joint venture is treated as a partnership. The first column of this chart presents pretax income, provision for taxes and the after-tax income which implies reported effective tax rate of 33.7% for the third quarter. The middle column shows the partner's share of the joint venture income. Note, the company does not make a provision for taxes for the partner's income. The last column shows the tax provision for taxes in the third quarter at a 34.6% rate, about 1 point higher than the reported effective tax rate. On a year-to-date basis, we record a 35.6% provision for taxes and the reported effective tax rate is 35%. Full year 2012 results should be generally in line with the year-to-date performance. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we continue to have a very strong balance sheet with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments at quarter end. Year-over-year, our free cash flow is down approximately $200 million due largely to the onetime cash outlays related to the Growth and Value Plan expenses and the timing of quarterly cash tax payments. On a full year basis, we expect to deliver approximately $750 million in free cash flow, excluding cash outlays associated with the Growth and Value Plan. 
One additional point on our balance sheet. This month, about 1/3 of our debt is coming due. As a result over the near term, it is likely that we will access the commercial paper market as the repayment of the $400 million of debt and the funding of our fourth quarter share repurchase program require domestic cash availability. We will reevaluate further actions related to the balance sheet once the choice of sale versus spin options for McGraw-Hill Education are clear. 
Now let me provide some additional details related to the solid progress we are making in the execution of the Growth and Value Plan. First, all separation activities are either well underway or complete. Secondly, we continue to make progress on our target of at least $100 million in run rate cost savings by the end of 2012. 
Let me provide some color on the 4 major initiatives that drive the cost reduction program. The first was the McGraw-Hill Education cost structure reductions that began in the fourth quarter of 2011 and continue into this quarter. Over 10% of the Education workforce has been reduced to resize the cost structure to market demand and to support the necessary technology investments to advance McGraw-Hill Education's digital offerings. 
The second was the realignment of our core benefit programs, including the pension and health care plans. The benefit plans across McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education need to be increasingly tailored to their respective competitive environment. 
The third was the partnering relationships to transition various accounting, information technology and human resources activities to world-class partners, including Genpact, Atos and Workday, that specialize in these operations. The transition of these activities is well underway and the associated onetime transition costs stepped up in the third quarter. 
Lastly, we have targeted selected restructuring activities across McGraw-Hill Financial operations to streamline operations consistent with being a more focused operating company. All in all, significant progress has been made already and we fully expect to reduce at least $100 million in costs on a run-rate basis by the end of the year. 
During the third quarter, we incurred $99 million of onetime Growth and Value Plan expenses, largely related to professional fees and restructuring. These onetime expenses will continue into the fourth quarter. 
In closing, 2012 is turning out to be a remarkable year for McGraw-Hill. We are exceeding EPS expectations despite a challenging year for McGraw-Hill Education and have increased our earnings per share guidance to a range of $3.35 to $3.40. McGraw-Hill Financial is delivering great performance and we have expanded the McGraw-Hill Financial portfolio with tuck-in acquisitions and selective partnerships like CME. We are positioned to make a decision on sale versus spend for McGraw-Hill Education in the coming weeks and we are focused on making the right choice for both the business and our shareholders. And through countless efforts around the world, the work is on track to separate 2 leading companies, and we have been able to accomplish all of this while delivering cost reductions of at least $100 million. Now we are focused on a solid finish to 2012 and on finalizing the separation and stand up of these 2 terrific industry-leading businesses.

And literally, because of all the litigation out there, not just ours, I mean, all of the litigation out there, it takes 2, 2.5 years to get before a federal judge, and so you have to wait, and one of the things that we have said and we're encouraged by the results is that in many cases, once you get before a judge is the same day that these cases get dismissed on all that. So we are -- we think that we're in a very good position. We're obviously well advised and it's a wait-and-see game.

We've got to get back onto that track. Now if everything is essentially based on property tax structures at local and state municipalities and all that and you put the longest housing recession that we've ever seen together with that, you've got a very bad combination, plus the fact that you have so many states that are in deficit in all those. Those aren't excuses, those are realities and everything. So one, on improving housing market, getting states out of deficit positions and getting growth again is going to help this situation. But literally, and this won't last, I mean it can, but this is the worst K-12 environment in a decade. And I think it should be, obviously, an outraged everyone, but it won't last.

We have been, whether we're working with certain manufactured device manufacturers or whether we're working with partners in terms of developing digital solution, we've been working aggressively on this for some time and the receptivity of it is just moving at a very fast pace now, and so that's very encouraging.

21719,222777903,376395,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2012",2012-11-02,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Okay, well, look, first of all, and not to talk about just the fourth quarter, to talk about the next 3, 5, 10 years, the capital demand needs are huge.

And if you talk about infrastructure financing alone between now and 2030, you're talking about $70 trillion. You talk about $1 trillion of infrastructure financing in India alone over the next 5 years. The study I gave you was on just refunding between now and 2016 of $8 trillion. So the demand here is absolutely huge on that part. So I'm not -- I mean, any given time you're going to have some slowness or some pickup or whatever, but the overall demand for capital is only going to go up and banks are not going to be able to satisfy all that kind of demand. And in fact, the reason that the capital markets and fixed income in particular are doing well is because now, the banks in many ways are stalled and the largest portion of the capital demand has got to come from the capital markets on that one. So from a backlog standpoint, we're doing really well. Now the second part to that question is, look, obviously, the European Central Bank made a decision that they were going to intervene in the sovereign bond markets and provide a level of support, and that obviously created some activity. When Ben Bernanke came out with the QE3, the real question was, is there going to be a QE4 for? I don't know and all of that. But both of those caused global spreads to contract and obviously fuel to surge in September bond issuance. So then I get questions like, okay, well, is that just bringing monies forward in the fourth quarter or the first quarter for next year or something like that? How do I know and all that and we'll just have to wait and see what the facts are. But the capital demand load is huge on that on and it's worldwide on that part. And again, with 45% of our revenues coming from outside the United States, we're in a terrific position to be able to deal with that."

Joining me on today's conference call is Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Jack and I will review our corporate results. We're going to provide an update on our Growth and Value Plan progress. We'll provide a detailed look at the segment results that make up what will be McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education and then, provide an outlook for the balance of the year. 
Now like many other New York companies, we delayed our earnings report from Wednesday to today to accommodate employees and shareholders impacted by Hurricane Sandy. And thankfully, all of our employees are safe and our business continuity plans are operating effectively. Our employees have really stepped up to work through the many challenges, and I'm grateful to them and to the state and city workers who have done so much to help us over this past week. And I hope those of you on the phone affected by the storm are safe and starting the process to return to some state of normality as well. 
All right. Let me begin by saying that we are pleased by the success of our Growth and Value Plan and the strong results of the McGraw-Hill Financial businesses. Now while the Education company is facing some very tough current challenges in the U.S. education sector, we feel very excited by the promise of digital learning and by our new digital products and services, which are improving learning outcomes for students everywhere. And this digital transformation is gaining momentum, and we'll talk about that in just a little bit. 
During the third quarter, the company delivered a 2% increase in revenue. McGraw-Hill Financial, which realized a boost from the robust global issuance, delivered a 15% increase in revenue. Separately, McGraw-Hill Education delivered an 11% decrease in revenue as it managed the impact of the weakest level of state funding for K-12 textbooks in the past decade. Adjusted operating profit increased 3%, and due to our aggressive share repurchase program, we delivered 10% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share, and Jack will provide a little additional financial detail on that in just a moment. 
A little over a year ago, we made a set of commitments in this Growth and Value Plan, and I'm proud of the substantial progress that our employees have made on each of these commitments. And let me take a moment and just walk through these different commitments and give you an update as to where we are. 
The first and most visible commitment is the separation of the company into 2 industry-leading companies, McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education, and we are on track to do so. Amendment #2 to the Form 10 SEC Registration Statement for the potential spinoff of McGraw-Hill Education was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month, and we don't anticipate any substantial issues with that. 
In parallel with our efforts to spin off McGraw-Hill Education, we have undertaken a thorough evaluation process of numerous options, including the option to sell the business. This process is near its conclusion, and we expect to reach a decision in the coming weeks. Critical to this decision is ensuring that we choose the option that maximizes shareholder value. The timing of the ultimate separation will be dictated by which option is chosen. 
We have also committed to more than $100 million in run rate cost reductions by the end of the year. We're on track for this, and Jack will provide some color on this in just a moment. We committed to aggressively repurchasing shares, and after completing the $1.5 billion share repurchase program earlier this year, we reentered the market in the third quarter and purchased an additional $295 million of McGraw-Hill stock. 
Lastly, we committed to investing for growth. Earlier this year, we formed the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture. Importantly, this is the first quarter that we have managed and reported the combined results for some of the most widely followed and trusted brands in the index space. We believe this joint venture will prove to be a great value not only to our customers, but also our shareholders. 
In addition, earlier this year, the company acquired R2 Financial Technologies, QuantHouse, Credit Market Analysis Limited and Coalition Development Ltd. And most recently, we announced the acquisition of Kingsman SA, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a moment. So whether it's through the separation process, cost reductions, share repurchases or investing in growth, McGraw-Hill is meeting its Growth and Value Plan commitments and is on target and on track to do so. 
With that, let me now turn to the business results. McGraw-Hill Financial on a pro forma basis delivered a 15% increase in revenue and a 21% increase in adjusted operating profit during the quarter. Of the 15% revenue growth, 11% was organic and 4% was from the transactions that I just mentioned. 
While all 3 segments delivered revenue growth, it was Standard & Poor's Rating Services and Commodities & Commercial markets that provided the most impressive adjusted operating profit growth of 28% and 29%, respectively, as well as improved adjusted operating margins. McGraw-Hill Financial delivered 40% of its revenue from outside the United States during the third quarter. Domestic revenue growth of 17% outpaced International growth of 12%, which was impacted by adverse foreign exchange rates. 
Standard & Poor's Ratings continues to be the segment with the largest international presence, with 45% of its revenue coming from outside the United States. Standard & Poor's Ratings also delivered the largest revenue increase within McGraw-Hill Financial and delivered its strongest quarterly revenue since the third quarter of 2007. Revenue for this segment grew 22%, with a 33% increase in domestic revenue and a 12% increase in international revenue. The increase in international revenue occurred despite a 7% negative impact from foreign exchange rates. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 28%, and the corresponding operating margin increased almost 200 basis points. 
Actions during the quarter by both the European Central Bank, the ECB, and the Federal Reserve resulted in increased global bond issuance. The ECB's pledge to intervene in the sovereign bond markets and the Federal Reserves' Quantitative Easing 3 program caused global spreads to contract and fueled a surge in September bond issuance. These actions helped to drive U.S. speculative grade corporate bond issuance to a record $85.4 billion in the third quarter. 
Transaction revenue increased 64% to $215 million. Recall that while issuance in the first half of 2011 was quite robust, it tapered off considerably in the second half of 2011, creating less difficult year-over-year comparisons in the second half of 2012. Nevertheless, the key drivers to the increase in transaction revenue were: one, worldwide corporate issuance, which increased 81%, with a 72% increase in U.S. corporate issuance and 126% increase in European corporate issuance; and secondly, the public finance issuance, which increased 9% and contributed to the growth as well. 
Additionally, worldwide structured issuance was flat, with a 65% increase in the United States' structured finance issuance offset by a 33% decline in European structured finance issuance. The European weakness was driven by a 37% decline in European covered bond issuance as issuers funded through the European Central Bank long-term refinancing option. 
Non-transaction revenue, which represented 57% of Standard & Poor's third quarter revenue, increased 3%. Now in periods of robust debt issuance, investors are frequently concerned about issuance being pulled forward. This is always a difficult point to determine until after the fact. However, a  study by Standard & Poor's Global Fixed Income Research to analyze corporate refunding needs over the next few years may be instructive. 
The study concluded that approximately $8 trillion in rated corporate debt will mature from 2012 to the end of 2016. Let me repeat that, that approximately $8 trillion in rated corporate debt will mature from 2012 to year-end 2016. Now the non-financial sector accounts for about $3.3 trillion of the $8 trillion in maturing debt, and financial companies, including banks and insurance companies, account for the remaining $4.8 trillion. Now this research clearly suggests that corporate debt needs will remain robust over the next several years. 
Our success on the litigation front has been encouraging. The trends that we have discussed in the past quarterly conference calls continue. To date, 30 cases have been dismissed. Nine dismissals by lower courts have been reaffirmed by higher courts, and 10 cases have been voluntarily withdrawn. Again, we have said that the legal risk is low, and it's bearing that out. 
While aiding and abetting and negligent misrepresentation claims have been dropped in the Abu Dhabi case, the trial over fraud claims is set to begin in May. And again, we continue to believe that the legal risk of pending litigation remains very low. 
All right. With that, let me turn now to S&P Capital IQ and the S&P Dow Jones Indices. And again, this is the second largest segment within McGraw-Hill Financial, which delivered solid top line results with revenue growth of 13%. 72% of revenue came from subscriptions, the same as a year ago. International revenue increased 10% to $117 million, and that represents 30% of total segment revenue. Adjusted operating profit increased 5%, and there was a modest decline in the adjusted operating margin as the segment integrates and develops newly acquired technology and products into the S&P Capital IQ offerings. 
Looking at S&P Capital IQ alone. Revenue increased 9%, with organic revenue growth of 5%. Two key products, S&P Capital IQ within Desktop Solutions and Global Data Solutions within Enterprise Solutions both delivered solid growth. S&P Capital IQ delivered double-digit client and subscriber growth, which reached 4,400 clients and 55,000 subscriber unit growth, respectively. These results were offset somewhat by revenue weakness from equity research. 
One of the top priorities at S&P Capital IQ is the execution of product innovation and driving integration of the newly acquired assets. On the innovation front, we believe that we are amassing considerable technical capabilities and are working to translate these into competitive advantage. We are pleased to have been recognized for the first time on Institutional Investors' annual 2012 Tech 50 List, coming in, in the 29th spot. 
In addition to integrating the technology, our strategy is to deploy an integrated sales effort that can assemble any combination of S&P Capital IQ products in a customized offering. In fact, in August, we won our first combination sale with an offering that included S&P Capital IQ, Standard & Poor's Ratings data via express feed and CMA credit default swaps. 
The big news is that the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture is up and it's running. What a fantastic opportunity we have with this amazing collection of world-renowned brands. This business is all about building trusted and transparent brands, and we have some of the best. 
Having a partner like the CME is also incredibly important. The relationships it maintains with exchanges around the world provide several of our businesses with important access. This access has already been -- or has already enabled us a new opportunity with the BM&FBOVESPA in Brazil. The S&P 500 is being made available to them via a sublicense from the CME Group and the S&P Dow Jones Indices. The launch of a U.S. dollar-denominated S&P 500 index future settled in the Brazilian real is the first derivative of a U.S. stock index to trade on the Brazilian exchange, very first. 
S&P Indices reported revenue of $109 million in the third quarter, and excluding the addition of Dow Jones Indexes, revenue was $82 million and decreased 7%. Revenue from exchange-traded funds and mutual funds was very strong, with double-digit increases year-over-year. Assets under management in exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices grew 40% year-over-year to $390 billion, and that includes the Dow Jones Indexes. Their assets under management reached $454 billion. Revenue from derivatives declined due to incredibly difficult comparisons to the third quarter of 2011. This was driven by trading volume of exchange-traded derivatives that decreased 41% versus third quarter 2011. 
This chart should put the difficult comparison into perspective. In the third quarter of 2011, derivative volumes reached a 5-year high as investors hedged their positions due to euro crisis concerns. Please note that with the formation of S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture, there is no longer a direct correlation between the E-mini futures trading volumes and the S&P Indices revenues as in the past. We now receive a percentage of profits from the CME equity complex rather than being paid on a per-contract basis. 
Let me now turn to the Commodities & Commercial markets segment, which delivered a year-over-year adjusted operating profit gain that, again, led all segments. Revenue growth was 5%, with international revenue up 15%. The leverage of the business is very evident. This leverage, coupled with a $5 million decrease in expenses, resulted in an adjusted operating margin that increased more than 500 basis points to 28%. 
Within Commodities, petroleum market subscriptions continued to be the primary growth driver. However, derivative trading in Bentek Energy also delivered double-digit revenue growth. And Kingsman, which I mentioned earlier, Kingsman leverages Platts' presence in biofuels to make our first foray into the agricultural commodities. The acquisition, which closed yesterday, expands Platts' biofuels position by providing additional coverage, price assessments and subscriber base for the biodiesel and ethanol markets. 
In addition, agriculture is a natural extension from the biofuels market. It is large, it's sophisticated, it's a global commodity market like the others that Platts serves. Kingsman is a great first step into this marketplace, and Kingsman is not only a leader in biofuels, it is a leader in the sugar market, a key feedstock into the biofuels complex. 
Within Commercial, revenue decreased 2%. J.D. Power's revenue growth was offset by modest declines in the remainder of the portfolio. But simply stated, J.D. Power is poised for its best year ever. This is driven in part by the continued expansion of China's domestic automotive industry, as well as J.D. Power's Power Information Network, proprietary research and automotive consulting. And as J.D. Power continues to pursue business beyond the automotive industry, there's an interesting piece of new business with the National Football League that has contracted with J.D. Power to conduct their voice of the fan tracking. 
With that, let me move over to McGraw-Hill Education. McGraw-Hill Education in the third quarter reported an 11% decline in revenue to $836 million. Revenue decreased at the Higher Education, Professional and International Group, as well as the School Education Group. While both groups are operating in very difficult economic environments, the reported revenues are also impacted by increased deferred revenues resulting from growth in subscription products. 
As the Education business develops and sells more digital solutions, the traditional revenue model is changing and it's changing rapidly. Rather than booking revenue at the time of a sale, revenue has spread out and recognized over the life of the subscription. Largely because of the dramatic increases in McGraw-Hill Education subscription businesses, its third quarter deferred revenue balance increased 74% over the prior year. Excluding the impact of this increase in deferred revenue, the third quarter revenue decline was only 7%. To combat the difficult business environment, McGraw-Hill Education reduced expenses 9% versus the third quarter of 2011 and continues to look for additional cost reduction opportunities. 
The Higher Education, Professional and International Group reported a 6% decrease in revenue. Excluding the impact of increased deferred revenue, the decline was 5%. With difficult economic conditions around the globe, the vast majority of the revenue decline in this group was in international, with Higher Education revenue decreasing modestly. However, the continued migration to digital solution helps to mitigate these declines by offering growing revenue streams in all of its major markets. 
Student usage of our homework study solutions in the higher education market has grown by 67%, boosted by usage of LearnSmart, which grew 115% and now has more than 890,000 registered students. We recently launched a direct-to-consumer website which makes LearnSmart available for purchase by students even if their professors don't utilize it as part of their course. This is a divergence from the business-to-business model that typically has been deployed. 
The School Education Group reported a 16% decline in revenue from the prior year, and excluding the impact of increased deferred revenue, the decrease was 10%. K-12 revenue was down due to weak state funding, with 2012 expected to be the lowest funding year in the last decade. And according to the Association of American Publishers, the AAP, and their statistics, August year-to-date industry K-12 net sales were down 14%. McGraw-Hill Education captured a substantial share of 2012's 2 largest state adoption opportunities, and that's, of course, Florida's K-12 social studies and California's reading program, but could not overcome the overall decline in the rest of U.S. state funding. 
As we look beyond the immediate challenge of state funding for K-12 education, it is important to remember that a strong and innovative education sector is critical for a healthy economy, whether in the United States or around the world, so these current issues should be kept in context. That is why McGraw-Hill Education, driven by new management, is focused on responding to the critical need for education by driving operational excellence, reimagining learning and capturing the new growth opportunities. Indeed, we have made impressive progress over the last few years in developing digital learning products, and we believe there is a long runway of opportunities both in the developed and emerging countries. 
Our products are prime for the digital revolution in education. Virtually all of our content is available in digital form to enable personalized, adaptive learning solutions and improved outcomes. The education market will continue to grow meaningfully as digital devices of all kinds are becoming more prevalent around the world. Our Higher Education business, the CTB testing business and our Professional and International businesses are all well positioned to take advantage of this growth potential. 
In the K-12 market, we are encouraged that the new Common Core State Standards assessments begin in 2014. This should drive demand for both teaching materials and assessments as 46 states have formally adopted the standards of Common Core.  There is also a greater demand by parents and educators for improved performance, which should bode well for our adaptive -- digital learning programs that have demonstrated proven advancements in learning outcomes. 
One major element that is out of our control but clearly impacts the U.S. K-12 market is home prices. We are encouraged by signs that U.S. housing prices may have finally bottomed, which eventually lead to a recovery in state revenue from property taxes. Through August 2012, the S&P/Case-Shiller home price indices, the leading measure of U.S. home prices, showed that the average home price increases for both the 10-City Composite and the 20-City Composites for the fourth consecutive month and those were rising. 
As we approach the separation of the Education company, I want to sincerely thank all of the Education employees for all of their extremely hard work and dedication, helping to raise educational levels around the world. It's not only a noble calling, it's essential, and their hard work and dedication are to be commended. The past year, they have made very tough decisions on costs while building world-class products and services for future growth and success.  With the digital footprint that they have created and the superb new management in place under President Buzz Waterhouse, I feel truly excited about how the Education company is positioned as it becomes a standalone company. 
In summary, McGraw-Hill Financial continues to deliver solid top and bottom line growth. The separation of McGraw-Hill Education is approaching, and the business is becoming an attractive standalone company with highly talented employees, innovative and essential education products and services and an appropriate cost structure. In summation, McGraw-Hill is delivering on its Growth and Value Plan commitments, with the pending separation, exciting growth plans, multiple tuck-in acquisition, sizable cost reductions and aggressive share repurchase program. 
With that, that completes my comments on the third quarter. I will now ask Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, to update you on some of the key financial performance, and then I look forward to go in any direction that you would like to go. Jack?"
21719,222777903,376664,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2012",2012-11-02,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. This morning, I want to discuss several topics: our consolidated results, including cash flow; the financial impact of corporate development activities on the S&P Capital IQ Indices business; the progress of the Growth and Value Plan, in",1554,"Thank you, Terry. This morning, I want to discuss several topics: our consolidated results, including cash flow; the financial impact of corporate development activities on the S&P Capital IQ Indices business; the progress of the Growth and Value Plan, including the primary drivers of cost reduction; and lastly, our increased guidance and outlook for the balance of the year. 
Let me begin by discussing our results, which, as Terry mentioned, were quite different across the Financial and Education businesses. In the quarter, McGraw-Hill Financial delivered excellent growth, with a 15% increase in revenue and a 21% increase in pro forma operating profit. This resulted in 170-basis-point improvement in the pro forma operating margins of 36%. Overall, an excellent quarter across the MHF businesses. 
On the other hand, McGraw-Hill Education revenue decreased 11% and adjusted segment operating profit decreased 15%. As Terry just discussed, the market has proven even more challenging than our original expectations. Obviously, now that the all-important third quarter is behind us, MHE will not deliver on our initial financial guidance for this year. We now expect MHE revenues to decline 7% to 8% and operating income to be $20 million to $25 million below a year ago. Taken together, total consolidated McGraw-Hill both revenue and expenses increased approximately 2%. This resulted in adjusted operating profit growth of 3%. 
Overall, we delivered double-digit earnings per share growth. However, there were substantive changes in below-the-line comparison due to the formation of the new S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture, impacting both the tax rate and the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The reduction in the effective tax rate from the prior year was due primarily to the partnership structure of the joint venture with CME, combined with the modest improvement in our overall rate. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest increased largely due to the new joint venture, which I will elaborate on in just a moment. 
The impact of the accelerated share repurchase program was evident again this quarter. Year-over-year, we reduced shares outstanding by 90 million shares. This leveraged the 4% increase in adjusted net income to a 10% increase in adjusted diluted earnings or $1.33 per share. It should be noted that sequentially, our fully diluted shares outstanding remained unchanged at 285 million shares as stock option exercise activity largely offset share repurchases of approximately $300 million during the quarter. 
Our share repurchase program is an important and ongoing part of the Growth and Value Plan. Since the beginning of 2011 through the third quarter of 2012, the company has repurchased nearly 42 million shares at a weighted average price of $43.22. This reduced shares outstanding by approximately 14%. We anticipate spending approximately $200 million on share repurchases in the fourth quarter. 
Now I would like to provide additional detail regarding the significant business development impact to the S&P Capital IQ and S&P Dow Jones Indices to help you better understand the results. First, within S&P Capital IQ, we made several acquisitions during the year that added new capabilities. The additions of R2, QuantHouse and CME were -- and CMA were all accretive to revenue growth. However, these acquisitions and the work that we are undertaking to integrate these acquisitions are somewhat dilutive to profits. We have absorbed these costs and the related noncash amortization without any negative impact to guidance. 
Secondly, the creation of S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture has important accounting implications for the company. Since we own a majority of the joint venture, 73%, we record 100% of the revenue and expenses in the company's income statement. During the third quarter, this included $82 million in revenues from S&P Indices and $27 million from the Dow Jones Indexes. Of course, the 27% of the net income representing our partner's share is excluded from the bottom line results. 
The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest effectively removes our partner's share of the profits from our income statement. During the third quarter, our partner's share of the profits totaled $18 million. This $18 million is excluded from the company's taxes, and I will address the impact on our reported effective tax rate in more detail in just a moment. 
Taken together, these acquisitions and the formation of the joint venture had a significant impact on the segment's revenue growth. Organic growth was 3%, in part due to difficult year-on-year comparisons in the index business. The joint venture and the 3 acquisitions increased revenue growth to 13%, with approximately 75% of the incremental revenue from the joint venture and 25% from the 3 acquisitions. 
As I mentioned, earlier, the joint venture has had an impact on the company's effective tax rate that merits further explanation. For tax purposes, the joint venture is treated as a partnership. The first column of this chart presents pretax income, provision for taxes and the after-tax income, which implies reported effective tax rate of 33.7% for the third quarter. The middle column shows the partner's share of the joint venture income. 
Note, the company does not make a provision for taxes for the partner's income. The last column shows the tax provision for taxes in the third quarter at a 34.6% rate, about 1 point higher than the reported effective tax rate. On a year-to-date basis, we record a 35.6% provision for taxes, and the reported effective tax rate is 35%. Full year 2012 results should be generally in line with the year-to-date performance. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to have a very strong balance sheet, with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments at quarter end. Year-over-year, our free cash flow is down approximately $200 million due largely to the onetime cash outlays related to the Growth and Value Plan expenses and the timing of quarterly cash tax payments. On a full year basis, we expect to deliver approximately $750 million in free cash flow, excluding cash outlays associated with the Growth and Value Plan. 
One additional point on our balance sheet. This month, about 1/3 of our debt is coming due. As a result, over the near term, it is likely that we will access the commercial paper market as the repayment of the $400 million of debt and the funding of our fourth quarter share repurchase program require domestic cash availability. We will reevaluate further actions related to the balance sheet once the choice of sale versus spin options for McGraw-Hill Education are clear. 
Now let me provide some additional details related to the solid progress we are making in the execution of the Growth and Value Plan. First, all separation activities are either well underway or complete. Secondly, we continue to make progress on our target of at least $100 million in run rate cost savings by the end of 2012. Let me provide some color on the 4 major initiatives that drive the cost reduction program. 
The first was the McGraw-Hill Education cost structure reductions that began in the fourth quarter of 2011 and continue into this quarter. Over 10% of the Education workforce has been reduced to resize the cost structure to market demand and to support the necessary technology investments to advance McGraw-Hill Education's digital offerings. The second was the realignment of our core benefit programs, including the pension and health care plans. The benefit plans across McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education need to be increasingly tailored to their respective competitive environment. 
The third was the partnering relationships to transition various accounting, information technology and human resource activities to world-class partners, including Genpact, Atos and Workday, that specialize in these operations. The transition of these activities is well underway and the associated onetime transition costs stepped up in the third quarter. Lastly, we have targeted selected restructuring activities across McGraw-Hill Financial operations to streamline operations consistent with being a more focused operating company. 
All in all, significant progress has been made already, and we fully expect to reduce at least $100 million in costs on a run-rate basis by the end of the year. During the third quarter, we incurred $99 million of onetime Growth and Value Plan expenses, largely related to professional fees and restructuring. These onetime expenses will continue into the fourth quarter. 
In closing, 2012 is turning out to be a remarkable year for McGraw-Hill. We are exceeding EPS expectations despite a challenging year for McGraw-Hill Education and have increased our earnings per share guidance to a range of $3.35 to $3.40. McGraw-Hill Financial is delivering great performance, and we have expanded the McGraw-Hill Financial portfolio with tuck-in acquisitions and selective partnerships like CME. 
We are positioned to make a decision on sale versus spin for McGraw-Hill Education in the coming weeks, and we are focused on making the right choice for both the business and our shareholders. And through countless efforts around the world, the work is on track to separate 2 leading companies, and we have been able to accomplish all of this while delivering cost reductions of at least $100 million. Now we are focused on a solid finish to 2012 and on finalizing the separation and standup of these 2 terrific industry-leading businesses. 
Thank you for joining us today and your interest in McGraw-Hill. Now let me turn the call back over to Chip Merritt to moderate the Q&A session. Chip?"

And I gave one example of the Brazilian component. But I can tell you the growth of S&P Dow Jones Indices is just going to be phenomenal. It's a wonderful platform, and we're going to be able to do a lot of other things to add to this platform to grow it even faster.

But to date, with the 30 cases that have been dismissed, the number of cases that have been reaffirmed to be dismissed at the higher court level over lower court decision, all of those kinds of things, you have to be focused on all of these kinds of things. But we think the risk here in terms of legal aspects are low."

Look, the Education business, whether we're talking Higher Ed, whether we're talking Professional, International or the all-important K-12, these are essential businesses. I mean, you're talking about educating your future workforce. And the unfortunate part, we have seen in the United States a significant deterioration in educational funding, which has very dire consequences for student achievement and all of those kind of thing. We've got to get back onto that track. Now if your -- if everything is essentially based on property tax structures at local and state municipalities and all of that, and you put the longest housing recession that we've ever seen together with that, you've got a very bad combination, plus the fact that you have so many states that are in deficit and all of those. Those aren't excuses. Those are realities and everything. So one, on improving housing market, getting states out of deficit positions and getting growth again is going to help this situation. But literally, and this won't last, I mean it can, but this is the worst K-12 environment in a decade. And I think it should be, obviously, an outrage to everyone, but it won't last. And second part is, coupled with that environment, the positive here is the speed of the digital transformation part. We are seeing increased activity across the board here. We have been -- whether we're working with certain manufacturer -- device manufacturers or whether we're working with partners in terms of developing digital solution, we've been working aggressively on this for some time, and the receptivity of it is just moving at a very fast pace now. And so that's very encouraging. That's got serious implications for cost reduction, but also, very, very strong positives for our revenue growth on that part. But it's an essential business, it's our future workforce and the Education agenda should be a priority for any country."

I think there's very few companies that have ever talked about both of those things at the same time, and we're trying to put an end date on this cost program because once we get into the early part of next year, these are 2 separate entities. Then it'll be my accountability to come back and talk what would the cost outlook is for McGraw-Hill Financial and Patrick Milano will do the same for McGraw-Hill Education. And I think it's kind of given the separation right ahead of us now, it's premature to kind of go past that.

Well, look, first of all, and not to talk about just the fourth quarter, to talk about the next 3, 5, 10 years, the capital demand needs are huge.

Well, look, first of all, and not to talk about just the fourth quarter, to talk about the next 3, 5, 10 years, the capital demand needs are huge. And if you talk about infrastructure financing alone between now and 2030, you're talking some $70 trillion. You're talking about $1 trillion of infrastructure financing in India alone over the next 5 years. The study that I gave you was on just refunding between now and 2016 of $8 trillion. So the demand here is absolutely huge on that part. So I'm not -- I mean, any given time, you're going to have some slowness or some pickup or whatever, but the overall demand for capital is only going to go up and banks are not going to be able to satisfy all that kind of demand. And in fact, the reason that the capital markets and fixed income markets in particular are doing so well is because now the banks, in many ways, are stalled and the largest portion of the capital demand has got to come from the capital markets on that one. So from a backlog standpoint, we're doing really well. Now the second part to that question is, look, obviously, the European Central Bank made a decision that they were going to intervene in the sovereign bond markets and provide a level of support. That, obviously, created some activity. When Ben Bernanke came out with the QE3, the real question was, ""Is there going to be a QE4 for?"" I don't know and all of that, but both of those caused global spreads to contract and obviously, fueled a surge in September bond issuance. So then I get questions like, ""Okay, well, is that just bringing moneys forward that were in the fourth quarter or the first quarter for next year or something like that?"" How do I know and all of that, and we'll just have to wait and see what the facts are. But the capital demand load is huge on that one and it's worldwide on that part. And again, with 45% of our revenues coming from outside the United States, we're in a terrific position to be able to deal with that."

Joining me on today's conference call is Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Jack and I will review our corporate results. We're going to provide an update on our Growth and Value Plan progress. We'll provide a detailed look at the segment results that make up what will be McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education and then, provide an outlook for the balance of the year. 
Now, like many other New York companies, we delayed our earnings report from Wednesday to today to accommodate employees and shareholders impacted by Hurricane Sandy. And thankfully, all of our employees are safe, and our business continuity plans are operating effectively. Our employees have really stepped up to work through the many challenges, and I'm grateful to them and to the state and city workers who have done so much to help us over this past week. And I hope those of you on the phone affected by the storm are safe and starting the process to return to some state of normality as well. 
All right. Let me begin by saying that we are pleased by the success of our Growth and Value Plan and the strong results of the McGraw-Hill Financial businesses. Now while the Education company is facing some very tough current challenges in the U.S. education sector, we feel very excited by the promise of digital learning and by our new digital products and services, which are improving learning outcomes for students everywhere. And this digital transformation is gaining momentum, and we'll talk about that in just a little bit. 
During the third quarter, the company delivered a 2% increase in revenue. McGraw-Hill Financial, which realized a boost from the robust global issuance, delivered a 15% increase in revenue. Separately, McGraw-Hill Education delivered an 11% decrease in revenue as it managed the impact of the weakest level of state funding for K-12 textbooks in the past decade. Adjusted operating profit increased 3%, and due to our aggressive share repurchase program, we delivered 10% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share, and Jack will provide a little additional financial detail on that in just a moment. 
A little over a year ago, we made a set of commitments in this Growth and Value Plan, and I'm proud of the substantial progress that our employees have made on each of these commitments. And let me take a moment and just walk through these different commitments and give you an update as to where we are. 
The first and most visible commitment is the separation of the company into 2 industry-leading companies, McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education; and we are on track to do so. Amendment #2 to the Form 10 SEC Registration Statement for the potential spinoff of McGraw-Hill Education was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month, and we don't anticipate any substantial issues with that. 
In parallel with our efforts to spin off McGraw-Hill Education, we have undertaken a thorough evaluation process of numerous options, including the option to sell the business. This process is near its conclusion, and we expect to reach a decision in the coming weeks. Critical to this decision is ensuring that we choose the option that maximizes shareholder value. The timing of the ultimate separation will be dictated by which option is chosen. 
We have also committed to more than $100 million in run rate cost reductions by the end of the year. We're on track for this, and Jack will provide some color on this in just a moment. We committed to aggressively repurchasing shares, and after completing the $1.5 billion share repurchase program earlier this year, we reentered the market in the third quarter and purchased an additional $295 million of McGraw-Hill stock. 
Lastly, we committed to investing for growth. Earlier this year, we formed the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture. Importantly, this is the first quarter that we have managed and reported the combined results for some of the most widely followed and trusted brands in the index space. We believe this joint venture will prove to be a great value not only to our customers, but also our shareholders. 
In addition, earlier this year, the company acquired R2 Financial Technologies, QuantHouse, Credit Market Analysis Limited and Coalition Development Ltd. And most recently, we announced the acquisition of Kingsman SA, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a moment. So whether it's through the separation process, cost reductions, share repurchases or investing in growth, McGraw-Hill is meeting its Growth and Value Plan commitments and is on target and on track to do so. 
With that, let me now turn to the business results. McGraw-Hill Financial on a pro forma basis delivered a 15% increase in revenue and a 21% increase in adjusted operating profit during the quarter. Of the 15% revenue growth, 11% was organic and 4% was from the transactions that I just mentioned. 
While all 3 segments delivered revenue growth, it was Standard & Poor's Rating Services and Commodities & Commercial markets that provided the most impressive adjusted operating profit growth of 28% and 29%, respectively, as well as improved adjusted operating margins. McGraw-Hill Financial delivered 40% of its revenue from outside the United States during the third quarter. Domestic revenue growth of 17% outpaced International growth of 12%, which was impacted by adverse foreign exchange rates. 
Standard & Poor's Ratings continues to be the segment with the largest international presence, with 45% of its revenue coming from outside the United States. Standard & Poor's Ratings also delivered the largest revenue increase within McGraw-Hill Financial and delivered its strongest quarterly revenue since the third quarter of 2007. Revenue for this segment grew 22%, with a 33% increase in domestic revenue and a 12% increase in international revenue. The increase in international revenue occurred despite a 7% negative impact from foreign exchange rates. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 28%, and the corresponding operating margin increased almost 200 basis points. 
Actions during the quarter by both the European Central Bank, the ECB, and the Federal Reserve resulted in increased global bond issuance. The ECB's pledge to intervene in the sovereign bond markets and the Federal Reserves' Quantitative Easing 3 program caused global spreads to contract and fueled a surge in September bond issuance. These actions helped to drive U.S. speculative-grade corporate bond issuance to a record $85.4 billion in the third quarter. 
Transaction revenue increased 64% to $215 million. Recall that while issuance in the first half of 2011 was quite robust, it tapered off considerably in the second half of 2011, creating less difficult year-over-year comparisons in the second half of 2012. Nevertheless, the key drivers to the increase in transaction revenue were: one, worldwide corporate issuance, which increased 81%, with a 72% increase in U.S. corporate issuance and 126% increase in European corporate issuance; and secondly, the public finance issuance, which increased 9% and contributed to the growth as well. 
Additionally, worldwide structured issuance was flat, with a 65% increase in the United States' structured finance issuance offset by a 33% decline in European structured finance issuance. The European weakness was driven by a 37% decline in European covered bond issuance as issuers funded through the European Central Bank long-term refinancing option. 
Non-transaction revenue, which represented 57% of Standard & Poor's third quarter revenue, increased 3%. Now in periods of robust debt issuance, investors are frequently concerned about issuance being pulled forward. This is always a difficult point to determine until after the fact. However, a  study by Standard & Poor's Global Fixed Income Research to analyze corporate refunding needs over the next few years may be instructive. 
The study concluded that approximately $8 trillion in rated corporate debt will mature from 2012 to the end of 2016. Let me repeat that, that approximately $8 trillion in rated corporate debt will mature from 2012 to year-end 2016. Now the non-financial sector accounts for about $3.3 trillion of the $8 trillion in maturing debt, and financial companies, including banks and insurance companies, account for the remaining $4.8 trillion. Now this research clearly suggests that corporate debt needs will remain robust over the next several years. 
Our success on the litigation front has been encouraging. The trends that we have discussed in the past quarterly conference calls continue. To date, 30 cases have been dismissed. Nine dismissals by lower courts have been reaffirmed by higher courts, and 10 cases have been voluntarily withdrawn. Again, we have said that the legal risk is low, and it's bearing that out. 
While aiding and abetting and negligent misrepresentation claims have been dropped in the Abu Dhabi case, the trial over fraud claims is set to begin in May. And again, we continue to believe that the legal risk of pending litigation remains very low. 
All right. With that, let me turn now to S&P Capital IQ and the S&P Dow Jones Indices. And again, this is the second largest segment within McGraw-Hill Financial, which delivered solid top line results with revenue growth of 13%. 72% of revenue came from subscriptions, the same as a year ago. International revenue increased 10% to $117 million, and that represents 30% of total segment revenue. Adjusted operating profit increased 5%, and there was a modest decline in the adjusted operating margin as the segment integrates and develops newly acquired technology and products into the S&P Capital IQ offerings. 
Looking at S&P Capital IQ alone. Revenue increased 9%, with organic revenue growth of 5%. Two key products, S&P Capital IQ within Desktop Solutions and Global Data Solutions within Enterprise Solutions both delivered solid growth. S&P Capital IQ delivered double-digit client and subscriber growth, which reached 4,400 clients and 55,000 subscriber new growth, respectively. These results were offset somewhat by revenue weakness from equity research. 
One of the top priorities at S&P Capital IQ is the execution of product innovation and driving integration of the newly acquired assets. On the innovation front, we believe that we are amassing considerable technical capabilities and are working to translate these into competitive advantage. We are pleased to have been recognized for the first time on Institutional Investors' annual 2012 Tech 50 List, coming in, in the 29th spot. 
In addition to integrating the technology, our strategy is to deploy an integrated sales effort that can assemble any combination of S&P Capital IQ products in a customized offering. In fact, in August, we won our first combination sale with an offering that included S&P Capital IQ, Standard & Poor's Ratings data via express feed and CMA credit default swaps. 
The big news is that the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture is up and is running. What a fantastic opportunity we have with this amazing collection of world-renowned brands. This business is all about building trusted and transparent brands, and we have some of the best. 
Having a partner like the CME is also incredibly important. The relationships it maintains with exchanges around the world provides several of our businesses with important access. This access has already been -- or has already enabled us a new opportunity with the BM&FBOVESPA in Brazil. The S&P 500 is being made available to them via a sublicense from the CME Group and the S&P Dow Jones Indices. The launch of a U.S.-dollar-denominated S&P 500 index future settled in the Brazilian real is the first derivative of a U.S. stock index to trade on the Brazilian exchange, the very first. 
S&P Indices reported revenue of $109 million in the third quarter, and excluding the addition of Dow Jones Indexes, revenue was $82 million and decreased 7%. Revenue from exchange-traded funds and mutual funds was very strong, with double-digit increases year-over-year. Assets under management in exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices grew 40% year-over-year to $390 billion, and that includes the Dow Jones Indexes. Their assets under management reached $454 billion. Revenue from derivatives declined due to incredibly difficult comparisons to the third quarter of 2011. This was driven by trading volume of exchange-traded derivatives that decreased 41% versus third quarter 2011. 
This chart should put the difficult comparison into perspective. In the third quarter of 2011, derivative volumes reached a 5-year high as investors hedged their positions due to euro crisis concerns. Please note that with the formation of S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture, there is no longer a direct correlation between the E-mini futures trading volumes and the S&P Indices revenues as in the past. We now receive a percentage of profits from the CME equity complex rather than being paid on a per-contract basis. 
Let me now turn to the Commodities & Commercial markets segment, which delivered a year-over-year adjusted operating profit gain that, again, led all segments. Revenue growth was 5%, with international revenue up 15%. The leverage of the business is very evident. This leverage, coupled with a $5 million decrease in expenses, resulted in an adjusted operating margin that increased more than 500 basis points to 28%. 
Within Commodities, petroleum market subscriptions continued to be the primary growth driver. However, derivative trading in BENTEK Energy also delivered double-digit revenue growth. And Kingsman, which I mentioned earlier, Kingsman leverages Platts' presence in biofuels to make our first foray into the agricultural commodities. The acquisition, which closed yesterday, expands Platts' biofuels position by providing additional coverage, price assessments and subscriber base for the biodiesel and ethanol markets. 
In addition, agriculture is a natural extension from the biofuels market. It is large, it's sophisticated, it's a global commodity market like the others that Platts serves. Kingsman is a great first step into this marketplace, and Kingsman is not only a leader in biofuels, it is a leader in the sugar market, a key feedstock into the biofuels complex. 
Within Commercial, revenue decreased 2%. J.D. Power's revenue growth was offset by modest declines in the remainder of the portfolio. But simply stated, J.D. Power is poised for its best year ever. This is driven in part by the continued expansion of China's domestic automotive industry as well as J.D. Power's Power Information Network, proprietary research and automotive consulting. And as J.D. Power continues to pursue business beyond the automotive industry, there's an interesting piece of new business with the National Football League that has contracted with J.D. Power to conduct their voice of the fan tracking. 
With that, let me move over to McGraw-Hill Education. McGraw-Hill Education in the third quarter reported an 11% decline in revenue to $836 million. Revenue decreased at the Higher Education, Professional and International Group as well as the School Education Group. While both groups are operating in very difficult economic environments, the reported revenues are also impacted by increased deferred revenues resulting from growth in subscription products. 
As the Education business develops and sells more digital solutions, the traditional revenue model is changing, and it's changing rapidly. Rather than booking revenue at the time of a sale, revenue is spread out and recognized over the life of the subscription. Largely because of the dramatic increases in McGraw-Hill Education subscription businesses, its third quarter deferred revenue balance increased 74% over the prior year. Excluding the impact of this increase in deferred revenue, the third quarter revenue decline was only 7%. To combat the difficult business environment, McGraw-Hill Education reduced expenses 9% versus the third quarter of 2011 and continues to look for additional cost-reduction opportunities. 
The Higher Education, Professional and International Group reported a 6% decrease in revenue. Excluding the impact of increased deferred revenue, the decline was 5%. With difficult economic conditions around the globe, the vast majority of the revenue decline in this group was in international, with Higher Education revenue decreasing modestly. However, the continued migration to digital solution helps to mitigate these declines by offering growing revenue streams in all of its major markets. 
Student usage of our homework study solutions in the higher education market has grown by 67%, boosted by usage of LearnSmart, which grew 115% and now has more than 890,000 registered students. We recently launched a direct-to-consumer website which makes LearnSmart available for purchase by students even if their professors don't utilize it as part of their course. This is a divergence from the business-to-business model that typically has been deployed. 
The School Education Group reported a 16% decline in revenue from the prior year, and excluding the impact of increased deferred revenue, the decrease was 10%. K-12 revenue was down due to weak state funding, with 2012 expected to be the lowest funding year in the last decade. And according to the Association of American Publishers, the AAP, and their statistics, August year-to-date industry K-12 net sales were down 14%. McGraw-Hill Education captured a substantial share of 2012's 2 largest state adoption opportunities, and that's, of course, Florida's K-12 social studies and California's reading program, but could not overcome the overall decline in the rest of U.S. state funding. 
As we look beyond the immediate challenge of state funding for K-12 education, it is important to remember that a strong and innovative education sector is critical for a healthy economy, whether in the United States or around the world, so these current issues should be kept in context. That is why McGraw-Hill Education, driven by new management, is focused on responding to the critical need for education by driving operational excellence, reimagining learning and capturing the new growth opportunities. Indeed, we have made impressive progress over the last few years in developing digital learning products, and we believe there is a long runway of opportunities both in the developed and emerging countries. 
Our products are prime for the digital revolution in education. Virtually all of our content is available in digital form to enable personalized, adaptive learning solutions and improved outcomes. The education market will continue to grow meaningfully as digital devices of all kinds are becoming more prevalent around the world. Our Higher Education business, the CTB testing business and our Professional and International businesses are all well positioned to take advantage of this growth potential. 
In the K-12 market, we are encouraged that the new Common Core State Standards assessments begin in 2014. This should drive demand for both teaching materials and assessments as 46 states have formally adopted the standards of Common Core.  There is also a greater demand by parents and educators for improved performance, which should bode well for our adaptive -- digital learning programs that have demonstrated proven advancements in learning outcomes. 
One major element that is out of our control but clearly impacts the U.S. K-12 market is home prices. We are encouraged by signs that U.S. housing prices may have finally bottomed, which eventually lead to a recovery in state revenue from property taxes. Through August 2012, the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices, the leading measure of U.S. home prices, showed that the average home price increases for both the 10-City Composite and the 20-City Composites for the fourth consecutive month and those were rising. 
As we approach the separation of the Education company, I want to sincerely thank all of the Education employees for all of their extremely hard work and dedication.  Helping to raise educational levels around the world is not only a noble calling, it's essential.  And their hard work and dedication are to be commended. The past year, they have made very tough decisions on costs while building world-class products and services for future growth and success.  With the digital footprint that they have created and the superb new management in place under President ""Buzz"" Waterhouse, I feel truly excited about how the Education company is positioned as it becomes a standalone company. 
In summary, McGraw-Hill Financial continues to deliver solid top and bottom line growth. The separation of McGraw-Hill Education is approaching, and the business is becoming an attractive standalone company with highly talented employees, innovative and essential education products and services and an appropriate cost structure. In summation, McGraw-Hill is delivering on its Growth and Value Plan commitments, with the pending separation, exciting growth plans, multiple tuck-in acquisition, sizable cost reductions and aggressive share repurchase program. 
With that, that completes my comments on the third quarter. I will now ask Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, to update you on some of the key financial performance, and then I'd look forward to going in any direction that you would like to go. Jack?"
21719,222777903,377013,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2012",2012-11-02,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. This morning, I want to discuss several topics: our consolidated results, including cash flow; the financial impact of corporate development activities on the S&P Capital IQ Indices business; the progress of the Growth and Value Plan, in",1557,"Thank you, Terry. This morning, I want to discuss several topics: our consolidated results, including cash flow; the financial impact of corporate development activities on the S&P Capital IQ Indices business; the progress of the Growth and Value Plan, including the primary drivers of cost reduction; and lastly, our increased guidance and outlook for the balance of the year. 
Let me begin by discussing our results, which, as Terry mentioned, were quite different across the Financial and Education businesses. In the quarter, McGraw-Hill Financial delivered excellent growth, with a 15% increase in revenue and a 21% increase in pro forma operating profit. This resulted in a 170-basis-point improvement in the pro forma operating margins of 36%. Overall, an excellent quarter across the MHF businesses. 
On the other hand, McGraw-Hill Education revenue decreased 11% and adjusted segment operating profit decreased 15%. As Terry just discussed, the market has proven even more challenging than our original expectations. Obviously, now that the all-important third quarter is behind us, MHE will not deliver on our initial financial guidance for this year. We now expect MHE revenues to decline 7% to 8% and operating income to be $20 million to $25 million below a year ago. Taken together, total consolidated McGraw-Hill, both revenue and expenses, increased approximately 2%. This resulted in adjusted operating profit growth of 3%. 
Overall, we delivered double-digit earnings-per-share growth. However, there were substantive changes in below-the-line comparison due to the formation of the new S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture, impacting both the tax rate and the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The reduction in the effective tax rate from the prior year was due primarily to the partnership structure of the joint venture with CME, combined with the modest improvement in our overall rate. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest increased largely due to the new joint venture, which I will elaborate on in just a moment. 
The impact of the accelerated share repurchase program was evident again this quarter. Year-over-year, we reduced shares outstanding by 90 [ph] million shares. This leveraged a 4% increase in adjusted net income to a 10% increase in adjusted diluted earnings or $1.33 per share. It should be noted that sequentially, our fully diluted shares outstanding remained unchanged at 285 million shares as stock option exercise activity largely offset share repurchases of approximately $300 million during the quarter. 
Our share repurchase program is an important and ongoing part of the Growth and Value Plan. Since the beginning of 2011 through the third quarter of 2012, the company has repurchased nearly 42 million shares at a weighted average price of $43.22. This reduced shares outstanding by approximately 14%. We anticipate spending approximately $200 million on share repurchases in the fourth quarter. 
Now I would like to provide additional detail regarding the significant business development impact to the S&P Capital IQ and S&P Dow Jones Indices to help you better understand the results. First, within S&P Capital IQ, we made several acquisitions during the year that added new capabilities. The additions of R2, QuantHouse and CME were -- and CMA were all accretive to revenue growth. However, these acquisitions and the work that we are undertaking to integrate these acquisitions are somewhat dilutive to profits. We have absorbed these costs and the related noncash amortization without any negative impact to guidance. 
Secondly, the creation of S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture has important accounting implications for the company. Since we own a majority of the joint venture, 73%, we record 100% of the revenue and expenses in the company's income statement. During the third quarter, this included $82 million in revenues from S&P Indices and $27 million from the Dow Jones Indexes. Of course, the 27% of the net income representing our partner's share is excluded from the bottom line results. 
The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest effectively removes our partner's share of the profits from our income statement. During the third quarter, our partner's share of the profits totaled $18 million. This $18 million is excluded from the company's taxes, and I will address the impact on our reported effective tax rate in more detail in just a moment. 
Taken together, these acquisitions and the formation of the joint venture had a significant impact on the segment's revenue growth. Organic growth was 3%, in part due to difficult year-on-year comparisons in the index business. The joint venture and the 3 acquisitions increased revenue growth to 13%, with approximately 75% of the incremental revenue from the joint venture and 25% from the 3 acquisitions. 
As I mentioned earlier, the joint venture has had an impact on the company's effective tax rate that merits further explanation. For tax purposes, the joint venture is treated as a partnership. The first column of this chart presents pretax income, provision for taxes and the after-tax income, which implies the reported effective tax rate of 33.7% for the third quarter. The middle column shows the partner's share of the joint venture income.  Note the company does not make a provision for taxes for the partner's income. The last column shows the tax provision for taxes in the third quarter at a 34.6% rate, about 1 point higher than the reported effective tax rate. On a year-to-date basis, we record a 35.6% provision for taxes, and the reported effective tax rate is 35%. Full year 2012 results should be generally in line with the year-to-date performance. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to have a very strong balance sheet, with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments at quarter end. Year-over-year, our free cash flow is down approximately $200 million, due largely to the onetime cash outlays related to the Growth and Value Plan expenses and the timing of quarterly cash tax payments. On a full year basis, we expect to deliver approximately $750 million in free cash flow, excluding cash outlays associated with the Growth and Value Plan. 
One additional point on our balance sheet. This month, about 1/3 of our debt is coming due. As a result, over the near term, it is likely that we will access the commercial paper market as the repayment of the $400 million of debt and the funding of our fourth quarter share repurchase program require domestic cash availability. We will reevaluate further actions related to the balance sheet once the choice of sale versus spin options for McGraw-Hill Education are clear. 
Now let me provide some additional details related to the solid progress we are making in the execution of the Growth and Value Plan. First, all separation activities are either well under way or complete. Secondly, we continue to make progress on our target of at least $100 million in run rate cost savings by the end of 2012. Let me provide some color on the 4 major initiatives that drive the cost reduction program. 
The first was the McGraw-Hill Education cost structure reductions that began in the fourth quarter of 2011 and continue into this quarter. Over 10% of the Education workforce has been reduced to resize the cost structure to market demand and to support the necessary technology investments to advance McGraw-Hill Education's digital offerings. The second was the realignment of our core benefit programs, including the pension and health care plans. The benefit plans across McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education need to be increasingly tailored to their respective competitive environment. 
The third was the partnering relationships to transition various accounting, information technology and human resource activities to world-class partners, including Genpact, Atos and Workday, that specialize in these operations. The transition of these activities is well under way, and the associated onetime transition costs stepped up in the third quarter. Lastly, we have targeted selected restructuring activities across McGraw-Hill Financial operations to streamline operations consistent with being a more focused operating company. 
All in all, significant progress has been made already, and we fully expect to reduce at least $100 million in costs on a run-rate basis by the end of the year. During the third quarter, we incurred $99 million of onetime Growth and Value Plan expenses, largely related to professional fees and restructuring. These onetime expenses will continue into the fourth quarter. 
In closing, 2012 is turning out to be a remarkable year for McGraw-Hill. We are exceeding EPS expectations despite a challenging year for McGraw-Hill Education and have increased our earnings per share guidance to a range of $3.35 to $3.40. McGraw-Hill Financial is delivering great performance, and we have expanded the McGraw-Hill Financial portfolio with tuck-in acquisitions and selective partnerships like CME. 
We are positioned to make a decision on sale versus spin for McGraw-Hill Education in the coming weeks, and we are focused on making the right choice for both the business and our shareholders. And through countless efforts around the world, the work is on track to separate 2 leading companies, and we have been able to accomplish all of this while delivering cost reductions of at least $100 million. Now we are focused on a solid finish to 2012 and on finalizing the separation and standup of these 2 terrific industry-leading businesses. 
Thank you for joining us today and your interest in McGraw-Hill. Now let me turn the call back over to Chip Merritt to moderate the Q&A session. Chip?"

As you know, in the United States, we do everything at the federal court level. And literally, because of all the litigation out there, not just ours, I mean, all of the litigation out there, it takes 2, 2.5 years to get before a federal judge, and so you have to wait. And one of the things that we have said, and we're encouraged by the results, is that in many cases, once it gets before a judge, it's the same day that these cases get dismissed on all that. So we are -- we think that we're in a very good position. We're obviously well advised, and it's a wait-and-see game. But to date, with the 30 cases that have been dismissed, the number of cases that have been reaffirmed to be dismissed at the higher-court level over a lower-court decision, all of those kinds of things, you have to be focused on all of these kinds of things.

Look, the Education business, whether we're talking Higher Ed, whether we're talking Professional, International or the all-important K-12, these are essential businesses. I mean, you're talking about educating your future workforce. And the unfortunate part, we have seen in the United States a significant deterioration in educational funding, which has very dire consequences for student achievement and all of those kind of thing. We've got to get back onto that track. Now if your -- if everything is essentially based on property tax structures at local and state municipalities and all that, and you put the longest housing recession that we've ever seen together with that, you've got a very bad combination, plus the fact that you have so many states that are in deficit and all of those thing.  Those aren't excuses. Those are realities and everything. So one, on improving housing market, getting states out of deficit positions and getting growth again is going to help this situation. But literally -- and this won't last.  I mean, it can't.  But this is the worst K-12 environment in a decade. And I think it should be, obviously, an outrage to everyone, but it won't last. And second part is, coupled with that environment, the positive here is the speed of the digital transformation part. We are seeing increased activity across the board here. We have been -- whether we're working with certain manufacturer -- device manufacturers or whether we're working with partners in terms of developing digital solution, we've been working aggressively on this for some time, and the receptivity of it is just moving at a very fast pace now. And so that's very encouraging. That's got serious implications for cost reduction, but also, very, very strong positives for our revenue growth on that part.

Then it'll be my accountability to come back and talk what would the cost outlook is for McGraw-Hill Financial, and it'll be Patrick Milano's to do the same for McGraw-Hill Education.

First of all, and not to talk about just the fourth quarter, to talk about the next 3, 5, 10 years, the capital demand needs are huge.

And if you talk about infrastructure financing alone, between now and 2030, you're talking some $70 trillion. You're talking about $1 trillion of infrastructure financing in India alone over the next 5 years. The study that I gave you was on just refunding between now and 2016 of $8 trillion. So the demand here is absolutely huge on that part. So I'm not -- I mean, any given time, you're going to have some slowness or some pickup or whatever, but the overall demand for capital is only going to go up, and banks are not going to be able to satisfy all that kind of demand. And in fact, the reason that the capital markets and fixed income markets in particular are doing so well is because now the banks, in many ways, are stalled and the largest portion of the capital demand has got to come from the capital markets on that one. So from a backlog standpoint, we're doing really well. Now the second part to that question is, look, obviously, the European Central Bank made a decision that they were going to intervene in the sovereign bond market and provide a level of support. That, obviously, created some activity. When Ben Bernanke came out with the QE3, the real question was, ""Is there going to be a QE4?"" and anything.  I don't know and all of that, but both of those caused global spreads to contract and, obviously, fueled a surge in September bond issuance. So then I get questions like, ""Okay, well, is that just bringing moneys forward that were in the fourth quarter or the first quarter for next year or something like that?"" How do I know and all of that, and we'll just have to wait and see what the facts are. But the capital demand load is huge on that one and it's worldwide on that part. And again, with 45% of our revenues coming from outside the United States, we're in a terrific position to be able to deal with that."

A question, though, just -- and I don't mean to labor the point, but if I can just address the coming decision process around the Education asset, and clearly, you've talked about it being on a timescale of the coming weeks. Are you able to describe what kind of decision you are now going through? Is it one of having received the bids, you're determining whether a price is acceptable? I know it's a difficult area to talk about, but if you could shed some light on that, that would be helpful"

Thanks, David, and thanks for your comments about New York . I mean, as you know, from your own associates, I mean, it has really been hard hit, and it's probably going to be weeks in terms of getting total business continuity going again and all of that. But thanks for the comments on that. Now as far as the separation process and all that, look, we said from the very beginning that we're going to look at every single aspect in all of this, and that's exactly what we've done. We've given out timelines, and we are coming to a conclusion. And again, I think to skew this in any way is not appropriate from my standpoint at this point. So the best color I can give you is that you're not talking a long time frame here. You're talking, literally, coming weeks and maybe sooner."

Look, I thought the range $3.25 to $3.35 was a really, really solid number and range for us for 2012. The facts that things were a little bit better, that our cost reduction programs came in, all of those kinds of things, we started in the midyear giving guidance that it was more like $3.30 and maybe closer as we got on towards the upper end of the range. But given the third quarter and all of that and the way we expect to finish 2012, we think that improving the guidance from $3.35 to $3.40 is a good step. I mean, it's really there. Now would I like to be able to give more -- I'll get into a wrestling match with Jack here in a minute and all of that. But we're pleased with that guidance, and if things go the way we like it, we'll be very pleased."
