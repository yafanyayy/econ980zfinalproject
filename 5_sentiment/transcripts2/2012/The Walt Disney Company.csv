Our first quarter results were driven by our strong performances from many of our businesses, particularly, Cable Networks and Parks and Resorts. And EPS of $0.80 for the first quarter was up 18% from last year",1582,"Thank you, Lowell. Good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results were driven by our strong performances from many of our businesses, particularly, Cable Networks and Parks and Resorts. And EPS of $0.80 for the first quarter was up 18% from last year.  Our results reflects the benefit of our ongoing strategy to invest in and leverage our core brands, Disney, Pixar, Marvel, ESPN and ABC. Underscoring our consistent focus on creating high-quality entertainment experiences through the use of innovative technology across our businesses and around the globe.
Since our last earnings report, a lot has transpired. We launched an over the year Disney Channel in Russia, we successfully acquired control of UTV, a leading movie and television company in India, we made a lot of progress in the design and early construction of Shanghai Disneyland, our fourth cruise ship, the Disney Fantasy, completed sea trials in the North Atlantic, 2 of the films we distributed were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, the Disney Channel has the top 5 shows for kids and we announced the landmark agreement with Comcast for the distribution of all of our program channels.
I'd like to start by explaining why the Comcast agreement will be significant. As you all know, we own and program some of the best and most watched and most valuable channels in the business, all branded Disney, ABC or ESPN. These channels have delivered great value to us, to consumers and to distributors, and over the years, we've successfully invested more capital to enhance their value. And this new deal not only provides for distribution into next decade, but the rates that we will be paid reflect the increased value we're now providing. 
The multichannel business model is extremely important to us and to others in the business, adds new choices to distribute and consume content proliferate, we thought it was vital for us to accomplish 3 things: Allow more consumers access to our programs and channels on new devices, including mobile, desktop and laptop; protect and enhance the value of the multichannel subscription to the distributor by allowing it to sell access to our programs and channels on devices as part of their service and by not allowing access to channels to nonsubscribers; and get paid by the distributor for creating this opportunity. And all 3 were accomplished in this deal, which Comcast and we view as important to us and to our customers.
This deal highlighted the value of our television businesses, including our Kids portfolio. And as I mentioned earlier, the Disney Channel has had great success and tremendous ratings growth, driven by the compelling characters and strong storytelling that define the brand and connect with kids, tweens, as well as their families. In incredibly competitive environment, Disney Channel now has the 5 top series for kids 2 to 11, led by Jesse and Good Luck Charlie. It's been the #1 channel among tweens 9 to 14 for 21 months in a row, and the top channel for kids 6 to 11 for 9 straight months as well. 
Disney XD launched in 2008 and it just returned its most-watched quarter ever with its ratings increasing 11% over the last year. We see Disney XD, with its target audience of boys as a great opportunity to leverage Marvel characters and we believe the April 1 launch of the new Marvel Universe programming block would generate even stronger ratings and will become a powerful platform to support and grow the Marvel brand. Disney XD now has 23 existing channels and program blocks around the world and will add Australia, New Zealand in Southeast Asia.
Our newest kids brand, Disney, Jr., also posted record ratings, with 24% increase year-over-year as preschool viewers tuned in to a programming block of original series like Jake and the Neverland Pirates and the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, which are now the top 2 cable programs among preschool boys. Given its growing popularity, we also believe Jake and the Neverland Pirates has significant franchise potential, joining our list of successful franchises including Phineas and Ferb. Since introducing the Disney, Jr. brand a year ago, we've successfully launched 28 standalone channels and branded programming blocks around the world and we'll launch a 24-hour channel to 30 million U.S. homes next month.
Today, we launched more than 100 kids channels around the world, including Disney Channel, Disney XD and Disney, Jr., and our kids portfolio is a key component of our company's global growth strategy especially in emerging markets. We're encouraged by the initial success of our newest Disney Channel in Russia launched just 5 weeks ago and the recent addition of Turkey. In the last 3 years, our reach across European, Middle Eastern and African markets has tripled to more than 100 million households. 
The combination of strong programming and far greater distribution has elevated the Disney Channel business to incredible importance and value for the company, helping to drive strong financial results and amazing brand building momentum.
Some additional highlights from our Media Networks, ESPN's Monday Night Football was the most-watched series on cable for the sixth consecutive year. And although the football season is over, ESPN makes great use of those additional rights that it acquired in our recent NFL contract extension, and runs NFL-related programming on a year-round basis. ESPN continues to lead on digital platforms and has been the #1 sports destination on mobile devices since 2007, while online at ESPN.com, it has captured more of fans' time than any other sport site for 16 consecutive months.
And at ABC, Revenge and Once Upon A Time, our 2 new fall dramas continue to be hits for the network, and ratings increased for the second year in a row for our Wednesday night comedy block, led of course by the multi-award-winning Modern Family.  Several promising ABC shows premiere in the coming weeks including Missing, Scandal and GCB, and tonight is the debut of the spellbinding new drama The River.
Earlier, I mentioned UTV, and last week marked a major step in our India expansion. They're an acquisition of a controlling interest in UTV, India's premier media and entertainment company. By combining our existing businesses in India with UTV, it will be a leading film studio and TV programmer, with 9 separate channels, including Disney Channel, which is #1 with kids in the country.  The UTV acquisition will allow us to more effectively build, monetize and brand local and Disney franchises, and create content for the world's second-largest population. And one of the exciting opportunities for us in India is the absence of a strong family entertainment brand in that country, and our goal is to make Disney the #1 family entertainment brand in India, something we've accomplish over the years in so many markets around the world.
Turning to Parks and Resorts, I'm very pleased with recent attendance and pricing trends. Disneyland Resort has seen strong results lately due in part to the strategic investment we made at Disney's California Adventure. We've already opened some attractions as part of the expansion plan, but the largest and most exciting part of this expansion has yet to open, and that's Cars Land. This brand-new 12-acre land with 3 attractions set in Radiator Springs will open in June. 
Hong Kong Disneyland had a very good quarter as well. It was recently unveiled Toy Story Land, the first of 3 new themed areas to open as part of its expansion. 
Setting sail next month is the Disney Fantasy, the sister ship to the popular Disney Dream, expanding our fleet to 4 and allowing Disney Cruise Line to significantly increase in new destinations around the world. And as I also mentioned earlier, we're really pleased that construction of the Shanghai Disney Resort is well underway at the 963-acre site. And just looking at the model of this vast new resort has us all very excited about its prospects.
Turning to the Studio, our key upcoming titles are John Carter, an epic live-action adventure from Director Andrew Stent of Pixar, Marvel's most anticipated The Avengers, which will be the first Marvel film marketed and distributed by Disney, Disney-Pixar's Brave about a feisty heroine's adventure in the Scottish Highlands, and then later this year, we have Tim Burton's Frank and Winnie, and Disney Animation's Record Ralph. Those are both in fiscal 2013.  Also in 2013 from our Temple releases are Oz, Iron Man 3, the Lone Ranger and Monsters University, the sequel to the very successful Monsters, Inc.
As an extension of our new Consumer Products business, Disney's baby initiative, we launched disneybaby.com last month, creating a new destination for parents to connect and share experiences with each other. I'm also proud to say that in December, we had record-breaking traffic across all Disney-branded online sites and our popular mobile game Where's My Water has now reached the top of the charts and 71 different countries, including Cardly in the U.S. and while Guardians Of Time is named the most popular social game on Facebook.
In closing, we had a great start of the fiscal year, executing on our ongoing strategy, driving more and more value from our brands, Disney, Pixar, Marvel ESPN and ABC in the U.S. and around the globe. And we're confident that our commitment to creating and providing exceptional family entertainment on multiple platforms continues to position us to create long-term shareholder value.
And with that, I thank you, and turn the call over to Jay Rasulo."
191564,145646223,216814,"Walt Disney Co., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2012",2012-02-07,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal 2012 is off to a great start as evidenced by the strong financial results we delivered during the quarter. These results follow on the back of record revenue net income and earnings per share we del",1404,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal 2012 is off to a great start as evidenced by the strong financial results we delivered during the quarter. These results follow on the back of record revenue net income and earnings per share we delivered in 2011. 
I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing the first quarter in more detail and then highlight some factors that may influence our upcoming performance.
Operating income for the quarter was up 11% on revenue growth of 1%. Excluding Studio, revenue would've been up more than 4%. I mention this because as you know, the Studio has pursued a strategy of reducing production output and focusing on improving returns on invested capital rather than growing revenue.  Our Q1 results reflect this strategy. 
In the first quarter, Media Networks was once again the largest contributor to our performance, led by Cable Networks, where operating income growth was driven by ESPN and the worldwide Disney Channel. ESPN's growth was due to higher affiliate revenue related to both higher rates and lower revenue deferrals compared to the prior year. We deferred $76 million less in revenue during Q1, primarily as a result of our new affiliate agreement with Comcast. As a result of this agreement, ESPN will no longer defer Comcast affiliate revenue during the year. We expect ESPN will defer approximately $70 million less in revenue during the second quarter than in prior year. I remind you that the change in ESPN's revenue recognition related to Comcast has no impact on full year results.
ESPN's advertising revenue in Q1 was comparable to the prior year but up 8% after adjusting for the timing of the Rose and Fiesta bowls and the impact of the NBA lockout. If you'll recall, the Rose and Fiesta bowls aired during our first quarter last year, but those games fell in our second quarter this year. Also due to the NBA lockout, ESPN aired 29 fewer NBA games during Q1 compared to last year. ESPN will air more NBA games during the second and third fiscal quarters compared to last year, so the full year total will not change.
So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales are pacing up single digits after adjusting for the benefit of the Rose and Fiesta bowls. We are quite pleased with ESPN's current ad momentum, particularly given that ad revenue was up 23% during the second quarter last year after adjusting for the benefit of ESPN's first airing of the BCS.
Growth at the Worldwide Disney Channel was due to increased advertising and affiliate revenue, partially offset by higher programming and production costs. We continued to enjoy strong advertising momentum at ABC Family during the quarter, with ad revenue up 10%. So far during the second quarter, ABC Family ad sales are pacing up double digits. 
At Broadcasting, operating income was lower in the quarter as a result of decreased political ad revenue at our owned TV stations, partially offset by lower programming and production costs. Marketing spending at the ABC Network was higher in the quarter, reflecting support for several new primetime shows launched in Q1, including Revenge and Once Upon A Time. Both of these ABC Studios-produced shows are off to great starts.
Ad revenue at the stations was down 20% in the quarter. Excluding political advertising and the Flint and Toledo stations, which were sold in Q3 last year, ad revenue was up 3%. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was comparable to the prior year. Quarter to date, scatter pricing at the ABC network is running mid-teen percentage points above upfront levels. Q2 TV station ad sales are pacing down single digits.
We are pleased with our continued strong results at Parks and Resorts. Revenue for the quarter was up 10% and operating income was up 18%. The growth in operating income was the result of higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic parks and higher passenger cruise days driven by the Disney Dream, partially offset by higher costs. Total segment margins were up 120 basis points in the first quarter versus last year's Q1. 
For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 3% and per capita spending was up 8% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending. Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6% while occupancy was flat. The increase in per room spending was driven by higher pricing and a reduction of promotional room nights.
So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up mid-single digits compared to prior-year levels, while book rates are also up mid-single digits. Our first quarter results and the trends we are seeing so far in the second quarter are further evidence that our strategy of returning pricing to more normal levels without sacrificing volume continues to pay off.
At our International Parks and Resorts, operating income at Hong Kong Disneyland was higher due to increased guest spending and higher attendance. Operating income at Disneyland Paris was lower due to higher cost and the absence of a real estate sales that took place in Q1 of last year. 
As I mentioned earlier, Studio Entertainment revenue decline compared to prior year. This decline was primarily due to the release of fewer Disney-produced titles compared to last year and higher worldwide box office performances of Tangled and Tron in Q1 of last year compared to the Muppets this year. However, Studio operating income was higher in the quarter due to lower marketing, distribution and production costs associated with the release of these films.
At Consumer Products, operating income for the quarter was comparable to prior year. Merchandise, licensing earned revenue was in line with prior year as higher sales of Cars merchandise was largely offset by lower sales of Toy Story merchandise. 
At the Interactive Media segment, operating losses increased from the prior year due to the lower performance of our Console Game business, but partially offset by higher operating income from social games.  The decline in console games was due to fewer titles being released this quarter compared to last year, as well as lower performance of Disney Universe in Q1 compared to the very successful Epic Mickey last year. Higher operating income at social games was due to lower impact of purchase accounting for Playdom, as well as improved game performance driven by higher revenue from Gardens of Time.
Now let me turn to the second quarter. We'll continue to invest in successful initiatives that strengthen and extend our brands. In 2011, ABC Family's ratings grew for the eighth consecutive year, and ABC Family ranked as a top cable network for the third consecutive year in total viewers in adults 18 to 49.  During Q2, ABC Family will air approximately 20 additional hours of original programming, which will further strengthen its lineup of shows and extend ABC Family's popularity with millennial viewers. These additional hours of programming will result in approximately $35 million of incremental programming and marketing expense in the quarter. 
As Bob mentioned, we continue to expand the geographic footprint and reach of the Disney brand. In March, we will launch a new broadcast satellite channel in Japan targeting women and families. We expect to invest $35 million behind this initiative during the remainder of the fiscal year with approximately half of that falling in Q2. 
At Parks and Resorts, we will launch the Disney Fantasy at the end of the second quarter, whereas the Disney Dream launched in late January last year. As a result, we expect to incur preopening expenses in the second quarter related to the launch of the Fantasy, but the ship will not generate meaningful revenue until Q3.
While all of these investments will drive incremental expense during the second quarter, we're confident in our ability to generate attractive returns on these investments.
We continued to repurchase our stock -- continued to repurchase our stock during the first quarter by buyback 23.3 million shares for about $800 million, which is consistent with the pace during the first quarter last year. Fiscal year to date, we have repurchased 33 million shares for $1.2 billion. 
We feel great about the start of the fiscal year and look forward to continuing to execute on our strategic and financial objectives, and delivering strong performance for our shareholders during the rest of fiscal 2012.
With that, we turn the call over to Lowell for questions"

Yes, we still believe that the new initiative revenues will largely be offset by cost, new costs in for the entire fiscal year. And I've mentioned that before, that we were looking at about $500 million of additional revenue, which would be largely offset by launch costs, training cost, all the things that go into launching those businesses. In terms of Cruise, Alexia, it was not a really significant difference in the number, it's about $7 million or $8 million in difference from what we recognized last year. But understanding that the timing of the launch of the Fantasy is later than the timing of the launch of the Dream, it would be more costs in Q2. Sort of in total there, they're about the same, but it's more switch into Q2 than Q1 versus those costs for the Dream. And as I mentioned on a few calls ago, we're talking in the tens of millions for the launch costs associated here and nowhere near triple digits on the lower end of the tens of millions."

I'm assuming they themselves haven't had it or they haven't had it from their customers. And so, ESPN has remained basically on a highly distributed tier, not just with Comcast, but across the industry. Now there's so much that's been said about chord cutting and chord slicing and a la cart packages. I think it's just important to emphasize a couple of points about that again. First, I'll start with ESPN. I think they've now gotten to a point because of their popularity and the quality of what they offer, they almost transcend sports. They offer news, stories that are of interest nationally and locally, of a programs 6,400 hours of live in original programming a year, 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. Their ratings double the combination of all the RSMs in markets as a for instance. And I just think generally speaking, not only are they popular, but they've gotten into that virtual must-have category. We don't take that for granted. But because of their position and because of not just their popularity, but almost the value that they now supply both to the distributor and to the customer, we don't really see either a la carte offerings or chord splicing -- or slicing I guess, I should say, as a trend. The only thing I want to say about a la carte and I've said it a few times, is that I think people want variety and they're getting it today and they're also getting substantially increased quality. I said this before, but for $60, which is the average cost of the expanded basic service, consumers get about 100 channels of programming. Those channels, ours and others, have put billions of dollars into programming over the years. So the product is a lot better. And if suddenly, they were able to buy these channels on an a la carte basis, we know what would happen. First of all, there would be channels that are interested a lot of different entities, in some cases, niche channels, that would simply go away. And I don't think that would necessarily be good. Secondly, the channels that were left would see decreased distribution, decreased ratings, decreased advertising revenue, and that will put a lot of pressure on the rates that they charge. So the rates would go up. The result would be that consumers would be spending more per channel, and it's quite possible that the $60 100-channel package would quickly become a $60 50-channel package. And I don't think that's necessarily good siding that's 1 of the reasons why we're not seeing some great interest in chord cutting because I think generally, consumers are happy with the quality and the variety that they're getting and the price to value relationship is generally good."

And we will be opening different parts of this hotel over the next year, year and a half, most of us will be in the family suite category. And to put that in perspective, I don't have the pricing in front of me directly. But my recollection is that we're selling family suites somewhere in the neighborhood of $200 to $225 a night. This have been very, very popular in the marketplace. And we thought we wanted to expand. Obviously, a family suite is designed to accommodate an entire family. And for that price, we think that this is it's right to call this a value room or value accommodation. We've seen a fair amount of demand in this space over the last 5 or so years, actually probably longer as he said before, if you look at our profile, particularly in Florida, we have many more value-priced keys or rooms and suites available today, about 40% of our total fit into that category. As of the first quarter that we just announced, obviously, when we open this new resort, which is very, very large, that number's going to grow somewhat.

I want to add because I'm very proud of it and proud of our team, but for what we borrowed and both the amounts and our rating, we really almost always in the past year, saw historically low coupon rates on that debt. And whereas a couple have been better since then. I think we've timid our steps into the debt marketplace very carefully, and put a lot of time into picking what we think would be low entry points and we have been very successful in doing that. In doing so, we obviously increased our debt because of the availability of money at these great rates. But I think that one of the reasons why we kind of punched beyond our weight in the debt market is because we have been so strategic and so public and so consistent in wanting to keep a A rating on our balance sheet and go to the market with that consistent message. We have no intention at the current time to change that. There is some -- we can continue to leverage up somewhat and stay below that sort of 2.0  gross debt ratio, that will keep us at that A, and we won't push ourselves beyond that. I think there's a little more capacity when we see opportunities to step out. Again, we've got a couple of maturities that we'd like to fill in and when the see the opportunity to step in a great rates, I think you'll see us doing that. Of course, as time passes, will have some maturities that will refill.

There was no connection between the announcement was made yesterday and the decision by the Studio, which is made by the Studio, to go to the 28-day window. The reason they hadn't gone to that window before is the Studio felt that it was not seeing any affect from these dollar rentals on their sellthrough business, and it was their feeling that if they went to that model, it really wasn't -- there would be nothing to be gained from. In fact is what they actually might lose from. They have taken a hard look at the business overall. I'd say that the industry has continued to suffer on the sellthrough side and the sale of goods digitally or the rental side have not made up for enough of that falloff that's across the industry. And so, they decided to take a step in the direction of further protecting the initial window and the sellthrough window. The whole issue of authentication is somewhat different or separate from the discussion on windowing, although I understand why you would connect the 2. What authentication is about is we see it as really 2 things. One, it's recognizing the value of the multichannel distribution business model and working to protect it, but also working to enhance it by recognizing the value and the excitement of new technology platforms. And so, what this does is it gives people, who have subscribed to those services, the ability to watch these channels and watch these programs in a much more mobile, much more flexible ways than all the other devices. It also, does create a window that advantages the subscriber and on at least the rental side, disadvantages the nonsubscriber. The nonsubscriber would still be able to buy some of these programs on a sellthrough basis digitally, virtually right after they air, but would not be able to gain access to them on a rental or a VOD model, unless they're subscribers of the service. And that's obviously designed to protect again the business model, while at the same time recognizing the importance of it and the potential and the excitement around new technology-driven platforms."

Our first quarter results were driven by strong performances from many of our businesses, particularly, Cable Networks and Parks and Resorts. And EPS of $0.80 for the first quarter was up 18% from last year.  O",1579,"Thank you, Lowell. Good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results were driven by strong performances from many of our businesses, particularly, Cable Networks and Parks and Resorts. And EPS of $0.80 for the first quarter was up 18% from last year.  Our results reflect the benefit of our ongoing strategy to invest in and leverage our core brands, Disney, Pixar, Marvel, ESPN and ABC, underscoring our consistent focus on creating high-quality entertainment experiences through the use of innovative technology across our businesses and around the globe.
Since our last earnings report, a lot has transpired. We launched an over-the-year Disney Channel in Russia; we successfully acquired control of UTV, a leading movie and television company in India; we made a lot of progress in the design and early construction of Shanghai Disneyland; our fourth cruise ship, the Disney Fantasy, completed sea trials in the North Atlantic; 2 of the films we distributed were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture; the Disney Channel has the top 5 shows for kids; and we announced the landmark agreement with Comcast for the distribution of all of our program channels.
I'd like to start by explaining why the Comcast agreement will be significant. As you all know, we own and program some of the best and most watched and most valuable channels in the business, all branded Disney, ABC or ESPN. These channels have delivered great value to us, to consumers and to distributors, and over the years, we've successfully invested more capital to enhance their value. And this new deal not only provides for distribution into the next decade, but the rates that we will be paid reflect the increased value we're now providing. 
The multichannel business model is extremely important to us and to others in the business. And as new choices to distribute and consume content proliferate, we thought it was vital for us to accomplish 3 things: allow more consumers access to our programs and channels on new devices, including mobile, desktop and laptop; protect and enhance the value of the multichannel subscription to the distributor by allowing it to sell access to our programs and channels on devices as part of their service and by not allowing access to channels to nonsubscribers; and get paid by the distributor for creating this opportunity. And all 3 were accomplished in this deal, which Comcast and we view as important to us and to our customers.
This deal highlighted the value of our television businesses, including our Kids portfolio. And as I mentioned earlier, the Disney Channel has had great success and tremendous ratings growth, driven by the compelling characters and strong storytelling that define the brand and connect with kids, tweens, as well as their families. In an incredibly competitive environment, Disney Channel now has the 5 top series for kids 2 to 11, led by Jesse and Good Luck Charlie. It's been the #1 channel among tweens, 9 to 14, for 21 months in a row, and the top channel for kids 6 to 11 for 9 straight months as well. 
Disney XD launched in 2008, and it just returned its most-watched quarter ever with its ratings increasing 11% over the last year. We see Disney XD, with its target audience of boys, as a great opportunity to leverage Marvel characters. And we believe the April 1 launch of the new Marvel Universe programming block would generate even stronger ratings and will become a powerful platform to support and grow the Marvel brand. Disney XD now has 23 existing channels and program blocks around the world and will add Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia.
Our newest kids brand, Disney Junior., also posted record ratings, with 24% increase year-over-year as preschool viewers tuned in to a programming block of original series like Jake and the Neverland Pirates and the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, which are now the top 2 cable programs among preschool boys. Given its growing popularity, we also believe Jake and the Neverland Pirates has significant franchise potential, joining our list of successful franchises including Phineas and Ferb. Since introducing the Disney, Jr. brand a year ago, we've successfully launched 28 standalone channels and branded programming blocks around the world, and we'll launch a 24-hour channel to 30 million U.S. homes next month.
To date, we've launched more than 100 kids channels around the world, including Disney Channel, Disney XD and Disney Junior, and our kids portfolio is a key component of our company's global growth strategy, especially in emerging markets. 
We're encouraged by the initial success of our newest Disney Channel in Russia launched just 5 weeks ago and the recent addition of Turkey. In the last 3 years, our reach across European, Middle Eastern and African markets has tripled to more than 100 million households. 
The combination of strong programming and far greater distribution has elevated the Disney Channel business to incredible importance and value for the company, helping to drive strong financial results and amazing brand-building momentum.
Some additional highlights from our Media Networks. ESPN's Monday Night Football was the most-watched series on cable for the sixth consecutive year. And although the football season is over, ESPN makes great use of those additional rights that it acquired in our recent NFL contract extension and runs NFL-related programming on a year-round basis. ESPN continues to lead on digital platforms and has been the #1 sports destination on mobile devices since 2007, while online at ESPN.com, it has captured more of fans' time than any other sport site for 16 consecutive months.
And at ABC, Revenge and Once Upon a Time, our 2 new fall dramas, continue to be hits for the network, and ratings increased for the second year in a row for our Wednesday night comedy block, led, of course, by the multi-award-winning Modern Family.  Several promising ABC shows premiere in the coming weeks, including Missing, Scandal and GCB, and tonight is the debut of the spellbinding new drama The River.
Earlier, I mentioned UTV, and last week marked a major step in our India expansion with our acquisition of a controlling interest in UTV, India's premier media and entertainment company. By combining our existing businesses in India with UTV, we'll be a leading film studio and TV programmer, with 9 separate channels, including Disney Channel, which is #1 with kids in the country.  The UTV acquisition will allow us to more effectively build, monetize and brand local and Disney franchises, and create content for the world's second-largest population. And one of the exciting opportunities for us in India is the absence of a strong family entertainment brand in that country, and our goal is to make Disney the #1 family entertainment brand in India, something we've accomplish over the years in so many markets around the world.
Turning to Parks and Resorts. I'm very pleased with recent attendance and pricing trends. Disneyland Resort has seen strong results lately due in part to the strategic investment we made at Disney's California Adventure. We've already opened some attractions as part of the expansion plan, but the largest and most exciting part of this expansion has yet to open, and that's Cars Land. This brand-new 12-acre land with 3 attractions set in Radiator Springs will open in June. 
Hong Kong Disneyland had a very good quarter as well, with its recently unveiled Toy Story Land, the first of 3 new themed areas to open as part of its expansion. 
Setting sail next month is the Disney Fantasy, the sister ship to the popular Disney Dream, expanding our fleet to 4 and allowing Disney Cruise Line to significantly increase the number of destinations around the world. And as I also mentioned earlier, we're really pleased that construction at Shanghai Disney Resort is well underway at the 963-acre site. And just looking at the model of this vast new resort has us all very excited about its prospects.
Turning to the Studio, our key upcoming titles are John Carter, an epic live-action adventure from Director Andrew Stanton of Pixar, Marvel's much anticipated The Avengers, which will be the first Marvel film marketed and distributed by Disney, Disney-Pixar's Brave, about a feisty heroine's adventure in the Scottish Highlands. And then later this year, we have Tim Burton's Frankenweenie and Disney Animation's Wreck-It Ralph. And those are both in fiscal 2013.  Also in 2013, our tentpole  releases are Oz, Iron Man 3, the Lone Ranger and Monsters University, the sequel to the very successful Monsters, Inc.
As an extension of our new Consumer Products business, Disney's baby initiative, we launched disneybaby.com last month, creating a new destination for parents to connect and share experiences with each other. I'm also proud to say that in December, we had record-breaking traffic across all Disney-branded online sites, and our popular mobile game Where's My Water? has now reached the top of the charts in 71 different countries, including currently in the U.S. and while Gardens of Time was named the most popular social game on Facebook.
In closing, we had a great start to the fiscal year, executing on our ongoing strategy, driving more and more value from our brands, Disney, Pixar, Marvel ESPN and ABC in the U.S. and around the globe. And we're confident that our commitment to creating and providing exceptional family entertainment on multiple platforms continues to position us to create long-term shareholder value.
And with that, I thank you, and turn the call over to Jay Rasulo."

Our fiscal 2012 is off to a great start, as evidenced by the strong financial results we delivered during the quarter. These results follow on the back of record revenue net income and earnings per share we de",1406,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal 2012 is off to a great start, as evidenced by the strong financial results we delivered during the quarter. These results follow on the back of record revenue net income and earnings per share we delivered in 2011. 
I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing the first quarter in more detail and then highlight some factors that may influence our upcoming performance.
Operating income from the quarter was up 11% on revenue growth of 1%. Excluding Studio, revenue would've been up more than 4%. I mention this because as you know, the Studio has pursued a strategy of reducing production output and focusing on improving returns on invested capital rather than growing revenue. Our Q1 results reflect this strategy. 
In the first quarter, Media Networks was once again the largest contributor to our performance, led by Cable Networks, where operating income growth was driven by ESPN and the worldwide Disney Channel. ESPN's growth was due to higher affiliate revenue related to both higher rates and lower revenue deferrals compared to the prior year. We deferred $76 million less in revenue during Q1, primarily as a result of our new affiliate agreement with Comcast. As a result of this agreement, ESPN will no longer defer Comcast affiliate revenue during the year. We expect ESPN will defer approximately $70 million less in revenue during the second quarter than in prior year. I remind you that the change in ESPN's revenue recognition related to Comcast has no impact on full year results.
ESPN's advertising revenue in Q1 was comparable to the prior year, but up 8% after adjusting for the timing of the Rose and Fiesta Bowls and the impact of the NBA lockout. 
If you recall, the Rose and Fiesta Bowls aired during our first quarter last year, but those games fell in our second quarter this year. Also due to the NBA lockout, ESPN aired 29 fewer NBA games during Q1 compared to last year. ESPN will air more NBA games during the second and third fiscal quarters compared to last year, so the full year total will not change.
So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales are pacing up single digits after adjusting for the benefit of the Rose and Fiesta Bowls. We are quite pleased with ESPN's current ad momentum, particularly given that ad revenue was up 23% during the second quarter last year after adjusting for the benefit of ESPN's first airing of the BCS.
Growth at the worldwide Disney Channel was due to increased advertising and affiliate revenue, partially offset by higher programming and production costs. We continued to enjoy strong advertising momentum at ABC Family during the quarter, with ad revenue up 10%. So far during the second quarter, ABC Family ad sales are pacing up double digits. 
At Broadcasting, operating income was lower in the quarter as a result of decreased political ad revenue at our owned TV stations, partially offset by lower programming and production costs. Marketing spending at the ABC Network was higher in the quarter, reflecting support for several new primetime shows launched in Q1, including Revenge and Once Upon a Time. Both of these ABC Studios-produced shows are off to great starts.
Ad revenue at the stations was down 20% in the quarter. Excluding political advertising and the Flint and Toledo stations, which were sold in Q3 last year, ad revenue was up 3%. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was comparable to the prior year. Quarter to date, scatter pricing at the ABC network is running mid-teen percentage points above upfront levels. Q2 TV station ad sales are pacing down single digits.
We are pleased with our strong -- continued strong results at Parks and Resorts. Revenue for the quarter was up 10% and operating income was up 18%. The growth in operating income was the result of higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic parks and higher passenger cruise days driven by the Disney Dream, partially offset by higher costs. Total segment margins were up 120 basis points in the first quarter versus last year's Q1. 
For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 3% and per capita spending was up 8% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending. Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6% while occupancy was flat. The increase in per room spending was driven by higher pricing and a reduction of promotional room nights.
So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up mid-single digits compared to prior-year levels, while book rates are also up mid-single digits. Our first quarter results and the trends we are seeing so far in the second quarter are further evidence that our strategy of returning pricing to more normal levels without sacrificing volume continues to pay off.
At our International Parks and Resorts, operating income at Hong Kong Disneyland was higher due to increased guest spending and higher attendance. Operating income at Disneyland Paris was lower due to higher cost and the absence of a real estate sales that took place in Q1 of last year. 
As I mentioned earlier, Studio Entertainment revenue decline compared to prior year. This decline was primarily due to the release of fewer Disney-produced titles compared to last year and higher worldwide box office performances of Tangled and Tron in Q1 last year compared to the Muppets this year. However, Studio operating income was higher in the quarter due to lower marketing, distribution and production costs associated with the release of these films.
At Consumer Products, operating income for the quarter was comparable to prior year. Merchandise, licensing earned revenue was in line with prior year as higher sales of Cars merchandise was largely offset by lower sales of Toy Story merchandise. 
At the Interactive Media segment, operating losses increased from the prior year due to the lower performance of our console game business, but partially offset by higher operating income from social games.  The decline in console games was due to fewer titles being released this quarter compared to last year, as well as lower performance of Disney Universe in Q1 compared to the very successful Epic Mickey last year. Higher operating income at social games was due to lower impact of purchase accounting for Playdom, as well as improved game performance driven by higher revenue from Gardens of Time.
Now let me turn to the second quarter. We'll continue to invest in successful initiatives that strengthen and extend our brands. In 2011, ABC Family's ratings grew for the eighth consecutive year, and ABC Family ranked as a top cable network for the third consecutive year in total viewers in adults 18 to 49.  During Q2, ABC Family will air approximately 20 additional hours of original programming, which will further strengthen its lineup of shows and extend ABC Family's popularity with millennial viewers. These additional hours of programming will result in approximately $35 billion of incremental programming and marketing expense in the quarter. 
As Bob mentioned, we continue to expand the geographic footprint and reach of the Disney brand. In March, we will launch a new broadcast satellite channel in Japan targeting women and families. We expect to invest $35 million behind this initiative during the remainder of the fiscal year with approximately half of that falling in Q2. 
At Parks and Resorts, we will launch the Disney Fantasy at the end of the second quarter, whereas the Disney Dream launched in late January last year. As a result, we expect to incur preopening expenses in the second quarter related to the launch of the Fantasy, but the ship will not generate meaningful revenue until Q3.
While all of these investments will drive incremental expenses during the second quarter, we're confident in our ability to generate attractive returns on these investments.
We continue to repurchase our stock -- continued to repurchase our stock during the first quarter by buying back 23.3 million shares for about $800 million, which is consistent with the pace during the first quarter last year. Fiscal year to date, we have repurchased 33 million shares for $1.2 billion. 
We feel great about the start of the fiscal year and look forward to continuing to execute on our strategic and financial objectives, and delivering strong performance for our shareholders during the rest of fiscal 2012.
With that, we turn the call over to Lowell for questions"

Yes, we still believe that the new initiative revenues will largely be offset by cost, new costs in -- for the entire fiscal year.

In terms of Cruise, Alexia, it was not a really significant difference in the number. It's about $7 million or $8 million difference from what we recognized last year. But understanding that the timing of the launch of the Fantasy is later than the timing of the launch of the Dream, there would be more costs in Q2.

I'm assuming either they themselves haven't had it or they haven't had it from their customers. And so ESPN has remained basically on a highly distributed tier, not just with Comcast, but across the industry. Now there's so much that's been said about cord cutting and cord slicing and a la carte packages. I think it's just important to emphasize a couple of points about that again. 
First, I'll start with ESPN. I think they've now gotten to a point because of their popularity and the quality of what they offer, they almost transcend sports. They offer news, stories that are of interest nationally and locally, they program 6,400 hours of live and original programming a year, 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. Their ratings double the combination of all the RSNs in markets as a -- for instance. And I just think, generally speaking, not only are they popular, but they've gotten into that virtual must-have category. Now we don't take that for granted. But because of their position and because of not just their popularity, but almost the value that they now supply both to the distributor and to the customer, we don't really see either a la carte offerings or cord splicing -- or slicing I guess, I should say, as a trend. The only thing I want to say about a la carte and I'll say it -- I've said it a few times, is that I think people want variety, and they're getting it today, and they're also getting substantially increased quality. I've said this before, but for $60, which is the average cost of the expanded basic service, consumers get about 100 channels of programming. Those channels, ours and others, have put billions of dollars into programming over the years, so that the product is a lot better. And if suddenly, they were able to buy these channels on an a la carte basis, we know what would happen. First of all, there would be channels that are of interest to a lot of different entities, in some cases, niche channels, that would simply go away. And I don't think that would necessarily be good. Secondly, the channels that were left would see decreased distribution, decreased ratings, decreased advertising revenue, and that will put a lot of pressure on the rates that they charge. So the rates would go up. The result would be that consumers would be spending more per channel, and it's quite possible that the $60 100-channel package would quickly become a $60 50-channel package. And I don't think that's necessarily good. So I think that's one of the reasons why we're not seeing some great interest in cord cutting because I think, generally, consumers are happy with the quality and the variety that they're getting, and the price-to-value relationship is generally good."

As to -- I think what was hidden or maybe not in your question about how we're looking at Redbox and a lot of these services, we are in discussions to go to the 28-day window to not make -- to not sell directly our physical goods to these entities unless they adhere to a 28-day window. Obviously, because of the first-sale doctrine, they would have an ability to buy those goods from normal retailers. But rather than us being part of that sale and in protection of the sell-through window, we feel that, that would be a wise thing for us to do. I'm not, obviously, as you anticipated, Jessica, going to comment about the Univision article that came out yesterday. 
I've said before that ABC has a platform that we continue to invest in from a content perspective. And ABC News is a very important part of that platform.

And most of what we're opening are family suites, where we've seen a real demand in the marketplace. We actually converted some of our space that's on our other hotels to family suites. And we will be opening different parts of this hotel over the next year, year and a half, most of which will be in the family suite category. And to put that in perspective, I don't have the pricing in front of me directly, but my recollection is that we're selling family suites for somewhere in the neighborhood of $200 to $225 a night. These have been very, very popular in the marketplace, and we thought we wanted to expand. Obviously, a family suite is designed to accommodate an entire family. And for that price, we think that this is -- it's right to call this a value room or a value accommodation. 
We've seen a fair amount of demand in this space over the last 5 or so years, actually probably longer. As we've said before, if you look at our profile, particularly in Florida, we have many more value-priced keys or rooms and suites available today. About 40% of our total fit into that category as of the first quarter that we just announced. 
Obviously, when we open this new resort, which is very, very large, that number's going to grow somewhat. I think it reflects what's going on in the marketplace in some respects, but it also reflects the popularity of our product and the fact that we're now making it more accessible to more people because of the affordability factor. And for people to be able to come and stay in a room like the ones that we're building for that price is a pretty good deal. Do you want to answer the second?"

So you're absolutely right in stating that we have been through the market multiple times in the past year. I want to add, because I'm very proud of it and proud of our team, but for what we borrowed, in both the amounts and our rating, we really, almost always in the past year, saw historically low coupon rates on that debt. And whereas a couple have been better since then, I think we've timed our steps into the debt marketplace very carefully and put a lot of time into picking what we think would be low entry points, and we've been very successful in doing that. In doing so, we've obviously increased our debt because of the availability of money at these great rates. But I think that one of the reasons why we kind of punched beyond our weight in the debt market is because we have been so strategic and so public and so consistent in wanting to keep the A rating as -- on our balance sheet and go to the market with that consistent message. We have no intention at the current time to change that. There is some -- we can continue to leverage up somewhat and stay below that sort of 2.0 gross debt ratio that will keep us at that A, and we won't push ourselves beyond that. I think there's a little more capacity when we see opportunities to step out. Again, we've got a couple of maturities that we'd like to fill in. And when the see the opportunity to step in at great rates, I think you'll see us doing that. Of course, as time passes, will have some maturities that will refill. But don't expect us to back the truck up to the point where we have to give up that great balance sheet and great Standard & Poor's rating that has, I think, served us incredibly well over the past decade, including when liquidity dried up for most companies in 2008."

We know from research that the Disney Channel is now the strongest brand driver of the Disney brand in most countries in the world. And as such, we try to get that channel in front of more and more people, which explains why we did the Russian free-to-air joint venture, why we moved from premium to free-to-air and a much broader distribution in Spain and France last year, why we've launched in Turkey. 
This is a great entry point for people into the Disney franchise. The Disney Channel is a franchise builder. It's a Disney brand builder. And so the combination of both, its financial contribution to the company and strategic leverage that we draft off of in everything that we do around the world makes those investments really payback multifold."

There was no connection between the announcement that was made yesterday and the decision by the Studio, which was made by the Studio, to go to the 28-day window. The reason they hadn't gone to that window before is the Studio felt that it was not seeing any affect from these dollar rentals on their sell-through business. And it was their feeling that if they went to that model, it really wasn't -- there would be nothing to be gained from it. In fact they thought they actually might lose some. They have taken a hard look at the business overall. I'd say that the industry has continued to suffer on the sell-through side. And the sale of goods digitally or the rental side have not made up for enough of that falloff that's across the industry. And so they've decided to take a step in the direction of further protecting the initial window and the sell-through window. 
The whole issue of authentication is somewhat different or separate from the discussion on windowing, although I understand why you would connect the 2. What authentication is about is we see it as really 2 things. One, it's recognizing the value of the multichannel distribution business model and working to protect it, but also working to enhance it by recognizing the value and the excitement of new technology platforms. And so what this does is it gives people, who have subscribed to those services, the ability to watch these channels and watch these programs in a much more mobile, much more flexible ways than all the other devices. 
It also does create a window that advantages the subscriber and on, at least, the rental side, disadvantages the nonsubscriber. The nonsubscriber would still be able to buy some of these programs on a sell-through basis digitally, virtually right after they air, but would not be able to gain access to them on a rental or a VOD model, unless they're subscribers of the service. And that's obviously designed to protect, again, the business model, while at the same time recognizing the importance of and the potential and the excitement around new technology-driven platforms."

191564,145646223,216978,"Walt Disney Co., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2012",2012-02-07,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thank you, Lowell. Good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results were driven by strong performances from many of our businesses, particularly, Cable Networks and Parks and Resorts. And EPS of $0.80 for the first quarter was up 18% from last year.  O",1579,"Thank you, Lowell. Good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results were driven by strong performances from many of our businesses, particularly, Cable Networks and Parks and Resorts. And EPS of $0.80 for the first quarter was up 18% from last year.  Our results reflect the benefits of our ongoing strategy to invest in and leverage our core brands, Disney, Pixar, Marvel, ESPN and ABC, underscoring our consistent focus on creating high-quality entertainment experiences through the use of innovative technology across our businesses and around the globe.
Since our last earnings report, a lot has transpired. We launched an over-the-air Disney Channel in Russia; we successfully acquired control of UTV, a leading movie and television company in India; we made a lot of progress in the design and early construction of Shanghai Disneyland; our fourth cruise ship, the Disney Fantasy, completed sea trials in the North Atlantic; 2 of the films we distributed were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture; the Disney Channel has the top 5 shows for kids; and we announced the landmark agreement with Comcast for the distribution of all of our program channels.
I'd like to start by explaining why the Comcast agreement will be significant. As you all know, we own and program some of the best and most watched and most valuable channels in the business, all branded Disney, ABC or ESPN. These channels have delivered great value to us, to consumers and to distributors, and over the years, we've successfully invested more capital to enhance their value. And this new deal not only provides for distribution into the next decade, but the rates that we will be paid reflect the increased value we're now providing. 
The multichannel business model is extremely important to us and to others in the business. And as new choices to distribute and consume content proliferate, we thought it was vital for us to accomplish 3 things: allow more consumers access to our programs and channels on new devices, including mobile, desktop and laptop; protect and enhance the value of the multichannel subscription to the distributor by allowing it to sell access to our programs and channels on devices as part of their service and by not allowing access to channels to nonsubscribers; and get paid by the distributor for creating this opportunity. And all 3 were accomplished in this deal, which Comcast and we view as important to us and to our customers.
This deal highlighted the value of our television businesses, including our Kids portfolio. And as I mentioned earlier, the Disney Channel has had great success and tremendous ratings growth, driven by the compelling characters and strong storytelling that define the brand and connect with kids, tweens, as well as their families. In an incredibly competitive environment, Disney Channel now has the 5 top series for kids 2 to 11, led by Jesse and Good Luck Charlie. It's been the #1 channel among tweens, 9 to 14, for 21 months in a row, and the top channel for kids 6 to 11 for 9 straight months as well. 
Disney XD launched in 2008, and it just returned its most-watched quarter ever with its ratings increasing 11% over the last year. We see Disney XD, with its target audience of boys, as a great opportunity to leverage Marvel characters. And we believe the April 1 launch of the new Marvel Universe programming block will generate even stronger ratings and will become a powerful platform to support and grow the Marvel brand. Disney XD now has 23 existing channels and program blocks around the world and will add Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia.
Our newest kids brand, Disney Junior., also posted record ratings, with 24% increase year-over-year as preschool viewers tuned in to a programming block of original series like Jake and the Neverland Pirates and the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, which are now the top 2 cable programs among preschool boys. Given its growing popularity, we also believe Jake and the Neverland Pirates has significant franchise potential, joining our list of successful franchises including Phineas and Ferb. Since introducing the Disney, Jr. brand a year ago, we've successfully launched 28 standalone channels and branded programming blocks around the world, and we'll launch a 24-hour channel to 30 million U.S. homes next month.
To date, we've launched more than 100 kids channels around the world, including Disney Channel, Disney XD and Disney Junior, and our kids portfolio is a key component of our company's global growth strategy, especially in emerging markets. 
We're encouraged by the initial success of our newest Disney Channel in Russia launched just 5 weeks ago and the recent addition of Turkey. In the last 3 years, our reach across European, Middle Eastern and African markets has tripled to more than 100 million households. 
The combination of strong programming and far greater distribution has elevated the Disney Channel business to incredible importance and value for the company, helping to drive strong financial results and amazing brand-building momentum.
Some additional highlights from our Media Networks. ESPN's Monday Night Football was the most-watched series on cable for the sixth consecutive year. And although the football season is over, ESPN makes great use of those additional rights that it acquired in our recent NFL contract extension and runs NFL-related programming on a year-round basis. ESPN continues to lead on digital platforms and has been the #1 sports destination on mobile devices since 2007, while online at ESPN.com, it has captured more of fans' time than any other sport site for 16 consecutive months.
And at ABC, Revenge and Once Upon a Time, our 2 new fall dramas, continue to be hits for the network, and ratings increased for the second year in a row for our Wednesday night comedy block, led, of course, by the multi-award-winning Modern Family.  Several promising ABC shows premiere in the coming weeks, including Missing, Scandal and GCB, and tonight is the debut of the spellbinding new drama The River.
Earlier, I mentioned UTV, and last week marked a major step in our India expansion with our acquisition of a controlling interest in UTV, India's premier media and entertainment company. By combining our existing businesses in India with UTV, we'll be a leading film studio and TV programmer, with 9 separate channels, including Disney Channel, which is #1 with kids in the country.  The UTV acquisition will allow us to more effectively build, monetize and brand local and Disney franchises, and create content for the world's second-largest population. And one of the exciting opportunities for us in India is the absence of a strong family entertainment brand in that country, and our goal is to make Disney the #1 family entertainment brand in India, something we've accomplish over the years in so many markets around the world.
Turning to Parks and Resorts. I'm very pleased with recent attendance and pricing trends. Disneyland Resort has seen strong results lately due in part to the strategic investment we made at Disney's California Adventure. We've already opened some attractions as part of the expansion plan, but the largest and most exciting part of this expansion has yet to open, and that's Cars Land. This brand-new 12-acre land with 3 attractions set in Radiator Springs will open in June. 
Hong Kong Disneyland had a very good quarter as well, with its recently unveiled Toy Story Land, the first of 3 new themed areas to open as part of its expansion. 
Setting sail next month is the Disney Fantasy, the sister ship to the popular Disney Dream, expanding our fleet to 4 and allowing Disney Cruise Line to significantly increase the number of destinations around the world. And as I also mentioned earlier, we're really pleased that construction at Shanghai Disney Resort is well underway at the 963-acre site. And just looking at the model of this vast new resort has us all very excited about its prospects.
Turning to the Studio, our key upcoming titles are John Carter, an epic live-action adventure from Director Andrew Stanton of Pixar, Marvel's much anticipated The Avengers, which will be the first Marvel film marketed and distributed by Disney, Disney-Pixar's Brave, about a feisty heroine's adventure in the Scottish Highlands. And then later this year, we have Tim Burton's Frankenweenie and Disney Animation's Wreck-It Ralph. And those are both in fiscal 2013.  Also in 2013, our tentpole  releases are Oz, Iron Man 3, the Lone Ranger and Monsters University, the sequel to the very successful Monsters, Inc.
As an extension of our new Consumer Products business, Disney's baby initiative, we launched disneybaby.com last month, creating a new destination for parents to connect and share experiences with each other. I'm also proud to say that in December, we had record-breaking traffic across all Disney-branded online sites, and our popular mobile game Where's My Water? has now reached the top of the charts in 71 different countries, including currently in the U.S. and while Gardens of Time was named the most popular social game on Facebook.
In closing, we had a great start to the fiscal year, executing on our ongoing strategy, driving more and more value from our brands, Disney, Pixar, Marvel ESPN and ABC in the U.S. and around the globe. And we're confident that our commitment to creating and providing exceptional family entertainment on multiple platforms continues to position us to create long-term shareholder value.
And with that, I thank you, and turn the call over to Jay Rasulo."
191564,145646223,216978,"Walt Disney Co., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2012",2012-02-07,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal 2012 is off to a great start, as evidenced by the strong financial results we delivered during the quarter. These results follow on the back of record revenue net income and earnings per share we de",1406,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal 2012 is off to a great start, as evidenced by the strong financial results we delivered during the quarter. These results follow on the back of record revenue net income and earnings per share we delivered in 2011. 
I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing the first quarter in more detail and then highlight some factors that may influence our upcoming performance.
Operating income for the quarter was up 11% on revenue growth of 1%. Excluding Studio, revenue would've been up more than 4%. I mention this because as you know, the Studio has pursued a strategy of reducing production output and focusing on improving returns on invested capital rather than growing revenue. Our Q1 results reflect this strategy. 
In the first quarter, Media Networks was once again the largest contributor to our performance, led by Cable Networks, where operating income growth was driven by ESPN and the worldwide Disney Channel. ESPN's growth was due to higher affiliate revenue related to both higher rates and lower revenue deferrals compared to the prior year. We deferred $76 million less in revenue during Q1, primarily as a result of our new affiliate agreement with Comcast. As a result of this agreement, ESPN will no longer defer Comcast affiliate revenue during the year. We expect ESPN will defer approximately $70 million less in revenue during the second quarter than in prior year. I remind you that the change in ESPN's revenue recognition related to Comcast has no impact on full year results.
ESPN's advertising revenue in Q1 was comparable to the prior year, but up 8% after adjusting for the timing of the Rose and Fiesta Bowls and the impact of the NBA lockout. 
If you recall, the Rose and Fiesta Bowls aired during our first quarter last year, but those games fell in our second quarter this year. Also due to the NBA lockout, ESPN aired 29 fewer NBA games during Q1 compared to last year. ESPN will air more NBA games during the second and third fiscal quarters compared to last year, so the full year total will not change.
So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales are pacing up single digits after adjusting for the benefit of the Rose and Fiesta Bowls. We are quite pleased with ESPN's current ad momentum, particularly given that ad revenue was up 23% during the second quarter last year after adjusting for the benefit of ESPN's first airing of the BCS.
Growth at the worldwide Disney Channel was due to increased advertising and affiliate revenue, partially offset by higher programming and production costs. We continued to enjoy strong advertising momentum at ABC Family during the quarter, with ad revenue up 10%. So far during the second quarter, ABC Family ad sales are pacing up double digits. 
At Broadcasting, operating income was lower in the quarter as a result of decreased political ad revenue at our owned TV stations, partially offset by lower programming and production costs. Marketing spending at the ABC Network was higher in the quarter, reflecting support for several new primetime shows launched in Q1, including Revenge and Once Upon a Time. Both of these ABC Studios-produced shows are off to great starts.
Ad revenue at the stations was down 20% in the quarter. Excluding political advertising and the Flint and Toledo stations, which were sold in Q3 last year, ad revenue was up 3%. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was comparable to the prior year. Quarter to date, scatter pricing at the ABC network is running mid-teen percentage points above upfront levels. Q2 TV station ad sales are pacing down single digits.
We are pleased with our strong -- continued strong results at Parks and Resorts. Revenue for the quarter was up 10% and operating income was up 18%. The growth in operating income was the result of higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic parks and higher passenger cruise days driven by the Disney Dream, partially offset by higher costs. Total segment margins were up 120 basis points in the first quarter versus last year's Q1. 
For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 3% and per capita spending was up 8% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending. Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6% while occupancy was flat. The increase in per room spending was driven by higher pricing and a reduction of promotional room nights.
So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up mid-single digits compared to prior-year levels, while book rates are also up mid-single digits. Our first quarter results and the trends we are seeing so far in the second quarter are further evidence that our strategy of returning pricing to more normal levels without sacrificing volume continues to pay off.
At our International Parks and Resorts, operating income at Hong Kong Disneyland was higher due to increased guest spending and higher attendance. Operating income at Disneyland Paris was lower due to higher costs and the absence of a real estate sales that took place in Q1 of last year. 
As I mentioned earlier, Studio Entertainment revenue decline compared to prior year. This decline was primarily due to the release of fewer Disney-produced titles compared to last year and higher worldwide box office performances of Tangled and Tron in Q1 last year compared to the Muppets this year. However, Studio operating income was higher in the quarter due to lower marketing, distribution and production costs associated with the release of these films.
At Consumer Products, operating income for the quarter was comparable to prior year. Merchandise, licensing earned revenue was in line with prior year as higher sales of Cars merchandise was largely offset by lower sales of Toy Story merchandise. 
At the Interactive Media segment, operating losses increased from the prior year due to the lower performance of our console game business, but partially offset by higher operating income from social games.  The decline in console games was due to fewer titles being released this quarter compared to last year, as well as lower performance of Disney Universe in Q1 compared to the very successful Epic Mickey last year. Higher operating income at social games was due to lower impact of purchase accounting for Playdom, as well as improved game performance driven by higher revenue from Gardens of Time.
Now let me turn to the second quarter. We'll continue to invest in successful initiatives that strengthen and extend our brands. In 2011, ABC Family's ratings grew for the eighth consecutive year, and ABC Family ranked as a top cable network for the third consecutive year in total viewers in adults 18 to 49.  During Q2, ABC Family will air approximately 20 additional hours of original programming, which will further strengthen its lineup of shows and extend ABC Family's popularity with millennial viewers. These additional hours of programming will result in approximately $35 billion of incremental programming and marketing expense in the quarter. 
As Bob mentioned, we continue to expand the geographic footprint and reach of the Disney brand. In March, we will launch a new broadcast satellite channel in Japan targeting women and families. We expect to invest $35 million behind this initiative during the remainder of the fiscal year with approximately half of that falling in Q2. 
At Parks and Resorts, we will launch the Disney Fantasy at the end of the second quarter, whereas the Disney Dream launched in late January last year. As a result, we expect to incur preopening expenses in the second quarter related to the launch of the Fantasy, but the ship will not generate meaningful revenue until Q3.
While all of these investments will drive incremental expenses during the second quarter, we're confident in our ability to generate attractive returns on these investments.
We continue to repurchase our stock -- continued to repurchase our stock during the first quarter by buying back 23.3 million shares for about $800 million, which is consistent with the pace during the first quarter last year. Fiscal year to date, we have repurchased 33 million shares for $1.2 billion. 
We feel great about the start of the fiscal year and look forward to continuing to execute on our strategic and financial objectives, and delivering strong performance for our shareholders during the rest of fiscal 2012.
With that, we turn the call over to Lowell for questions"

In terms of Cruise, Alexia, it was not a really significant difference in the number. It's about $7 million or $8 million difference from what we recognized last year. But understanding that the timing of the launch of the Fantasy is later than the timing of the launch of the Dream, there would be more costs in Q2. Sort of in total, they're about the same, but it's more switched into Q2 than Q1 versus those costs for the Dream. And as I mentioned on a few calls ago, we're talking in the tens of millions for the launch costs associated here and nowhere near triple digits on the lower end of the tens of millions."

One of the things that is of interest to us is the fact that by offering Comcast and its subscribers authentication or the ability to watch all of these services, every one of the services on mobile devices and computers is clearly something that other distributors would like to be able to offer their consumers. And other than the deal that we did with Time Warner for ESPN, and the deal that we did with Verizon and a few other smaller distributors, we haven't done deals that allow that. So DIRECTV, Cablevision and others are -- and Time Warner because all they got was the rights to do that for ESPN. Those will all start kicking in, we anticipate, relatively soon."

I'm assuming either they themselves haven't had it or they haven't had it from their customers. And so ESPN has remained basically on a highly distributed tier, not just with Comcast, but across the industry. Now there's so much that's been said about cord cutting and cord slicing and a la carte packages. I think it's just important to emphasize a couple of points about that again. 
First, I'll start with ESPN. I think they've now gotten to a point because of their popularity and the quality of what they offer, they almost transcend sports. They offer news, stories that are of interest nationally and locally, they program 6,400 hours of live and original programming a year, 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. Their ratings double the combination of all the RSNs in markets as a -- for instance. And I just think, generally speaking, not only are they popular, but they've gotten into that virtual must-have category. Now we don't take that for granted. But because of their position and because of not just their popularity, but almost the value that they now supply both to the distributor and to the customer, we don't really see either a la carte offerings or cord splicing -- or slicing I guess, I should say, as a trend. The only thing I want to say about a la carte and I'll say it -- I've said it a few times, is that I think people want variety, and they're getting it today, and they're also getting substantially increased quality. I've said this before, but for $60, which is the average cost of the expanded basic service, consumers get about 100 channels of programming. Those channels, ours and others, have put billions of dollars into programming over the years, so that the product is a lot better. And if suddenly, they were able to buy these channels on an a la carte basis, we know what would happen. First of all, there would be channels that are of interest to a lot of different entities, in some cases, niche channels, that would simply go away. And I don't think that would necessarily be good. Secondly, the channels that were left would see decreased distribution, decreased ratings, decreased advertising revenue, and that will put a lot of pressure on the rates that they charge. So the rates would go up. The result would be that consumers would be spending more per channel, and it's quite possible that the $60 100-channel package would quickly become a $60 50-channel package. And I don't think that's necessarily good. So I think that's one of the reasons why we're not seeing some great interest in cord cutting because I think, generally, consumers are happy with the quality and the variety that they're getting, and the price-to-value relationship is generally good."

And most of what we're opening are family suites, where we've seen a real demand in the marketplace. We actually converted some of our space in some of our other hotels to family suites. And we will be opening different parts of this hotel over the next year, year and a half, most of which will be in the family suite category. And to put that in perspective, I don't have the pricing in front of me directly, but my recollection is that we're selling family suites for somewhere in the neighborhood of $200 to $225 a night. These have been very, very popular in the marketplace, and we thought we wanted to expand. Obviously, a family suite is designed to accommodate an entire family. And for that price, we think that this is -- it's right to call this a value room or a value accommodation. 
We've seen a fair amount of demand in this space over the last 5 or so years, actually probably longer. As we've said before, if you look at our profile, particularly in Florida, we have many more value-priced keys, rooms and suites available today. About 40% of our total fit into that category as of the first quarter that we just announced. 
Obviously, when we open this new resort, which is very, very large, that number's going to grow somewhat. I think it reflects what's going on in the marketplace in some respects, but it also reflects the popularity of our product and the fact that we're now making it more accessible to more people because of the affordability factor. And for people to be able to come and stay in a room like the ones that we're building for that price is a pretty good deal. Do you want to answer the second?"

So you're absolutely right in stating that we have been through the market multiple times in the past year. I want to add, because I'm very proud of it and proud of our team, but for what we borrowed, in both the amounts and our rating, we really, almost always in the past year, saw historically low coupon rates on that debt. And whereas a couple have been better since then, I think we've timed our steps into the debt marketplace very carefully and put a lot of time into picking what we think would be low entry points, and we've been very successful in doing that. In doing so, we've obviously increased our debt because of the availability of money at these great rates. But I think that one of the reasons why we kind of punched beyond our weight in the debt market is because we have been so strategic and so public and so consistent in wanting to keep a A rating as -- on our balance sheet and go to the market with that consistent message. We have no intention at the current time to change that. There is some -- we can continue to leverage up somewhat and stay below that sort of 2.0 gross debt ratio that will keep us at that A, and we won't push ourselves beyond that. I think there's a little more capacity when we see opportunities to step out. Again, we've got a couple of maturities that we'd like to fill in. And when the see the opportunity to step in at great rates, I think you'll see us doing that. Of course, as time passes, will have some maturities that will refill. But don't expect us to back the truck up to the point where we have to give up that great balance sheet and great Standard & Poor's rating that has, I think, served us incredibly well over the past decade, including when liquidity dried up for most companies in 2008."

With regard to your earlier comment that protecting the Pay TV subs was -- is a paramount consideration, and you said also in response to a Verizon Redbox question that you are, it seems, revisiting your day-and-date strategy, is what I got out of it, given the current situation. It wasn't clear to me if that was a result of the Verizon Redbox announcement or why it took you so long to revisit this. I think it's been almost 3 years when a lot of the other studios have been imposing this window. So I wanted to get your sense of how this perhaps might also affect your view of the whole authentication philosophy, which Verizon itself is also a stakeholder. And now they're, kind of, in the streaming side, as well. So how do you balance all of these interests?"

There was no connection between the announcement that was made yesterday and the decision by the Studio, which was made by the Studio, to go to the 28-day window. The reason they hadn't gone to that window before is the Studio felt that it was not seeing any affect from these dollar rentals on their sell-through business. And it was their feeling that if they went to that model, it really wasn't -- there would be nothing to be gained from it. In fact they thought they actually might lose some. They have taken a hard look at the business overall. I'd say that the industry has continued to suffer on the sell-through side. And the sale of goods digitally or the rental side have not made up for enough of that falloff that's across the industry. And so they've decided to take a step in the direction of further protecting the initial window and the sell-through window. 
The whole issue of authentication is somewhat different or separate from the discussion on windowing, although I understand why you would connect the 2. What authentication is about is we see it as really 2 things. One, it's recognizing the value of the multichannel distribution business model and working to protect it, but also working to enhance it by recognizing the value and the excitement of new technology platforms. And so what this does is it gives people, who have subscribed to those services, the ability to watch these channels and watch these programs in a much more mobile, much more flexible ways on all the new devices. 
It also does create a window that advantages the subscriber and on, at least, the rental side, disadvantages the nonsubscriber. The nonsubscriber would still be able to buy some of these programs on a sell-through basis digitally, virtually right after they air, but would not be able to gain access to them on a rental or a video D model, unless they're subscribers of the service. And that's obviously designed to protect, again, the business model, while at the same time recognizing the importance of and the potential and the excitement around new technology-driven platforms."

Our first quarter results were driven by strong performances from many of our businesses, particularly, Cable Networks and Parks and Resorts. And EPS of $0.80 for the first quarter was up 18% from last year. Ou",1579,"Thank you, Lowell. Good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results were driven by strong performances from many of our businesses, particularly, Cable Networks and Parks and Resorts. And EPS of $0.80 for the first quarter was up 18% from last year. Our results reflect the benefits of our ongoing strategy to invest in and leverage our core brands, Disney, Pixar, Marvel, ESPN and ABC, underscoring our consistent focus on creating high-quality entertainment experiences through the use of innovative technology across our businesses and around the globe.
Since our last earnings report, a lot has transpired. We launched an over-the-air Disney Channel in Russia; we successfully acquired control of UTV, a leading movie and television company in India; we made a lot of progress in the design and early construction of Shanghai Disneyland; our fourth cruise ship, the Disney Fantasy, completed sea trials in the North Atlantic; 2 of the films we distributed were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture; the Disney Channel has the top 5 shows for kids; and we announced the landmark agreement with Comcast for the distribution of all of our program channels.
I'd like to start by explaining why the Comcast agreement will be significant. As you all know, we own and program some of the best and most watched and most valuable channels in the business, all branded Disney, ABC or ESPN. These channels have delivered great value to us, to consumers and to distributors, and over the years, we've successfully invested more capital to enhance their value. And this new deal not only provides for distribution into the next decade, but the rates that we will be paid reflect the increased value we're now providing. 
The multichannel business model is extremely important to us and to others in the business. And as new choices to distribute and consume content proliferate, we thought it was vital for us to accomplish 3 things: allow more consumers access to our programs and channels on new devices, including mobile, desktop and laptop; protect and enhance the value of the multichannel subscription to the distributor by allowing it to sell access to our programs and channels on devices as part of their service and by not allowing access to channels to nonsubscribers; and get paid by the distributor for creating this opportunity. And all 3 were accomplished in this deal, which Comcast and we view as important to us and to our customers.
This deal highlighted the value of our television businesses, including our Kids portfolio. And as I mentioned earlier, the Disney Channel has had great success and tremendous ratings growth, driven by the compelling characters and strong storytelling that define the brand and connect with kids, tweens, as well as their families. In an incredibly competitive environment, Disney Channel now has the 5 top series for kids 2 to 11, led by Jesse and Good Luck Charlie. It's been the #1 channel among tweens, 9 to 14, for 21 months in a row, and the top channel for kids 6 to 11 for 9 straight months as well. 
Disney XD launched in 2008, and it just returned its most-watched quarter ever with its ratings increasing 11% over the last year. We see Disney XD, with its target audience of boys, as a great opportunity to leverage Marvel characters. And we believe the April 1 launch of the new Marvel Universe programming block will generate even stronger ratings and will become a powerful platform to support and grow the Marvel brand. Disney XD now has 23 existing channels and program blocks around the world and will add Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia.
Our newest kids brand, Disney Junior., also posted record ratings, with 24% increase year-over-year as preschool viewers tuned in to a programming block of original series like Jake and the Neverland Pirates and the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, which are now the top 2 cable programs among preschool boys. Given its growing popularity, we also believe Jake and the Neverland Pirates has significant franchise potential, joining our list of successful franchises including Phineas and Ferb. Since introducing the Disney, Jr. brand a year ago, we've successfully launched 28 standalone channels and branded programming blocks around the world, and we'll launch a 24-hour channel to 30 million U.S. homes next month.
To date, we've launched more than 100 kids channels around the world, including Disney Channel, Disney XD and Disney Junior, and our kids portfolio is a key component of our company's global growth strategy, especially in emerging markets. 
We're encouraged by the initial success of our newest Disney Channel in Russia launched just 5 weeks ago and the recent addition of Turkey. In the last 3 years, our reach across European, Middle Eastern and African markets has tripled to more than 100 million households. 
The combination of strong programming and far greater distribution has elevated the Disney Channel business to incredible importance and value for the company, helping to drive strong financial results and amazing brand-building momentum.
Some additional highlights from our Media Networks. ESPN's Monday Night Football was the most-watched series on cable for the sixth consecutive year. And although the football season is over, ESPN makes great use of those additional rights that it acquired in our recent NFL contract extension and runs NFL-related programming on a year-round basis. ESPN continues to lead on digital platforms and has been the #1 sports destination on mobile devices since 2007, while online at ESPN.com, it has captured more of fans' time than any other sport site for 16 consecutive months.
And at ABC, Revenge and Once Upon a Time, our 2 new fall dramas, continue to be hits for the network, and ratings increased for the second year in a row for our Wednesday night comedy block, led, of course, by the multi-award-winning Modern Family. Several promising ABC shows premiere in the coming weeks, including Missing, Scandal and GCB, and tonight is the debut of the spellbinding new drama The River.
Earlier, I mentioned UTV, and last week marked a major step in our India expansion with our acquisition of a controlling interest in UTV, India's premier media and entertainment company. By combining our existing businesses in India with UTV, we'll be a leading film studio and TV programmer, with 9 separate channels, including Disney Channel, which is #1 with kids in the country. The UTV acquisition will allow us to more effectively build, monetize and brand local and Disney franchises, and create content for the world's second-largest population. And one of the exciting opportunities for us in India is the absence of a strong family entertainment brand in that country, and our goal is to make Disney the #1 family entertainment brand in India, something we've accomplish over the years in so many markets around the world.
Turning to Parks and Resorts. I'm very pleased with recent attendance and pricing trends. Disneyland Resort has seen strong results lately due in part to the strategic investment we made at Disney's California Adventure. We've already opened some attractions as part of the expansion plan, but the largest and most exciting part of this expansion has yet to open, and that's Cars Land. This brand-new 12-acre land with 3 attractions set in Radiator Springs will open in June. 
Hong Kong Disneyland had a very good quarter as well, with its recently unveiled Toy Story Land, the first of 3 new themed areas to open as part of its expansion. 
Setting sail next month is the Disney Fantasy, the sister ship to the popular Disney Dream, expanding our fleet to 4 and allowing Disney Cruise Line to significantly increase the number of destinations around the world. And as I also mentioned earlier, we're really pleased that construction at Shanghai Disney Resort is well underway at the 963-acre site. And just looking at the model of this vast new resort has us all very excited about its prospects.
Turning to the Studio, our key upcoming titles are John Carter, an epic live-action adventure from Director Andrew Stanton of Pixar, Marvel's much anticipated The Avengers, which will be the first Marvel film marketed and distributed by Disney, Disney-Pixar's Brave, about a feisty heroine's adventure in the Scottish Highlands. And then later this year, we have Tim Burton's Frankenweenie and Disney Animation's Wreck-It Ralph. And those are both in fiscal 2013. Also in 2013, our tentpole releases are Oz, Iron Man 3, the Lone Ranger and Monsters University, the sequel to the very successful Monsters, Inc.
As an extension of our new Consumer Products business, Disney's baby initiative, we launched disneybaby.com last month, creating a new destination for parents to connect and share experiences with each other. I'm also proud to say that in December, we had record-breaking traffic across all Disney-branded online sites, and our popular mobile game Where's My Water? has now reached the top of the charts in 71 different countries, including currently in the U.S. and while Gardens of Time was named the most popular social game on Facebook.
In closing, we had a great start to the fiscal year, executing on our ongoing strategy, driving more and more value from our brands, Disney, Pixar, Marvel ESPN and ABC in the U.S. and around the globe. And we're confident that our commitment to creating and providing exceptional family entertainment on multiple platforms continues to position us to create long-term shareholder value.
And with that, I thank you, and turn the call over to Jay Rasulo."
191564,145646223,217750,"Walt Disney Co., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2012",2012-02-07,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal 2012 is off to a great start, as evidenced by the strong financial results we delivered during the quarter. These results follow on the back of record revenue net income and earnings per share we de",1406,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal 2012 is off to a great start, as evidenced by the strong financial results we delivered during the quarter. These results follow on the back of record revenue net income and earnings per share we delivered in 2011. 
I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing the first quarter in more detail and then highlight some factors that may influence our upcoming performance.
Operating income for the quarter was up 11% on revenue growth of 1%. Excluding Studio, revenue would've been up more than 4%. I mention this because as you know, the Studio has pursued a strategy of reducing production output and focusing on improving returns on invested capital rather than growing revenue. Our Q1 results reflect this strategy. 
In the first quarter, Media Networks was once again the largest contributor to our performance, led by Cable Networks, where operating income growth was driven by ESPN and the worldwide Disney Channel. ESPN's growth was due to higher affiliate revenue related to both higher rates and lower revenue deferrals compared to the prior year. We deferred $76 million less in revenue during Q1, primarily as a result of our new affiliate agreement with Comcast. As a result of this agreement, ESPN will no longer defer Comcast affiliate revenue during the year. We expect ESPN will defer approximately $70 million less in revenue during the second quarter than in prior year. I remind you that the change in ESPN's revenue recognition related to Comcast has no impact on full year results.
ESPN's advertising revenue in Q1 was comparable to the prior year, but up 8% after adjusting for the timing of the Rose and Fiesta Bowls and the impact of the NBA lockout. 
If you recall, the Rose and Fiesta Bowls aired during our first quarter last year, but those games fell in our second quarter this year. Also due to the NBA lockout, ESPN aired 29 fewer NBA games during Q1 compared to last year. ESPN will air more NBA games during the second and third fiscal quarters compared to last year, so the full year total will not change.
So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales are pacing up single digits after adjusting for the benefit of the Rose and Fiesta Bowls. We are quite pleased with ESPN's current ad momentum, particularly given that ad revenue was up 23% during the second quarter last year after adjusting for the benefit of ESPN's first airing of the BCS.
Growth at the worldwide Disney Channel was due to increased advertising and affiliate revenue, partially offset by higher programming and production costs. We continued to enjoy strong advertising momentum at ABC Family during the quarter, with ad revenue up 10%. So far during the second quarter, ABC Family ad sales are pacing up double digits. 
At Broadcasting, operating income was lower in the quarter as a result of decreased political ad revenue at our owned TV stations, partially offset by lower programming and production costs. Marketing spending at the ABC Network was higher in the quarter, reflecting support for several new primetime shows launched in Q1, including Revenge and Once Upon a Time. Both of these ABC Studios-produced shows are off to great starts.
Ad revenue at the stations was down 20% in the quarter. Excluding political advertising and the Flint and Toledo stations, which were sold in Q3 last year, ad revenue was up 3%. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was comparable to the prior year. Quarter to date, scatter pricing at the ABC network is running mid-teen percentage points above upfront levels. Q2 TV station ad sales are pacing down single digits.
We are pleased with our strong -- continued strong results at Parks and Resorts. Revenue for the quarter was up 10% and operating income was up 18%. The growth in operating income was the result of higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic parks and higher passenger cruise days driven by the Disney Dream, partially offset by higher costs. Total segment margins were up 120 basis points in the first quarter versus last year's Q1. 
For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 3% and per capita spending was up 8% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending. Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6% while occupancy was flat. The increase in per room spending was driven by higher pricing and a reduction of promotional room nights.
So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up mid-single digits compared to prior-year levels, while book rates are also up mid-single digits. Our first quarter results and the trends we are seeing so far in the second quarter are further evidence that our strategy of returning pricing to more normal levels without sacrificing volume continues to pay off.
At our International Parks and Resorts, operating income at Hong Kong Disneyland was higher due to increased guest spending and higher attendance. Operating income at Disneyland Paris was lower due to higher costs and the absence of a real estate sales that took place in Q1 of last year. 
As I mentioned earlier, Studio Entertainment revenue decline compared to prior year. This decline was primarily due to the release of fewer Disney-produced titles compared to last year and higher worldwide box office performances of Tangled and Tron in Q1 last year compared to the Muppets this year. However, Studio operating income was higher in the quarter due to lower marketing, distribution and production costs associated with the release of these films.
At Consumer Products, operating income for the quarter was comparable to prior year. Merchandise, licensing earned revenue was in line with prior year as higher sales of Cars merchandise was largely offset by lower sales of Toy Story merchandise. 
At the Interactive Media segment, operating losses increased from the prior year due to the lower performance of our console game business, but partially offset by higher operating income from social games. The decline in console games was due to fewer titles being released this quarter compared to last year, as well as lower performance of Disney Universe in Q1 compared to the very successful Epic Mickey last year. Higher operating income at social games was due to lower impact of purchase accounting for Playdom, as well as improved game performance driven by higher revenue from Gardens of Time.
Now let me turn to the second quarter. We'll continue to invest in successful initiatives that strengthen and extend our brands. In 2011, ABC Family's ratings grew for the eighth consecutive year, and ABC Family ranked as a top cable network for the third consecutive year in total viewers in adults 18 to 49. During Q2, ABC Family will air approximately 20 additional hours of original programming, which will further strengthen its lineup of shows and extend ABC Family's popularity with millennial viewers. These additional hours of programming will result in approximately $35 billion of incremental programming and marketing expense in the quarter. 
As Bob mentioned, we continue to expand the geographic footprint and reach of the Disney brand. In March, we will launch a new broadcast satellite channel in Japan targeting women and families. We expect to invest $35 million behind this initiative during the remainder of the fiscal year with approximately half of that falling in Q2. 
At Parks and Resorts, we will launch the Disney Fantasy at the end of the second quarter, whereas the Disney Dream launched in late January last year. As a result, we expect to incur preopening expenses in the second quarter related to the launch of the Fantasy, but the ship will not generate meaningful revenue until Q3.
While all of these investments will drive incremental expenses during the second quarter, we're confident in our ability to generate attractive returns on these investments.
We continue to repurchase our stock -- continued to repurchase our stock during the first quarter by buying back 23.3 million shares for about $800 million, which is consistent with the pace during the first quarter last year. Fiscal year to date, we have repurchased 33 million shares for $1.2 billion. 
We feel great about the start of the fiscal year and look forward to continuing to execute on our strategic and financial objectives, and delivering strong performance for our shareholders during the rest of fiscal 2012.

In terms of Cruise, Alexia, it was not a really significant difference in the number. It's about $7 million or $8 million difference from what we recognized last year. But understanding that the timing of the launch of the Fantasy is later than the timing of the launch of the Dream, there would be more costs in Q2. Sort of in total, they're about the same, but it's more switched into Q2 than Q1 versus those costs for the Dream.

I'm assuming either they themselves haven't had it or they haven't had it from their customers. And so ESPN has remained basically on a highly distributed tier, not just with Comcast, but across the industry. Now there's so much that's been said about cord cutting and cord slicing and a la carte packages. I think it's just important to emphasize a couple of points about that again. First, I'll start with ESPN. I think they've now gotten to a point because of their popularity and the quality of what they offer, they almost transcend sports. They offer news, stories that are of interest nationally and locally, they program 6,400 hours of live and original programming a year, 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. Their ratings double the combination of all the RSNs in markets as a -- for instance. And I just think, generally speaking, not only are they popular, but they've gotten into that virtual must-have category. Now we don't take that for granted. But because of their position and because of not just their popularity, but almost the value that they now supply both to the distributor and to the customer, we don't really see either a la carte offerings or cord splicing -- or slicing I guess, I should say, as a trend. The only thing I want to say about a la carte and I'll say it -- I've said it a few times, is that I think people want variety, and they're getting it today, and they're also getting substantially increased quality. I've said this before, but for $60, which is the average cost of the expanded basic service, consumers get about 100 channels of programming. Those channels, ours and others, have put billions of dollars into programming over the years, so that the product is a lot better. And if suddenly, they were able to buy these channels on an a la carte basis, we know what would happen. First of all, there would be channels that are of interest to a lot of different entities, in some cases, niche channels, that would simply go away. And I don't think that would necessarily be good. Secondly, the channels that were left would see decreased distribution, decreased ratings, decreased advertising revenue, and that will put a lot of pressure on the rates that they charge. So the rates would go up. The result would be that consumers would be spending more per channel, and it's quite possible that the $60 100-channel package would quickly become a $60 50-channel package. And I don't think that's necessarily good. So I think that's one of the reasons why we're not seeing some great interest in cord cutting because I think, generally, consumers are happy with the quality and the variety that they're getting, and the price-to-value relationship is generally good."

As to -- I think what was hidden or maybe not in your question about how we're looking at Redbox and a lot of these services, we are in discussions to go to the 28-day window to not make -- to not sell directly our physical goods to these entities unless they adhere to a 28-day window. Obviously, because of the first-sale doctrine, they would have an ability to buy those goods from normal retailers. But rather than us being part of that sale and in protection of the sell-through window, we feel that, that would be a wise thing for us to do. I'm not, obviously, as you anticipated, Jessica, going to comment about the Univision article that came out yesterday. 
I've said before that ABC has a platform that we continue to invest in from a content perspective. And ABC News is a very important part of that platform.

And most of what we're opening are family suites, where we've seen a real demand in the marketplace. We actually converted some of our space in some of our other hotels to family suites. And we will be opening different parts of this hotel over the next year, year and a half, most of which will be in the family suite category. And to put that in perspective, I don't have the pricing in front of me directly, but my recollection is that we're selling family suites for somewhere in the neighborhood of $200 to $225 a night. These have been very, very popular in the marketplace, and we thought we wanted to expand. Obviously, a family suite is designed to accommodate an entire family. And for that price, we think that this is -- it's right to call this a value room or a value accommodation. We've seen a fair amount of demand in this space over the last 5 or so years, actually probably longer. As we've said before, if you look at our profile, particularly in Florida, we have many more value-priced keys, rooms and suites available today. About 40% of our total fit into that category as of the first quarter that we just announced. Obviously, when we open this new resort, which is very, very large, that number's going to grow somewhat. I think it reflects what's going on in the marketplace in some respects, but it also reflects the popularity of our product and the fact that we're now making it more accessible to more people because of the affordability factor. And for people to be able to come and stay in a room like the ones that we're building for that price is a pretty good deal. Do you want to answer the second?"

So you're absolutely right in stating that we have been through the market multiple times in the past year. I want to add, because I'm very proud of it and proud of our team, but for what we borrowed, in both the amounts and our rating, we really, almost always in the past year, saw historically low coupon rates on that debt. And whereas a couple have been better since then, I think we've timed our steps into the debt marketplace very carefully and put a lot of time into picking what we think would be low entry points, and we've been very successful in doing that. In doing so, we've obviously increased our debt because of the availability of money at these great rates. But I think that one of the reasons why we kind of punched beyond our weight in the debt market is because we have been so strategic and so public and so consistent in wanting to keep a A rating as -- on our balance sheet and go to the market with that consistent message. We have no intention at the current time to change that. There is some -- we can continue to leverage up somewhat and stay below that sort of 2.0 gross debt ratio that will keep us at that A, and we won't push ourselves beyond that. I think there's a little more capacity when we see opportunities to step out. Again, we've got a couple of maturities that we'd like to fill in. And when they see the opportunity to step in at great rates, I think you'll see us doing that. Of course, as time passes, will have some maturities that will refill. But don't expect us to back the truck up to the point where we have to give up that great balance sheet and great Standard & Poor's rating that has, I think, served us incredibly well over the past decade, including when liquidity dried up for most companies in 2008."

But I think that we can't forget that the power of this channel expansion is not just financial. And to look at it that way, I think, would miss, sort of, a key leg of our strategy. We know from research that the Disney Channel is now the strongest brand driver of the Disney brand in most countries in the world. And as such, we try to get that channel in front of more and more people, which explains why we did the Russian free-to-air joint venture, why we moved from premium to free-to-air and a much broader distribution in Spain and France last year, why we've launched in Turkey. This is a great entry point for people into the Disney franchise. The Disney Channel is a franchise builder. It's a Disney brand builder. And so the combination of both, its financial contribution to the company and strategic leverage that we draft off of in everything that we do around the world makes those investments really payback multifold."

There was no connection between the announcement that was made yesterday and the decision by the Studio, which was made by the Studio, to go to the 28-day window. The reason they hadn't gone to that window before is the Studio felt that it was not seeing any affect from these dollar rentals on their sell-through business. And it was their feeling that if they went to that model, it really wasn't -- there would be nothing to be gained from it. In fact they thought they actually might lose some. They have taken a hard look at the business overall. I'd say that the industry has continued to suffer on the sell-through side. And the sale of goods digitally or the rental side have not made up for enough of that falloff that's across the industry. And so they've decided to take a step in the direction of further protecting the initial window and the sell-through window. The whole issue of authentication is somewhat different or separate from the discussion on windowing, although I understand why you would connect the 2. What authentication is about is we see it as really 2 things. One, it's recognizing the value of the multichannel distribution business model and working to protect it, but also working to enhance it by recognizing the value and the excitement of new technology platforms. And so what this does is it gives people, who have subscribed to those services, the ability to watch these channels and watch these programs in a much more mobile, much more flexible ways on all the new devices. It also does create a window that advantages the subscriber and on, at least, the rental side, disadvantages the nonsubscriber. The nonsubscriber would still be able to buy some of these programs on a sell-through basis digitally, virtually right after they air, but would not be able to gain access to them on a rental or a video D model, unless they're subscribers of the service. And that's obviously designed to protect, again, the business model, while at the same time recognizing the importance of and the potential and the excitement around new technology-driven platforms."

It's also a great illustration of why we like Marvel so much, great characters, great storytelling, and the wonderful ability for them to bring their characters and stories to the big screen so effectively.  Ironman, Thor and Captain America initially brought those compelling characters to millions of people leading to the tremendous success we're now seeing with The Avengers. And we'll continue to build on this incredible franchise with the release of Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 next year, followed by Captain America 2 in 2014. And since I'm sure I will be asked, yes, we are in development on a sequel to Avengers. 
There are obviously numerous benefits to creating such a valuable franchise, and one of them is in our Consumer Products business, where our combined Disney-Marvel licensing team is hard at work bringing those characters to market in multiple ways significantly growing our retail presence around the world. And based on early figures, the demand for Avengers merchandise has been very strong.
We actually have a lot of other great new movies on the way as well, starting with Disney Pixar's Brave, a brilliant action-adventure featuring Pixar's first female hero. And then later this year, we're looking forward to Frankenweenie, Tim Burton's heartwarming twist on the classic monster movie, as well as Disney Animation's Record Ralph which takes viewers into the world of classic video arcade games. And next year, we've got Oz, the Great and Powerful, as well as Johnny Depp's Tonto and the Lone Ranger and a Monsters, Inc. prequel from Disney Pixar.
We've also got plenty to be excited about in our other businesses. Our Media Networks, ESPN, Disney channels, ABC, ABC Family Plus, our equity stakes in A&E history and Lifetime represent an incredibly valuable growth driving segment for us, with multiple revenue streams supported by strong high-quality creative content leveraged across territories and on many new digital platforms.
It's almost a cliché to mention ESPN as the strongest brand in media, but it continues to strengthen and to grow. And in 2011, more adults 18 to 49 watched ESPN than any other 24-hour cable network. And fans are spending more time with the ESPN brand and media on TV, online and on a variety of mobile devices than any other sports brand.
ESPN delivers tremendous value to distributors with an unparalleled content array that helps to drive broadband subscriptions, local ad sales and HD upgrades. And with numerous sports rights agreements in place into the next decade, including the NFL, the ACC, the SCC, Pac-12 and Wimbledon, and long-term agreements in place with 2 of the largest multichannel providers, ESPN is obviously quite well positioned to remain the preeminent sports brand.  It's also worthy of noting that as of today, Comcast subscribers can download the WatchESPN app that brings the total number of subscribers that can now access ESPN's channel on mobile devices to 40 million.
While we have mentioned the Disney Channel on these calls on numerous occasion, we thought it was time to put its accomplishment in perspective. With 103 channels in 167 countries right now, Disney Channel is our biggest and most effective global brand builder and content engine, taking Disney into hundreds of millions of homes everyday. And list of markets we are in continues to expand, sometimes in pretty dramatic ways. An example of this is in Russia, where we launched a free to air channel in January to excellent ratings and it's just the beginning.
Here in the U.S., Disney Channel is a top destination for kids and tweens, and for the last 3 months, it has been the #1 network among kids 2 to 11, supporting 3 of the top 10 shows among that essential audience. Original programming is also driving success of Disney Junior, where we got the top preschooler shows, including Jake and the Neverland Pirates, and our newest animated hit Doc McStuffin's. And after achieving record ratings again last year, Disney XD's core audience continues to grow drawn by the exciting programming that defines that brand. 
So when you think about this collection of Disney-branded channels, consider their strength in terms of program quality, program success, reach, brand building effectiveness and financial growth.
And rounding out our cable portfolio, ABC Family continues to build on its eighth consecutive years of growth with an ambitious slate of original programming. The channel is not only popular with Millennial is, it's currently the #3 Cable Networks in all key female demos. And the same high quality original content that draws audiences to ABC Family here in the U.S. is now being sold into several hundred markets around the world.
On the network side, where we go away from ABC upfront we will introduce our shows for next season, and we're anticipating a strong upfront marketplace, and we're very impressed by the quality of our pilots, particularly those from ABC Studios. We're building on the strength of our current schedule, with ABC-owned Grey's Anatomy, the #1 drama, and Once Upon a Time, the #1 new drama, as well as television's #1 comedy, Modern Family and Revenge, one of the season's top new series.
With strong demand for our content around the world, we're currently selling ABC programming into more than 225 international markets, and our success has allowed us to presell our new series globally off and before they air on the network. Our ABC Studios business is meaningful. Revenue from domestic and international syndication and digital sales will reach an all-time high this year and has grown 25% per year over the past decade.
As we've articulated on numerous occasions, global expansion remains a key part of our strategy, and China is a top priority for us. During my recent visit to China I met with Vice President about our current initiatives and future opportunities, and was very encouraged by his support and enthusiasm for our plans, especially Shanghai Disney Resort, which is a critical investment for our long-term growth there. The Shanghai Disney Resort site is fully cleared, and the land has been prepared for construction. And visiting the site the week before last gave us a visual validation of just how vast and how significant this project is for us.
We've several investment in our Parks and Resorts now coming online or near completion, all of which we're very optimistic about. Our expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland is also proceeding nicely and features 3 new themed areas, including the hugely popular Toy Story Land, which we opened in 2011, as well as Grizzly Gulch, which comes online later this year.  And we're happy with the progress of Hong Kong Disneyland, as well as the fact that it just had another great quarter.
The California Adventure, we're looking forward to the June 15 opening of Cars Land, an incredible 12-acre addition that transports guests right into the world of Radiator Springs. With 3 new attractions and theme restaurants, Cars Land is the culmination of the expansion we started with Toy Story Mania!, Little Mermaid and the spectacular World of Color. I believe the completion will result in a park that will both stand on its own but also serve as an important and worthy neighbor to Disneyland, and finally, enable the 2 to become the destination resort we once envisioned.
And lastly, on the Cruise ship front, we recently launched the Disney Fantasy, the sister ship to the Dream which sets sail in 2011  and the 2 new ships have proven to be extremely popular with strong bookings. A few of us had the chance to sail on the Fantasy's maiden voyage with over 3,000 other guests and the ship is visually stunning, the sailing experience truly wonderful. It's impossible to fully explain just how magnificent this ship really is, the quality, the service and the attention to the very smallest details create the kind of extraordinary family vacation that only Disney can provide. And by the way, a lot of the people on that first maiden voyage reserved future trips.
So as you can see, in Parks and Resorts, many of our long-term investments are now coming to fruition, driving increased performance and positioning us for future growth.
Our commitment to creative excellence is also evident on Broadway. The Lion King is now the top grossing Broadway production of all-time, and our 2 newest productions, Newsies and Peter and the Starcatcher, just turned an impressive 17 Tony nominations. 
I also want to mention our Disney Interactive team who are also leveraging creative content from our lines of business to generate gains and other interactive content. Marvel Avengers Alliance is the first social media game ever based on the Marvel brand, and it already has nearly 1.5 million daily players. Animal Kingdom explorers is a popular game based on Disney's Animal Kingdom Park, and builds on the hidden object gains success Gardens of Time, which is now available on mobile platforms.
We just recently launched disneychannel.com, a new highly interactive consumer friendly site for kids and family. In a few weeks allegedly was our Disney video product which includes a Disney YouTube family-friendly destination, and then later this year, we'll launch an all-new disney.com.
So in closing, we're obviously pleased with the results in the quarter and thrilled with the reaction to Avengers, but we remain extremely excited about the future for all of our businesses.  We're seeing revenue increases in Media Networks, driven by the quality of our content and the consumer demand for it, we're welcoming more guests to our Parks and Resorts as a result of our expansions and enhanced experiences, and we're very optimistic about what's being developed and constructed for the years ahead.  And we're using characters and creativity from Disney, Pixar and Marvel to deliver extraordinary entertainment and drive franchises across our entire company.
We're expanding the reach of our content and consumer access to it on a variety of new platforms, while we're dramatically expanding our international presence in the traditional and emerging markets around the world.
So here's Jay for details about the quarter and comments about the current business trends. Jay?"

We delivered strong financial performance during the second fiscal quarter, with operating income up 10% on a revenue growth of 6%. Earnings per share, excluding certain non-comparable items, were up 18%. These",1498,"Thanks, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong financial performance during the second fiscal quarter, with operating income up 10% on a revenue growth of 6%. Earnings per share, excluding certain non-comparable items, were up 18%. These results continue to demonstrate the success of our strategy, the strength of our company's assets, the unique competitive position and our ability to generate attractive returns on investment over the long term. 
I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing the second quarter in more detail and then highlight some factors that may influence our upcoming performance.  In the second quarter, Media Networks was the largest contributor to our performance. Operating income growth for this segment was primarily driven by growth in Cable Networks, with ESPN and the domestic Disney Channels being the main drivers. 
ESPN's growth was due to higher affiliate and advertising revenues, as well as lower affiliate revenue deferrals compared to the prior year. The growth in affiliate revenues were due to contractual rate increases. ESPN deferred $72 million less in revenue during the second quarter compared to last year. And I'll remind you that this change in ESPN's revenue recognition is related to Comcast affiliate revenue and has no impact on full year results.
ESPN's Q2 advertising revenue was up 14% compared to prior year and up an estimated 6% when adjusted for the timing of the Rose and Fiesta Bowls and the impact of the NBA lockout. If you'll recall, the Rose and Fiesta Bowls aired during our second quarter this year, but those games fell in our first quarter last year. As I mentioned last quarter, despite the NBA lockout, ESPN aired the same number of regular-season NBA games than last year, however the number of games per quarter was different. We have aired 9 more games during Q2 compared to prior year, and there are 20 additional NBA games during the third quarter compared to prior year.  So far this quarter, ESPN had sales are pacing up high single digits.
Growth at the domestic Disney Channels was driven by higher affiliate revenue due to contractual rate increases and higher sales of Disney Channel programming. At ABC Family, the decision to further invest in original programming during the quarter is paying off as the network continues to resonate with viewers and advertisers. 
For the quarter, ABC Family primetime ratings were up 7% among adults 18 to 49. ABC also had 3 of the top 5 basic cable scripted original series among females 12 to 34, Pretty Little Liars which was #1, Switched at Birth and the Lying Game. ABC Family ad revenue was up 12% in the quarter, and that follows the 10% growth delivered last quarter. So far during the third quarter, ABC Family ad sales are pacing up 10%.
Reported cable margins, excluding our equity investments, were down 100 basis points in the quarter. However, this decline was due to a net negative impact of 170 basis points resulting from several non-comparable factors. On the positive side, we had the benefit of the change in the Comcast revenue deferral. On the negative side, there was the impact of the timing of the Rose and Fiesta Bowls, the NBA schedule changes and the incremental expense we occurred for ABC Family programming and to launch our Japan broadcast satellite channel. On balance, the negative factors outweigh the positive factor, thus driving the net negative impact of 170 basis points.
At Broadcasting, the increase in operating income was the result of higher advertising revenue, as well as lower programming and production costs. The increase in ad revenue was due to higher rates at the ABC network, partially offset by lower ad revenue at our owned stations. 
Ad revenue at the ABC network was up 6% during the quarter. Ad revenue at the stations was down 8% in the quarter. Excluding the Flint and Toledo stations, which we sold in Q3 last year, ad revenue at the stations was down 5%. Quarter-to-date scatter pricing at the ABC network is running over 20% above upfront levels. Q3 TV station ad sales are pacing down low single-digits. On the cost side, lower programming and production costs reflect the absence of the Oprah Winfrey Show at our owned stations, as well as lower daytime and new production costs at the network.
Our Parks and Resorts segment delivered another strong quarter, with revenues up 10% and operating income up an impressive 53%. Operating income was higher at our domestic resorts, Tokyo Disney Resort, and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by a decrease at Disneyland Paris. We saw continued improvement in segment margin store in the quarter, up more than 200 basis points compared to last year.
At our Domestic Parks, the increase in operating income was due to increased guest spending and attendance, partially offset by increased costs. For the quarter, attendance at our Domestic Parks was up 7% and per capita spending was up 5% on a higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending.
Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 7%, while occupancy increased almost 2 percentage points to a little over 82%. The increase in per room spending was driven by higher average daily rates. 
The results at our Domestic Parks and Resorts confirm that our strategy of restoring pricing to normalized levels continues to pay off. During the quarter, we enjoyed growth in pricing and volume, both at our domestic parks and at our domestic resorts, with Disneyland setting a new Q2 attendance records, reflecting the success of our continued expansion of Disney's California Adventure. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 1%, while booked rates are up low single-digits. Q3 bookings at the Disney Cruise Line are 30% higher than prior year, with occupancy for the entire fleet now over 90%. 
At our International Parks and Resorts, better results from the Tokyo Disney Resort reflect the negative impact of the Tokyo earthquake during Q2 last year and the related business interruption insurance proceeds we received in Q2 this year.  We continue to enjoy strong performance at Hong Kong Disneyland with the park achieving Q2 records in revenue and attendance. The growth in operating income during the second quarter was due to increased guest spending and higher attendance. At Disneyland Paris, operating income was lower due to lower attendance and higher labor costs.
At Studio Entertainment, operating income declined in the quarter due to the performance of John Carter compared to prior-year titles, which included Tangled and Mars Needs Moms, as well as higher film impairments in the quarter driven by John Carter.
At Consumer Products, operating income was up for the quarter due to increased -- an increase in merchandise licensing, partially offset by lower results in our Retail business. Growth in licensing was due to higher recognition of guaranteed shortfall revenue, as well as higher merchandise sales. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 3%. 
At the Interactive Media segment, operating losses were lower compared to prior year due to improved results in our Games business. Social games results benefited from the lower impact of acquisition accounting with Playdom, as well as improved performance driven by higher revenue from Gardens of Time. The improvement at console games in the quarter was due to lower product development expenses as we continue to focus on developing fewer console games and more social games.
Turning to the third quarter, there are a number of items that will impact year-over-year comparisons. At ESPN, net deferred revenue recognition for Q3 will be $140 million lower than prior year since we no longer defer revenues from Comcast as part of our new deal. ESPN will also incur about $35 million in additional costs due to 20 extra NBA games in the quarter compared to last year. 
During the second quarter, NBC Universal exercised an option that requires A&E Television Networks to purchase a substantial portion of NBC Universal's 15.8% equity interest. The transaction is expected to close following the termination of a value of NBC Universal's equity interest and result in an increase in our equity interest in A&E, which at the end of the second quarter stood at approximately 42%.  We expect to continue to account for our interest in AETN as an equity method investment. 
We continue to repurchase our stock during the second quarter by buying back 21.4 million shares for about $870 million, which is consistent with the pace during the second quarter last year. Fiscal year-to-date, we have purchased 51 million shares for $1.9 billion. We are pleased with our Q2 results and our current business momentum and the ongoing process of our growth initiatives and competitive position in our Media Networks. That, coupled with the strongest balance sheet in the industry, gives us great confidence that our strategy of managing the company for long-term success will continue to deliver returns to our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell for questions"

First of all, there was a substantial amount of interest in the film among our call the consumer products industry, more interest than some of its predecessor films, Thor and Captain America. But the interest was not commensurate with what we've already seen in terms of the success of the movie and interest in the movie among audiences around the world. So what you basically have is you have extraordinary demand for the products that are on the shows, and in many cases, product that's already been sold out. So our global licensing team is hard at work, working with licensees and retailers around the world to stop the shelves as fast as possible. We expect, given the interest in this film, that demand for its product is going to continue to be strong, pretty much throughout the year, but given the plan that we have for this film and the characters, it's our complete or full intent to make sure that demand for Consumer Products continues. So as I mentioned in my calls, in 2013, you're going to see a sequel to Thor 2 and you're going to see Iron Man 3. In 2014, you're going to see a sequel to Captain America, and then eventually, a date to be determined, you'll see a sequel to Avengers, and so on. The other thing that we're seeing is that interest in other characters, like The Hulk for instance, is also strong. It had always been a decent merchandise product for Marvel in the past, but the presence of the character in this film and the performance of the actor, the popularity has actually grown significantly. So there's real demand for Hulk product in the marketplace right now. So I think what you're essentially seeing here is a true franchise not necessarily in the making, but I having been made and launched. And the box office is only one part of it. There are a multiple opportunities to continue to mind this great set of characters, and while it all started with a set of really good movies, we fully intend to continue to fuel the marketplace with Marvel's Avengers-related stories and characters so the momentum continues."

So I was wondering if you would just update us on we're is that today? I think back pre-acquisition 40% of Marvel's licensing revenue was international, where is that today. And then secondly, as you look at the portfolio of characters, would you consider buying back the film rights to some of the other characters, say like X-Men from FOX?"

They got development in the works for a number of unnamed characters that are going to give us Marvel the ability to make numerous films over the years ahead. So I don't think you'll see necessarily a need to buy back characters or all that much opportunity. On the licensing front, we're fully integrated internationally. Marvel used to use third parties frequently to represent them on the licensing side. We have a global licensing organization that we fully integrated with some really talented Marvel folks. And that we believe will not only reduce costs because we're paying basically third-party representatives to handle licensing on behalf of Marvel, but we believe that the combined entity has a much more effective ability to gain access to the marketplace and increase our presence at retail. And with the quality of the films that Marvel is making the interest in them that obviously increases that much more. No specifics though in terms of the percentage represented by International sales. Clearly, the box office side is really significant and should continue to be. This we believe will be the most accessible Marvel film internationally, and that obviously will give us some great opportunities on the licensing front too."

So the quarter was pretty strong on international attendance. We are now -- I've always talked about the sort of 18% to 22% range of international attendance at Walt Disney World, and in fact, we're at the very high end of that range in the previous quarter. We've seen a lot of visitation from Brazil in particular, which is not a new market for us, but it increasingly becomes an important market. Canada, always stays an important market out here at Disneyland. We are also in the range there pretty high, approaching 10% of the international visitation, lots of it from Asia. On the domestic side, domestic visitors outside of the state of Florida and outside of the state of California, we were relatively flat on the quarter versus prior year. And of course, because of all the new stuff we're doing, we're seeing a lot of a big pickup in resident attendance and a lot of demand on the Annual Pass programs, particularly out here on the West Coast. So we're very happy about what we're seeing, gives us, particularly at Disney's California Adventure, a very good feeling about what's to come when we finally drop the rope on that in mid-June. Your second question was about cash. I presume that you are asking about returns to shareholders, which we of course always talk about aggressively as part of our overall strategy. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are pacing at the same level with now about $2 billion worth of buybacks in the first half of fiscal year. You'll remember last year, we ended up buying back about $5 billion in the year, and that's not to be predictive, but we are always out there and opportunistically looking to make good investment in our own stock. And we will continue to do so as part of our fundamental strategy. I don't need to remind you that we increased our dividend significantly last year what the board did. And of course we will -- they will look at that again as we near the end of this year. Our goal being to stay in the pack in terms of the yield that we pay against our stock. We're quite conscious of that, and had fallen behind and don't want to fall behind again."

And then my question for Bob, I think you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks on social games, your strategy is to develop more social games than console games. So I'm wondering if you can give us an update on that strategy. We've seen these games like Draw Something on the iPhone pop up so quickly and resonate with kids in time spent.

We've made a practice of not being predictive on margins and looking too far down the road. But let me take the opportunity to talk a little bit about what happened in this current quarter in terms of affiliate revenue growth. So on a reported basis, cable revenue growth grew at over 10%. And ESPN grew almost at 12% in terms of affiliate fees. Of course, you have to adjust for the things I spoke about in my prepared remarks. The covenant-related Comcast deal, the other puts and takes that I mentioned. And if you do that, on ESPN affiliate revenue was up high single digits in the quarter, which was comparable to the growth that we achieved in the first quarter.

One way to do that was to decrease our investment in console games and increase our investment, or diversify our investment, to social and to mobile games. And I don't think that it would be fair to conclude that we've given social a priority, even though we purchased Playdom to enable us to get more into that business. We've actually spent a fair amount of time and investment on mobile games and it had some considerable success, notably Where's My Water, which for a period of time was the #1 downloaded mobile game in the iTunes platform. I have another very popular game that involved birds. So we think that you're right that we see a dramatic increase in the time and money spent, particularly among our core demographic on mobile platforms. We actually think that they are going to continue to penetrate the market more profoundly, particularly outside the United States and our presence on those platforms is very, very important. The other thing to note is that the development cost for both the social games and for the -- and the basically the production cost, the social and the mobile games, are relatively unexpected. So in order for them to give a comparability we have to reduce expenses. And one way to do that is to deemphasize console and emphasize on the other.

What that does is it pays us incremental money in terms of the money that we're being paid by the multichannel providers.

They're enjoying great success. I believe that great success is solely the result of great programming. And there are a number of programs that are delivering those great ratings. We have been aggressive as a company at being present on new platforms because we believe that by and large they create incremental revenue opportunities, and thereby increase your interest in our programs and relevance. We also have managed our presence in these platforms very carefully because the Digital Media business is still nascent and certainly but dynamic. It's changing right before our eyes. What we believe we've done is to strike a pretty good balance between protecting the core or the traditional business in platforms and taking advantage of new opportunities on new digital platforms, which also happens to give viewers more access to these programs at both from a time perspective and a place perspective than they've ever had before. We have not seen any negative impact from the presence of Disney Channel shows on these new platforms. Most of them, by the way, are not available until after a season ends. And I think on the Netflix deal, only for that are and what we found is that the product that is available on the linear channel through the multichannel provider is simply much richer, much more diverse and much more attractive to the consumer than what's available on the other platforms. Not just the other platforms, the new ones aren't good, they are. But they pale in comparison in terms of how attractive they are to the consumer. So that's a long way of my saying that we feel good about the balance that we've struck, we're going to continue to look at and watch very carefully. We believe it will be wrong for us to remove our product from these new media platforms, particularly as they grow just as it would be wrong for us to be cavalier or reckless about the traditional business which is delivering so much value to our company and our distributors and that's why the Watch apps were created. It creates an unbelievable balance as far as we're concerned, between protecting an old business and being aggressive about going after new opportunities. But again, going to the back of the Disney Channel, when you have great programming, you get great ratings, and you're just not that susceptible to the presence of those shows on other platforms."

Or if not, potentially exit those markets. That's not to say that we're going to get out of international, but I think ESPN is likely to be selective about their presence there. It's tough going for them because they're frequently competing with local or locally owned and controlled platform owners that are going after sports almost as loss leaders to drive subscriptions to their platforms and the absence of us owning traditional distribution in these markets, it's kind of tough to be as aggressive buying live sports. So the opportunities for ESPN internationally I think are somewhat limited. Not to say that they don't exist but it's never going to be a big part of ESPN's business."

We're very pleased with the company's strong performance in the second quarter with earnings per share up 18% over last year when adjusted for comparability. Growth in advertising and affiliate fees in Media Networks as well as greater attendance and guest spending in our Parks and Resorts primarily drove our performance. 
There are many exciting things happening across our businesses starting with The Avengers, which, as all of you know, shattered industry box office records, achieving the biggest domestic opening weekend of all time with $207.1 million. The movie set new opening weekend records in several other countries as well, bringing its worldwide box office gross to more than $700 million to date.  
It's a fantastic movie, and we're obviously thrilled that audiences around the world share that opinion. It's also a great illustration of why we like Marvel so much: great characters, great storytelling and the wonderful ability for them to bring their characters and stories to the big screen so effectively.  Ironman, Thor and Captain America initially brought those compelling characters to millions of people, leading to the tremendous success we're now seeing with The Avengers. And we'll continue to build on this incredible franchise with the release of Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 next year, followed by Captain America 2 in 2014. And since I'm sure I will be asked, yes, we are in development on a sequel to Avengers. 
There are obviously numerous benefits to creating such a valuable franchise, and one of them is in our Consumer Products business, where our combined Disney-Marvel licensing team is hard at work bringing those characters to market in multiple ways, significantly growing our retail presence around the world. And based on early figures, the demand for Avengers merchandise has been very strong.
We actually have a lot of other great new movies on the way as well, starting with Disney/Pixar's Brave, a brilliant action-adventure featuring Pixar's first female hero. And then later this year, we're looking forward to Frankenweenie, Tim Burton's heartwarming twist on the classic monster movie, as well as Disney Animation's Wreck-It Ralph, which takes viewers into the world of classic video arcade games. And next year, we've got Oz The Great and Powerful, as well as Johnny Depp's Tonto in The Lone Ranger and a Monsters, Inc. prequel from Disney/Pixar.
We've also got plenty to be excited about in our other businesses. Our media networks, ESPN, Disney Channels, ABC, ABC Family plus our equity stakes in A&E, History and Lifetime, represent an incredibly valuable growth-driving segment for us with multiple revenue streams supported by strong, high-quality, creative content leveraged across territories and on many new digital platforms.
It's almost a cliché to mention ESPN as the strongest brand in media, but it continues to strengthen and to grow. And in 2011, more adults 18 to 49 watched ESPN than any other 24-hour cable network. And fans are spending more time with ESPN-branded media on TV, online and on a variety of mobile devices than any other sports brand.
ESPN delivers tremendous value to distributors with an unparalleled content array that helps to drive broadband subscriptions, local ad sales and HD upgrades. And with numerous sports rights agreements in place into the next decade, including the NFL, the ACC, the SEC, Pac-12 and Wimbledon, and long-term agreements in place with 2 of the largest multichannel providers, ESPN is obviously quite well positioned to remain the preeminent sports brand.  
It's also worthy of noting that as of today, Comcast subscribers can download the WatchESPN app that brings the total number of subscribers that can now access ESPN's channel on mobile devices to 40 million.
While we had mentioned the Disney Channel on these calls on numerous occasion, we thought it was time to put its accomplishments in perspective. With 103 channels in 167 countries right now, Disney Channel is our biggest and most effective global brand builder and content engine, taking Disney into hundreds of millions of homes every day. And the list of markets where we are in continues to expand, sometimes in pretty dramatic ways. An example of this is in Russia, where we launched a free-to-air channel in January to excellent ratings, and it's just the beginning.
Here in the U.S., Disney Channel is a top destination for kids and tweens. And for the last 3 months, it has been the #1 network among kids 2 to 11, supported by 3 of the top 10 shows among that essential audience. 
Original programming is also driving the success of Disney Junior, where we've got the top preschooler shows, including Jake and the Neverland Pirates and our newest animated hit, Doc McStuffins. 
And after achieving record ratings again last year, Disney XD's core audience continues to grow, drawn by the exciting programming that defines that brand. 
So when you think about this collection of Disney-branded channels, consider their strength in terms of program quality, program success, reach, brand building effectiveness and financial growth.
And rounding out our cable portfolio, ABC Family continues to build on its eighth consecutive years of growth with an ambitious slate of original programming. The channel is not only popular with Millennials, it's currently the #3 cable network in all key female demos. And the same high-quality, original content that draws audiences to ABC Family here in the U.S. is now being sold into several hundred markets around the world.
On the network side, we're a week away from the ABC upfront where we'll introduce our shows for next season, and we're anticipating a strong upfront marketplace. And we're very impressed by the quality of our pilots, particularly those from ABC Studios. We're building on the strength of our current schedule, with ABC-owned Grey's Anatomy, the #1 drama, and Once Upon a Time, the #1 new drama, as well as television's #1 comedy, Modern Family, and Revenge, one of the season's top new series.
With strong demand for our content around the world, we're currently selling ABC programming into more than 225 international markets, and our success has allowed us to presell our new series globally often before they air on the network. 
Our ABC Studios business is meaningful. Revenue from domestic and international syndication and digital sales will reach an all-time high this year and has grown 25% per year over the past decade.
As we've articulated on numerous occasions, global expansion remains a key part of our strategy, and China is a top priority for us. During my recent visit to China, I met with Vice President Xi Jinping about our current initiatives and future opportunities. I was very encouraged by his support and enthusiasm for our plans, especially Shanghai Disney Resort, which is a critical investment for our long-term growth there. The Shanghai Disney Resort site is fully cleared, and the land has been prepared for construction. And visiting the site the week before last gave us a visual validation of just how vast and how significant this project is for us.
We have several investments in our Parks and Resorts now coming online or near completion, all of which we're very optimistic about. Our expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland is also proceeding nicely and features 3 new themed areas, including the hugely popular Toy Story Land, which we opened in 2011, as well as Grizzly Gulch, which comes online later this year.  And we're happy with the progress of Hong Kong Disneyland as well as the fact that it just had another great quarter.
California Adventure, we're looking forward to the June 15 opening of Cars Land, an incredible 12-acre addition that transports guests right into the world of Radiator Springs. And with 3 new attractions and theme restaurants, Cars Land is the culmination of the expansion we started with Toy Story Mania!, Little Mermaid and the spectacular World of Color. I believe the completion will result in a park that will both stand on its own but also serve as an important and worthy neighbor to Disneyland and finally enable the 2 to become the destination resort we once envisioned.
And lastly, on the cruise ship front, we recently launched the Disney Fantasy, the sister ship to the Dream, which sets sail in 2011, and the 2 new ships have proven to be extremely popular with strong bookings. A few of us had the chance to sail on the Fantasy's maiden voyage with over 3,000 other guests, and the ship is visually stunning, the sailing experience truly wonderful. It's impossible to fully explain just how magnificent this ship really is. The quality, the service and the attention to the very smallest details create the kind of extraordinary family vacation that only Disney can provide. And by the way, a lot of the people on that first maiden voyage reserved future trips.
So as you can see, in Parks and Resorts, many of our long-term investments are now coming to fruition, driving increased performance and positioning us for future growth.
Our commitment to creative excellence is also evident on Broadway. The Lion King is now the top-grossing Broadway production of all time, and our 2 newest productions, Newsies and Peter and the Starcatcher, just turned an impressive 17 Tony nominations. 
I also want to mention our Disney Interactive team who are also leveraging creative content from our lines of business to generate games and other interactive content. Marvel: Avengers Alliance is the first social media game ever based on the Marvel brand, and it already has nearly 1.5 million daily players. Animal Kingdom Explorers is a popular game based on Disney's Animal Kingdom Park and builds on the hidden objects game success of Gardens of Time, which is now available on mobile platforms.
We just recently launched disneychannel.com, a new highly interactive, consumer-friendly site for kids and family. In a few weeks, we'll introduce our Disney video product, which includes a Disney YouTube family-friendly destination. And then later this year, we'll launch an all-new Disney.com.
So in closing, we're obviously pleased with the results in the quarter and thrilled with the reaction to Avengers, but we remain extremely excited about the future for all of our businesses.  We're seeing revenue increases in Media Networks, driven by the quality of our content and the consumer demand for it; we're welcoming more guests to our parks and resorts as a result of our expansions and enhanced experiences; and we're very optimistic about what's being developed and constructed for the years ahead.  And we're using characters and creativity from Disney, Pixar and Marvel to deliver extraordinary entertainment and drive franchises across our entire company. We're expanding the reach of our content and consumer access to it on a variety of new platforms, while we're dramatically expanding our international presence in the traditional and emerging markets around the world.
So here's Jay for the details about the quarter and some comments about current business trends. Jay?"

We delivered strong financial performance during the second fiscal quarter with operating income up 10% on a revenue growth of 6%. Earnings per share, excluding certain noncomparable items, were up 18%. These res",1502,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong financial performance during the second fiscal quarter with operating income up 10% on a revenue growth of 6%. Earnings per share, excluding certain noncomparable items, were up 18%. These results continue to demonstrate the success of our strategy, the strength of our company's assets, the unique competitive position and our ability to generate attractive returns on investment over the long term. 
I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing the second quarter in more detail and then highlight some factors that may influence our upcoming performance.  
In the second quarter, Media Networks was the largest contributor to our performance. Operating income growth for the segment was primarily driven by growth in Cable Networks, with ESPN and the domestic Disney Channels being the main drivers. 
ESPN's growth was due to higher affiliate and advertising revenues as well as lower affiliate revenue deferrals compared to the prior year. The growth in affiliate revenues were due to contractual rate increases. ESPN deferred $72 million less in revenue during the second quarter compared to last year. And I'll remind you that this change in ESPN's revenue recognition is related to Comcast affiliate revenue and has no impact on full year results.
ESPN's Q2 advertising revenue was up 14% compared to prior year and up an estimated 6% when adjusted for the timing of the Rose and Fiesta bowls and the impact of the NBA lockout. If you'll recall, the Rose and Fiesta Bowls aired during our second quarter this year, but those games fell in our first quarter last year. As I mentioned last quarter, despite the NBA lockout, ESPN aired the same number of regular-season NBA games as last year. However, the number of games per quarter was different. We have aired 9 more games during Q2 compared to prior year, and there are 20 additional NBA games during the third quarter compared to prior year. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales are pacing up high single digits.
Growth at the domestic Disney Channels was driven by higher affiliate revenue due to contractual rate increases and higher sales of Disney Channel programming. At ABC Family, the decision to further invest in original programming during the quarter is paying off as the network continues to resonate with viewers and advertisers. For the quarter, ABC Family prime time ratings were up 7% among adults 18 to 49. ABC also had 3 of the top 5 basic cable, scripted, original series among females 12 to 34: Pretty Little Liars, which was #1; Switched at Birth; and the Lying Game. ABC Family ad revenue was up 12% in the quarter, and that follows the 10% growth delivered last quarter. So far during the third quarter, ABC Family ad sales are pacing up 10%.
Reported cable margins, excluding our equity investments, were down 100 basis points in the quarter. However, this decline was due to a net negative impact of 170 basis points resulting from several noncomparable factors. On the positive side, we had the benefit of the change in the Comcast revenue deferral. On the negative side, there was the impact of the timing of the Rose and Fiesta bowls, the NBA schedule changes and the incremental expense we incurred for ABC Family programming and to launch our Japan broadcast satellite channel. On balance, the negative factors outweigh the positive factor, thus driving the net negative impact of 170 basis points.
At Broadcasting, the increase in operating income was the result of higher advertising revenue as well as lower programming and production costs. The increase in ad revenue was due to higher rates at the ABC network, partially offset by lower ad revenue at our owned stations. 
Ad revenue at the ABC network was up 6% during the quarter. Ad revenue at the stations was down 8% in the quarter. Excluding the Flint and Toledo stations, which we sold in Q3 last year, ad revenue at the stations was down 5%. Quarter-to-date, scatter pricing at the ABC network is running over 20% above upfront levels. Q3 TV station ad sales are pacing down low single digits. On the cost side, lower programming and production costs reflect the absence of the Oprah Winfrey Show at our owned stations as well as lower daytime and new production costs at the network.
At our Parks and Resorts -- our Parks and Resorts segment delivered another strong quarter with revenues up 10% and operating income up an impressive 53%. Operating income was higher at our domestic resorts, Tokyo Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by a decrease at Disneyland Paris. We saw continued improvement in segment margin store [ph] in the quarter, up more than 200 basis points compared to last year.
At our domestic parks, the increase in operating income was due to increased guest spending and attendance, partially offset by increased costs. For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 7%, and per capita spending was up 5% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending.
Average per-room spending at our domestic hotels was up 7%, while occupancy increased almost 2 percentage points to a little over 82%. The increase in per-room spending was driven by higher average daily rates. 
The results at our domestic parks and resorts confirm that our strategy of restoring pricing to normalized levels continues to pay off. During the quarter, we enjoyed growth in pricing and volume, both at our domestic parks and at our domestic resorts, with Disneyland setting a new Q2 attendance record, reflecting the success of our continued expansion of Disney's California Adventure. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 1%, while booked rates are up low single digits. Q3 bookings at the Disney Cruise Line are 30% higher than prior year with occupancy for the entire fleet now over 90%. 
At our international parks and resorts, better results from the Tokyo Disney Resort reflect the negative impact of the Tokyo earthquake during Q2 last year and the related business interruption insurance proceeds we received in Q2 this year.  We continue to enjoy strong performance at Hong Kong Disneyland with the park achieving Q2 records in revenue and attendance. The growth in operating income during the second quarter was due to increased guest spending and higher attendance. At Disneyland Paris, operating income was lower due to lower attendance and higher labor costs.
At Studio Entertainment, operating income declined in the quarter due to the performance of John Carter compared to prior year titles, which included Tangled and Mars Needs Moms as well as higher film impairments in the quarter driven by John Carter.
At Consumer Products, operating income was up for the quarter due to increased -- an increase in Merchandise Licensing, partially offset by lower results in our retail business. Growth in licensing was due to higher recognition of guaranteed shortfall revenue as well as higher merchandise sales. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 3%. 
At the Interactive Media segment, operating losses were lower compared to prior year due to improved results in our games business. Social games results benefited from the lower impact of acquisition accounting at Playdom as well as improved performance driven by higher revenue from Gardens of Time. The improvement at console games in the quarter was due to lower product development expenses as we continued to focus on developing fewer console games and more social games.
Turning to the third quarter, there are a number of items that will impact year-over-year comparisons. At ESPN, net deferred revenue recognition for Q3 will be $140 million lower than prior year since we no longer defer revenues from Comcast as part of our new deal. ESPN will also incur about $35 million in additional costs due to 20 extra NBA games in the quarter compared to last year. 
During the second quarter, NBCUniversal exercised an option that requires A&E Television Networks to purchase a substantial portion of NBCUniversal's 15.8% equity interest. The transaction is expected to close following determination of value of NBCUniversal's equity interest and will result in an increase in our equity interest in A&E, which, at the end of the second quarter, stood at approximately 42%. We expect to continue to account for our interest in AETN as an equity method investment. 
We continued to repurchase our stock during the second quarter by buying back 21.4 million shares for about $870 million, which is consistent with the pace during the second quarter last year. Fiscal year-to-date, we have purchased 51 million shares for $1.9 billion. 
We are pleased with our Q2 results and our current business momentum and the ongoing process of our growth initiatives and competitive position in our Media Networks. That, coupled with the strongest balance sheet in the industry, gives us great confidence that our strategy of managing the company for long-term success will continue to deliver returns to our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell for questions"

First of all, there was substantial amount of interest in the film among I'll call it the consumer products industry, more interest than some of its predecessor films, Thor and Captain America. But the interest was not commensurate with what we've already seen in terms of the success of the movie and the interest in the movie among audiences around the world. So what you basically have is you have extraordinary demand for the products that are on the shelves and, in many cases, product that's already been sold out. So our global licensing team is hard at work working with licensees and retailers around the world to stock the shelves as fast as possible. We expect, given the interest in this film, that demand for its product is going to continue to be strong pretty much throughout the year. But given the plan that we have for this film and the characters, it's our complete and -- or full intent to make sure that demand for consumer products continues. So as I mentioned in my calls, in 2013, you're going to see a sequel to Thor 2, and you're going to see Iron Man 3. In 2014, you're going to see a sequel to Captain America, and then eventually, a date to be determined, you'll see a sequel to Avengers and so on. The other thing that we're seeing is that interest in other characters like The Hulk for instance, is also strong. That had always been a decent merchandise product for Marvel in the past, but the presence of the character in this film and the performance of the actor, the popularity has actually grown significantly. So there's real demand for Hulk product in the marketplace right now. So I think what you're essentially seeing here is a true franchise not necessarily in the making but having been made and launched. And I -- the box office is only one part of it. There are multiple opportunities to continue to mine this great set of characters. And while it all started with a set of really good movies, we fully intend to continue to fuel the marketplace with Marvel's Avengers-related stories and characters so that the momentum continues."

They've got development in the works for a number of unnamed characters that are going to give us and Marvel the ability to make numerous films over the years ahead. So I don't think you'll see necessarily a need to buy back characters or all that much opportunity. On the licensing front, we're fully integrated internationally. Marvel used to use third parties frequently to represent them on the licensing side. We have a global licensing organization that we fully integrated with some really talented Marvel folks. And that, we believe, will not only -- has not only reduced costs because we're paying basically third-party representatives to handle licensing on behalf of Marvel, but we believe that the combined entity has a much more effective ability to gain access to the marketplace and increase our presence at retail. And with the quality of the films that Marvel is making, the interest in them -- that -- obviously increases that much more. No specifics, though, in terms of the percentage represented by international sales. Clearly, the box office side is really significant and should continue to be. This, we believe, will be the most successful Marvel film internationally, and that obviously will give us some great opportunities on the licensing front, too."

And our Imagineering group has been working over the last year. We've actually ramped it up more recently to create more opportunities for Marvel in the parks. I will note, by the way, I got a note from Tom Staggs earlier that all the Marvel product that we've been selling in our parks is pretty much off-the-shelves. So we're hard at work there. We control our pipeline product a little bit more. So we're hard at work replenishing the stuff on our shelves. But interest is clearly keen wherever our Marvel characters are touching the public."

We believe, Jessica, that this will give us an opportunity to increase length of stay. It also gives us some leverage on the ticket pricing side, which we hope to take advantage of. We just redid the Disneyland Hotel there. We did some expansion on -- the hotel was built when we opened California Adventure, the Grand Californian. But mostly on the vacation front side, we've not announced any plans to increase our hotel inventory there, but we do have the ability to do so either by expanding one of the existing hotels or building a new hotel.

So the quarter was pretty strong on international attendance. We are now -- I've always talked about the sort of 18% to 22% range of international attendance at Walt Disney World. And in fact, we're at the very high end of that range in the previous quarter. We've seen a lot of visitation from Brazil in particular, which is not a new market for us, but it -- but increasingly becomes an increasingly important market. Canada always stays an important market out here at Disneyland. We're also in the range there, pretty high, approaching 10% of the international visitation, lots of it from Asia. On the domestic side, domestic visitors outside of the state of Florida and outside of the state of California, we were relatively flat on the quarter versus prior year. And of course, because of all the new stuff we're doing, we're seeing a lot of -- a big pickup in resident attendance and a lot of demand on the Annual Pass programs, particularly out here on the West Coast. So we're very happy about what we're seeing, gives us, particularly at Disney's California Adventure, a very good feeling about what's to come when we finally drop the rope on that in mid-June. The -- your second question was about cash. I presume that you are asking about returns to shareholders, which we, of course, always talk about aggressively as part of our overall strategy. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are pacing at the same level with now about $2 billion worth of buybacks in the first half of the fiscal year. You'll remember last year we ended up buying back about $5 billion in the year. And that's not to be predictive, but we are always out there and opportunistically looking to make an investment in our own stock, and we will continue to do so as part of our fundamental strategy. I don't need to remind you that we increased our dividend significantly last year. Well, the board did. And of course, we will -- they will look at that again as we near the end of this year, our goal being to stay in the pack in terms of the yield that we pay against our stock.

So on a reported basis, cable revenue growth grew at over 10%, and ESPN grew almost at 12% in terms of affiliate fees. Of course, you have to adjust for the things I spoke about in my prepared remarks, the covenant-related Comcast deal, the other puts and takes that I mentioned. And if you do that, ESPN affiliate revenue was up high single digits in the quarter, which was comparable to the growth that we achieved in the first quarter.

And it's reflected in this quarter and will be reflected in 2012, where we continue on the path to deliver that. One way to do that was to decrease our investment in console games and increase our investment, or diversify our investment, to social and to mobile games. And I don't think that it would be fair to conclude that we've given social a priority, even though we purchased Playdom, to enable us to get more into that business. We've actually spent a fair amount of time and investment on mobile games and have had some considerable success, notably Where's My Water?, which, for a period of time, was the #1 downloaded mobile game on the iTunes platform ahead of another very popular game that involved birds. So we think that you're right that we see a dramatic increase in the time and money spent, particularly among our core demographic, on mobile platforms. We actually think that they are going to continue to penetrate the market more profoundly, particularly outside the United States, and our presence on that -- those platforms is very, very important. The other thing to note is that the development cost for both the social games and for the -- and the -- basically the production costs for social and the mobile games are relatively inexpensive. So in order for us to get to profitability, we have to reduce expenses, and one way to do that is to deemphasize console and emphasize the other. And I think that actually is timed right to the market because you're seeing such a dramatic increase in time and money spent on those other platforms."

Bob, are you still prognosticating making money in the Interactive business in fiscal '13? And the second one is, with the Rich Ross' departure, as you assess perhaps filling in that position or what have you, does any scenario go through your mind where upon you could imagine just not having any Chairman of the Studio at all? And the reason I say that is because it seems like the Marvel unit is kind of somewhat self-contained, they kind of run themselves, although there's obviously a lot of cooperation and symbiosis with your other businesses. Pixar's obviously run by John Lasseter. You maybe clearly need somebody to run sort of the Walt Disney Pictures label. But do you really need a Chairman of the Studio? It just seems like it's too many layers, and I'm wondering if you can comment on that."

You mentioned there are multiple entities, but the Studio markets and distributes those multiple entities and gets involved with many issues related to both the making of the movies at those individual units and the distribution and management of the -- of those movies, as well as the library and all the other aspects of the Studio that exist, like the live entertainment business, our Broadway plays and the music business.

They're enjoying great success. I believe that great success is solely the result of great programming. And there are a number of programs that are delivering those great ratings. We have been aggressive as a company at being present on new platforms because we believe that by and large, they create incremental revenue opportunities and thereby increase your interest in our programs and relevance. We also have managed our presence on these platforms very carefully because the digital media business is still nascent and certainly dynamic. It's changing right before our eyes. What we believe we've done is to strike a pretty good balance between protecting the core, or the traditional business and platforms, and taking advantage of new opportunities on new digital platforms, which also happens to give viewers more access to these programs, both from a time perspective and a place perspective, than they've ever had before. We have not seen any negative impact from the presence of Disney Channel shows on these new platforms. Most of them, by the way, are not available until after a season ends. And I think on the Netflix deal, there's only 4 that are. And what we found is that the product that is available on the linear channel through the multichannel provider is simply much richer, much more diverse and much more attractive to the consumer than what's available on the other platforms. Not that the other platforms, the new ones, aren't good. They are, but they pale in comparison in terms of how attractive they are to the consumer. So that's a long way of my saying that we feel good about the balance that we've struck, we're going to continue to look and watch very carefully. We believe it would be wrong for us to remove our product from these new media platforms, particularly as they grow, just as it would be wrong for us to be cavalier or reckless about the traditional business, which is delivering so much value to our company and our distributors. And that's why the Watch apps were created. It creates an unbelievable balance, as far as we're concerned, between protecting an old business and being aggressive about going after new opportunities. But again, going back of the Disney Channel, when you have great programming, you get great ratings, and you're just not that susceptible to the presence of those shows on other platforms."

They have managed to take advantage of certain opportunities, notably through the partnership in Asia with News Corp., in Latin America and selectively in Europe, particularly the U.K. They're going to continue to look at those opportunities with an eye toward determining whether they have the ability to grow or, in some cases, become profitable or, if not, potentially exit those markets. That's not to say they we're going to get out of international, but I think ESPN is likely to be selective about their presence there. It's tough going for them because they're frequently competing with local or locally owned and controlled platform owners that are going after sports almost as loss leaders to drive subscriptions to their platforms. And the absence of us owning true or traditional distribution in these markets, it's kind of tough to be as aggressive buying live sports. So the opportunities for ESPN internationally, I think, are somewhat limited. Not to say that they're -- they don't exist, but it's never going to be a big part of ESPN's business."

We're very pleased with the company's strong performance in the second quarter with earnings per share up 18% over last year when adjusted for comparability. Growth in advertising and affiliate fees in Media Networks as well as greater attendance and guest spending in our parks and resorts primarily drove our performance. 
There are many exciting things happening across our businesses starting with The Avengers, which, as all of you know, shattered industry box office records, achieving the biggest domestic opening weekend of all time with $207.1 million. The movie set new opening weekend records in several other countries as well, bringing its worldwide box office gross to more than $700 million to date.  
It's a fantastic movie, and we're obviously thrilled that audiences around the world share that opinion. It's also a great illustration of why we like Marvel so much: great characters, great storytelling and the wonderful ability for them to bring their characters and stories to the big screen so effectively. Ironman, Thor and Captain America initially brought those compelling characters to millions of people, leading to the tremendous success we're now seeing with The Avengers. And we'll continue to build on this incredible franchise with the release of Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 next year, followed by Captain America 2 in 2014. And since I'm sure I will be asked, yes, we are in development on a sequel to Avengers. 
There’re obviously numerous benefits to creating such a valuable franchise, and one of them is in our Consumer Products business, where our combined Disney-Marvel licensing team is hard at work bringing those characters to market in multiple ways, significantly growing our retail presence around the world. And based on early figures, the demand for Avengers merchandise has been very strong.
We actually have a lot of other great new movies on the way as well, starting with Disney/Pixar's BRAVE, a brilliant action-adventure featuring Pixar's first female hero. And then later this year, we're looking forward to Frankenweenie, Tim Burton's heartwarming twist on the classic monster movie, as well as Disney Animation's Wreck-It Ralph, which takes viewers into the world of classic video arcade games. And next year, we've got Oz The Great and Powerful, as well as Johnny Depp's Tonto in The Lone Ranger and a Monsters, Inc. prequel from Disney-Pixar.
We've also got plenty to be excited about in our other businesses. Our media networks, ESPN, Disney Channels, ABC, ABC Family [ph] plus our equity stakes in A&E, History and Lifetime [ph] , represent an incredibly valuable growth-driving segment for us with multiple revenue streams supported by strong, high-quality, creative content leveraged across territories and on many new digital platforms.
It's almost a cliché to mention ESPN as the strongest brand in media, but it continues to strengthen and to grow. And in 2011, more adults 18 to 49 watched ESPN than any other 24-hour cable network. And fans are spending more time with ESPN-branded media on TV, online and on a variety of mobile devices than any other sports brand.
ESPN delivers tremendous value to distributors with an unparalleled content array that helps to drive broadband subscriptions, local ad sales and HD upgrades. And with numerous sports rights agreements in place into the next decade, including the NFL, the ACC, the SEC, Pac-12 and Wimbledon, and long-term agreements in place with 2 of the largest multichannel providers, ESPN is obviously quite well positioned to remain the preeminent sports brand.  
It's also worthy of noting that as of today, Comcast subscribers can download the WatchESPN app that brings the total number of subscribers that can now access ESPN's channel on mobile devices to 40 million.
While we had mentioned the Disney Channel on these calls on numerous occasions, we thought it was time to put its accomplishments in perspective. With 103 channels in 167 countries right now, Disney Channel is our biggest and most effective global brand builder and content engine, taking Disney into hundreds of millions of homes every day. And the list of markets where we are in continues to expand, sometimes in pretty dramatic ways. An example of this is in Russia, where we launched a free-to-air channel in January to excellent ratings, and it's just the beginning.
Here in the U.S., Disney Channel is a top destination for kids and tweens. And for the last 3 months, it has been the #1 network among kids 2 to 11, supported by 3 of the top 10 shows among that essential audience. 
Original programming is also driving the success of Disney Junior, where we've got the top preschooler shows, including Jake and the Neverland Pirates and our newest animated hit, Doc McStuffins. 
And after achieving record ratings again last year, Disney XD's core audience continues to grow, drawn by the exciting programming that defines that brand. 
So when you think about this collection of Disney-branded channels, consider their strength in terms of program quality, program success, reach, brand building effectiveness and financial growth.
And rounding out our cable portfolio, ABC Family continues to build on its eighth consecutive years of growth with an ambitious slate of original programming. The channel is not only popular with Millennials [ph] , it's currently the #3 cable network in all key female demos. And the same high-quality, original content that draws audiences to ABC Family here in the U.S. is now being sold into several hundred markets around the world.
On the network side, we're a week away from the ABC upfront where we'll introduce our shows for next season, and we're anticipating a strong upfront marketplace. And we're very impressed by the quality of our pilots, particularly those from ABC Studios. We're building on the strength of our current schedule, with ABC-owned Grey's Anatomy [ph], the #1 drama, and Once Upon a Time, the #1 new drama, as well as television's #1 comedy, Modern Family [ph], and Revenge, one of the season's top new series.
With strong demand for our content around the world, we're currently selling ABC programming into more than 225 international markets, and our success has allowed us to presell our new series globally often before they air on the network. 
Our ABC Studios business is meaningful. Revenue from domestic and international syndication and digital sales will reach an all-time high this year and has grown 25% per year over the past decade.
As we've articulated on numerous occasions, global expansion remains a key part of our strategy, and China is a top priority for us. During my recent visit to China, I met with Vice President Xi Jinping about our current initiatives and future opportunities. I was very encouraged by his support and enthusiasm for our plans, especially Shanghai Disney Resort, which is a critical investment for our long-term growth there. The Shanghai Disney Resort site is fully cleared, and the land has been prepared for construction. And visiting the site the week before last gave us a visual validation of just how vast and how significant this project is for us.
We have several investments in our Parks and Resorts now coming online or near completion, all of which we're very optimistic about. Our expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland is also proceeding nicely and features 3 new themed areas, including the hugely popular Toy Story Land, which we opened in 2011, as well as Grizzly Gulch, which comes online later this year.  And we're happy with the progress of Hong Kong Disneyland as well as the fact that it just had another great quarter.
California Adventure, we're looking forward to the June 15 opening of Cars Land, an incredible 12-acre addition that transports guests right into the world of Radiator Springs. And with 3 new attractions and theme restaurants, Cars Land is the culmination of the expansion we started with Toy Story Mania!, Little Mermaid and the spectacular World of Color. I believe the completion will result in a park that will both stand on its own but also serve as an important and worthy neighbor to Disneyland and finally enable the 2 to become the destination resort we once envisioned.
And lastly, on the cruise ship front, we recently launched the Disney Fantasy, the sister ship to the Dream, which sets sail in 2011, and the 2 new ships have proven to be extremely popular with strong bookings. A few of us had the chance to sail on the Fantasy's maiden voyage with over 3,000 other guests, and the ship is visually stunning, the sailing experience truly wonderful. It's impossible to fully explain just how magnificent this ship really is. The quality, the service and the attention to the very smallest details create the kind of extraordinary family vacation that only Disney can provide. And by the way, a lot of the people on that first maiden voyage reserved future trips.
So as you can see, in Parks and Resorts, many of our long-term investments are now coming to fruition, driving increased performance and positioning us for future growth.
Our commitment to creative excellence is also evident on Broadway. The Lion King is now the top-grossing Broadway production of all time, and our 2 newest productions, Newsies and Peter and the Starcatcher, just turned an impressive 17 Tony nominations. 
I also want to mention our Disney Interactive team who are also leveraging creative content from our lines of business to generate games and other interactive content. Marvel: Avengers Alliance is the first social media game ever based on the Marvel brand, and it already has nearly 1.5 million daily players. Animal Kingdom Explorers is a popular game based on Disney's Animal Kingdom Park and builds on the hidden objects game success of Gardens of Time, which is now available on mobile platforms.
We just recently launched disneychannel.com, a new highly interactive, consumer-friendly site for kids and family. In a few weeks, we'll introduce our Disney video product, which includes a Disney YouTube family-friendly destination. And then later this year, we'll launch an all-new Disney.com.
So in closing, we're obviously pleased with the results in the quarter and thrilled with the reaction to Avengers, but we remain extremely excited about the future for all of our businesses.  We're seeing revenue increases in Media Networks, driven by the quality of our content and the consumer demand for it; we're welcoming more guests to our parks and resorts as a result of our expansions and enhanced experiences; and we're very optimistic about what's being developed and constructed for the years ahead.  And we're using characters and creativity from Disney, Pixar and Marvel to deliver extraordinary entertainment and drive franchises across our entire company. We're expanding the reach of our content and consumer access to it on a variety of new platforms, while we're dramatically expanding our international presence in the traditional and emerging markets around the world.
So here's Jay for the details about the quarter and some comments about current business trends. Jay?"

We delivered strong financial performance during the second fiscal quarter with operating income up 10% on a revenue growth of 6%. Earnings per share, excluding certain noncomparable items, were up 18%. These res",1502,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong financial performance during the second fiscal quarter with operating income up 10% on a revenue growth of 6%. Earnings per share, excluding certain noncomparable items, were up 18%. These results continue to demonstrate the success of our strategy, the strength of our company's assets, the unique competitive position and our ability to generate attractive returns on investment over the long term. 
I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing the second quarter in more detail and then highlight some factors that may influence our upcoming performance.  
In the second quarter, Media Networks was the largest contributor to our performance. Operating income growth for the segment was primarily driven by growth in Cable Networks, with ESPN and the domestic Disney Channels being the main drivers. 
ESPN's growth was due to higher affiliate and advertising revenues as well as lower affiliate revenue deferrals compared to the prior year. The growth in affiliate revenues were due to contractual rate increases. ESPN deferred $72 million less in revenue during the second quarter compared to last year. And I'll remind you that this change in ESPN's revenue recognition is related to Comcast affiliate revenue and has no impact on full year results.
ESPN's Q2 advertising revenue was up 14% compared to prior year and up an estimated 6% when adjusted for the timing of the Rose and Fiesta bowls and the impact of the NBA lockout. If you'll recall, the Rose and Fiesta Bowls aired during our second quarter this year, but those games fell in our first quarter last year. As I mentioned last quarter, despite the NBA lockout, ESPN aired the same number of regular-season NBA games as last year. However, the number of games per quarter was different. We have aired 9 more games during Q2 compared to prior year, and there are 20 additional NBA games during the third quarter compared to prior year. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales are pacing up high single digits.
Growth at the domestic Disney Channels was driven by higher affiliate revenue due to contractual rate increases and higher sales of Disney Channel programming. At ABC Family, the decision to further invest in original programming during the quarter is paying off as the network continues to resonate with viewers and advertisers. For the quarter, ABC Family prime time ratings were up 7% among adults 18 to 49. ABC also had 3 of the top 5 basic cable, scripted, original series among females 12 to 34: Pretty Little Liars, which was #1; Switched at Birth; and the Lying Game. ABC Family ad revenue was up 12% in the quarter, and that follows the 10% growth delivered last quarter. So far during the third quarter, ABC Family ad sales are pacing up 10%.
Reported cable margins, excluding our equity investments, were down 100 basis points in the quarter. However, this decline was due to a net negative impact of 170 basis points resulting from several noncomparable factors. On the positive side, we had the benefit of the change in the Comcast revenue deferral. On the negative side, there was the impact of the timing of the Rose and Fiesta bowls, the NBA schedule changes and the incremental expense we incurred for ABC Family programming and to launch our Japan broadcast satellite channel. On balance, the negative factors outweigh the positive factor, thus driving the net negative impact of 170 basis points.
At Broadcasting, the increase in operating income was the result of higher advertising revenue as well as lower programming and production costs. The increase in ad revenue was due to higher rates at the ABC network, partially offset by lower ad revenue at our owned stations. 
Ad revenue at the ABC network was up 6% during the quarter. Ad revenue at the stations was down 8% in the quarter. Excluding the Flint and Toledo stations, which we sold in Q3 last year, ad revenue at the stations was down 5%. Quarter-to-date, scatter pricing at the ABC network is running over 20% above upfront levels. Q3 TV station ad sales are pacing down low single digits. On the cost side, lower programming and production costs reflect the absence of the Oprah Winfrey Show at our owned stations as well as lower daytime and new production costs at the network.
At our Parks and Resorts -- our Parks and Resorts segment delivered another strong quarter with revenues up 10% and operating income up an impressive 53%. Operating income was higher at our domestic resorts, Tokyo Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by a decrease at Disneyland Paris. We saw continued improvement in segment margin store [ph] in the quarter, up more than 200 basis points compared to last year.
At our domestic parks, the increase in operating income was due to increased guest spending and attendance, partially offset by increased costs. For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 7%, and per capita spending was up 5% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending.
Average per-room spending at our domestic hotels was up 7%, while occupancy increased almost 2 percentage points to a little over 82%. The increase in per-room spending was driven by higher average daily rates. 
The results at our domestic parks and resorts confirm that our strategy of restoring pricing to normalized levels continues to pay off. During the quarter, we enjoyed growth in pricing and volume, both at our domestic parks and at our domestic resorts, with Disneyland setting a new Q2 attendance record, reflecting the success of our continued expansion of Disney's California Adventure. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 1%, while booked rates are up low single digits. Q3 bookings at the Disney Cruise Line are 30% higher than prior year with occupancy for the entire fleet now over 90%. 
At our international parks and resorts, better results from the Tokyo Disney Resort reflect the negative impact of the Tokyo earthquake during Q2 last year and the related business interruption insurance proceeds we received in Q2 this year. We continue to enjoy strong performance at Hong Kong Disneyland with the park achieving Q2 records in revenue and attendance. The growth in operating income during the second quarter was due to increased guest spending and higher attendance. At Disneyland Paris, operating income was lower due to lower attendance and higher labor costs.
At Studio Entertainment, operating income declined in the quarter due to the performance of John Carter compared to prior year titles, which included Tangled and Mars Needs Moms as well as higher film impairments in the quarter driven by John Carter.
At Consumer Products, operating income was up for the quarter due to increased -- an increase in Merchandise Licensing, partially offset by lower results in our retail business. Growth in licensing was due to higher recognition of guaranteed shortfall revenue as well as higher merchandise sales. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 3%. 
At the Interactive Media segment, operating losses were lower compared to prior year due to improved results in our games business. Social games results benefited from the lower impact of acquisition accounting at Playdom, as well as improved performance driven by higher revenue from Gardens of Time. The improvement at console games in the quarter was due to lower product development expenses as we continued to focus on developing fewer console games and more social games.
Turning to the third quarter, there are a number of items that will impact year-over-year comparisons. At ESPN, net deferred revenue recognition for Q3 will be $140 million lower than prior year since we no longer defer revenues from Comcast as part of our new deal. ESPN will also incur about $35 million in additional costs due to 20 extra NBA games in the quarter compared to last year. 
During the second quarter, NBCUniversal exercised an option that requires A&E Television Networks to purchase a substantial portion of NBCUniversal's 15.8% equity interest. The transaction is expected to close following determination of value of NBCUniversal's equity interest and will result in an increase in our equity interest in A&E, which, at the end of the second quarter, stood at approximately 42%. We expect to continue to account for our interest in AETN as an equity method investment. 
We continued to repurchase our stock during the second quarter by buying back 21.4 million shares for about $870 million, which is consistent with the pace during the second quarter last year. Fiscal year-to-date, we have purchased 51 million shares for $1.9 billion. 
We are pleased with our Q2 results and our current business momentum and the ongoing process of our growth initiatives and competitive position in our Media Networks. That, coupled with the strongest balance sheet in the industry, gives us great confidence that our strategy of managing the company for long-term success will continue to deliver returns to our shareholders.

First of all, there was substantial amount of interest in the film among I'll call it the consumer products industry, more interest than some of its predecessor films, Thor and Captain America. But the interest was not commensurate with what we've already seen in terms of the success of the movie and the interest in the movie among audiences around the world. So what you basically have is you have extraordinary demand for the products that are on the shelves and, in many cases, product that's already been sold out. So our global licensing team is hard at work working with licensees and retailers around the world to stock the shelves as fast as possible. We expect, given the interest in this film, that demand for its product is going to continue to be strong pretty much throughout the year. But given the plan that we have for this film and the characters, it's our complete and -- or full intent to make sure that demand for consumer products continues. So as I mentioned in my calls, in 2013, you're going to see a sequel to Thor 2, and you're going to see Iron Man 3. In 2014, you're going to see a sequel to Captain America, and then eventually, a date to be determined, you'll see a sequel to Avengers and so on. The other thing that we're seeing is that interest in other characters like The Hulk for instance, is also strong. That had always been a decent merchandise product for Marvel in the past, but the presence of the character in this film and the performance of the actor, the popularity has actually grown significantly. So there's real demand for Hulk product in the marketplace right now. So I think what you're essentially seeing here is a true franchise not necessarily in the making but having been made and launched. And I -- the box office is only one part of it. There are multiple opportunities to continue to mine this great set of characters. And while it all started with a set of really good movies, we fully intend to continue to fuel the marketplace with Marvel's Avengers-related stories and characters so that the momentum continues."

The first is if you look at Marvel holistically in terms of the licensing opportunity, I think one of the big synergy opportunities from the acquisition that you talked about in the past is driving higher penetration abroad for the Marvel licensing and the characters. So I was wondering if you could just update us on where is that today. I think back pre-acquisition, 40% of Marvel's licensing revenue was international. Where is that today? And then secondly, as you look at the portfolio of characters, would you consider buying back the film rights to some of the other characters, say, like X-Men from FOX?"

Marvel's got a slew of great characters to mine, and we'll continue to do that. They've got development in the works for a number of unnamed characters that are going to give us and Marvel the ability to make numerous films over the years ahead. So I don't think you'll see necessarily a need to buy back characters or all that much opportunity. On the licensing front, we're fully integrated internationally. Marvel used to use third parties frequently to represent them on the licensing side. We have a global licensing organization that we fully integrated with some really talented Marvel folks. And that, we believe, will not only -- has not only reduced costs because we're paying basically third-party representatives to handle licensing on behalf of Marvel, but we believe that the combined entity has a much more effective ability to gain access to the marketplace and increase our presence at retail. And with the quality of the films that Marvel is making, the interest in them -- that -- obviously increases that much more. No specifics, though, in terms of the percentage represented by international sales. Clearly, the box office side is really significant and should continue to be. This, we believe, will be the most successful Marvel film internationally, and that obviously will give us some great opportunities on the licensing front, too."

We just redid the Disneyland Hotel there. We did some expansion on -- the hotel was built when we opened California Adventure, the Grand Californian.

So the quarter was pretty strong on international attendance. We are now -- I've always talked about the sort of 18% to 22% range of international attendance at Walt Disney World. And in fact, we're at the very high end of that range in the previous quarter. We've seen a lot of visitation from Brazil in particular, which is not a new market for us, but it -- but increasingly becomes an increasingly important market. Canada always stays an important market out here at Disneyland. We're also in the range there, pretty high, approaching 10% of international visitation, lots of it from Asia. On the domestic side, domestic visitors outside of the state of Florida and outside of the state of California, we were relatively flat on the quarter versus prior year. And of course, because of all the new stuff we're doing, we're seeing a lot of -- a big pickup in resident attendance and a lot of demand on the Annual Pass programs, particularly out here on the West Coast. So we're very happy about what we're seeing, gives us, particularly at Disney's California Adventure, a very good feeling about what's to come when we finally drop the rope on that in mid-June. The -- your second question was about cash. I presume that you are asking about returns to shareholders, which we, of course, always talk about aggressively as part of our overall strategy. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are pacing at the same level with now about $2 billion worth of buybacks in the first half of the fiscal year. You'll remember last year we ended up buying back about $5 billion in the year. And that's not to be predictive, but we are always out there and opportunistically looking to make an investment in our own stock, and we will continue to do so as part of our fundamental strategy. I don't need to remind you that we increased our dividend significantly last year. Well, the board did. And of course, we will -- they will look at that again as we near the end of this year, our goal being to stay in the pack in terms of the yield that we pay against our stock.

Of course, you have to adjust for the things I spoke about in my prepared remarks, the covenant-related Comcast deal, the other puts and takes that I mentioned.

And it's reflected in this quarter and will be reflected in 2012, where we continue on the path to deliver that. One way to do that was to decrease our investment in console games and increase our investment, or diversify our investment, to social and to mobile games. And I don't think that it would be fair to conclude that we've given social a priority, even though we purchased Playdom, to enable us to get more into that business. We've actually spent a fair amount of time and investment on mobile games and have had some considerable success, notably Where's My Water?, which, for a period of time, was the #1 downloaded mobile game on the iTunes platform ahead of another very popular game that involved birds. So we think that you're right that we see a dramatic increase in the time and money spent, particularly among our core demographic, on mobile platforms. We actually think that they are going to continue to penetrate the market more profoundly, particularly outside the United States, and our presence on that -- those platforms is very, very important. The other thing to note is that the development cost for both the social games and for the -- and the -- basically the production costs for social and the mobile games are relatively inexpensive. So in order for us to get to profitability, we have to reduce expenses, and one way to do that is to deemphasize console and emphasize the other.

I think you're going to see continued consumption of particularly film entertainment on tablets around the world. And that's great for us. We are hard at work at creating a set of apps to enable subscribers of multichannel services to watch these channels on these mobile or tablet devices as well as smartphones. I mentioned in my call we launched ESPN today to Comcast subscribers. And we're going to be launching apps for subscribers of the Disney Channel in June, and that's a big deal because suddenly, you'll be able to watch all this programming, both streamed live but also on an on-demand basis, on these devices provided you're a subscriber. What that does is it pays us incremental money in terms of the money that we're being paid by the multichannel providers. It also helps protect the value of that product to the distributors and increases the value of the product to the subscribers. And it does give us additional opportunities to either up-sell other product or to sell advertising in certain cases. I can't, at this point, give you some -- an estimate on just what the upside could be, but we clearly believe that we're going to increase engagement with our programming on multiple fronts, ESPN, all the Disney channel programming, ABC and ABC Family.

They're enjoying great success. I believe that great success is solely the result of great programming. And there are a number of programs that are delivering those great ratings. We have been aggressive as a company at being present on new platforms because we believe that by and large, they create incremental revenue opportunities and thereby increase your interest in our programs and relevance. We also have managed our presence on these platforms very carefully because the digital media business is still nascent and certainly dynamic. It's changing right before our eyes. What we believe we've done is to strike a pretty good balance between protecting the core, or the traditional business and platforms, and taking advantage of new opportunities on new digital platforms, which also happens to give viewers more access to these programs, both from a time perspective and a place perspective, than they've ever had before. We have not seen any negative impact from the presence of Disney Channel shows on these new platforms. Most of them, by the way, are not available until after a season ends. And I think on the Netflix deal, there's only 4 that are. And what we found is that the product that is available on the linear channel through the multichannel provider is simply much richer, much more diverse and much more attractive to the consumer than what's available on the other platforms. Not that the other platforms, the new ones, aren't good. They are, but they pale in comparison in terms of how attractive they are to the consumer. So that's a long way of my saying that we feel good about the balance that we've struck, we're going to continue to look and watch very carefully. We believe it would be wrong for us to remove our product from these new media platforms, particularly as they grow, just as it would be wrong for us to be cavalier or reckless about the traditional business, which is delivering so much value to our company and our distributors. And that's why the Watch apps were created. It creates an unbelievable balance, as far as we're concerned, between protecting an old business and being aggressive about going after new opportunities. But again, going back of the Disney Channel, when you have great programming, you get great ratings, and you're just not that susceptible to the presence of those shows on other platforms."

They have managed to take advantage of certain opportunities, notably through the partnership in Asia with News Corp., in Latin America and selectively in Europe, particularly the U.K. They're going to continue to look at those opportunities with an eye toward determining whether they have the ability to grow or, in some cases, become profitable or, if not, potentially exit those markets. That's not to say they we're going to get out of international, but I think ESPN is likely to be selective about their presence there. It's tough going for them because they're frequently competing with local or locally owned and controlled platform owners that are going after sports almost as loss leaders to drive subscriptions to their platforms. And the absence of us owning true or traditional distribution in these markets, it's kind of tough to be as aggressive buying live sports. So the opportunities for ESPN internationally, I think, are somewhat limited. Not to say that they're -- they don't exist, but it's never going to be a big part of ESPN's business."

We had a phenomenal third quarter delivering the largest quarterly earnings in the history of our company. Earnings per share were up 31% over the last year driven by growth in every one of our businesses. We also delivered record earnings per share for the first nine months of our fiscal year and we believe that our results clearly demonstrate Disney’s unique value proposition and great potential to deliver long-term growth.
Before Jay gets into the specifics about our quarter, I’d like to spend a few minutes talking about the status of our capital spending in our parks and resorts as well as some of the acquisitions we made in the last few years especially Marvel. These things are relevant to our Q3 results and we will factor into our future performance as well. 
As you know, we’ve made significant investments in our parks and resorts over the past several years to create an even greater Disney experience for our guests and to drive long-term goals. These include completely transforming Disney California Adventure, expanding Disney’s fleet of cruise ships and enhancing and increasing the size of Fantasyland at Walt Disney World.
California Adventure is now an exceptional park in its own right and the perfect neighbor to Disneyland. Since the June opening of the phenomenal Cars Land and the brand new Main Street, attended has been up along with guest satisfaction. In fact, Disneyland Resort had new Q3 attendance record and on most days since our reopening California Adventure has been drawing nearly 50% of the total attendance to the overall Disneyland Resort and that’s up from roughly 25% in the past.
The successful launch of the Disney Fantasy in March and the Disney Dream the year before more than doubled the guest capacity of our cruise business. These amazing new ships deliver an extraordinary cruise experience and they both began contributing to operating income in their first full quarter of operation.
Our cruise ship bookings are currently at 94% occupancy for the year. Meanwhile, our multi-faceted expansion of Fantasyland has begun in Orlando, it's the most popular land and our most popular park and this will be the largest expansion in the magic kingdom since Walt Disney World opened more than 40 years ago. We will complete this particular project in 2014; however, the bulk of our capital investment will be made by the end of the current fiscal year.
In fact with these significant investments behind us, this will be the peak year for our capital expenditures in our domestic parks and resorts business. Going forward we expect each one of these projects to deliver strong returns on invested capital that will exceed our hurdle rate and drive improvement in our overall returns. 
On the international front, we have also invested in expanding Hong Kong Disneyland. Two of three new themed areas are already open and the third will open next spring. Attendance revenue and operating income for the park were all up again this quarter. Park actually set a new Q3 record for both attendance and revenue. And our investment in Shanghai Disneyland will continue to ramp to it's opening. As I have said many times before, this is the most exciting international project in the history of our company and it's certainly the biggest investment we have ever made outside the United States. 
Turning to our acquisitions. In Q3, we released two fantastic movies that demonstrate the incredible creativity and value of both Pixar and Marvel. Brave is Disney-Pixar’s 13th consecutive movie to open at number one here in the U.S. It grossed about $225 million domestically and is yet to open on some key international markets including UK and Spain.
And Marvel’s the Avengers has grossed almost $1.5 billion in box-office worldwide making it the third highest grossing movie of all time. It's also an important new franchise for us as Disney Interactive, Disney Channels Worldwide, ABC Studios and Disney Consumer Products are all working to leverage the power of the Avengers to create greater value.
We acquired Marvel in 2009 and with its multitude of exciting characters and as with Pixar we are confident that Marvel will be able to create original content and build franchises around these great characters to drive significant value across our company. 
The releases of Thor and Captain America last year built on the momentum from the first two Iron Man movies; combine these two movies grossed more than 800 million in global box-office and led to the phenomenal success of Marvel’s The Avengers. 
When Marvel took the stage at Comic-Con last month to announce the new slated films that will keep the momentum going, the reaction was huge. Iron Man 3 opens on May 3, 2013 followed by Thor: The Dark World in November of next year. Captain America: The Winter Soldier will be in theaters in April of ‘14 and as I mentioned in our last call is the sequel to Marvel’s The Avengers in the works. In fact Marvel has just signed Joss Whedon to exclusive deal and he will write and direct Avengers 2 and help develop a Marvel based series for ABC.
So, as you can see Disney has a unique ability to generate new opportunities and drive significant value from great creative content. Disney, Pixar and Marvel have the incredible characters and compelling stories that people connect to, the time we have proven we can build strong long lasting franchises upon. 
Our acquisitions give us more than extraordinary creative content, the creative cultures, unique talent, new perspectives and commitment to excellence at Pixar and marvel are now contributing to our company’s strength and along with ESPN and ABC they are creating new opportunities in numerous ways. With some of the world’s strongest brands, greatest creative talent and incredibly valuable assets, Disney has never been better positioned to create continued long-term growth.
And with that I will ask Jay to give you the details of our Q3 performance and then we will be back to take your questions.

We delivered an exceptional quarter with segment operating income up 18% and earnings per share of $1.01 up 31% over prior year. There is a great momentum at our company as evidenced by these results which I’m now going to spend a few minutes discussing in more detail then I’ll highlight some factors that may influence our upcoming performance.
In the third quarter, the Studio segment was the largest contributor to growth in operating income driven primarily by the tremendous worldwide box-office results of Marvel’s The Avengers. Television distribution results were also higher, but this was offset by a decrease in worldwide Home Entertainment. The success of Marvel’s The Avengers speaks for itself. It's a phenomenal film that dominated the box-office in every market in which it opened so we look forward to the opening of the film next week in Japan.
As we look to the balance of the year and fiscal 2013, we are excited about how robust release slate. On the animation side, Pixar will release two of its animated classics in 3D for the first time, Finding Nemo in September and Monsters Incorporated in December which sets the stage for Pixar’s next big film Monsters University, which will be released next June.
We will also release Tim Burton’s Frankenweenie in October and Disney Animation’s Wreck-It Ralph in November. On the live-action front, we will release a number of highly anticipated films in 2013 including Oz The Great and Powerful in March, Iron Man 3 in May and The Lone Ranger in July.
Results from television distribution were driven by higher sales of our films in international markets compared to the prior year. The decline in home entertainment results was due to lower unit sales in the third quarter including lower performance of key titles by John Carter and The Muppets compared on Tron, Tangled and Gnomeo & Juliet which were released in the prior year.
Operating income growth for the Media Networks segment was driven by growth in both Cable Networks and Broadcasting. At Cable Networks, Disney Channel was the primary driver. Growth at domestic Disney Channel was driven by higher affiliate revenue due to contractual rate increases. Disney Channel continues to build and enhance brand awareness for Disney around the world, so we could not be more pleased with its recent success. Disney Channel is stronger today than ever with strength across all of its networks. In Q3, Disney Channel was the number one network with kids 2 to 11 and tweens 9 to 14. As of last week, Disney Channel had been number one with kids 2 to 11 for nine consecutive weeks. Disney XD had its highest rated third quarter ever with kids 6 to 11 and tweens 9 to 14. 
Our newest network, Disney Junior which we launched in March is already in 55 million homes followed by our recent agreement that brought the network to DIRECTV’s customers. In June of this year, we launched the suite of Disney Channel apps with Comcast, Watch Disney Channel, Watch Disney XD and Watch Disney Junior which gives their subscribers access to live linear feeds of those networks in addition to a host of on-demand programming. This suite of services further strengthens our relationship with consumers by enhancing the value of their multichannel subscriptions.
ESPN’s operating income was down in the quarter due to lower recognition of deferred affiliate revenue compared to prior year. If you recall, ESPN did not defer any Comcast revenue during Q1 and Q2. So this quarter, ESPN recognized $139 million less in deferred revenue related to its Comcast agreement than in the prior year. 
I'll remind you the deferral issue nearly relates to timing of revenue recognition and has no impact on full-year results. Excluding this impact, ESPN’s growth in affiliate rates subscribers and advertising revenue was more than offset an increase in programming and production costs. Programming and production costs were higher due to the airing of additional NBA games compared to Q3 last year as well as higher contractual rates for NBA and Major League Baseball programming.
ESPN ad revenue was up mid-teen percentage points compared to last year driven by higher rates, unit sales, and ratings. Viewership of the ESPN network continue to grow during the quarter as ratings were up over 16% due to our coverage of the UEFA 2012 championship, more NBA games and increased viewership of SportsCenter and U.S. Open Golf.
Reported cable margins excluding our equity investments were down 70 basis points due primarily to lower affiliate revenue recognition from Comcast. This revenue recognition change associated with Comcast affiliate revenue and an adverse impact on cable margins of approximately 220 basis points. 
At Broadcasting, the increase in operating income was a result of higher affiliate and royalty revenue and lower programming and production costs at our owned stations partially offset by a decrease in ad revenue at the ABC Network. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was down modestly as higher CPMs were more than offset by lower ratings in a quarter. Ad revenue at the stations was comparable to prior year.
Quarter-to-date scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running mid-teens above upfront levels. At ESPN ad sales are pacing down modestly. Our advertising business has been impacted in the last couple of weeks by the Olympics. However, we are very pleased with the strong demand ABC and ESPN enjoyed in the upfront, which is evidenced in the advertiser demand for our networks remains strong.
Our Parks and Resorts segment delivered another strong quarter with revenue up 9% and operating income up 21%. The increase in operating income was due to growth at Tokyo Disney Resort, Disney Cruise Line and our domestic resorts. We saw continued improvement in segment margins during the quarter, up more than 190 basis points compared to last year. Results from the Tokyo Disney Resort continue to improve reflecting the negative impact of the Japan earthquake on last year’s Q3 results and the related business interruption insurance proceeds we received in Q3 this year. I’d also note that Hong Kong Disneyland’s operating income grew in the quarter due to increased guest spending and higher attendance. 
Disney Cruise Line results were higher due to the launch of the Disney Fantasy in late March. At our domestic parks, the increase in operating income was due to increased guest spending and attendance, partially offset by increased cost. For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 1% and per capita spending was up 8% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending. Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6% driven by higher average daily rates.
Occupancy decreased 1.5 points to 79% while occupied room nights were comparable to prior year, domestic inventory increased versus prior year, due to the opening of Ahwahnee and Disney's Art of Animation Resorts. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 1% while book rates are up 4%. Booking at the Disney Cruise Line are 38% higher than prior year with occupancy for the entire fleet at 94% for the year.
At Consumer Products, operating income was up in the quarter due to an increase in merchandise licensing. Growth in licensing was due to lower revenue share with the studio compared to prior year and higher revenue in Japan. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was down modestly. We are pleased with the sale of Avengers merchandise and the early sell-in of Spiderman, but faced a difficult comparison given the performance of Cars merchandise last year.
At the Interactive segment, we continue to make steady progress with lower operating costs in the quarter compared to prior year due to improved results in our games business. Social games results continued to benefit from lower impact of acquisition accounting for Playdom as well as improved performance driven by the success of Gardens of Time. Results of our console games business were comparable to the prior-year.
During the quarter, A&E Television Networks agreed to redeem NBCUniversal’s entire 15.8% equity interest in A&E for approximately $3 billion. 2.5 billion of this purchase price represents the enterprise value of NBC used equity interest in A&E and the balance represents the value of tax benefits expected to be generated as a result of the transaction. We are very pleased with the price A&E will pay to redeem this stake. We expect the transaction to close by the end of calendar 2012 at which point our ownership stake in A&E will increase to 50%.
Turning to the fourth quarter, there are couple of items I’d like to highlight that will impact year-over-year comparisons. ESPN will incur more than $100 million in incremental programming and production costs due primarily to contractual increases for College Football and Major League Baseball as well as higher costs associated with our new contracts for the Pac-12 and Wimbledon.
At Disney Interactive, while year-to-date results have improved over prior year, we expect Q4 results to be comparable to last year. Results in our console games business faced difficult comparison given the performance of Cars 2 and Pirates LEGO in the prior year and we have no comparable titles this year as our next big title Epic Mickey 2 will be released in the beginning of fiscal 2013.
We continue to repurchase our stock during the third quarter with 8.6 million shares repurchased for about $373 million. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased 55 million shares for $2.1 billion. While our pace of repurchase in the third quarter was slower than in recent quarter, it's probably more useful to look at our buybacks over the longer term than in any individual quarter. Returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase continues to be a key component of our capital allocation strategy and we intend to continue repurchasing our stock. We have not altered our thinking about the amount of capital allocated to share repurchase.
We’re very pleased with our Q3 results. We’ve made a number of investments in last couple of years with an eye towards creating long-term sustainable value for our shareholders and we believe this quarter demonstrates the impact of these investments are having on the financial results of our company.
And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Lowell for your questions.

The Avengers is probably a good example of that, because we have to look at it through the release of DVD which is late this September and obviously that takes as well in to Christmas and because the Avengers incorporates Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and the Hulk, we basically are selling products against all those characters and we’ll be selling it when those are the movies, certainly Iron Man, Thor and Captain America come out. So, this is kind of a long-term proposition; Avengers not as strong as Cars but until when the DVD comes out and we get into the Christmas season, it's way too early to assess this and we have high hopes for not only the films from the individual characters that appear in the movie but that in for the sequel which will come out at a time we haven’t announced yet.

If you adjust for that deferral and adjust to the FX rate as well, the Q3 cable affiliate rate growth was very similar to the first half of the year which was high single-digits. I think I gave that out in the last call. So, those two factors pretty much account for what looks like a slowdown in the reported number.
On your second question about the 100 million, basically that it really matches the kind of pace of cost growth that we’ve seen which is the sort of low to mid single-digits in cost growth quarter-to-quarter at ESPN nothing really special there. And that’s Q4 versus prior year, Ben.

So, even though the Olympics are siphoning some money out of the marketplace particularly with strong ratings, ESPN was fully prepared for a quarter that would be impacted negatively by the Olympics by selling deeper into the upfront. I should also say that their sales for their Fall premier product notable college football and pro football are very, very strong and very, very encouraging. 
On the international front, ESPN’s track record internationally has not really delivered the kind of bottom-line results that we would have liked or expected and as we look forward, we did not see the kind of growth engine from ESPN internationally and so we have approached it somewhat more conservatively. The bid that we made for instance for Premier League was we considered to be a rational bid to try to turn ESPN's business in the U.K. into a profitable business and we are outbid by very, very powerful local distributor adding really not only impossible to compete with them, but it made no sense for us to do so because it simply would not have benefited our bottom line. 
Asia a different story, well those we look long-term at that JV. We didn't think we would drive great growth for the company. It was also a partnership with News Corp. and every once in a while the partnerships even though we had a good one with News Corp., you have a different point of view about the future or the direction of the business and both entities felt that it would be better to go off individually and so we decided basically with News Corp. being very interested to sell our interest back to them and to pursue other markets for ESPN and internationally notably Latin America. Well we do think that we have a path well we are profitable today and we have a path to growth long-term.

So, I think we feel generally speaking good about the market and not huge visibility, but this is what we are seeing I think we’re positive particularly on the ESPN front.

We’ve instructed Pixar to make great movies. That's their primary priority, tell great stories and if we get good franchises out of them that's great for the company. But we're not taking a check boxes approach to how we develop. That said they do have properties in the marketplace that we really believe in. The sequel to Monsters, which comes out in 2013 would be one very good example of that. It's also kind of tough to compare things to Toy Story since that was the number one grossing animated film box office ever. What we have instructed Pixar to do is to continuing doing what they’ve been doing all along and doing quite well, which is find great characters, tell great stories and when we have got one that can me mine the way Toy Story was or Cars was or some of the other properties and certainly Nemo was onto that category. Monster then we should make the film then we should leverage it, but by and large we want to make good movies tell great stories first.

We’re very encouraged by the apps that we launched through Comcast and the app, the ESPN app that was launched by Time Warner about a year earlier. The take up rate in terms of downloading the app and ultimately authenticating has been impressive and what's really impressive particularly from the Disney Channel side is the number of shows that have been viewed on that app. This proves a number of things to us. One, the power of mobile media, clearly the device mostly, the tablet to some extent the smartphone is a device that people are willing to watch a long-form video on particularly kids and that's very encouraging. What we've got here is a model that benefits the consumer, because it gives the consumer more ways to access the programs conveniently. It benefits the distributor, because we are protecting the business model because of the need to be a multichannel subscriber and it certainly benefits us. So, I think we will do more deals like the one that we did with Comcast. There is a veritable queue of distributors that would like to launch these apps, but we are willing to launch them as part of overall extensions of omnibus deals that we’ve done with them, with the deals that we’ve done for the channel and not just allow distributors to launch them basically outside of the format of an extension of our deal. 
On the monetization front, we are working on technology that we expect to implement probably this fall for ESPN and for the Disney branded apps to embed advertising that is discrete to these apps both on the VOD front so that when they watch an episode, but also in terms of streaming of the channel and so we have an opportunity we believe not just to use these apps to increase the value of the multichannel ecosystem, but ultimately to drive greater revenue through advertising.

We’ve actually grown share a bit on the social front lately.

If you check the apps that are around, if you play social games, you will note that you will be marketed to by friends or through friends who are playing social games and you will be marketed from companies that create games because of the games you may have already played. And so we’re getting access to a marketing platform that we actually believe is encouraging. The other thing to note is there is still growth in Facebook in terms of number of users and the numbers in terms of how much time Facebook users spend playing games are staggering. And so we still believe in that business, but our investment is relatively modest in the space. I think we launch about 10 games this year, a lot of them are based on Disney-owned IP which we believe gives us, not necessarily [advantage], but an interesting way in to that space.

But we’re not up against that, we’re not bumping against it. We are very happy with the concept and allocation of capital to this activity and we don't think it eclipses other fantastic growth opportunities for the company.

History of our company has been growth through acquisition. If you look at the acquisitions we’ve made from Marvel and back, Playdom and the others, we feel very, very strong about the returns in that.

Some of the great series you see coming out of ABC last year and I hope again this year.

The agreement that we have with them for basically the Disney brand at our kids-oriented channel is the following. We put basically YouTube curated by Disney on Disney.com. That will be even more evident when we relaunch Disney.com later this year and we sell that advertising and then we curate the channel on the YouTube platform and we share that revenue with YouTube. So we think that given some of the number that we’ve seen through the basically the beta that we have launched already that is an opportunity to increase consumption, increase revenue from that and also use it to drive more users to Disney.com and to increase the value as a marketing platform. So it has multiple effects and we’ve not been specific about the nature of the investment but it is modest.

We had a phenomenal third quarter delivering the largest quarterly earnings in the history of our company.

We had a phenomenal third quarter delivering the largest quarterly earnings in the history of our company. Earnings per share were up 31% over the last year driven by growth in every one of our businesses. We also delivered record earnings per share for the first 9 months of our fiscal year and we believe that our results clearly demonstrate Disney’s unique value proposition and great potential to deliver long-term growth.
Before Jay gets into the specifics about our quarter, I’d like to spend a few minutes talking about the status of our capital spending in our parks and resorts as well as some of the acquisitions we made in the last few years especially Marvel. These things are relevant to our Q3 results and will factor into our future performance as well.
As you know, we’ve made significant investments in our parks and resorts over the past several years to create an even greater Disney experience for our guests and to drive long-term growth. These include completely transforming Disney California Adventure, expanding Disney’s fleet of cruise ships and enhancing and increasing the size of Fantasyland at Walt Disney World.
California Adventure is now an exceptional park in its own right and the perfect neighbor to Disneyland. Since the June opening of the phenomenal Cars Land and the brand new Main Street, attendance has been up along with guest satisfaction. In fact, Disneyland Resort had new Q3 attendance record and on most days since our reopening California Adventure has been drawing nearly 50% of the total attendance to the overall Disneyland Resort and that’s up from roughly 25% in the past.
The successful launch of the Disney Fantasy in March and the Disney Dream the year before more than doubled the guest capacity of our cruise business. These amazing new ships deliver an extraordinary cruise experience and they both began contributing to operating income in their first full quarter of operation.
Our cruise ship bookings are currently at 94% occupancy for the year. Meanwhile, our multi-faceted expansion of Fantasyland has begun in Orlando, it's the most popular land and our most popular park and this will be the largest expansion in the magic kingdom since Walt Disney World opened more than 40 years ago. We will complete this particular project in 2014; however, the bulk of our capital investment will be made by the end of the current fiscal year.
In fact with these significant investments behind us, this will be the peak year for our capital expenditures in our domestic parks and resorts business. Going forward we expect each one of these projects to deliver strong returns on invested capital that will exceed our hurdle rate and drive improvement in our overall returns.
On the international front, we have also invested in expanding Hong Kong Disneyland. Two of 3 new themed areas are already open and the third will open next spring. Attendance, revenue and operating income for the park were all up again this quarter. Park actually set a new Q3 record for both attendance and revenue. And our investment in Shanghai Disneyland will continue to ramp up through its opening. As I have said many times before, this is the most exciting international project in the history of our company and it's certainly the biggest investment we have ever made outside the United States.
Turning to our acquisitions. In Q3, we released 2 fantastic movies that demonstrate the incredible creativity and value of both Pixar and Marvel. Brave is Disney-Pixar’s 13th consecutive movie to open at number one here in the U.S. It's grossed about $225 million domestically and is yet to open on some key international markets including UK and Spain.
And Marvel’s The Avengers has grossed almost $1.5 billion in box-office worldwide making it the third highest grossing movie of all time. It's also an important new franchise for us as Disney Interactive, Disney Channels Worldwide, ABC Studios and Disney Consumer Products are all working to leverage the power of the Avengers to create greater value.
We acquired Marvel in 2009 and with its multitude of exciting characters and as with Pixar we are confident that Marvel will be able to create original content and build franchises around these great characters to drive significant value across our company.
The releases of Thor and Captain America last year built on the momentum from the first 2 Iron Man movies. Combined these 2 movies grossed more than $800 million in global box-office and led to the phenomenal success of Marvel’s The Avengers.
When Marvel took the stage at Comic-Con last month to announce the new slate of films that will keep the momentum going, the reaction was huge. Iron Man 3 opens on May 3, 2013 followed by Thor: The Dark World in November of next year. Captain America: The Winter Soldier will be in theaters in April of ‘14 and as I mentioned in our last call is the sequel to Marvel’s The Avengers in the works. In fact Marvel has just signed Joss Whedon to exclusive deal and he will write and direct Avengers 2 and help develop a Marvel based series for ABC.
So, as you can see Disney has a unique ability to generate new opportunities and drive significant value from great creative content. Disney, Pixar and Marvel have the incredible characters and compelling stories that people connect to, the kind we have proven we can build strong long lasting franchises upon.
Our acquisitions give us more than extraordinary creative content, the creative cultures, unique talent, new perspectives and commitment to excellence at Pixar and marvel are now contributing to our company’s strength and along with ESPN and ABC they are creating new opportunities in numerous ways. With some of the world’s strongest brands, greatest creative talent and incredibly valuable assets, Disney has never been better positioned to create continued long-term growth.
And with that I will ask Jay to give you the details of our Q3 performance and then we will be back to take your questions."
191564,210275766,341336,"Walt Disney Co., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2012",2012-08-07,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. We delivered an exceptional quarter with segment operating income up 18% and earnings per share of $1.01 up 31% over prior year.

We delivered an exceptional quarter with segment operating income up 18% and earnings per share of $1.01 up 31% over prior year. There is a great momentum at our company as evidenced by these results which I’m now going to spend a few minutes discussing in more detail then I’ll highlight some factors that may influence our upcoming performance.
In the third quarter, the Studio segment was the largest contributor to growth in operating income driven primarily by the tremendous worldwide box-office results of Marvel’s The Avengers. Television distribution results were also higher, but this was offset by a decrease in worldwide Home Entertainment. The success of Marvel’s The Avengers speaks for itself. It's a phenomenal film that dominated the box-office in every market in which it opened so we look forward to the opening of the film next week in Japan.
As we look to the balance of the year and fiscal 2013, we are excited about our robust release slate. On the animation side, Pixar will release 2 of its animated classics in 3D for the first time, Finding Nemo in September and Monsters Incorporated in December which sets the stage for Pixar’s next big film Monsters University, which will be released next June.
We will also release Tim Burton’s Frankenweenie in October and Disney Animation’s Wreck-It Ralph in November. On the live-action front, we will release a number of highly anticipated films in 2013 including Oz The Great and Powerful in March, Iron Man 3 in May and The Lone Ranger in July.
Results from television distribution were driven by higher sales of our films in international markets compared to the prior year. The decline in home entertainment results was due to lower unit sales in the third quarter including lower performance of key titles like John Carter and The Muppets compared on Tron, Tangled and Gnomeo & Juliet which were released in the prior year.
Operating income growth for the Media Networks segment was driven by growth in both Cable Networks and Broadcasting. At Cable Networks, Disney Channel was the primary driver. Growth at domestic Disney Channel was driven by higher affiliate revenue due to contractual rate increases. Disney Channel continues to build and enhance brand awareness for Disney around the world, so we could not be more pleased with its recent success. Disney Channel is stronger today than ever with strength across all of its networks. In Q3, Disney Channel was the number one network with kids 2 to 11 and tweens 9 to 14. As of last week, Disney Channel had been number one with kids 2 to 11 for 9 consecutive weeks. Disney XD had its highest rated third quarter ever with kids 6 to 11 and tweens 9 to 14.
Our newest network, Disney Junior which we launched in March is already in 55 million homes followed by our recent agreement that brought the network to DIRECTV’s customers. In June of this year, we launched the suite of Disney Channel apps with Comcast, Watch Disney Channel, Watch Disney XD and Watch Disney Junior which gives their subscribers access to live linear feeds of those networks in addition to a host of on-demand programming. This suite of services further strengthens our relationship with consumers by enhancing the value of their multichannel subscriptions.
ESPN’s operating income was down in the quarter due to lower recognition of deferred affiliate revenue compared to prior year. If you recall, ESPN did not defer any Comcast revenue during Q1 and Q2. So this quarter, ESPN recognized $139 million less in deferred revenue related to its Comcast agreement than in the prior year.
I'll remind you the deferral issue nearly relates to timing of revenue recognition and has no impact on full-year results. Excluding this impact, ESPN’s growth in affiliate rates subscribers and advertising revenue was more than offset an increase in programming and production costs. Programming and production costs were higher due to the airing of additional NBA games compared to Q3 last year as well as higher contractual rates for NBA and Major League Baseball programming.
ESPN ad revenue was up mid-teen percentage points compared to last year driven by higher rates, unit sales, and ratings. Viewership of the ESPN network continued to grow during the quarter as ratings were up over 16% due to our coverage of the UEFA 2012 championship, more NBA games and increased viewership of SportsCenter and U.S. Open Golf.
Reported cable margins excluding our equity investments were down 70 basis points due primarily to lower affiliate revenue recognition from Comcast. This revenue recognition change associated with Comcast affiliate revenue had an adverse impact on cable margins of approximately 220 basis points.
At Broadcasting, the increase in operating income was a result of higher affiliate and royalty revenue and lower programming and production costs at our owned stations partially offset by a decrease in ad revenue at the ABC Network. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was down modestly as higher CPMs were more than offset by lower ratings in a quarter. Ad revenue at the stations was comparable to prior year.
Quarter-to-date scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running mid-teens above upfront levels. At ESPN ad sales are pacing down modestly. Our advertising business has been impacted in the last couple of weeks by the Olympics. However, we are very pleased with the strong demand ABC and ESPN enjoyed in the upfront, which is evidence that advertiser demand for our networks remains strong.
Our Parks and Resorts segment delivered another strong quarter with revenue up 9% and operating income up 21%. The increase in operating income was due to growth at Tokyo Disney Resort, Disney Cruise Line and our domestic resorts. We saw continued improvement in segment margins during the quarter, up more than 190 basis points compared to last year. Results from the Tokyo Disney Resort continue to improve reflecting the negative impact of the Japan earthquake on last year’s Q3 results and the related business interruption insurance proceeds we received in Q3 this year. I’d also note that Hong Kong Disneyland’s operating income grew in the quarter due to increased guest spending and higher attendance.
Disney Cruise Line results were higher due to the launch of the Disney Fantasy in late March. At our domestic parks, the increase in operating income was due to increased guest spending and attendance, partially offset by increased cost. For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 1% and per capita spending was up 8% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending. Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6% driven by higher average daily rates.
Occupancy decreased 1.5 points to 79%. While occupied room nights were comparable to prior year, domestic inventory increased versus prior year, due to the opening of Ahwahnee and Disney's Art of Animation Resorts. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 1% while book rates are up 4%. Bookings at the Disney Cruise Line are 38% higher than prior year with occupancy for the entire fleet at 94% for the year.
At Consumer Products, operating income was up in the quarter due to an increase in merchandise licensing. Growth in licensing was due to lower revenue share with the studio compared to prior year and higher revenue in Japan. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was down modestly. We are pleased with the sale of Avengers merchandise and the early sell-in of Spiderman, but faced a difficult comparison given the performance of Cars merchandise last year.
At the Interactive segment, we continue to make steady progress with lower operating costs in the quarter compared to prior year due to improved results in our games business. Social games results continued to benefit from lower impact of acquisition accounting for Playdom as well as improved performance driven by the success of Gardens of Time. Results of our console games business were comparable to the prior-year.
During the quarter, A&E Television Networks agreed to redeem NBC Universal’s entire 15.8% equity interest in A&E for approximately $3 billion. $2.5 billion of this purchase price represents the enterprise value of NBC used equity interest in A&E and the balance represents the value of tax benefits expected to be generated as a result of the transaction. We are very pleased with the price A&E will pay to redeem this stake. We expect the transaction to close by the end of calendar 2012 at which point our ownership stake in A&E will increase to 50%.
Turning to the fourth quarter, there are couple of items I’d like to highlight that will impact year-over-year comparisons. ESPN will incur more than $100 million in incremental programming and production costs due primarily to contractual increases for College Football and Major League Baseball as well as higher costs associated with our new contracts for the Pac-12 and Wimbledon.
At Disney Interactive, while year-to-date results have improved over prior year, we expect Q4 results to be comparable to last year. Results in our console games business faced difficult comparison given the performance of Cars 2 and Pirates LEGO in the prior year and we have no comparable titles this year as our next big title Epic Mickey 2 will be released in the beginning of fiscal 2013.
We continue to repurchase our stock during the third quarter with 8.6 million shares repurchased for about $373 million. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased 55 million shares for $2.1 billion. While our pace of repurchase in the third quarter was slower than in recent quarters, it's probably more useful to look at our buybacks over the longer term than in any individual quarter. Returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase continues to be a key component of our capital allocation strategy and we intend to continue repurchasing our stock. We have not altered our thinking about the amount of capital allocated to share repurchase.
We’re very pleased with our Q3 results. We’ve made a number of investments in last couple of years with an eye towards creating long-term sustainable value for our shareholders and we believe this quarter demonstrates the impact that these investments are having on the financial results of our company.
And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Lowell for your questions."

Looking at Q3, how would you sort of judge the performance of the company overall across the segments particularly at CP and at Film, and how do you think about looking at this property from a licensing perspective relative to some of your other big hits like the Cars where you really didn't see much of a fall off on the licensing front as you moved out over the years beyond initial release of the film?"

It's not as strong as Cars from the CP front, but that's the strongest that we’ve ever had. I think it's important to note, Ben,  you can't look at one of these properties in terms of it franchise quality or strength in one quarter. The Avengers is probably a good example of that, because we have to look at it through the release of DVD which is late this September and obviously that takes as well in to Christmas and because the Avengers incorporates Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and the Hulk, we basically are selling products against all those characters and we’ll be selling it when those are the movies, certainly Iron Man, Thor and Captain America come out. So, this is kind of a long-term proposition. Avengers not as strong as Cars but until when the DVD comes out and we get into the Christmas season, it's way too early to assess this and we have high hopes for not only the films from the individual characters that appear in the movie but that in for the sequel which will come out at a time we haven’t announced yet."

If you adjust for that deferral and adjust to the FX rate as well, the Q3 cable affiliate rate growth was very similar to the first half of the year which was high single-digits. I think I gave that out in the last call. So, those 2 factors pretty much account for what looks like a slowdown in the reported number.
On your second question about the $100 million, basically that it really matches the kind of pace of cost growth that we’ve seen which is the sort of low to mid single-digits in cost growth quarter-to-quarter at ESPN nothing really special there. And that’s Q4 versus prior year, Ben."

The pricing that we get is probably the strongest in terms of a percentage increase is from the other networks led by the Disney Channel. So, we’re getting tremendous price growth in some of the other channels and decent growth in ESPN, but albeit on a very, very high base."

So, even though the Olympics are siphoning some money out of the marketplace particularly with strong ratings, ESPN was fully prepared for a quarter that would be impacted negatively by the Olympics by selling deeper into the upfront. I should also say that their sales for their Fall premier product notably college football and pro football are very, very strong and very, very encouraging.
On the international front, ESPN’s track record internationally has not really delivered the kind of bottom-line results that we would have liked or expected and as we look forward, we did not see the kind of growth engine from ESPN internationally and so we have approached it somewhat more conservatively. The bid that we made for instance for Premier League was what we considered to be a rational bid to try to turn ESPN's business in the U.K. into a profitable business and we are outbid by very, very powerful local distributor adding and it was not only impossible to compete with them, but it made no sense for us to do so because it simply would not have benefited our bottom line.
Asia a different story, well those we look long-term at that JV. We didn't think we would drive great growth for the company. It was also a partnership with News Corp. and every once in a while the partnerships, even though we had a good one with News Corp., you have a different point of view about the future or the direction of the business and both entities felt that it would be better to go off individually and so we decided basically with News Corp. being very interested to sell our interest back to them and to pursue other markets for ESPN and internationally notably Latin America where we do think that we have a path well we are profitable today and we have a path for growth long-term."

We’re very encouraged by the apps that were launched through Comcast and the app, the ESPN app that was launched by Time Warner about a year earlier. The take up rate in terms of downloading the app and ultimately authenticating has been impressive and what's really impressive particularly from the Disney Channel side is the number of shows that have been viewed on that app. This proves a number of things to us. One, the power of mobile media, clearly the device mostly, the tablet to some extent the smartphone is a device that people are willing to watch a long-form video on particularly kids and that's very encouraging. What we've got here is a model that benefits the consumer, because it gives the consumer more ways to access the programs conveniently. It benefits the distributor, because we are protecting the business model because of the need to be a multichannel subscriber and it certainly benefits us. So, I think we will do more deals like the one that we did with Comcast. There is a veritable queue of distributors that would like to launch these apps, but we are willing to launch them as part of overall extensions of omnibus deals that we’ve done with them, with the deals that we’ve done for the channel and not just allow distributors to launch them basically outside of the format of an extension of our deal.
On the monetization front, we are working on technology that we expect to implement probably this fall for ESPN and for the Disney branded apps to embed advertising that is discrete to these apps both on the VOD front so that when they watch an episode, but also in terms of streaming of the channel and so we have an opportunity we believe not just to use these apps to increase the value of the multichannel ecosystem, but ultimately to drive greater revenue through advertising."

Of course, the euro and the pound have been relatively strong for most of that period."

We’ve actually grown share a bit on the social front lately. Our exposure is less than some of the big competitors in that space namely one big competitor in the space. And we’ve actually seen some interesting growth, thanks to the new Facebook App Center that was launched recently where we’re getting access to customers, Facebook users of Facebook for marketing purposes that we didn't have before. If you check the apps that are out, if you play social games, you will note that you will be marketed to by friends or through friends who are playing social games and you will be marketed from companies that create games because of the games you may have already played. And so we’re gaining access to a marketing platform that we actually believe is encouraging. The other thing to note is there is still growth in Facebook in terms of number of users and the numbers in terms of how much time Facebook users spend playing games are staggering. And so we still believe in that business, but our investment is relatively modest in the space. I think we'll launch about 10 games this year, a lot of them are based on Disney-owned IP which we believe gives us, not necessarily a great advantage, but an interesting way in to that space. So we feel relatively good about it. It's not a huge business for us, but it's one that we’re going to continue to be in."

But we’re not up against that, we’re not bumping against it. We are very happy with the concept and allocation of capital to this activity and we don't think it eclipses other fantastic growth opportunities for the company.
If you look over the last 5 years, we have allocated 60% to 65% of the cash generated by the company to the incredible products that you see coming forth, and you know whether it's Avengers, whether it's theme park product, cruise ships, these are the kinds of things that we know we can get high returns on and we will continue to seek those out.
History of our company has been growth through acquisition. If you look at the acquisitions we’ve made from Marvel and back, Playdom and the others, we feel very, very strong about the returns in that. We allocate we think the right amount of money to invest in our television networks. The Disney Channel is proof of that. Some of the great series you see coming out of ABC last year and I hope again this year will show that this is first and foremost what we want to do, but it does leave us the opportunity to return capital to shareholders and we are determined to allocate a sizable portion of the cash we generate through that. If you look over the last the last few years it's been 20 to 25%. No reason to think differently about that."

We had a phenomenal third quarter delivering the largest quarterly earnings in the history of our company. Earnings per share were up 31% over the last year driven by growth in every one of our businesses. We also delivered record earnings per share for the first 9 months of our fiscal year and we believe that our results clearly demonstrate Disney’s unique value proposition and great potential to deliver long-term growth.
Before Jay gets into the specifics about our quarter, I’d like to spend a few minutes talking about the status of our capital spending in our parks and resorts as well as some of the acquisitions we made in the last few years especially Marvel. These things are relevant to our Q3 results and will factor into our future performance as well.
As you know, we’ve made significant investments in our parks and resorts over the past several years to create an even greater Disney experience for our guests and to drive long-term growth. These include completely transforming Disney California Adventure, expanding Disney’s fleet of cruise ships and enhancing and increasing the size of Fantasyland at Walt Disney World.
California Adventure is now an exceptional park in its own right and the perfect neighbor to Disneyland. Since the June opening of the phenomenal Cars Land and the brand new Main Street, attendance has been up along with guest satisfaction. In fact, Disneyland Resort had new Q3 attendance record and on most days since our reopening California Adventure has been drawing nearly 50% of the total attendance to the overall Disneyland Resort and that’s up from roughly 25% in the past.
The successful launch of the Disney Fantasy in March and the Disney Dream the year before more than doubled the guest capacity of our cruise business. These amazing new ships deliver an extraordinary cruise experience and they both began contributing to operating income in their first full quarter of operation.
Our cruise ship bookings are currently at 94% occupancy for the year. Meanwhile, our multi-faceted expansion of Fantasyland has begun in Orlando, it's the most popular land and our most popular park and this will be the largest expansion in the magic kingdom since Walt Disney World opened more than 40 years ago. We will complete this particular project in 2014; however, the bulk of our capital investment will be made by the end of the current fiscal year.
In fact with these significant investments behind us, this will be the peak year for our capital expenditures in our domestic parks and resorts business. Going forward we expect each one of these projects to deliver strong returns on invested capital that will exceed our hurdle rate and drive improvement in our overall returns.
On the international front, we have also invested in expanding Hong Kong Disneyland. Two of 3 new themed areas are already open and the third will open next spring. Attendance, revenue and operating income for the park were all up again this quarter. Park actually set a new Q3 record for both attendance and revenue. And our investment in Shanghai Disneyland will continue to ramp up through its opening. As I have said many times before, this is the most exciting international project in the history of our company and it's certainly the biggest investment we have ever made outside the United States.
Turning to our acquisitions. In Q3, we released 2 fantastic movies that demonstrate the incredible creativity and value of both Pixar and Marvel. Brave is Disney-Pixar’s 13th consecutive movie to open at number one here in the U.S. It's grossed about $225 million domestically and is yet to open on some key international markets including UK and Spain.
And Marvel’s The Avengers has grossed almost $1.5 billion in box-office worldwide making it the third highest grossing movie of all time. It's also an important new franchise for us as Disney Interactive, Disney Channels Worldwide, ABC Studios and Disney Consumer Products are all working to leverage the power of the Avengers to create greater value.
We acquired Marvel in 2009 and with its multitude of exciting characters and as with Pixar we are confident that Marvel will be able to create original content and build franchises around these great characters to drive significant value across our company.
The releases of Thor and Captain America last year built on the momentum from the first 2 Iron Man movies. Combined these 2 movies grossed more than $800 million in global box-office and led to the phenomenal success of Marvel’s The Avengers.
When Marvel took the stage at Comic-Con last month to announce the new slate of films that will keep the momentum going, the reaction was huge. Iron Man 3 opens on May 3, 2013 followed by Thor: The Dark World in November of next year. Captain America: The Winter Soldier will be in theaters in April of ‘14 and as I mentioned in our last call is the sequel to Marvel’s The Avengers in the works. In fact Marvel has just signed Joss Whedon to exclusive deal and he will write and direct Avengers 2 and help develop a Marvel based series for ABC.
So, as you can see Disney has a unique ability to generate new opportunities and drive significant value from great creative content. Disney, Pixar and Marvel have the incredible characters and compelling stories that people connect to, the kind we have proven we can build strong long lasting franchises upon.
Our acquisitions give us more than extraordinary creative content, the creative cultures, unique talent, new perspectives and commitment to excellence at Pixar and marvel are now contributing to our company’s strength and along with ESPN and ABC they are creating new opportunities in numerous ways. With some of the world’s strongest brands, greatest creative talent and incredibly valuable assets, Disney has never been better positioned to create continued long-term growth.
And with that I will ask Jay to give you the details of our Q3 performance and then we will be back to take your questions."

We delivered an exceptional quarter with segment operating income up 18% and earnings per share of $1.01 up 31% over prior year.

We delivered an exceptional quarter with segment operating income up 18% and earnings per share of $1.01 up 31% over prior year. There is a great momentum at our company as evidenced by these results which I’m now going to spend a few minutes discussing in more detail then I’ll highlight some factors that may influence our upcoming performance.
In the third quarter, the Studio segment was the largest contributor to growth in operating income driven primarily by the tremendous worldwide box-office results of Marvel’s The Avengers. Television distribution results were also higher, but this was offset by a decrease in worldwide Home Entertainment. The success of Marvel’s The Avengers speaks for itself. It's a phenomenal film that dominated the box-office in every market in which it opened so we look forward to the opening of the film next week in Japan.
As we look to the balance of the year and fiscal 2013, we are excited about our robust release slate. On the animation side, Pixar will release 2 of its animated classics in 3D for the first time, Finding Nemo in September and Monsters Incorporated in December which sets the stage for Pixar’s next big film Monsters University, which will be released next June.
We will also release Tim Burton’s Frankenweenie in October and Disney Animation’s Wreck-It Ralph in November. On the live-action front, we will release a number of highly anticipated films in 2013 including Oz The Great and Powerful in March, Iron Man 3 in May and The Lone Ranger in July.
Results from television distribution were driven by higher sales of our films in international markets compared to the prior year. The decline in home entertainment results was due to lower unit sales in the third quarter including lower performance of key titles like John Carter and The Muppets compared on Tron, Tangled and Gnomeo & Juliet which were released in the prior year.
Operating income growth for the Media Networks segment was driven by growth in both Cable Networks and Broadcasting. At Cable Networks, Disney Channel was the primary driver. Growth at domestic Disney Channel was driven by higher affiliate revenue due to contractual rate increases. Disney Channel continues to build and enhance brand awareness for Disney around the world, so we could not be more pleased with its recent success. Disney Channel is stronger today than ever with strength across all of its networks. In Q3, Disney Channel was the number one network with kids 2 to 11 and tweens 9 to 14. As of last week, Disney Channel had been number one with kids 2 to 11 for 9 consecutive weeks. Disney XD had its highest rated third quarter ever with kids 6 to 11 and tweens 9 to 14.
Our newest network, Disney Junior which we launched in March is already in 55 million homes followed by our recent agreement that brought the network to DIRECTV’s customers. In June of this year, we launched the suite of Disney Channel apps with Comcast, Watch Disney Channel, Watch Disney XD and Watch Disney Junior which gives their subscribers access to live linear feeds of those networks in addition to a host of on-demand programming. This suite of services further strengthens our relationship with consumers by enhancing the value of their multichannel subscriptions.
ESPN’s operating income was down in the quarter due to lower recognition of deferred affiliate revenue compared to prior year. If you recall, ESPN did not defer any Comcast revenue during Q1 and Q2. So this quarter, ESPN recognized $139 million less in deferred revenue related to its Comcast agreement than in the prior year.
I'll remind you the deferral issue nearly relates to timing of revenue recognition and has no impact on full-year results. Excluding this impact, ESPN’s growth in affiliate rates subscribers and advertising revenue was more than offset an increase in programming and production costs. Programming and production costs were higher due to the airing of additional NBA games compared to Q3 last year as well as higher contractual rates for NBA and Major League Baseball programming.
ESPN ad revenue was up mid-teen percentage points compared to last year driven by higher rates, unit sales, and ratings. Viewership of the ESPN network continued to grow during the quarter as ratings were up over 16% due to our coverage of the UEFA 2012 championship, more NBA games and increased viewership of SportsCenter and U.S. Open Golf.
Reported cable margins excluding our equity investments were down 70 basis points due primarily to lower affiliate revenue recognition from Comcast. This revenue recognition change associated with Comcast affiliate revenue had an adverse impact on cable margins of approximately 220 basis points.
At Broadcasting, the increase in operating income was a result of higher affiliate and royalty revenue and lower programming and production costs at our owned stations partially offset by a decrease in ad revenue at the ABC Network. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was down modestly as higher CPMs were more than offset by lower ratings in a quarter. Ad revenue at the stations was comparable to prior year.
Quarter-to-date scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running mid-teens above upfront levels. At ESPN ad sales are pacing down modestly. Our advertising business has been impacted in the last couple of weeks by the Olympics. However, we are very pleased with the strong demand ABC and ESPN enjoyed in the upfront, which is evidence that advertiser demand for our networks remains strong.
Our Parks and Resorts segment delivered another strong quarter with revenue up 9% and operating income up 21%. The increase in operating income was due to growth at Tokyo Disney Resort, Disney Cruise Line and our domestic resorts. We saw continued improvement in segment margins during the quarter, up more than 190 basis points compared to last year. Results from the Tokyo Disney Resort continue to improve reflecting the negative impact of the Japan earthquake on last year’s Q3 results and the related business interruption insurance proceeds we received in Q3 this year. I’d also note that Hong Kong Disneyland’s operating income grew in the quarter due to increased guest spending and higher attendance.
Disney Cruise Line results were higher due to the launch of the Disney Fantasy in late March. At our domestic parks, the increase in operating income was due to increased guest spending and attendance, partially offset by increased cost. For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 1% and per capita spending was up 8% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending. Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6% driven by higher average daily rates.
Occupancy decreased 1.5 points to 79%. While occupied room nights were comparable to prior year, domestic inventory increased versus prior year, due to the opening of Ahwahnee and Disney's Art of Animation Resorts. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 1% while book rates are up 4%. Bookings at the Disney Cruise Line are 38% higher than prior year with occupancy for the entire fleet at 94% for the year.
At Consumer Products, operating income was up in the quarter due to an increase in merchandise licensing. Growth in licensing was due to lower revenue share with the studio compared to prior year and higher revenue in Japan. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was down modestly. We are pleased with the sale of Avengers merchandise and the early sell-in of Spiderman, but faced a difficult comparison given the performance of Cars merchandise last year.
At the Interactive segment, we continue to make steady progress with lower operating costs in the quarter compared to prior year due to improved results in our games business. Social games results continued to benefit from lower impact of acquisition accounting for Playdom as well as improved performance driven by the success of Gardens of Time. Results of our console games business were comparable to the prior-year.
During the quarter, A&E Television Networks agreed to redeem NBC Universal’s entire 15.8% equity interest in A&E for approximately $3 billion. $2.5 billion of this purchase price represents the enterprise value of NBC used equity interest in A&E and the balance represents the value of tax benefits expected to be generated as a result of the transaction. We are very pleased with the price A&E will pay to redeem this stake. We expect the transaction to close by the end of calendar 2012 at which point our ownership stake in A&E will increase to 50%.
Turning to the fourth quarter, there are couple of items I’d like to highlight that will impact year-over-year comparisons. ESPN will incur more than $100 million in incremental programming and production costs due primarily to contractual increases for College Football and Major League Baseball as well as higher costs associated with our new contracts for the Pac-12 and Wimbledon.
At Disney Interactive, while year-to-date results have improved over prior year, we expect Q4 results to be comparable to last year. Results in our console games business faced difficult comparison given the performance of Cars 2 and Pirates LEGO in the prior year and we have no comparable titles this year as our next big title Epic Mickey 2 will be released in the beginning of fiscal 2013.
We continue to repurchase our stock during the third quarter with 8.6 million shares repurchased for about $373 million. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased 55 million shares for $2.1 billion. While our pace of repurchase in the third quarter was slower than in recent quarters, it's probably more useful to look at our buybacks over the longer term than in any individual quarter. Returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase continues to be a key component of our capital allocation strategy and we intend to continue repurchasing our stock. We have not altered our thinking about the amount of capital allocated to share repurchase.
We’re very pleased with our Q3 results. We’ve made a number of investments in last couple of years with an eye towards creating long-term sustainable value for our shareholders and we believe this quarter demonstrates the impact that these investments are having on the financial results of our company.
And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Lowell for your questions."

It's not as strong as Cars from the CP front, but that's the strongest that we’ve ever had. I think it's important to note, Ben, you can't look at one of these properties in terms of it franchise quality or strength in one quarter. The Avengers is probably a good example of that, because we have to look at it through the release of DVD which is late this September and obviously that takes as well in to Christmas and because the Avengers incorporates Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and the Hulk, we basically are selling products against all those characters and we’ll be selling it when those are the movies, certainly Iron Man, Thor and Captain America come out. So, this is kind of a long-term proposition. Avengers not as strong as Cars but until when the DVD comes out and we get into the Christmas season, it's way too early to assess this and we have high hopes for not only the films from the individual characters that appear in the movie but that in for the sequel which will come out at a time we haven’t announced yet."

If you adjust for that deferral and adjust to the FX rate as well, the Q3 cable affiliate rate growth was very similar to the first half of the year which was high single-digits. I think I gave that out in the last call. So, those 2 factors pretty much account for what looks like a slowdown in the reported number.
On your second question about the $100 million, basically that it really matches the kind of pace of cost growth that we’ve seen which is the sort of low to mid single-digits in cost growth quarter-to-quarter at ESPN nothing really special there. And that’s Q4 versus prior year, Ben."

So, even though the Olympics are siphoning some money out of the marketplace particularly with strong ratings, ESPN was fully prepared for a quarter that would be impacted negatively by the Olympics by selling deeper into the upfront. I should also say that their sales for their Fall premier product notably college football and pro football are very, very strong and very, very encouraging.
On the international front, ESPN’s track record internationally has not really delivered the kind of bottom-line results that we would have liked or expected and as we look forward, we did not see the kind of growth engine from ESPN internationally and so we have approached it somewhat more conservatively. The bid that we made for instance for Premier League was what we considered to be a rational bid to try to turn ESPN's business in the U.K. into a profitable business and we are outbid by very, very powerful local distributor adding and it was not only impossible to compete with them, but it made no sense for us to do so because it simply would not have benefited our bottom line.
Asia a different story, well those we look long-term at that JV. We didn't think we would drive great growth for the company. It was also a partnership with News Corp. and every once in a while the partnerships, even though we had a good one with News Corp., you have a different point of view about the future or the direction of the business and both entities felt that it would be better to go off individually and so we decided basically with News Corp. being very interested to sell our interest back to them and to pursue other markets for ESPN and internationally notably Latin America where we do think that we have a path well we are profitable today and we have a path for growth long-term."

We’ve instructed Pixar to make great movies. That's their primary priority, tell great stories and if we get good franchises out of them that's great for the company. But we're not taking a check boxes approach to how we develop. That said they do have properties in the marketplace that we really believe in. The sequel to Monsters, which comes out in 2013 would be one very good example of that. It's also kind of tough to compare things to Toy Story since that was the number one grossing animated film box office ever. What we have instructed Pixar to do is to continuing doing what they’ve been doing all along and doing quite well, which is find great characters, tell great stories and when we've have got one that can me mine the way Toy Story was or Cars was or some of the other properties and certainly Nemo would fall onto that category and Monster, then we should make the film then we should leverage it. But by and large we want to make good movies tell great stories first."

We’re very encouraged by the apps that were launched through Comcast and the app, the ESPN app that was launched by Time Warner about a year earlier. The take up rate in terms of downloading the app and ultimately authenticating has been impressive and what's really impressive particularly from the Disney Channel side is the number of shows that have been viewed on that app. This proves a number of things to us. One, the power of mobile media, clearly the device mostly, the tablet to some extent the smartphone is a device that people are willing to watch a long-form video on particularly kids and that's very encouraging. What we've got here is a model that benefits the consumer, because it gives the consumer more ways to access the programs conveniently. It benefits the distributor, because we are protecting the business model because of the need to be a multichannel subscriber and it certainly benefits us. So, I think we will do more deals like the one that we did with Comcast. There is a veritable queue of distributors that would like to launch these apps, but we are willing to launch them as part of overall extensions of omnibus deals that we’ve done with them, with the deals that we’ve done for the channel and not just allow distributors to launch them basically outside of the format of an extension of our deal.
On the monetization front, we are working on technology that we expect to implement probably this fall for ESPN and for the Disney branded apps to embed advertising that is discrete to these apps both on the VOD front so that when they watch an episode, but also in terms of streaming of the channel and so we have an opportunity we believe not just to use these apps to increase the value of the multichannel ecosystem, but ultimately to drive greater revenue through advertising."

The agreement that we have with them for basically the Disney brand are a kids-oriented channel is the following. We put basically YouTube curated by Disney on Disney.com. That will be even more evident when we relaunch Disney.com later this year and we sell that advertising and then we curate the channel on the YouTube platform and we share that revenue with YouTube. So we think that given some of the numbers that we’ve seen through the basically the beta that we have launched already that is an opportunity to increase consumption, increase revenue from that and also use it to drive more users to Disney.com and to increase the value as a marketing platform. So it has multiple effects and we’ve not been specific about the nature of the investment but it is modest."

I'm very happy to report that Disney has delivered yet another record annual performance, driven by improved results in each of our businesses. In the fiscal 2012 year, Disney achieved record revenue, net income and earnings per share. Net income was up by 18% for the year on a 3% increase in revenue, and our earnings per share adjusted for comparability were up 21% over last year. 
I'm also very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were primarily driven by growth at Cable Networks and Parks and Resorts. Net income grew by 14% and revenue was up 3% for the quarter, and our EPS for Q4 adjusted for comparability grew 15% to $0.68. These results once again demonstrate our ability to grow earnings in the near term while investing for the long term, and we're obviously proud of our performance. 
Before I get into the highlights of fiscal 2012, I just want to mention the tremendous creative resurgence we are seeing at Disney Animation. Building on the success of Tangled, our newest release, Wreck-It Ralph, just had a phenomenal opening weekend, bigger than any previous Disney animated movie. With $58.6 million in domestic box office so far, Wreck-It Ralph continues to create a momentum that started with our acquisition of Pixar. Pixar deal brought us more than just great Pixar movies. It also reinvigorated our entire animation pipeline led by the great team of John Lasseter and Ed Capitol. 
Looking back, fiscal 2012 was a great year for Disney by every measure, creatively, financially and strategically. Marvel had a fantastic year, capped by the extraordinary success of The Avengers, which became the world's third highest grossing movie of all-time, a global phenomenon and an incredibly important franchise for us. 
Pixar also generated a great deal of value for us this year from the opening of the phenomenal Cars Land, to transform Disney California Adventure into an extraordinary park, to the opening of BRAVE, which became Pixar's 13th consecutive movie to debut #1 at the box office. 
We opened 2 new lands in Hong Kong Disneyland, completed the first phase of our historic multiyear expansion of Fantasyland and Walt Disney World and made significant progress in Shanghai to keep development on track to open by the end of 2015. 
With the addition of the Disney Fantasy last March, we've now more doubled our cruise business, and this year, we were named the #1 large cruise line by readers of Condé Nast Traveler magazine. 
ESPN was a strong contributor for the year as well, adding Wimbledon to its world-class sports lineup along with higher ratings, ad sales and affiliate revenue. ESPN also solidified its position in some critical sports, including college football and basketball and major league baseball. 
Disney Channels worldwide continued to be an important brand and business driver for our company, reaching approximately 425 million homes in 167 countries. In 2002, we introduced Disney Junior and Disney XD to new markets around the world and also launched our first over-the-air Disney Channel in Russia. 
We also completed our strategic acquisition of UTV, making Disney India's leading -- making Disney India's leading film studio and TV producer, as well as one of the country's leading broadcasters, reaching more than 100 million viewers every week. 
And looking ahead, our Shanghai development is moving into an exciting phase as the construction work starts to define the shape of things to come and our vision starts to become reality. We look forward to completing our Hong Kong Disneyland expansion, which should only enhance the park's current strong performance. And we're also very excited about the ongoing Fantasyland transformation at Walt Disney World. It's the largest expansion of the Magic Kingdom since that park opened more than 40 years ago, and it's going to be pretty spectacular. 
And also in Florida, we're very excited about the new technology rollout designed to enhance guest experience and advance and expand guest engagement before their visits. We will provide details early next year, but among the many features and benefits of this technology is giving guests the chance to plan their itineraries ahead of time, including access to their favorite and often our most popular attractions. 
On the studio front, we're going to follow the success of Wreck-It Ralph with 4 major films this fiscal year: Oz The Great and Powerful opens on March 8, and Marvel's Iron Man 3 will be in theaters May 3. And this coming summer, Pixar's Monsters University will open on June 21, followed by The Lone Ranger on July 3. 
As all of you know, last week, we announced our acquisition of Lucasfilm. And upon closing, we believe it will fit right in with Disney, ABC, ESPN, Pixar and Marvel in our unparalleled portfolio of phenomenal assets and world-class brands. And when you look at all the franchises and IP every created in the history of entertainment and rank them in terms of value, Star Wars is always at or near the very top of that list. It is the very definition of a franchise. It has global appeal, stands the test of time 35 years so far, and we see great potential well into the future. It enjoys strong unwavering popularity with hundreds of millions of fans even in the absence of a new theatrical release in the last 7 years. 
Star Wars is an incredibly relevant and vibrant franchise, with tremendous opportunity for global growth, especially with the new slate of future feature film starting with Star Wars Episode 7 in 2015. The addition of Lucasfilm to our strong portfolio of assets will continue to fuel Disney's creative engine across our entire company to create additional value for our shareholders. 
We're obviously very pleased with what we've achieved in fiscal 2012, and overall, we believe we're well positioned for continued strong performance and growth. And now I'm going to turn the call over to Jay Rasulo to go through the details. Jay?"

We're pleased with our fourth quarter results, ending yet another record year of financial performance for the company. We reported record revenue and net income and earnings per share in fiscal 2012, surpassing last year's record results. 
Our performance is the result of relentless focus on maximizing the value of our existing assets and realizing returns from recent investments while continuing to invest for future growth. We believe this balanced approach will deliver consistent and attractive returns for our shareholders for years to come. 
I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing the fourth quarter in more detail, and then I'll bring -- I'll highlight a few 2013 items. In Q4, Media Networks was the largest contributor to our performance, driven by growth in operating income at Cable Networks due to continued growth at ESPN and higher equity income at A&E Television Networks. 
Growth at ease ESPN was due to an increase in affiliate revenue, which was driven by higher rates, partially offset by higher programming costs for college football and major league baseball, as well as our new Wimbledon contract. Higher equity income at A&E Television Networks during the quarter resulted from increases in advertising and affiliate revenue. 
Advertising revenue at ESPN was flat for the quarter as higher rates were offset by lower ratings. We experienced a less robust marketplace around the Olympics, and we did not see a strong a pickup in demand as we expected after the Olympics ended. 
During the quarter, ESPN signed a new long-term agreement with Major League Baseball. This deal extends our rights through 2021 season and significantly enhances our current deal with more games, greater coexist rights and an increase in annual studio programming hours of more than 100%. Extending our partnership with Major League Baseball further strengthens our unrivaled sports content portfolio, which continues to make ESPN the #1 destination for sports fans, as well as cable television's most valuable network. 
Operating income at Broadcasting was down modestly compared to last year due to lower advertising revenue at the ABC Network, partially offset by higher program sales. Lower advertising revenue at the network was driven by lower primetime ratings. Higher program sales were driven by the sale of Castle and Wipeout in the quarter. 
At the ABC Network, quarter-to-date scatter pricing is pacing midteens above upfront levels. ESPN ad sales are piecing down modestly, and ABC Family ad sales are pacing up high single-digits. TV station ad sales are pacing up mid single-digits as well. 
Our Parks and Resorts segment delivered solid results, with revenue up 9% and operating income up 18%. The increase in operating income was due to higher results at our international resorts and Disney Cruise Line. Total segment margins were up 100 basis points compared to last year. Growth initiatives reduced segment margin expansion by about 90 basis points. 
Results at our international resorts were high due to increased attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland Paris. Royalties from the Tokyo Disney Resort were also higher versus prior-year quarter. Higher operating income at Disney Cruise Line was driven by the increased passenger cruise days due to the launch of the Disney Fantasy. 
Results at our domestic parks were comparable to prior year as growth at the Disneyland Resort was largely offset by higher costs at Walt Disney World as a result of our growth initiatives. We are encouraged by Disneyland Resorts' overall performance in the quarter and are particularly pleased with the attendance and per capita spending results following the opening of Cars Land in June. Overall, domestic attendance was up 3% driven by strong attendance at the Disneyland Resort. Per capita spending at our domestic parks was up 7% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending. 
Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 8%. The increase in per room spending was driven by higher pricing and higher merchandise spending. Occupancy at our domestic hotels was down 3 percentage points to 78% due to an increase in available rooms at Walt Disney World. The increase in available room nights was driven by the completion of the final phase of Disney's Art of Animation Hotel. So far this quarter, domestic hotel reservations are pacing up mid single-digits compared to prior-year levels while book rates are also up. 
At Studio Entertainment, the decrease in operating income was driven by lower worldwide theatrical results and higher film cost write-downs, which were partially offset by stronger performance of our worldwide home entertainment business. 
Worldwide theatrical results were lower due to the strong performance of Cars 2 and Lion King 3D last year compared to Brave and Finding Nemo 3D, as well as higher pre-release marketing expenses compared to prior year. Worldwide home entertainment results were up due to higher unit sales and increased effective pricing driven by the successful release of Marvel's The Avengers. 
At Consumer Products, operating income was up in the quarter due to higher results in merchandise licensing and retail. Growth in licensing was driven by higher earned royalties due to the strong performance of Spiderman and The Avengers merchandise. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 5%. Higher retail operating income was primarily driven by strong results in North America and Europe. 
At the Interactive segment, lower operating losses compared to prior year were due to continued improvement in our social games business, which benefited from lower impact to purchase accounting. Results in our console game business faced a difficult comparison to the performance of Cars 2 and Lego in the prior year, with no comparable titles in the quarter this year. 
I would now like to turn to fiscal 2013. Overall, we feel great about our prospects for this fiscal year, but I would like to discuss a few timing and comparability issues, particularly related to Q1 and provide some insight into a few cost considerations for 2013. At Cable, domestic sports rights costs will be $170 million higher in Q1 versus last year driven by increases in college football, NFL and NBA programming. 
College football increase is due to our new deals with the Pac-12 and the Big 12, along with the expansion of the SEC. Our Q1 NBA costs will be higher compared to last year when fewer games were played in Q1 due to the lockout. However, ESPN's full year results will reflect the benefit of several new affiliate deals, one of which will commence in the second quarter. 
At studio, we face a very difficult home entertainment comparison in Q1 given strong operating income from Cars 2 and the Lion King last year. Specifically, we expect this comparison to drive a year-over-year decline in home entertainment operating income of more than $150 million. Cars 2 delivered very strong home entertainment operating income last year, driven in part by lower cost allocations given to the strength -- given the strength of its merchandise licensing revenue. The strong performance of the Lion King was volume driven as the title had not been available on home video since January 2005. 
Our Q1 Parks Resorts results will be impacted by a timing shift due to our fiscal calendar as a portion of the New Year's holiday will shift from fiscal Q1 to fiscal Q2. We estimate this will shift about $30 million in operating income from Q1 to Q2. 
2013 will benefit from a full year of performance from both the Disney Fantasy and Disney California Adventure. We expect these 2 projects to be accretive to operating income. However, the games will be offset this year by incremental spending for projects in Orlando and Shanghai. In Orlando, we're continuing to work on the guest experience enhancement project Bob discussed. In Shanghai, we're beginning to ramp up spending for our new theme park. So in fiscal 2013, in aggregate, all of our growth initiatives, both launched and to be launched, will contribute roughly $500 million of both incremental revenue and expense. We expect these initiatives to be accretive to operating income in fiscal 2014 and increasingly add to operating income each year thereafter and each to deliver returns above our cost of capital. 
We expect the Q1 tax rate to be about 2 percentage points higher than last year due to the benefit of tax settlements in prior year. Pension and postretirement medical expenses will increase by approximately $70 million in fiscal 2013 due to a decline in discount rate. On top of these items, we do expect superstorm Sandy to impact our Q1 results though it's a little too early to quantify that. 
This list of comparability and one-time items that I've just shared with you will impact our Q1 reported earnings. But rest assured, we remain confident that our operating performance for the remaining quarters will result in solid earnings growth for the entire 2013 fiscal year. 
We continue to repurchase our stock during the fourth quarter with 19.1 million shares repurchased for about $973 million. For the fiscal year, we repurchased 72 million shares for $3 billion. So far this quarter, we have repurchased 8.2 million shares for $490 million. Over the next 2 quarters, we expect to repurchase in the open market up to 40 million shares in connection with the Lucasfilm acquisition, and that's in addition to our regular share repurchase. 
2012 was another great year for our company, and in 2013, we expect to deliver another year of strong operating performance. Now I'll turn the call over to Lowell for questions."

One, the greater penetration of DVRs and the greater usage of DVRs, which clearly have shifted the rating in the direction of C-3 and ultimately hopefully C-7 because I think it speaks for an expanded look from a Nielsen and advertising perspective at 7 days versus 3. And I think the other story is that there seems to be somewhat of an absence of what I call new big real sort of buzzworthy hits. And because of that, I would say that it would be premature to either write the epitaph or suggest that we're seeing a trend. We've seen years where the presence of a big hit -- by the way, as in the case with NBC, if you look at the impact of The Voice on their schedule, has improved their numbers dramatically. So I think I'm happy to believe that ABC's schedule is pretty solid. Their Sunday schedule with Once Upon a Time and Revenge is working, and they're got Modern Family and Gray's and other shows some real strong base. And their ratings from a C-3 perspective without sports are down in the 7% to 8% range, which I don't consider to be that noteworthy. What I like to -- what I like ABC to put on the schedule are really big hit at the beginning of the year, but of course, they put on a few shows that I think are quite serviceable and have potential, Nashville being 1."

We have said for some period of time that there is no reason structurally, including, by the way, what I just said about these new initiatives that will ultimately keep us from reaching our prerecession margin levels at the Parks. So I think that is your -- hope that answers your question. On the attendance trends on the 2 coasts, obviously, the great success of Cars Land both from quality and from a quantity perspective in terms of attendance and pricing has reflected itself in Disneyland Resort, greatly outgrowing Walt Disney World. I'll say that Walt Disney World's attendance was down modestly, but Disneyland's attendance was up substantially, resulting, if you add the 2 together, in domestic attendance being up 3% that I mentioned."

It is, as I mentioned, the first big improvement that we've done at the Magic Kingdom in about 40 years.

And then lastly, we opened a big new hotel, Art of Animation, which features a family suite concept, which is growing in popularity in the marketplace and the bookings for that hotel have been great."

And we are still very confident that this would be a strong year for us in terms of performance. Obviously, the comparability, just to go through it, the large items, the one we just talked about in terms of costs associated with these guest enhancements before the revenue comes in. Secondly, the home video comparison, where we'll be off pretty substantially on a comparability basis there, because if you think about Cars 2, which was not only a successful video title but because of all of the merchandise success in prior periods around that title, that bleeds off a lot of the amortization that goes with the making of that film. When -- because Consumer Product sales are part of the ultimate package in which the film is amortized against. So a lot of that was bled off in prior periods, which made that a particularly profitable title a year ago in the home video front. Brave was also a profitable title, but it doesn't have the benefit of bleeding off all of that amortization when the units sell, so that has created a very tough comparison. And then I mentioned Lion King versus Finding Nemo in terms of its release, where the Lion King had been kind of in the vault since 2005, and of course, had enormous response in the marketplace due to that. Nemo was more available on a regular basis in the market and therefore didn't benefit from that bump. So those 2 factors are about $150 million but that's a first quarter event. And that is not -- that doesn't affect our performance at the studio in the rest of the 3 quarters of the year. The tax number I ticked off again is -- has to do with a tax favorability in the prior year. It's a first quarter event as well of course, because tax you tend to carry that for the whole year. We'll have a little bit up in our tax -- our effective tax rate for the year but not as much as in the first quarter. So I tried to emphasize and it's always difficult in prepared remarks to kind of emphasize that these are really largely comparability items that we try to give you in the first quarter and are not to lead you to believe we don't have confidence in strong results for the whole year."

I can start with our theme parks. While we haven't really had a gender problem at our theme parks, we've always been mindful of what we're offering is something for everybody. And at some of the IP gravitated more in the girls direction, it made us turn to some other IP that maybe wasn't derived from movies or television series, for instance, in order to essentially deliver against the basically the interest of our guests. Obviously, we've had Star Wars in the past. This gives us the ability to expand that presence in our parks. Marvel in certain circumstances because you may recall there are some encumbrances there, will give us an opportunity to expand but mostly internationally. So that's one way. Obviously, on the TV front, we launched or we relaunched the channel a few years back called Disney XD. We should have other names in the past. If Disney Channel is focused on a little bit more on girls than boys, this is going to be focused a little bit more on boys than girls. We started to roll out Marvel shows there. We referenced in our comments about the Lucasfilm acquisition if there are opportunities for television. One big opportunity for us in Lucasfilm's derived IP is on that channel. Again, it gives the ability for promise of that channel that much quicker. The footprint from Consumer Products obviously will give us much more of a blend. That enhances our relationship in the marketplace with retailers and with licensees as a for instance, and just generally, broadens the profile of the brand. Lucas product, by the way, will be cobranded with Disney's name on it. And then of course, on the games front, we also have that ability to turn more to Disney IP, particularly since games are a little bit more boys-driven anyway. And so I don't want -- we'll proceed with caution in this direction, but I think it enhances our opportunity particularly in the mobile space, which is very driven by boys."

We've approached that, I guess, with some degree of caution because the obvious risks associated with being a specially retail bricks-and-mortar business so it's not going to change our footprint. It will change our SKU makeup of the stores as a great opportunity as we saw with Marvel to infuse our stores with Star Wars merchandise, for instance, and we look forward to doing that and also to grow our online retail or our e-commerce business, which by the way has grown very, very nicely since the relaunch of Disney.com. And noticing what we noticed in terms of sale of Lucasfilm merchandise online, we think there's real potential there. To the first question, we went out specific about the deal that we referenced that impacted, I guess, the fourth [ph] quarter a year ago and we won't be specific. You're pretty good at guessing but I'll leave it at that. We feel very, very good about opportunities in SVOD and on digital platforms as we've seen and other large media companies have seen, the opportunities to monetize owned IP are only growing not just because of new technology but globally.

And during the period of time that we've owned Pixar, the equity in the Disney brand no matter how you measure it is has also increased, so I think we've demonstrated our ability to be ambidextrous in that regard. We also co-brand Pixar Films with Disney, and we found in the process that, that enhances both impression of the Pixar brand and impression of the Disney brand. Marvel has seen, I think, real strong brand growth. That's largely been tied to a couple of things, one, quality of the films, particularly the last 3: Captain America, Thor and obviously Avengers, but also the growth of -- the presence of the brand which is in part enhanced by self-distribution. So when we take over the distribution of their films, for instance, and we are also the owner of the brand, we're much more focused on growing the brand in the process than the third-party distributors that distributes their product before we are interested in. So there are opportunities there. The Star Wars brand, I think, basically doesn't need much help it except obviously, well I think benefit greatly from the release of a film. We intend in that case to co-brand, as I mentioned just a few minutes ago, Disney Lucas or Disney Star Wars in some form, different forms. And I think that's again another opportunity like Pixar to enhance both the Star Wars brand and the Disney brand. ESPN's doing just fine. ABC is also doing fine although from a brand perspective, we leverage the ABC name obviously in much more limited fashion than we do the other brands that we've been talking about."

So we said that 2012 would be our peak CapEx year for some time to come. And that we would be ramping down significantly in Parks capital thereafter while Shanghai was ramping up. So let me talk to that. If you look on the domestic side, domestic parks, we're probably down -- will be down by the end of fiscal '13 about $1 billion from where we were in fiscal '12 in terms of capital expenditures. A lot of the capital expenditure that is behind what Bob talked about as guest enhancing technologies is behind us. On a consolidated basis though, it's only going to look like a $500 million decrease. And in fact, the difference has to do with investment in Shanghai Disneyland. But remember, as only 43% owners of that project, we only spend 43% of the capital. So 57% of the capital spent on Shanghai Disneyland will make its way back to us in a financing line. So if you look at it that way, even on a consolidated basis, we're going to be down about $800 million for the year."

In the fiscal 2012 year, Disney achieved record revenue, net i",1000,"Thank you, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very happy to report that Disney has delivered yet another record annual performance, driven by improved results in each of our businesses. In the fiscal 2012 year, Disney achieved record revenue, net income and earnings per share. Net income was up by 18% for the year on a 3% increase in revenue, and our earnings per share adjusted for comparability were up 21% over last year. 
I'm also very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were primarily driven by growth at Cable Networks and Parks and Resorts. Net income grew by 14%, and revenue was up 3% for the quarter. And our EPS for Q4 adjusted for comparability grew 15% to $0.68. These results once again demonstrate our ability to grow earnings in the near term while investing for the long term, and we're obviously proud of our performance. 
Before I get into the highlights of fiscal 2012, I just want to mention the tremendous creative resurgence we are seeing at Disney Animation. Building on the success of Tangled, our newest release, Wreck-It Ralph, just had a phenomenal opening weekend, bigger than any previous Disney animated movie. With $58.6 million in domestic box office so far, Wreck-It Ralph continues to create a momentum that started with our acquisition of Pixar. Pixar deal brought us more than just great Pixar movies. It also reinvigorated our entire animation pipeline led by the great team of John Lasseter and Ed Catmull.
Looking back, fiscal 2012 was a great year for Disney by every measure: creatively, financially and strategically. Marvel had a fantastic year, capped by the extraordinary success of The Avengers, which became the world's third highest grossing movie of all time, a global phenomenon and an incredibly important franchise for us. 
Pixar also generated a great deal of value for us this year from the opening of the phenomenal Cars Land to transform Disney California Adventure into an extraordinary park, to the opening of BRAVE, which became Pixar's 13th consecutive movie to debut #1 at the box office. 
We opened 2 new lands in Hong Kong Disneyland, completed the first phase of our historic multiyear expansion of Fantasyland and Walt Disney World and made significant progress in Shanghai to keep development on track to open by the end of 2015. 
With the addition of the Disney Fantasy last March, we've now more than doubled our cruise business, and this year, we were named the #1 large cruise line by readers of Condé Nast Traveler magazine. 
ESPN was a strong contributor for the year as well, adding Wimbledon to its world-class sports lineup, along with higher ratings, ad sales and affiliate revenue. ESPN also solidified its position in some critical sports, including college football and basketball and major league baseball. 
Disney Channels worldwide continued to be an important brand and business driver for our company, reaching approximately 425 million homes in 167 countries. In 2002, we introduced Disney Junior and Disney XD to new markets around the world and also launched our first over-the-air Disney Channel in Russia. 
We also completed our strategic acquisition of UTV, making Disney India's leading -- making Disney India's leading film studio and TV producer, as well as one of the country's leading broadcasters, reaching more than 100 million viewers every week. 
And looking ahead, our Shanghai development is moving into an exciting phase as the construction work starts to define the shape of things to come and our vision starts to become reality. We look forward to completing our Hong Kong Disneyland expansion, which should only enhance the park's current strong performance. And we're also very excited about the ongoing Fantasyland transformation at Walt Disney World. It's the largest expansion of the Magic Kingdom since that park opened more than 40 years ago, and it's going to be pretty spectacular. 
And also in Florida, we're very excited about a new technology rollout designed to enhance guest experience and advance and expand guest engagement before their visits. We will provide details early next year, but among the many features and benefits of this technology is giving guests the chance to plan their itineraries ahead of time, including access to their favorite and often our most popular attractions. 
On the studio front, we're going to follow the success of Wreck-It Ralph with 4 major films this fiscal year: Oz The Great and Powerful opens on March 8, and Marvel's Iron Man 3 will be in theaters May 3. And this coming summer, Pixar's Monsters University will open on June 21, followed by The Lone Ranger on July 3. 
As all of you know, last week, we announced our acquisition of Lucasfilm. And upon closing, we believe it will fit right in with Disney, ABC, ESPN, Pixar and Marvel in our unparalleled portfolio of phenomenal assets and world-class brands. And when you look at all the franchises and IP ever created in the history of entertainment and rank them in terms of value, Star Wars is always at or near the very top of that list. It is the very definition of a franchise. It has global appeal, stands the test of time 35 years so far, and we see great potential well into the future. It enjoys strong unwavering popularity with hundreds of millions of fans even in the absence of a new theatrical release in the last 7 years. 
Star Wars is an incredibly relevant and vibrant franchise, with tremendous opportunity for global growth, especially with the new slate of feature films starting with Star Wars Episode 7 in 2015. The addition of Lucasfilm to our strong portfolio of assets will continue to fuel Disney's creative engine across our entire company to create additional value for our shareholders. 
We're obviously very pleased with what we've achieved in fiscal 2012, and overall, we believe we're well positioned for continued strong performance and growth. I'm now going to turn the call over to Jay Rasulo to go through the details. Jay?"

We're pleased with our fourth quarter results, ending yet another record year of financial performance for the company. We reported record revenue, net income and earnings per share in fiscal 2012, surpassing last year's record results. 
Our performance is the result of relentless focus on maximizing the value of our existing assets and realizing returns from recent investments while continuing to invest for future growth. We believe this balanced approach will deliver consistent and attractive returns for our shareholders for years to come. 
I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing the fourth quarter in more detail, and then I'll bring -- I'll highlight a few 2013 items. In Q4, Media Networks was the largest contributor to our performance, driven by growth in operating income at Cable Networks due to continued growth at ESPN and higher equity income at A&E Television Networks. 
Growth at ESPN was due to an increase in affiliate revenue, which was driven by higher rates, partially offset by higher programming costs for college football and major league baseball, as well as our new Wimbledon contract. Higher equity income at A&E Television Networks during the quarter resulted from increases in advertising and affiliate revenue. 
Advertising revenue at ESPN was flat for the quarter as higher rates were offset by lower ratings. We experienced a less robust marketplace around the Olympics, and we did not see a strong a pickup in demand as we expected after the Olympics ended. 
During the quarter, ESPN signed a new long-term agreement with Major League Baseball. This deal extends our rights through 2021 season and significantly enhances our current deal with more games, greater coexist rights and an increase in annual studio programming hours of more than 100%. Extending our partnership with Major League Baseball further strengthens our unrivaled sports content portfolio, which continues to make ESPN the #1 destination for sports fans, as well as cable television's most valuable network. 
Operating income at Broadcasting was down modestly compared to last year due to lower advertising revenue at the ABC Network partially offset by higher program sales. Lower advertising revenue at the network was driven by lower primetime ratings. Higher program sales were driven by the sale of Castle and Wipeout in the quarter. 
At the ABC Network, quarter-to-date scatter pricing is pacing midteens above upfront levels. ESPN ad sales are pacing down modestly, and ABC Family ad sales are pacing up high single digits. TV station ad sales are pacing up mid single digits as well. 
Our Parks and Resorts segment delivered solid results, with revenue up 9% and operating income up 18%. The increase in operating income was due to higher results at our international resorts and Disney Cruise Line. Total segment margins were up 100 basis points compared to last year. Growth initiatives reduced segment margin expansion by about 90 basis points. 
Results at our international resorts were high due to increased attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland Paris. Royalties from the Tokyo Disney Resort were also higher versus prior year quarter. Higher operating income at Disney Cruise Line was driven by the increased passenger cruise days due to the launch of the Disney Fantasy. 
Results at our domestic parks were comparable to prior year as growth at the Disneyland Resort was largely offset by higher costs at Walt Disney World as a result of our growth initiatives. We are encouraged by Disneyland Resorts' overall performance in the quarter and are particularly pleased with its attendance and per capita spending results following the opening of Cars Land in June. Overall, domestic attendance was up 3% driven by strong attendance at the Disneyland Resort. Per capita spending at our domestic parks was up 7% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending. 
Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 8%. The increase in per room spending was driven by higher pricing and higher merchandise spending. Occupancy at our domestic hotels was down 3 percentage points to 78% due to an increase in available rooms at Walt Disney World. The increase in available room nights was driven by the completion of the final phase of Disney's Art of Animation Hotel. So far this quarter, domestic hotel reservations are pacing up mid single digits compared to prior year levels, while book rates are also up. 
At Studio Entertainment, the decrease in operating income was driven by lower worldwide theatrical results and higher film cost write-downs, which were partially offset by stronger performance of our worldwide home entertainment business. 
Worldwide theatrical results were lower due to the strong performance of Cars 2 and Lion King 3D last year compared to Brave and Finding Nemo 3D, as well as higher pre-released marketing expenses compared to prior year. Worldwide home entertainment results were up due to higher unit sales and increased effective pricing driven by the successful release of Marvel's The Avengers. 
At Consumer Products, operating income was up in the quarter due to higher results in merchandise licensing and retail. Growth in licensing was driven by higher earned royalties due to the strong performance of Spiderman and The Avengers merchandise. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 5%. Higher retail operating income was primarily driven by strong results in North America and Europe. 
At the Interactive segment, lower operating losses compared to prior year were due to continued improvement in our social games business, which benefited from lower impact to purchase accounting. Results in our console game business faced a difficult comparison to the performance of Cars 2 and Pirates LEGO in the prior year, with no comparable titles in the quarter this year. 
I would now like to turn to fiscal 2013. Overall, we feel great about our prospects for this fiscal year, but I would like to discuss a few timing and comparability issues, particularly related to Q1, and provide some insight into a few cost considerations for 2013. At Cable, domestic sports rights costs will be $170 million higher in Q1 versus last year driven by increases in college football, NFL and NBA programming. 
College football increase is due to our new deals with the Pac-12 and the Big 12, along with the expansion of the SEC. Our Q1 NBA costs will be higher compared to last year when fewer games were played in Q1 due to the lockout. However, ESPN's full year results will reflect the benefit of several new affiliate deals, one of which will commence in the second quarter. 
At Studio, we face a very difficult home entertainment comparison in Q1 given strong operating income from Cars 2 and the Lion King last year. Specifically, we expect this comparison to drive a year-over-year decline in home entertainment operating income of more than $150 million. Cars 2 delivered very strong home entertainment operating income last year, driven in part by lower cost allocations given to the strength -- given the strength of its merchandise licensing revenue. The strong performance of the Lion King was volume driven as the title had not been available on home video since January 2005. 
Our Q1 Parks and Resorts results will be impacted by a timing shift due to our fiscal calendar as a portion of the New Year's holiday will shift from fiscal Q1 to fiscal Q2. We estimate this will shift about $30 million in operating income from Q1 to Q2. 
2013 will benefit from a full year of performance from both the Disney Fantasy and Disney California Adventure. We expect these 2 projects to be accretive to operating income. However, the games will be offset this year by incremental spending for projects in Orlando and Shanghai. In Orlando, we're continuing to work on the guest experience enhancement project Bob discussed. In Shanghai, we're beginning to ramp up spending for our new theme park. So in fiscal 2013, in aggregate, all of our growth initiatives, both launched and to be launched, will contribute roughly $500 million of both incremental revenue and expense. We expect these initiatives to be accretive to operating income in fiscal 2014 and increasingly add to operating income each year thereafter and each to deliver returns above our cost of capital. 
We expect the Q1 tax rate to be about 2 percentage points higher than last year due to the benefit of tax settlements in prior year. Pension and postretirement medical expenses will increase by approximately $70 million in fiscal 2013 due to a decline in discount rate. On top of these items, we do expect Superstorm Sandy to impact our Q1 results, though it's a little too early to quantify that. 
This list of comparability and one-time items that I've just shared with you will impact our Q1 reported earnings. But rest assured, we remain confident that our operating performance for the remaining quarters will result in solid earnings growth for the entire 2013 fiscal year. 
We continue to repurchase our stock during the fourth quarter with 19.1 million shares repurchased for about $973 million. For the fiscal year, we repurchased 72 million shares for $3 billion. So far this quarter, we have repurchased 8.2 million shares for $490 million. Over the next 2 quarters, we expect to repurchase in the open market up to 40 million shares in connection with the Lucasfilm acquisition, and that's in addition to our regular share of repurchase. 
2012 was another great year for our company, and in 2013, we expect to deliver another year of strong operating performance. Now I'll turn the call over to Lowell for questions."

One, the greater penetration of DVRs and the greater usage of DVRs, which clearly have shifted the rating in the direction of C3 and ultimately, hopefully C7 because I think it speaks for an expanded look from a Nielsen and advertising perspective at 7 days versus 3. And I think the other story is that there seems to be somewhat of an absence of what I call new big real sort of buzzworthy hits. And because of that, I would say that it would be premature to either write the epitaph or suggest that we're seeing a trend. We've seen years where the presence of a big hit -- by the way, as in the case with NBC, if you look at the impact of The Voice on their schedule, it has improved their numbers dramatically. So I think I'm happy to believe that ABC's schedule is pretty solid. Their Sunday schedule with Once Upon a Time and Revenge is working, and they've got Modern Family and Grey's, and others show some real strong base. And their ratings from a C3 perspective without sports are down in the 7% to 8% range, which I don't consider to be that noteworthy. What I'd like to -- what I like ABC to put on the schedule a really big hit at the beginning of the year, of course. But they put on a few shows that are I think quite serviceable and have potential, Nashville being one."

And we are still very confident that this will be a strong year for us in terms of performance. The -- obviously, the comparability, just to go through it, the large items, the one we just talked about in terms of costs associated with these guest enhancements before the revenue comes in. Secondly, the home video comparison, where we'll be off pretty substantially on a comparability basis there because if you think about Cars 2, which was not only a successful video title but because of all of the merchandise success in prior periods around that title, that bleeds off a lot of the amortization that goes with the making of that film. When you -- because consumer product sales are part of the ultimate package in which the film is amortized against. So a lot of that was bled off in prior periods, which made that a particularly profitable title a year ago in the home video front. Brave was also a profitable title, but it doesn't have the benefit of bleeding off all of that amortization when the units sell. So that has created a very tough comparison. And then I mentioned Lion King versus Finding Nemo through -- in terms of its release, where the Lion King had been kind of in the vault since 2005 and, of course, had enormous response in the marketplace due to that. Nemo was more available on a regular basis in the market and therefore didn't benefit from that bump. So those 2 factors are about $150 million, but that's a first quarter event. And that is not -- that doesn't affect our performance at the studio in the rest of the 3 quarters of the year. The tax number I ticked off again is -- has to do with a tax favorability in the prior year. It's a first quarter event as well, of course, because taxes tend to -- you tend to carry that for the whole year. We'll have a little bit up in our tax -- our effective tax rate for the year but not as much as in the first quarter. So I tried to emphasize, and it's always difficult, in prepared remarks to kind of emphasize that these are really largely comparability items that we're trying to give you info on in the first quarter and are not to lead you to believe we don't have confidence in strong results for the whole year."

I could start with our theme parks. While we haven't really had a gender problem at our theme parks, we've always been mindful of what we're offering is something for everybody. And as some of the IP gravitated more in the girls' direction, it made us turn to some other IP that maybe wasn't derived from movies or television series, for instance, in order to essentially deliver against the -- basically, the interest of our guests. Obviously, we've had Star Wars in the past. This gives us the ability to expand that presence in our parks. Marvel, in certain circumstances, because you may recall there are some encumbrances there, will give us an opportunity to expand, but -- that mostly internationally. So that's one way. Obviously, on the TV front, we launched or we relaunched a channel a few years back called Disney XD, which had other names in its past. If Disney Channel is focused a little bit more on girls than boys, this is going to be focused a little bit more on boys than girls. We started to roll out Marvel shows there. We referenced in our comments about the Lucasfilm acquisition if there are opportunities for television. One big opportunity for us in Lucasfilm's derived IP is on that channel. Again, it gives the ability to fulfill promise of that channel that much quicker. The footprint from Consumer Products obviously will give us much more of a blend. That enhances our relationship in the marketplace with retailers and with licensees as a for instance and just generally broadens the profile of the brand. Lucas product, by the way, will be co-branded with Disney's name on it. And then, of course, on the games front, we also have that ability to turn more to Disney IP, particularly since games are a little bit more boys-driven anyway. And so I don't want to -- we'll proceed with caution in this direction, but I think it enhances our opportunity particularly in the mobile space, which is very driven by boys."

The Lucasfilm acquisition, even though I just responded to your question about boys in a manner that would suggest we might not have felt strategically complete from a gender perspective. Imagine talking about being strategically complete from a gender perspective. I think I should be shot for that. But we don't necessarily make acquisitions to fill in strategicals, and we didn't in the Lucas case. That was an opportunity to buy IP that, as I described, is unparalleled really in terms of its value, the strength of its franchise and the potential that it represents particularly or especially to a company like ours. And we're not looking right now at anything from an acquisition perspective that is in any way tied to something that we would consider strategical."

We've approached that, I guess, with some degree of caution because of the obvious risks associated with being a specialty retail bricks-and-mortar business, so it's not going to change our footprint. It will change our SKU makeup at the stores is a great opportunity as we saw with Marvel to infuse our stores with Star Wars merchandise, for instance, and we look forward to doing that. And also to grow our online retail or our e-commerce business, which, by the way, has grown very, very nicely since the relaunch of disney.com. And noticing -- what we've noticed in terms of sale of Lucasfilm merchandise online, we think there's real potential there. To the first question, we were not specific about the deal that we referenced that was impacted, I guess, the fourth quarter a year ago, and we won't be specific. You're pretty good at guessing, but I'll leave it at that. We feel very, very good about opportunities in SVOD and on digital platforms, as we've seen and other large media companies have seen the opportunities to monetize owned IP are only growing not just because of new technology but globally.

And during the period of time that we've owned Pixar, the equity in the Disney brand, no matter how you measure it, has also increased. So I think we've demonstrated our ability to be ambidextrous in that regard. We also co-brand Pixar films with Disney. And we found in the process that, that enhances both impression of the Pixar brand and impression of the Disney brand. Marvel has seen, I think, real strong brand growth. That's largely been tied to a couple of things. One, quality of their films, particularly the last 3: Captain America, Thor and obviously Avengers. But also, and the growth of their -- the presence of the brand, which is in part enhanced by self-distribution. So when we take over the distribution of their films, for instance, and we are also the owner of the brand, we're much more focused on growing the brand in the process than the third-party distributors that distributes their product before we're interested in. So there are opportunities there. The Star Wars brand, I think, basically doesn't need much help except to, obviously, will I think benefit greatly from the release of a film. We intend in that case to co-brand, as I mentioned just a few minutes ago, Disney-Lucas or Disney-Star Wars in some form, different forms. And I think that's again another opportunity like Pixar to enhance both the Star Wars brand and the Disney brand. ESPN's doing just fine. ABC is also doing fine, although from a brand perspective, we leveraged the ABC name obviously in much more limited fashion than we do the other brands that we've been talking about."

A lot of the capital expenditure that is behind what Bob talked about as guest-enhancing technologies is behind us.

I'm very happy to report that Disney has delivered yet another record annual performance, driven by improved results in each of our businesses. In the fiscal 2012 year, Disney achieved record revenue, net income and earnings per share. Net income was up by 18% for the year on a 3% increase in revenue, and our earnings per share adjusted for comparability were up 21% over last year. 
I'm also very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were primarily driven by growth at Cable Networks and Parks and Resorts. Net income grew by 14%, and revenue was up 3% for the quarter. And our EPS for Q4 adjusted for comparability grew 15% to $0.68. These results once again demonstrate our ability to grow earnings in the near term while investing for the long term, and we're obviously proud of our performance. 
Before I get into the highlights of fiscal 2012, I just want to mention the tremendous creative resurgence we are seeing at Disney Animation. Building on the success of Tangled, our newest release, Wreck-It Ralph, just had a phenomenal opening weekend, bigger than any previous Disney animated movie. With $58.6 million in domestic box office so far, Wreck-It Ralph continues the creative momentum that started with our acquisition of Pixar. Pixar deal brought us more than just great Pixar movies. It also reinvigorated our entire animation pipeline led by the great team of John Lasseter and Ed Catmull.
Looking back, fiscal 2012 was a great year for Disney by every measure: creatively, financially and strategically. Marvel had a fantastic year, capped by the extraordinary success of The Avengers, which became the world's third highest grossing movie of all time, a global phenomenon and an incredibly important franchise for us. 
Pixar also generated a great deal of value for us this year from the opening of the phenomenal Cars Land to transform Disney California Adventure into an extraordinary park, to the opening of BRAVE, which became Pixar's 13th consecutive movie to debut #1 at the box office. 
We opened 2 new lands in Hong Kong Disneyland, completed the first phase of our historic multiyear expansion of Fantasyland in Walt Disney World and made significant progress in Shanghai to keep development on track to open by the end of 2015. 
With the addition of the Disney Fantasy last March, we've now more than doubled our cruise business, and this year, we were named the #1 large cruise line by readers of Condé Nast Traveler magazine. 
ESPN was a strong contributor for the year as well, adding Wimbledon to its world-class sports lineup, along with higher ratings, ad sales and affiliate revenue. ESPN also solidified its position in some critical sports, including college football and basketball and major league baseball. 
Disney Channels worldwide continued to be an important brand and business driver for our company, reaching approximately 425 million homes in 167 countries. In 2002, we introduced Disney Junior and Disney XD to new markets around the world and also launched our first over-the-air Disney Channel in Russia. 
We also completed our strategic acquisition of UTV, making Disney India's leading -- making Disney India's leading film studio and TV producer, as well as one of the country's leading broadcasters, reaching more than 100 million viewers every week. 
And looking ahead, our Shanghai development is moving into an exciting phase as the construction work starts to define the shape of things to come and our vision starts to become reality. We look forward to completing our Hong Kong Disneyland expansion, which should only enhance the park's current strong performance. And we're also very excited about the ongoing Fantasyland transformation at Walt Disney World. It's the largest expansion of the Magic Kingdom since that park opened more than 40 years ago, and it's going to be pretty spectacular. 
And also in Florida, we're very excited about a new technology rollout designed to enhance guest experience and advance and expand guest engagement before their visits. We will provide details early next year, but among the many features and benefits of this technology is giving guests the chance to plan their itineraries ahead of time, including access to their favorite and often our most popular attractions. 
On the studio front, we're going to follow the success of Wreck-It Ralph with 4 major films this fiscal year: Oz The Great and Powerful opens on March 8, and Marvel's Iron Man 3 will be in theaters May 3. And this coming summer, Pixar's Monsters University will open on June 21, followed by The Lone Ranger on July 3. 
As all of you know, last week, we announced our acquisition of Lucasfilm. And upon closing, we believe it will fit right in with Disney, ABC, ESPN, Pixar and Marvel in our unparalleled portfolio of phenomenal assets and world-class brands. And when you look at all the franchises and IP ever created in the history of entertainment and rank them in terms of value, Star Wars is always at or near the very top of that list. It is the very definition of a franchise. It has global appeal, stands the test of time, 35 years so far, and we see great potential well into the future. It enjoys strong unwavering popularity with hundreds of millions of fans even in the absence of a new theatrical release in the last 7 years. 
Star Wars is an incredibly relevant and vibrant franchise, with tremendous opportunity for global growth, especially with the new slate of feature films starting with Star Wars Episode 7 in 2015. The addition of Lucasfilm to our strong portfolio of assets will continue to fuel Disney's creative engine across our entire company to create additional value for our shareholders. 
We're obviously very pleased with what we've achieved in fiscal 2012, and overall, we believe we're well positioned for continued strong performance and growth. I'm now going to turn the call over to Jay Rasulo to go through the details. Jay?"

We're pleased with our fourth quarter results, ending yet another record year of financial performance for the company. We reported record revenue, net income and earnings per share in fiscal 2012, surpassing last year's record results. 
Our performance is the result of relentless focus on maximizing the value of our existing assets and realizing returns from recent investments while continuing to invest for future growth. We believe this balanced approach will deliver consistent and attractive returns for our shareholders for years to come. 
I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing the fourth quarter in more detail, and then I'll bring -- I'll highlight a few 2013 items. In Q4, Media Networks was the largest contributor to our performance, driven by growth in operating income at Cable Networks due to continued growth at ESPN and higher equity income at A&E Television Networks. 
Growth at ESPN was due to an increase in affiliate revenue, which was driven by higher rates, partially offset by higher programming costs for college football and Major League Baseball, as well as our new Wimbledon contract. Higher equity income at A&E Television Networks during the quarter resulted from increases in advertising and affiliate revenue. 
Advertising revenue at ESPN was flat for the quarter as higher rates were offset by lower ratings. We experienced a less robust marketplace around the Olympics, and we did not see as strong a pickup in demand as we expected after the Olympics ended. 
During the quarter, ESPN signed a new long-term agreement with Major League Baseball. This deal extends our rights through 2021 season and significantly enhances our current deal with more games, greater coexist rights and an increase in annual studio programming hours of more than 100%. Extending our partnership with Major League Baseball further strengthens our unrivaled sports content portfolio, which continues to make ESPN the #1 destination for sports fans, as well as cable television's most valuable network. 
Operating income at Broadcasting was down modestly compared to last year due to lower advertising revenue at the ABC Network partially offset by higher program sales. Lower advertising revenue at the network was driven by lower primetime ratings. Higher program sales were driven by the sale of Castle and Wipeout in the quarter. 
At the ABC Network, quarter-to-date scatter pricing is pacing mid-teens above upfront levels. ESPN ad sales are pacing down modestly, and ABC Family ad sales are pacing up high single digits. TV station ad sales are pacing up mid single digits as well. 
Our Parks and Resorts segment delivered solid results, with revenue up 9% and operating income up 18%. The increase in operating income was due to higher results at our international resorts and Disney Cruise Line. Total segment margins were up 100 basis points compared to last year. Growth initiatives reduced segment margin expansion by about 90 basis points. 
Results at our international resorts were high due to increased attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland Paris. Royalties from the Tokyo Disney Resort were also higher versus prior year quarter. Higher operating income at Disney Cruise Line was driven by the increased passenger cruise days due to the launch of the Disney Fantasy. 
Results at our domestic parks were comparable to prior year as growth at the Disneyland Resort was largely offset by higher costs at Walt Disney World as a result of our growth initiatives. We are encouraged by Disneyland Resorts' overall performance in the quarter and are particularly pleased with its attendance and per capita spending results following the opening of Cars Land in June. Overall, domestic attendance was up 3% driven by strong attendance at the Disneyland Resort. Per capita spending at our domestic parks was up 7% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending. 
Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 8%. The increase in per room spending was driven by higher pricing and higher merchandise spending. Occupancy at our domestic hotels was down 3 percentage points to 78% due to an increase in available rooms at Walt Disney World. The increase in available room nights was driven by the completion of the final phase of Disney's Art of Animation Hotel. So far this quarter, domestic hotel reservations are pacing up mid single digits compared to prior year levels, while book rates are also up. 
At Studio Entertainment, the decrease in operating income was driven by lower worldwide theatrical results and higher film cost write-downs, which were partially offset by stronger performance of our worldwide home entertainment business. 
Worldwide theatrical results were lower due to the strong performance of Cars 2 and Lion King 3D last year compared to BRAVE and Finding Nemo 3D, as well as higher pre-released marketing expenses compared to prior year. Worldwide home entertainment results were up due to higher unit sales and increased effective pricing driven by the successful release of Marvel's The Avengers. 
At Consumer Products, operating income was up in the quarter due to higher results in merchandise licensing and retail. Growth in licensing was driven by higher earned royalties due to the strong performance of Spiderman and The Avengers merchandise. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 5%. Higher retail operating income was primarily driven by strong results in North America and Europe. 
At the Interactive segment, lower operating losses compared to prior year were due to continued improvement in our social games business, which benefited from lower impact to purchase accounting. Results in our console game business faced a difficult comparison to the performance of Cars 2 and Pirates LEGO in the prior year, with no comparable titles in the quarter this year. 
I would now like to turn to fiscal 2013. Overall, we feel great about our prospects for this fiscal year, but I would like to discuss a few timing and comparability issues, particularly related to Q1, and provide some insight into a few cost considerations for 2013. At Cable, domestic sports rights costs will be $170 million higher in Q1 versus last year driven by increases in college football, NFL and NBA programming. 
College football increase is due to our new deals with the Pac-12 and the Big 12, along with the expansion of the SEC. Our Q1 NBA costs will be higher compared to last year when fewer games were played in Q1 due to the lockout. However, ESPN's full year results will reflect the benefit of several new affiliate deals, one of which will commence in the second quarter. 
At Studio, we face a very difficult home entertainment comparison in Q1 given strong operating income from Cars 2 and the Lion King last year. Specifically, we expect this comparison to drive a year-over-year decline in home entertainment operating income of more than $150 million. Cars 2 delivered very strong home entertainment operating income last year, driven in part by lower cost allocations given to the strength -- given the strength of its merchandise licensing revenue. The strong performance of the Lion King was volume driven as the title had not been available on home video since January 2005. 
Our Q1 Parks and Resorts results will be impacted by a timing shift due to our fiscal calendar as a portion of the New Year's holiday will shift from fiscal Q1 to fiscal Q2. We estimate this will shift about $30 million in operating income from Q1 to Q2. 
2013 will benefit from a full year of performance from both the Disney Fantasy and Disney California Adventure. We expect these 2 projects to be accretive to operating income. However, the gains will be offset this year by incremental spending for projects in Orlando and Shanghai. In Orlando, we're continuing to work on the guest experience enhancement project Bob discussed. In Shanghai, we're beginning to ramp up spending for our new theme park. So in fiscal 2013, in aggregate, all of our growth initiatives, both launched and to be launched, will contribute roughly $500 million of both incremental revenue and expense. We expect these initiatives to be accretive to operating income in fiscal 2014 and increasingly add to operating income each year thereafter and each to deliver returns above our cost of capital. 
We expect the Q1 tax rate to be about 2 percentage points higher than last year due to the benefit of tax settlements in prior year. Pension and postretirement medical expenses will increase by approximately $70 million in fiscal 2013 due to a decline in discount rate. On top of these items, we do expect Superstorm Sandy to impact our Q1 results, though it's a little too early to quantify that. 
This list of comparability and one-time items that I've just shared with you will impact our Q1 reported earnings. But rest assured, we remain confident that our operating performance for the remaining quarters will result in solid earnings growth for the entire 2013 fiscal year. 
We continued to repurchase our stock during the fourth quarter with 19.1 million shares repurchased for about $973 million. For the fiscal year, we repurchased 72 million shares for $3 billion. So far this quarter, we have repurchased 8.2 million shares for $419 million. Over the next 2 quarters, we expect to repurchase in the open market up to 40 million shares in connection with the Lucasfilm acquisition, and that's in addition to our regular share repurchase. 
2012 was another great year for our company, and in 2013, we expect to deliver another year of strong operating performance. Now I'll turn the call over to Lowell for questions."

One, the greater penetration of DVRs and the greater usage of DVRs, which clearly have shifted the rating in the direction of C3 and ultimately, hopefully C7 because I think it speaks for an expanded look from a Nielsen and advertising perspective at 7 days versus 3. And I think the other story is that there seems to be somewhat of an absence of what I call new big real sort of buzzworthy hits. And because of that, I would say that it would be premature to either write the epitaph or suggest that we're seeing a trend. We've seen years where the presence of a big hit -- by the way, as in the case with NBC, if you look at the impact of The Voice on their schedule, it has improved their numbers dramatically. So I think I'm happy to believe that ABC's schedule is pretty solid. Their Sunday schedule with Once Upon a Time and Revenge is working, and they've got Modern Family and Grey's, and others show some real strong base. And their ratings from a C3 perspective without sports are down in the 7% to 8% range, which I don't consider to be that noteworthy. What I'd like to -- would I have liked ABC to have put on the schedule a really big hit at the beginning of the year? Of course. But they put on a few shows that are I think quite serviceable and have potential, Nashville being one."

I don't want to be -- I don't want to give too much guidance on where that takes us from a margin perspective. I -- we have said for some period of time that there is no reason structurally, including, by the way, what I just said about these new initiatives that will ultimately keep us from reaching our prerecession margin levels at the Parks. So I think that is your -- I hope that answers your question. On the attendance trends on the 2 coasts, obviously, the great success of Cars Land both from a quality and from a quantity perspective in terms of attendance and pricing has reflected itself in Disneyland Resort, greatly outgrowing Walt Disney World. I'll say that Walt Disney World's attendance was down modestly, but Disneyland's attendance was up substantially, resulting, if you add the 2 together, in domestic attendance being up 3% that I mentioned."

The product is already, in some cases, open and doing really well, and we think that's going to drive some attendance gains at that park.

And we are still very confident that this will be a strong year for us in terms of performance. The -- obviously, the comparability, just to go through it, the large items, the one we just talked about in terms of costs associated with these guest enhancements before the revenue comes in. Secondly, the home video comparison, where we'll be off pretty substantially on a comparability basis there because if you think about Cars 2, which was not only a successful video title but because of all of the merchandise success in prior periods around that title, that bleeds off a lot of the amortization that goes with the making of that film. When you -- because consumer product sales are part of the ultimate package in which the film is amortized against. So a lot of that was bled off in prior periods, which made that a particularly profitable title a year ago in the home video front. BRAVE was also a profitable title, but it doesn't have the benefit of bleeding off all of that amortization when the units sell. So that has created a very tough comparison. And then I mentioned the Lion King versus Finding Nemo through -- in terms of its release, where the Lion King had been kind of in the vault since 2005 and, of course, had enormous response in the marketplace due to that. Nemo was more available on a regular basis in the market and therefore didn't benefit from that bump. So those 2 factors are about $150 million, but that's a first quarter event. And that is not -- that doesn't affect our performance at the studio in the rest of the 3 quarters of the year. The tax number I ticked off again is -- has to do with a tax favorability in the prior year. It's a first quarter event as well, of course, because taxes tend to -- you tend to carry that for the whole year. We'll have a little bit up in our tax -- our effective tax rate for the year but not as much as in the first quarter. So I tried to emphasize, and it's always difficult, in prepared remarks to kind of emphasize that these are really largely comparability items that we're trying to give you info on in the first quarter and are not to lead you to believe we don't have confidence in strong results for the whole year."

I could start with our theme parks. While we haven't really had a gender problem at our theme parks, we've always been mindful of what we're offering is something for everybody. And as some of the IP gravitated more in the girls' direction, it made us turn to some other IP that maybe wasn't derived from movies or television series, for instance, in order to essentially deliver against the -- basically, the interest of our guests. Obviously, we've had Star Wars in the past. This gives us the ability to expand that presence in our parks. Marvel, in certain circumstances, because you may recall there are some encumbrances there, will give us an opportunity to expand, but -- that mostly internationally. So that's one way. Obviously, on the TV front, we launched or we relaunched a channel a few years back called Disney XD, which had other names in its past. If Disney Channel is focused a little bit more on girls than boys, this is going to be focused a little bit more on boys than girls. We started to roll out Marvel shows there. We referenced in our comments about the Lucasfilm acquisition if there are opportunities for television. One big opportunity for us in Lucasfilm's derived IP is on that channel. Again, it gives the ability to fulfill promise of that channel that much quicker. The footprint from Consumer Products obviously will give us much more of a blend. That enhances our relationship in the marketplace with retailers and with licensees as a for instance and just generally broadens the profile of the brand. Lucas product, by the way, will be co-branded with Disney's name on it. And then, of course, on the games front, we also have that ability to turn more to Disney IP, particularly since games are a little bit more boys-driven anyway. And so I don't want to -- we'll proceed with caution in this direction, but I think it enhances our opportunity particularly in the mobile space, which is very driven by boys."

And during the period of time that we've owned Pixar, the equity in the Disney brand, no matter how you measure it, has also increased. So I think we've demonstrated our ability to be ambidextrous in that regard. We also co-brand Pixar films with Disney. And we found in the process that, that enhances both impression of the Pixar brand and impression of the Disney brand. Marvel has seen, I think, real strong brand growth. That's largely been tied to a couple of things. One, quality of their films, particularly the last 3: Captain America, Thor and obviously Avengers. But also, and the growth of their -- the presence of the brand, which is in part enhanced by self-distribution. So when we take over the distribution of their films, for instance, and we are also the owner of the brand, we're much more focused on growing the brand in the process than the third-party distributors that distributed their product before were interested in. So there are opportunities there. The Star Wars brand, I think, basically doesn't need much help except to, obviously, will I think benefit greatly from the release of a film. We intend in that case to co-brand, as I mentioned just a few minutes ago, Disney-Lucas or Disney-Star Wars in some form, different forms. And I think that's again another opportunity like Pixar to enhance both the Star Wars brand and the Disney brand. ESPN's doing just fine. ABC is also doing fine, although from a brand perspective, we leveraged the ABC name obviously in much more limited fashion than we do the other brands that we've been talking about."

They will generate operating -- positive operating income in the year. The guest enhancement project that Bob talked about and Shanghai Disneyland are still in the investment -- not the investment, in the sort of generating operating income -- there is investment, but generating operating expense that exceeds any revenue that they will generate. So if you look at all these things in aggregate, the Disney Cruise Line expansion, the Fantasyland expansion, Disney's California, the guest enhancement program that we're talking about and Shanghai Disneyland, in aggregate, their incremental expenses will match the aggregate incremental revenue. So they will generate $500 million of incremental revenue and $500 million of incremental expense."

If you look on the domestic side, we're -- domestic parks side, we're probably down -- will be down by -- at the end of fiscal '13 about $1 billion from where we were in fiscal '12 in terms of capital expenditures. A lot of the capital expenditure that is behind what Bob talked about as guest-enhancing technologies is behind us. On a consolidated basis, though, it's only going to look like a $500 million decrease. And in fact, the difference has to do with investment in Shanghai Disneyland. But remember, as only 43% owners of that project, we only spend 43% of the capital. So 57% of the capital spent on Shanghai Disneyland will make its way back to us in a financing line.
