For the full year, we delivered revenue of almost $107 billion, which",3337,"Thank you for joining us today. In the fourth quarter, we grew revenue, expanded growth, pretax and net margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $4.71, up 11% year-to-year. For the full year, we delivered revenue of almost $107 billion, which was up 7%, operating pretax income of $21.6 billion, up 9% and operating EPS of $13.44, up 15%. Our 2011 results put us well on track towards 2015 roadmap objective.
Looking at the fourth quarter by segment, we continue to build our momentum in software. Our performance reflecting both strong demand for our offerings and leadership sales execution. Our software revenue was up 9%, driven by aggressive growth in our focus areas like Smarter Commerce, Business Analytics and Storage solutions. Our software profit was up 12%. 
Our Services business delivered powerful margin and profit growth, with combined pretax income of 17%. Services revenue growth was again led by growth markets, which were up 13% at constant currency. Our total services backlog ended the year at $141 billion. At constant currency, that's flat year-to-year and up $5 billion since September. Within hardware powered systems was up 6% as we continue to drive competitive displacements. We've now had 15 consecutive quarters of share gains in units. In fact, with the exception of mainframe, which was coming off of the biggest quarter in its history last year, each of our 16 brands across the company gained or held share. 
Turning to profit, our ongoing focus and productivity, together with the relative strength of our software business, drove strong margin performance. Our operating gross margin was up 1.1 points to over 50%. We extended operating pretax margin almost a full point and grew pretax income 6%. And while our tax rate was up year-to-year, we still expanded net margins above our model rate. 
When you put these all together, we delivered operating EPS of $4.71, which was up 11% and $13.44 for the year, up 15%, making this our ninth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth.
Our strong earnings performance drove $9 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $15.6 billion for the year. With that cash, we continue to invest in capital and acquisitions, and we delivered significant returns to shareholders with over $18 billion in share repurchase and dividends this year. 
Looking forward, we're confident in our ability to continue to leverage our business model to expand margin, grow profit, generate cash and return value to shareholders. And in 2012, we expect to deliver at least $14.85 of operating earnings per share for the year.
For the fourth quarter, revenue at constant currency was in line with our expectations. While currency provided a benefit to revenue growth of about 25 basis points in the quarter, currency movement, since we announced our third quarter earnings in October, impacted our revenue by about a point of growth or $300 million. 
Looking at the geographies on a constant currency basis, revenue on our major market countries was essentially flat year-to-year. In the Americas, Canada had terrific performance, up 13%. The U.S. grew 1% off of last year's very strong growth of 10%. In Europe, our growth rate improved compared to the third quarter. Germany return to growth, up 4% and once again we had good growth in U.K. and Spain, which were each up 9%. We've now had 9 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth in the U.K. and Spain has now grown 5 consecutive quarters, leveraging its global relationships.
Our growth markets outpaced the major markets by 8 points of revenue growth. The BRIC had another good quarter, combined they were up 11%. And with nearly 2/3 of our growth markets business outside the BRICs, all together, we had double-digit growth in 40 growth market countries, so our performance was broad-based. 
We're continuing to expand into new countries and territories to build out IT infrastructures in support of economic growth and to take a leadership position in key industries. This year to drive market expansion, we opened 92 new branches, and we added over 1,500 new sales reps. We gained 4 points of share this quarter and 4 points for the year. In 2011, our growth markets grew 11%, which outpaced the majors by 10 finance and growth markets now make up 22% of our geographic revenue. 
Turning to revenue, our gross margin by segment, Global Technology Services constant currency revenue growth rate was consistent with the third quarter while our Global Business Services growth rate improved. In both segments, we had great year-to-year performance in the growth markets, with double-digit constant currency revenue growth and expanding margins. 
Our software business had another fantastic quarter, with strength across the portfolio, web sphere Information Management and Tivoli all had very good growth and gained share. 
In Systems and Technology, last year, we had a great fourth quarter with over 20% growth driven by a new mainframe that had almost 70% revenue growth. This quarter, we wrapped around that performance. And we had strength in POWER as we continue to extend our share gains. 
Turning to gross profit, our operating gross margins improved 1.1 points to over 50%, driven by a combination of good margin expansion in both Services segment and an improving segment mix due to the relative strength of software. The services margin improvement was driven by a number of factors including productivity improvements and mix to higher value offerings and markets. 
For hardware, our product mix negatively impacted margin. 
Finally, our Global Financing business, which is better measured by return on equity, this quarter delivered return on equity of 42%. Now that's impressive. So now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile.
Our total operating expense and other income was up 2%, in line with our revenue growth. Acquisitions over the last 12 months contributed a point of growth. And our base expense was up 1%. There was effectively no year-to-year impact from the combination of currency translation and hedging dynamics. 
I'll comment on a couple of expense items that had larger year-to-year impacts to our profit. As you can see from our income statement, IP income was down $65 million year-to-year. Second, we had an increase of about $55 million in our accounts receivable provisions, though our reserve coverage us down 30 basis points from a year ago and down 20 points since September. 
Typically, we talk about the impact of our hedging programs as a driver of expense. However, this quarter was effectively no year-to-year impact on expense due to our hedging programs. Consistent with the fact that currency ended up being fairly neutral on a year-to-year basis.
So now let me get into the segments. The 2 services segments delivered $15.3 billion in revenue, up 3%. The combined Services segments grew pretax profits 17% and pretax margin was up 2.1 points. Total outsourcing revenue was $7.2 billion, up 4% and total transactional revenue was $6.2 billion, up 3%. 
Overall growth was driven by the growth markets, with constant currency revenue up double digits to the outsourcing, transactional and maintenance businesses. Total backlog in the quarter was $141 billion. At constant currency, that is flat year-to-year and up $5 billion quarter-to-quarter. 
Moving on to the 2 segments in Global Technology Services, revenue was $10.5 billion, up 3%. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 3% and we gained share in the quarter and full year. Integrated Technology Services revenue grew 5%. We had great performance in the growth markets where we're seeing the benefits of geographic expansion and offerings like business continuity and resiliency services. Global Technology Services delivered very strong profit and margin this quarter, with pretax income up 18% and pretax margin up 2.3 points to 18%. This margin expansion were driven by productivity and cost management, along with a mix into higher-margin growth markets. We had gross margin improvement in all lines of business, outsourcing, ETS and maintenance. 
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.9 billion, up 3%. Application Outsourcing revenue was up 5%, led by strong performance in the growth markets. Consulting and Systems Integration, which includes consulting, AMS systems integration and the U.S. federal business, grew 2%. At constant currency, our growth rate improved over last quarter. Overall GBS revenue continue to be impacted by Japan and public sector. So total GBS revenue, excluding Japan and public sector was up 9% at constant currency and up 8% for the year. And although the declines in Japan and public sector continued, we did see some improved performance in public sector.
Global Business Services delivered very strong profit and margin performance again this quarter. Pretax profit was up 14% year-to-year with pretax margin up 1.8 points to 16.6%. 
Now I want to spend a minute on backlog and run out as we begin 2012.
Last year, in the fourth quarter, we took you through an analysis of the key drivers of Services revenue. We focused the discussion around outsourcing and in particular the revenue generated by the run out of the outsourcing backlog. This year, we have expanded that analysis to give a view of the Total Services backlog run out. This view is more comprehensive and more indicative of the Total Services business as we start the year. 
There are 3 primary drivers of Total Services revenue: Backlog, sales into our existing contract base and new client signings. At very high percentage of services revenue, roughly 70%, comes from the run out of the backlog we start the year with. In 2012, we expect about 3% revenue growth from that backlog. This gives us a very solid base of revenue to begin the year. With the remaining revenue coming from sales into our existing accounts, which had been on a good trajectory and new client signings.
So with that, let me wrap up the year in Services. We had very consistent revenue performance in the year, driven by stability in the backlog. We continue to build our services within the growth markets, with Total Services revenue up double digits in those markets and strong margins with gross margin 2 points higher than that in the majors. We continue to get good traction in the growth initiatives, cloud, Business Analytics and Smarter Planet. And we had great profit and margin performance in both Services segments, with GTS pretax profit up 14% and GBS up 18% as we mix the higher value offering in markets and continue to drive productivity.
Software had another great quarter with revenue of $7.6 billion, up 9%. Key Branded Middleware grew double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter and gained share for the 17th straight quarter as we continue to expand our lead in the middleware market. 
Turning to brand performance, WebSphere was up 21% and continues to gain share. Each of WebSphere's 5 product areas grew 10% or better, including our Smarter Commerce offerings, which were up over 25%. This contribute to IBM's performance in the retail industry where we have grown in each of the last 9 quarters. Information Management grew 9% and again, gained share. Our distributed database grew double digits, led by strong performances from our [indiscernible] offerings, which were up nearly 70%. This appliance complements and extends our Business Analytics portfolio with a rapidly deployed low-cost of ownership solution for high performance queries and analytics. 
For the quarter, almost 1/3 of the transactions were with new [indiscernible] clients. Since acquiring [indiscernible], IBM has expended its customer base by over 40%. And then we go head-to-head against competition and proof of concepts, we had a win rate of over 80% this quarter. Our Business Analytics software offerings, most of which are part of Information Management, continue to outpace the market with double-digit growth. IBM's acquisition of Algorithmics in the fourth quarter further strengthens our Business Analytics and optimization offerings by providing risk analytics capabilities that help customers make informed business decisions.
Tivoli software was up 14% and gained share, driven by Storage software growth of 30%. Security solutions also delivered strong growth. With the recent acquisition of Q1 Labs, we can now offer clients a new level of intelligence around security to enable them to better predict, prevent and detect all types of security threats. Rational grew 4% and gained share, driven by strong performance in Telelogic. 
The fourth quarter wrapped up another powerful year for our software business. In 2011, software revenue grew 11%, gross margin expanded by 1/2 point and softer delivered nearly $10 billion of pretax profit.
Systems and Technology revenue of $5.8 billion was down 8%. This performance reflects very strong growth last year, driven by mainframe growth of almost 70%. Gross profit margin was down 3 points year-to-year, with a significant impact from product mix. 
Now let me take you through the brands. System Z revenue declined 31% as we wrap on the successful launch of our zEnterprise 196 last year. Mix declined 4% this quarter. System Z gross profit margin was up, reflecting a higher proportion of microcode upgrades, which is typical at this point of the product cycle. POWER grew 6%. This is the 15th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER. We continued our success and competitive take outs. In the fourth quarter, we had over 350 competitive displacements, which resulted in over $350 million of business. This is our strongest quarter in terms of competitive displacements since we started tracking this in 2006. Roughly 50% of this business came from HP, with most of the balance coming from Oracle Sun. 
2011 was the second year in a row where we had over 1,000 competitive displacements, which this year generated over $1 billion of business. [indiscernible] revenue declined revenue 2%. We anticipate this is in line with the market. Storage hardware revenue was down 1% when combined with the Storage software growth of 30%, the total grew 5%. Retail Store Solutions had a great quarter, up 9%, and we continue to grow share. 
When you look at the full year, Systems and Technology delivered solid performance, with revenue up 6%, gross margin up 1.6 points and $1.6 billion in pretax income, up 12% year-over-year.
Turning to cash flow on a full year basis, we generated $16.6 billion of free cash flow, which is up $300 million over last year. Excluding the impact of the income tax payments driven by audit settlement activity, which I discussed in prior quarters, full year free cash flow would have been up $1.1 billion, roughly in line with our net income growth. 
We continue to invest in our business, spending another $4 billion in capital expenditures. When I look at the uses of cash for the year, we returned $18.5 billion to shareholders, including $3.5 billion in dividends, and we bought back almost 89 million shares for $15 billion. At the end of the year, we had $8.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. 
In addition, we spent almost $2 billion to acquire 5 companies. Over the last 2 years, we've spent almost $8 billion. In addition, we've announced several acquisitions that didn't close by year-end, including [indiscernible], Simantec [ph] , platform computing and earlier this month, Green Hat. With $9 billion of free cash flow generation in the quarter, and $16.6 billion for the year, we're positioned to continue to invest in innovation and return value to shareholders.
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.9 billion, up $600 million from September. Total debt was $31.3 billion, of which $23.3 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at just over 7 to 1. Our non-financing debt was $8 billion, up $600 million from the third quarter and up $2.2 billion from a year ago. 
Now let me spend a minute on our retirement related plans, and the impact to the balance sheet.
Despite volatile conditions in 2011, we had good returns on global assets. The discount rate environment was challenging, which resulted in an impact to equity at the end of the year. This took our debt-to-cap up to 32%. And we're comfortable operating margin in this range of 30% to 40%. At the end of 2011, our defined-benefits qualified plans were well-funded and our cash requirements remained stable. We have supplemental charts that show the specific performance in rates, as well as a forward-looking view of the P&L and cash implications based on year-end 2011 assumptions with sensitivities. Suffice it to say that as we look forward, while changes in the return on assets and discount rates may drive some volatility in non-operating elements of the P&L, there is little implications to our cash requirements.
So now let me start to wrap up with the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance. Knowing that we faced a tough fourth quarter on revenue, we drove other elements of our model. Productivity, mix and cash utilization to deliver our earnings performance. Our revenue growth contributed $0.07 to our earnings growth. Our solid gross margin expansion more than offset a higher level of expense and an increase in the tax rate. Gross margins drove $0.19 of EPS growth, while we had a $0.02 impact from expense and a $0.04 impact from a higher tax rate. All in, margin expansion contributed $0.13. 
And a lower shared count resulting from our ongoing share repurchase program contributed $0.26. Bottom line, we delivered 11% EPS growth in the quarter, and for the full year, we delivered 15% growth. Revenue growth was the largest contributor to our earnings growth, so we had good contribution from share repurchase and margin expansion.
So 2011 was another very good year for us, with solid revenue performance, continued margin expansion, strong profit and cash generation and effective use of cash. Our focus on key growth initiatives and investments in innovation are enabling us to expand into new markets and capitalize on trends like analytics and cloud. Our growth market strategy to expand into new markets, buildout IT infrastructures and lead in specific industries is driving powerful performance and share gains. These countries contributed almost 2/3 of IBM's constant currency revenue growth, and now represent 22% of IBM's geographic revenue. 
Our Business Analytics solutions help our clients leverage massive amounts of data and content to gain insight and optimize results. This year, Business Analytics grew 16%. Our Smarter Planet initiatives generated close to 50% growth. Smarter Commerce, in particular, is gaining momentum by helping companies by market, sell and service their products and services. We're not just addressing an existing market, we're actually making markets. And in cloud, we're helping our clients improve the economics of IT. This year, we continue to extend our offerings. And cloud revenue in 2011 was more than 3x the prior year. 
With powerful contribution from these growth initiatives, we delivered 7% revenue growth. We said at the beginning of the year that we expect the growth in the first half of the year to be higher than the second half. By leveraging all of the elements of our model, productivity, mix and utilization of cash, we delivered operating pretax and net income growth of 9% and operating EPS growth of 15%, with double-digit growth in each of the 4 quarters. 
So now as we entered 2012, we expect to deliver operating EPS of at least $14.85 for the year, with the growth rate more skewed to the second half.
So we've just completed our centennial year. And as we reach this milestone, we've learned that we have to continually transform and reinvent yourself to be a leader in your industry. IBM's performance is a result of a transformation we've started years ago. We've been shifting our business to higher value areas, improving productivity and investing to drive future growth. These changes contributed to 9 consecutive years of double-digit earnings per share growth. But more importantly, they strengthen our business and put us on track to achieve our 2015 roadmap objectives of at least $20 of operating EPS. 
Now Patricia and I will take your questions."

To be honest, don't know what they're doing with their budgets. I do know what we do with our budge",695,"Okay, if you look at our business equation, I mean to be honest, Bill, we don't really judge that based on what our customers are doing with their budgets. To be honest, don't know what they're doing with their budgets. I do know what we do with our budget, and it's very similar to the conversations that I have with others CFOs. They're looking for the best value to move their business, to move their business rapidly. And so I think it's our measure of our ability to bring value to those clients. If you look at our business and evaluate that now, and give us a report card on just those key investment priorities that we had, we did very, very well. I think. Business Analytics, up 16%. Cloud Computing, more than tripled, Smarter Planet, almost 50% growth, and you now look at GMU, another very strong quarter from GMU, BRICs up 11%, GMU, 8 points faster than the majors. So obviously, we are satisfying value considerations within our customer set. You can see that, I think, in the surprising mix in some respects of our penetration within individual countries. So when you look at Europe, Europe at 1%, that they can go and look at it by country, some pretty industry statistics. Number one, we had Spain growing 9%, that's a fifth quarter of growth sequentially from Spain. We had the U.K. going 9%, for the 9th consecutive quarter. Germany returned to growth, up 4%. Let's look at North America, you look at the U.S., up 1%, that's on the back of that 10% growth last year, driven by our big mainframe announcement. If you look at that in 2-year basis, that's a 5% compound at our growth rate, which is pretty strong performance. Canada, up 13%. Strong growth statistics on growth markets, 40 countries at double-digit. So that's, I think, the best measure of our value and you can see it in the individual country. This isn't just a homogenous base across these individual geographies. You can also see it as you look at our overall share performance. So if you look at it and break down from a brand perspective into the 15, 16 composite brands in the business, I mean, we gained or held share in 15 of the 16. So we gained in ITS, Integrated Technology Services, we gained in global process services. We gained at EMS, both SL and SI, we in West we're in Information Management in Tivoli and Rational. In our, Retail Store Solutions. The only brand that we lost share was in mainframe. Now who do you think we lost share to? We lost share to POWER series, our own process line. Every other brand held. So I think that's also a good view of how we're adding value really pretty consistently across the product line as we enter 2012. Now if you look at 2012, your second part of your question, we move into '12 starting with the software business. We had 9% growth in the quarter about 12% profit growth, very strong performance out of our software business of business. And I remain do now in 2011 is almost $10 billion of profit except from the beginning of the decade when they were 2.8. [indiscernible] success and we move into 2012 with a strong set of opportunities. So I would expect to see similar performance from our software business. When you look at the overall services business, we gave you, I think, a much more comprehensive metric on revenue. This year looking at the total backlog of $141 billion and within that backlog, the run out of the total backlog should be up 3% covering about 70% of the revenue we need in the year. And you look at our hardware business, though the hardware business will face a difficult compare in the first half of the year, with new announcement content by the time we get to the second half of the year, I'd expect them to generate mid-single-digit growth. So once again, I think we entered the year in the value side, both brand and geographic with a pretty strong hand."

Within Services, first of all, I think that Services business did a very, very good job in the year of driving towards higher value offerings and higher year value content for the customer set that is able to bring in the other elements of the IBM equation from both software content and hardware business that our competitors are not able to bring to the table. So within the services businesses, once again they did a very good job on both the GBS and the GTS that continue to improve that value equation to the customer set. At least we look of the contract that we are now moving and caring into 2012, they've already done a very strong job on big contracts are we have more challenging financial dynamics that we know we're going to deliver in 2012. But the other point I'd make, Tony, we were very specific in the overall business model for both the 2010 roadmap and the 2015 roadmap of our attention to pull spend and drive productivity across the corporation as a global corporation. That's the $8 billion that we identified in the last Analyst Meeting. And we've done our first down payment on that right on track. Now who do you think is a beneficiary of a lot of that structural take out? The Services business. The Services business is a big beneficiary of that large corporate structural take out. And to a large degree, I think a lot of that operating leverage that we get is unique to IBM and differentiated from our competition and is not given away necessarily in price. So that structure element is a big assist to our overall services margin, right on track for the objectives that we have set and a strong complement. As far as opportunity and headroom, let's look at some IBM equation, I mean, were still not in the top quartile the S&P of the tech UniVerse. There's no reason with the value that we bring to our customer base that we shouldn't be in that top quartile. It's a very integrated part of our business model that we've integrated into our budgeting systems and as I said, I do believe we ought to be achieve an overall economy of scale of a large corporation and a lot of that displayed in our services business. So as our game plan for IBM as a whole, we're going to drive that software mix within IBM and you can see from the segment results that the PTI for our software business runs between 40% and 50%. We're going to continue to work to spend the reductions and productivity, much of that delivering within our Services segment and drive value add in the customer engagements with assets, research and value-added approach."

Let me now take that from the IBM level and then I'll go specifically to your question kind of these Q in the drivers and the SKU. So as I've said in the earlier questions, if you look at the software-based the business, I think we've got real momentum going into 2012. You saw that in our fourth quarter achievements. Additionally, within that back in 2012 that our acquisition performance for the $6.2 billion of spend that we did in 2010, plus the $1.8 billion that we did, those business case and the performance of those acquisitions against the business case was about the best I've seen in years. Real traction. And I think we entered 2012 with traction on the software business, and I believe they ought to be able to generate double-digit profit ability once again. I explained that in our services business already in the backlog run out now against the total backlog for services, that we already have about 3% in the backlog run out, which would comprise about 70% of our revenue. The balance of the revenue coming from new signings and base growth, even if that new signings base growth were flat, which I don't believe will be, but even if it were, 70% of the 3 would drive 2% revenue growth in services, and we showed last year that we could drive double-digit profitability on that basically will run the same place to deliver against that again. So driving for double-digit profit growth in our Services business. The question you asked and the distinction between first half and second half, that's really the STG equation. So STG will have a tough compare in the first half compared to last year's announcement cycle on the high end. But when we get to the new announcement, getting the second half I would expect that STG should return to mid single-digit revenue growth and with that double-digit profit growth. So that all together gives as a good handle. Now we if you could compare that first half to second half, I'm talking about a couple of point difference between the growth rate that we would see in the first half and the second half. It's not like a major difference, but I do think it ahs a couple of point differentiation based on that hardware platform. This is overall very consistent once again with our model. Revenue growth, margin expansion on mix to software productivity and improvement usage of our cash to drive investments, acquisitions and our balance sheet for share repurchase. Now like all years, we're going to acquire and we're going to divests those businesses. We're going to invest and market opportunities and we're going to drive productivity where it's more challenging. We're going to rebalance our workforce to opportunities and skills aligned with our key investments and hire to drive in those growth initiatives. When you look at workforce rebalancing, I think it should be roughly consistent with what we've seen over the last 4 years. More specifically, I think, it would be more like 2010. Once again, if there's a charge associated to that, it would be offset above net income but if you put that altogether, and I think we get a good hand as we enter 2012."

I still think the best guide over the longer period, Katy, we had said that in the 2015 time frame that we saw about $20 billion of acquisition spend. In that specific talent our timeframe, we've only done about $1.8 billion. I still think the $20 billion is a realistic number. We are pretty tough on the financial return in the cases. We're very, very tough on that. This doesn't make very strong financial sense, and we're either going to hold or we're going to walk. There has not been expect exceptions to that rule, at least I've been in the job. Consequently, we're there to perform against those. Now when the market gets more a reasonable on a price level, we'll move in a bigger way and look at price people back. In 2010, I thought prices were pretty reasonable. We had a lot of good candidates. We did 17 acquisitions, just to remind you, things got a little frothy as we get into 2011. We did pullback, but we still had some very strong acquisitions. You've seen in the fourth quarter, we had about 4 acquisitions. We've already done 3 this year. Within that, one aspect of that improving performance, I think, and I can't give you a precise variance analysis on it, so we've been able to with research based on the analytics performance and all of the acquisitions that we've done since 2000. You've got to imagine that's a pretty rich database to drive that. So now when we go in and do, do due diligence in an acquisition, we use that analytical tool, this is called eating your own cooking, we use that analytical tool to improve our performance. So when you do an acquisition, you got to put that team on the ground, we now know the 5 or 6 key elements that we have to absolutely nail to perform against that and we can hit those very, very quickly. Analytics, I think, has really paid off for us. But I do think the acquisition play is good one, and I do think the market is in a more reasonable position."

On the GBS base of business, they were impacted in the year and I think it would have been very difficult for them to offset this because about 1/3 of their business is in public sector in Japan. And with the difficulties in both of those, if you airlift them out of the results, in the fourth quarter, GBS did about 9% growth. So a bit of an acceleration, up 8% that they would have done on that basis in the first, second and third quarter. So we exit the year I think with the balance of that business performing pretty well. As we go into 2012, we should start to wrap on the public sector performance. We should also start to wrap on the issues in Japan. And so I do think that gives us an opportunity to improve performance, but we haven't banked on that as we build our budgets and our structure."

This year, consistent with year-to-year dynamics in backlog, more of that backlog run out is driven by the transactional businesses.

As far as lengthening of the sales cycle and more approvals, I do think people and CFOs are cautious about the business and they want to make sure they have the right processes engaged.

What I really feel good about is the profit performance beyond that growth because they are a big contributor. So if you look at the performance that we so in the quarter, at the relative mix, they drove about 42% of the profit growth that we have, so that was a very strong contributor. If you look at the dependencies are there, number one, I think we bring a lot of value to those geographies. So if you look at that value construct, I mean a play like Smarter Planet, play in a very, very big way in our growth markets. Secondly, we're able to rollout with our structural advantage on the back-office, the central structure of the business, we can move into new cities without recreating that back-office. It's as if you have a kind of a, for lack of a better word, a branch in a box that you plug in the back office. And the back office is running the systems across the geography. I think that gives us an advantage. And then third, not to be loss, we have a very good reputation, very good reputation and very good brand image in our growth markets as well. So we feel pretty confident in that play. So a lot of good questions. 
Let me wrap up now. Just make a few comments. We just delivered a great quarter to cap off what I think was a great 2011. For the year, we generated 7% revenue growth to almost $107 billion. We expanded margin in line with our model and delivered $13.44 of operating EPS, which is our ninth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. 
Looking forward to 2012, we see good opportunity in our growth markets and in our higher value solutions like analytics and Smarter Planet, where we believe our enterprise clients will continue to focus. And we leverage the strength and flexibility of our business model, driving productivity improving mix and using our capital effectively. 
So this all supports our expectation of at least $14.85 of operating earnings per share for the year. That's up 10.5% and keeps us right on track to deliver at least $20 in 2015. So thanks for joining us, now it's back to work."

In the fourth quarter, we grew revenue, expanded growth, pretax and net margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $4.71, up 11% year-to-year. For the full year, we delivered revenue of almost $107 billion, which was up 7%, operating pretax income of $21.6 billion, up 9% and operating EPS of $13.44, up 15%. Our 2011 results put us well on track towards 2015 roadmap objective.
Looking at the fourth quarter by segment, we continued to build our momentum in software. Our performance reflecting both strong demand for our offerings and leadership sales execution. Our software revenue was up 9%, driven by aggressive growth in our focus areas like Smarter Commerce, business analytics and storage solutions. Our software profit was up 12%.
Our Services business delivered powerful margin and profit growth, with combined pretax income of 17%. Services revenue growth was again led by growth markets, which were up 13% at constant currency. Our total services backlog ended the year at $141 billion. At constant currency, that's flat year-to-year and up $5 billion since September. Within Hardware, Power Systems was up 6% as we continue to drive competitive displacements. We've now had 15 consecutive quarters of share gain in UNIX. In fact, with the exception of mainframe, which was coming off of the biggest quarter in its history last year, each of our 16 brands across the company gained or held share.
Turning to profit, our ongoing focus and productivity, together with the relative strength of our software business, drove strong margin performance. Our operating gross margin was up 1.1 points to over 50%. We expanded operating pretax margins almost a full point and grew pretax income 6%. And while our tax rate was up year-to-year, we still expanded net margin above our model rate. 
When you put these all together, we delivered operating EPS of $4.71, which was up 11% and $13.44 for the year, up 15%, making this our ninth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth.
Our strong earnings performance drove $9 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $16.6 billion for the year. With that cash, we continue to invest in capital and acquisitions and we delivered significant returns to shareholders with over $18 billion in share repurchase and dividends this year.
Looking forward, we're confident in our ability to continue to leverage our business model to expand margin, grow profit, generate cash and return value to shareholders. And in 2012, we expect to deliver at least $14.85 of operating earnings per share for the year.
For the fourth quarter, revenue at constant currency was in line with our expectations. While currency provided a benefit to revenue growth of about 25 basis points in the quarter, currency movement, since we announced our third quarter earnings in October, impacted our revenue by about a point of growth or $300 million.
Looking at the geographies on a constant currency basis, revenue on our major market countries was essentially flat year-to-year. In the Americas, Canada had terrific performance, up 13%. The U.S. grew 1% off of last year's very strong growth of 10%. In Europe, our growth rate improved compared to the third quarter. Germany returned to growth, up 4%, and once again, we had good growth in U.K. and Spain, which were each up 9%. We've now had 9 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth in the U.K. and Spain has now grown 5 consecutive quarters, leveraging its global relationships.
Our growth markets outpaced the major markets by 8 points of revenue growth. The BRICS had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 11%. And with nearly 2/3 of our growth markets business outside the BRICS, all together, we had double-digit growth in 40 growth market countries, so our performance was broad-based.
We're continuing to expand into new countries and territories to build out IT infrastructures in support of economic growth and to take a leadership position in key industries. This year, to drive market expansion, we opened 92 new branches and we added over 1,500 new sales reps. We gained 4 points a share in the quarter and 4 points for the year. In 2011, our growth markets grew 11%, which outpaced the majors by 10 points, and growth markets now make up 22% of our geographic revenue.
Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment, Global Technology Services constant currency revenue growth rate was consistent with the third quarter, while our Global Business Services growth rate improved. In both segments, we had great year-to-year performance in the growth markets, with double-digit constant currency revenue growth and expanding margins.
Our software business had another fantastic quarter, with strength across the portfolio, WebSphere, Information Management and Tivoli all had very good growth and gained share.
In Systems and Technology, last year, we had a great fourth quarter with over 20% growth driven by a new mainframe that had almost 70% revenue growth. This quarter, we wrapped around that performance. And we had strength in POWER as we continue to extend our share gains.
Turning to gross profit, our operating gross margins improved 1.1 points to over 50%, driven by a combination of good margin expansion in both Services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative strength of software. The services margin improvement was driven by a number of factors, including productivity improvements and mix to higher value offerings and markets. For hardware, our product mix negatively impacted margin. 
Finally, our Global Financing business, which is better measured by return on equity, this quarter delivered return on equity of 42%. Now that's impressive. So now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile.
Our total operating expense and other income was up 2%, in line with our revenue growth. Acquisitions over the last 12 months contributed a point of growth. And our base expense was up 1%. There was effectively no year-to-year impact from the combination of currency translation and hedging dynamics.
I'll comment on a couple of expense items that had larger year-to-year impacts to our profit. As you can see from our income statement, IP income was down $65 million year-to-year. Second, we had an increase of about $55 million in our accounts receivable provisions, though our reserve coverage is down 30 basis points from a year ago and down 20 points since September.
Typically, we talk about the impact of our hedging programs as a driver of expense. However, this quarter was effectively no year-to-year impact on expense due to our hedging programs, consistent with the fact that currency ended up being fairly neutral on a year-to-year basis.
So now let me get into the segments. The 2 Services segments delivered $15.3 billion in revenue, up 3%. The combined Services segments grew pretax profits 17%, and pretax margin was up 2.1 points. Total outsourcing revenue was $7.2 billion, up 4%, and total transactional revenue was $6.2 billion, up 3%.
Overall growth was driven by the growth markets, with constant currency revenue up double digits in the outsourcing, transactional and maintenance businesses. Total backlog in the quarter was $141 billion. At constant currency, that is flat year-to-year and up $5 billion quarter-to-quarter.
Moving on to the 2 segments in Global Technology Services, revenue was $10.5 billion, up 3%. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 3% and we gained share in the quarter and full year. Integrated Technology Services revenue grew 5%. We had great performance in the growth markets where we're seeing the benefits of geographic expansion and offerings like business continuity and resiliency services. Global Technology Services delivered very strong profit and margin this quarter, with pretax income up 18% and pretax margin up 2.3 points to 18%. This margin expansion was driven by our productivity and cost management, along with a mix in the higher-margin growth markets. We had gross margin improvement in all lines of business, outsourcing, ITS and maintenance.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.9 billion, up 3%. Application Outsourcing revenue was up 5%, led by strong performance in the growth markets. Consulting and Systems Integration, which includes consulting, AMS systems integration and the U.S. federal business, grew 2%. At constant currency, our growth rate improved over last quarter. 
Overall GBS revenue continued to be impacted by Japan and public sector. So total GBS revenue, excluding Japan and public sector, was up 9% at constant currency and up 8% for the year. And although the declines in Japan and public sector continued, we did see some improved performance in public sector.
Global Business Services delivered very strong profit and margin performance again this quarter. Pretax profit was up 14% year-to-year, with pretax margin up 1.8 points to 16.6%. Now I want to spend a minute on backlog and run out as we begin 2012.
Last year, in the fourth quarter, we took you through an analysis of the key drivers of Services revenue. We focused the discussion around outsourcing, and in particular, the revenue generated by the run out of the outsourcing backlog. This year, we have expanded that analysis to give a view of the Total Services backlog run out. This view is more comprehensive and more indicative of the Total Services business as we start the year. 
There are 3 primary drivers of Total Services revenue: backlog, sales into our existing contract base and new client signings. At very high percentage of services revenue, roughly 70% comes from the run out of the backlog we start the year with. In 2012, we expect about 3% revenue growth from that backlog. This gives us a very solid base of revenue to begin the year, with the remaining revenue coming from sales into our existing accounts, which have been on a good trajectory, and new client signings.
So with that, let me wrap up the year in Services. We had very consistent revenue performance in the year driven by stability in the backlog. We continue to build out our services within the growth markets, with Total Services revenue up double digits in those markets and strong margins, with gross margin 2 points higher than that in the majors. We continue to get good traction in the growth initiatives, cloud, Business Analytics and Smarter Planet. And we had great profit and margin performance in both Services segments, with GTS pretax profit up 14% and GBS up 18% as we mix the higher value offerings in markets and continue to drive productivity.
Software had another great quarter, with revenue of $7.6 billion, up 9%. Key Branded Middleware grew double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter and gained share for the 17th straight quarter as we continue to expand our lead in the middleware market.
Turning to brand performance, WebSphere was up 21% and continues to gain share. Each of WebSphere's 5 product areas grew 10% or better, including our Smarter Commerce offerings, which were up over 25%. This contributed to IBM's performance in the retail industry where we have grown in each of the last 9 quarters. Information Management grew 9% and again gained share. Our distributed database grew double digits, led by strong performances from our Netezza offerings, which were up nearly 70%. This appliance complements and extends our Business Analytics portfolio with a rapidly deployed low-cost of ownership solution for high performance queries and analytics.
For the quarter, almost 1/3 of the transactions were with new Netezza clients. Since acquiring Netezza, IBM has expanded its customer base by over 40%. And when we go head-to-head against competition and proof of concepts, we had a win rate of over 80% this quarter. 
Our Business Analytics software offerings, most of which are part of Information Management, continue to outpace the market with double-digit growth. IBM's acquisition of Algorithmics in the fourth quarter further strengthens our business analytics and optimization offerings by providing risk analytics capabilities that help customers make informed business decisions.
Tivoli software was up 14% and gained share, driven by storage software growth of 30%. Security solutions also delivered strong growth. With the recent acquisition of Q1 Labs, we can now offer clients a new level of intelligence around security to enable them to better predict, prevent and detect all types of security threats. Rational grew 4% and gained share, driven by strong performance in Telelogic.
The fourth quarter wrapped up another powerful year for our software business. In 2011, software revenue grew 11%, gross margin expanded by 1/2 point and software delivered nearly $10 billion of pretax profit.
Systems and Technology revenue of $5.8 billion was down 8%. This performance reflects very strong growth last year, driven by mainframe growth of almost 70%. Gross profit margin was down 3 points year-to-year, with a significant impact from product mix.
Now let me take you to the brands. System z revenue declined 31% as we wrapped on the successful launch of our zEnterprise 196 last year. MIPS declined 4% this quarter. System z gross profit margin was up, reflecting a higher proportion of microcode upgrades, which is typical at this point of the product cycle. POWER grew 6%. This is the 15th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER. 
We continued our success in competitive takeouts. In the fourth quarter, we had over 350 competitive displacements which resulted in over $350 million of business. This is our strongest quarter in terms of competitive displacements since we started tracking this in 2006. Roughly 60% of this business came from HP, with most of the balance coming from Oracle Sun. 2011 was the second year in a row we had over 1,000 competitive displacements, which this year generated over $1 billion of business. 
System x revenue declined revenue 2%. We anticipate this is in line with the market. Storage hardware revenue was down 1% when combined with the storage software growth of 30%, the total grew 5%. Retail Store Solutions had a great quarter, up 9%, and we continued to grow share.
When you look at the full year, Systems and Technology delivered solid performance, with revenue up 6%, gross margin up 1.6 points and $1.6 billion in pretax income, up 12% year-to-year.
Turning to cash flow on a full year basis, we generated $16.6 billion of free cash flow, which is up $300 million over last year. Excluding the impact of the income tax payments driven by audit settlement activity, which I discussed in prior quarters, full year free cash flow would have been up $1.1 billion, roughly in line with our net income growth.
We continue to invest in our business, spending another $4 billion in capital expenditures. When I look at the uses of cash for the year, we returned $18.5 billion to shareholders, including $3.5 billion in dividends, and we bought back almost 89 million shares for $15 billion. At the end of the year, we had $8.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
In addition, we spent almost $2 billion to acquire 5 companies. Over the last 2 years, we spent almost $8 billion. In addition, we've announced several acquisitions that didn't close by year end, including Emptoris, DemandTec, Platform Computing and earlier this month, Green Hat. With $9 billion of free cash flow generation in the quarter and $16.6 billion for the year, we're positioned to continue to invest in innovation and return value to shareholders.
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.9 billion, up $600 million from September. Total debt was $31.3 billion, of which $23.3 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at just over 7 to 1. Our non-financing debt was $8 billion, up $600 million from the third quarter and up $2.2 billion from a year ago.
Now let me spend a minute on our retirement-related plans and the impact to the balance sheet. Despite volatile conditions in 2011, we had good returns on global assets. The discount rate environment was challenging, which resulted in an impact to equity at the end of the year. This took our debt-to-cap up to 32%. And we're comfortable operating in this range of 30% to 40%. 
At the end of 2011, our defined benefits qualified plans were well-funded and our cash requirements remained stable. We have supplemental charts that show the specific performance in rates, as well as a forward-looking view of the P&L and cash implications based on year-end 2011 assumptions with sensitivities. 
Suffice it to say that as we look forward, while changes in the return on assets and discount rate may drive some volatility in nonoperating elements of the P&L, there is little implication to our cash requirements.
So now let me start to wrap up with the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance. Knowing that we faced a tough fourth quarter on revenue, we drove other elements of our model, productivity, mix and cash utilization to deliver our earnings performance. Our revenue growth contributed $0.07 to our earnings growth. Our solid gross margin expansion more than offset a higher level of expense and an increase in the tax rate. Gross margins drove $0.19 of EPS growth, while we had a $0.02 impact from expense and a $0.04 impact from a higher tax rate. All in, margin expansion contributed $0.13. And a lower share count resulting from our ongoing share repurchase program contributed $0.26. Bottom line, we delivered 11% EPS growth in the quarter. And for the full year, we delivered 15% growth. Revenue growth was the largest contributor to our earnings growth, though we had good contribution from share repurchase and margin expansion.
So 2011 was another very good year for us, with solid revenue performance, continued margin expansion, strong profit and cash generation and effective use of cash. Our focus on key growth initiatives and investments in innovation are enabling us to expand into new markets and capitalize on trends like analytics and cloud. Our growth market strategy to expand into new markets, build out IT infrastructures and lead in specific industries is driving powerful performance and share gains. These countries contributed almost 2/3 of IBM's constant currency revenue growth and now represent 22% of IBM's geographic revenue.
Our Business Analytics solutions help our clients leverage massive amounts of data and content to gain insight and optimize results. This year, Business Analytics grew 16%. Our Smarter Planet initiatives generated close to 50% growth. Smarter Commerce, in particular, is gaining momentum by helping companies buy, market, sell and service their products and services. We're not just addressing an existing market, we're actually making markets. 
And in cloud, we're helping our clients improve the economics of IT. This year, we continue to expand our offerings. And our cloud revenue in 2011 was more than 3x the prior year. With powerful contribution from these growth initiatives, we delivered 7% revenue growth. 
We said at the beginning of the year that we expect the growth in the first half of the year to be higher than the second half. By leveraging all of the elements of our model, productivity, mix and utilization of cash, we delivered operating pretax and net income growth of 9% and operating EPS growth of 15%, with double-digit growth in each of the 4 quarters.
So now, as we entered 2012, we expect to deliver operating EPS of at least $14.85 for the year, with the growth rate more skewed to the second half.
So we've just completed our centennial year. And as we reach this milestone, we've learned that you have to continually transform and reinvent yourself to be a leader in your industry. IBM's performance is the result of a transformation we started years ago. We've been shifting our business to higher-value areas, improving productivity and investing to drive future growth. These changes contributed to 9 consecutive years of double-digit earnings per share growth. But more importantly, they strengthened our business and put us on track to achieve our 2015 roadmap objective of at least $20 of operating EPS.
Now Patricia and I will take your questions."

To be honest, I don't know what they're doing with their budgets. I do know what we do with our budget, and it's very similar to the conversations that I have with other CFOs. They're looking for the best value to move their business and move their business rapidly. And so I think it's a measure of our ability to bring value to those clients. If you look at our business and evaluate that now and give us a report card on just those key investment priorities that we had, we did very, very well, I think. Business Analytics, up 16%; cloud computing, more than tripled; Smarter Planet, almost 50% growth. And you look -- now you look at the GMU, another very strong quarter from GMU, BRICS up 11%, GMU, 8 points faster than the majors. So obviously, we are satisfying value considerations within our customer set. You can see that, I think, in the surprising mix, in some respects, of our penetration within individual countries. So when you look at Europe. Europe at 1%, let's take it though and look at it by country, some pretty interesting statistics. Number one, we had Spain growing 9%. That's a fifth quarter of growth sequentially from Spain. We had the U.K. growing 9% for the 9th consecutive quarter. Germany returned to growth, up 4%. Let's look at North America. You look at the U.S., up 1%. That's on the back of that 10% growth last year, driven by our big mainframe announcement. If you look at that on 2-year basis, that's a 5% compound in our growth rate, which is pretty strong performance. Canada, up 13%. Strong growth statistics on our growth markets, 40 countries at double-digit. So that's, I think, the best measure of our value, and you can see it in the individual countries. This isn't just a homogenous base across these individual geographies. You can also see it as you look at our overall share performance. So if you look at it and break down from a brand perspective into the 15, 16 composite brands in the business, I mean, we gained or held share in 15 of the 16. So we gained in ITS, Integrated Technology Services, we gained in global process services. We gained in AMS, both SO and SI. We gained in WebSphere, in Information Management, in Tivoli, in Rational, in POWER, Retail Store Solutions. The only brand that we lost share was in mainframe. Now who do you think we lost share to? We lost share to POWER series, our own product line. Every other brand held. So I think that's also a good view of how we're adding value really pretty consistently across the product line as we enter 2012. Now if you look at 2012, your second part of your question, we move into '12 starting with the software business. We had 9% growth in the quarter about 12% profit growth, very strong performance out of our software base of business. And I remind you that software now in 2011 is almost $10 billion of profit. That's up from the beginning of the decade when they are $2.8 billion success, and we moved into 2012 with a strong set of opportunities. So I would expect to see similar performance from our software business. When you look at the overall Services business, we gave you, I think, a much more comprehensive metric on revenue. This year, looking at the total backlog of $141 billion, and within that backlog, the runout of the total backlog should be up 3%, covering about 70% of the revenue we need in the year. And you look at our Hardware business, though the Hardware business was -- faced a difficult compare in the first half of the year, with new announcement content by the time we get to the second half of the year, I'd expect them to generate mid-single digit growth. So once again, I think we entered the year on the value side, both brand and geographic, with a pretty strong hand."

Within Services, first of all, I think the Services business did a very, very good job in the year of driving towards higher value offerings and higher value content for their customer set that is able to bring in the other elements of the IBM equation from both software content and hardware business that our competitors are not able to bring to the table. So within the Services businesses, once again, they did a very good job on both the GBS side and the GTS side to continue to improve that value equation to their customer set. And as we look at the contracts that they're now moving and carrying into 2012, they've already done a very strong job on big contracts where we have more challenging financial dynamics that we know we're going to deliver in 2012. But the other point I'd make, Toni, we were very specific in the overall business model for both the 2010 roadmap and the 2015 roadmap of our attention to pull spend and drive productivity across the corporation as a global corporation. That's the $8 billion that we identified in the last Analyst Meeting. And we've done our first down payment on that right on track. Now, who do you think is a beneficiary of a lot of that structural takeout? The Services business. The Services business are a big beneficiary at that large corporate structural takeout. And to a large degree, I think a lot of that operating leverage that we get is unique to IBM and differentiated from our competition and is not given away necessarily in price. So that structure element is a big assist to our overall services margin, right on track for the objectives that we had set and a strong complement. As far as opportunity and headroom, let's look at it from the IBM equation. I mean, were still not in the top quartile of the S&P in the tech universe. There's no reasons, with the value that we bring to our customer base, that we shouldn't be in that top quartile. It's a very integrated part of our business model that we've integrated into our budgeting systems. And as I said, I do believe we ought to be able to achieve an overall economy of scale of a large corporation, and a lot of that displayed in our Services business. So as our game plan for IBM as a whole, we're going to drive that software mix within IBM, and you can see from the segment results that the PTI for our software business runs between 40% and 50%. We're going to continue the work, the spend reductions and productivity, much of that delivering within our Services segment and drive value add in the customer engagement with assets, research and value-added approach."

Real traction. And I think we entered 2012 with traction on our software business. And I believe they ought to be able to generate double-digit profitability once again. I explained that in our Services business already, in the backlog runout, now against the total backlog for services, that we already have about 3% in the backlog runout, which would comprise about 70% of our revenue. The balance of the revenue coming from new signings and base growth, even if that new signings base growth were flat, which I don't believe it will be, but even if it were, 70% of the 3 would drive 2% revenue growth in services. And we showed last year that we could drive double-digit profitability on that base, and we will run the same place to deliver against that again. So driving for double-digit profit growth in our Services business. The question you asked and the distinction between first half and second half, that's really the STG equation. So STG will have a tough compare in the first half compared to last year's announcement cycle on the -- on a high end. But when we get to the new announcements, we get in the second half, I would expect that STG should return to mid-single digit revenue growth, and with that, double-digit profit growth. So that, all together, gives as a good handle. Now if you can compare that first half to second half, I'm talking about a couple of points difference between the growth rate that we would see in the first half and the second half. It's not like a major difference, but I do think it has a couple of points differentiation based on that hardware platform. This is, overall, very consistent, once again, with our model. Revenue growth, margin expansion on mix to software and productivity and improved usage of our cash to drive investments, acquisition and our balance sheet for share repurchase. Now like all years, we're going to acquire and we're going to divest the businesses. We're going to invest in market opportunities and we're going to drive productivity where it's more challenging. We're going to rebalance our workforce to opportunities and skills aligned with our key investments and hire to drive in those growth initiatives. When you look at workforce rebalancing, I think it should be roughly consistent with what we've seen over the last 4 years. More specifically, I think, it would be more like 2010. Once again, if there's a charge associated to that, it would be offset above net income. But if you put that all together, and I think we have a good hand as we enter 2012."

I still think the best guide over the longer period, Katy, we had said that in the 2015 time frame that we saw about $20 billion of acquisition spend. In that specific calendar time frame, we've only done about $1.8 billion. I still think the $20 billion is a realistic number. We are pretty tough on the financial returns in the cases. We're very, very tough on that. It doesn't make very strong financial sense than we're either going to hold or we're going to walk. And there have not been exceptions to that rule, at least since I've been in the job. Consequently, we're there to perform against those. Now when the market gets more reasonable on a price level, we'll move in in a bigger way, and we'd get surprised here we'll put PO back. In 2010, I thought prices are pretty reasonable. We had a lot of good candidates. We did 17 acquisitions, just to remind you. Things got a little frothier as we went into 2011. We did pull back, but we still had some very strong acquisitions. You've seen in the last -- in the fourth quarter, we had about 4 acquisitions. We've already done 3 this year. Within that, one aspect of that improving performance, I think, and I can't give you a precise variance analysis on it, but we've been able to tool with research based on the analytic performance in all of the acquisitions that we've done since 2000. You've got to imagine that's a pretty rich database to drive that. So now when we go in and do due diligence in an acquisition, we use that analytical tool, this is called eating your own cooking, we use that analytical tool to improve our performance. So when you do an acquisition, you got to put that team on the ground, we now know the 5 or 6 key elements that we have to actually -- absolutely nail to perform against that, and we can hit those very, very quickly. Analytics, I think, has really paid off for us. But I do think the acquisition play is a good one, and I do think the market is in a more reasonable position."

On the GBS base of business, they were impacted in the year, and I think it was -- it would have been very difficult for them to offset this because about 1/3 of their business is in public sector in Japan. And with the difficulties in both of those, if you airlift them out of their results, in the fourth quarter, GBS did about 9% growth. So a bit of an acceleration, up the 8% that they would have done on that basis in the first, second and third quarter. So we exit the year, I think, with the balance of that business performing pretty well. As we go into 2012, we should start to wrap on the public sector performance. We should also start to wrap on the issues in Japan. And so I do think that gives us an opportunity to improve performance, but we haven't banked on that as we build our budgets and our structure."

This year, consistent with year-to-year dynamics in backlog, more of that backlog runout is driven by the transactional businesses. So I think it's part of -- it's reflected in both of those metrics, which are quite consistent. And once again, I think it does put us in a good position as we enter 2012."

On the Services side, I mean, we've already had a very large win-back from one of our competitors that's driven pretty good quarter-to-date performance in our business. So I feel pretty good about those. As far as lengthening of the sales cycle and more approvals, I do think people and CFOs are cautious about the business, and they want to make sure they have the right processes engaged.

Well, if you look at the growth market performance for the quarter, as we said, 8 points better than the majors for the year or 10 points better.

At 10 points better, we did 10 points better this year, we did 10 points better last year but the prior 2 years were both 8 points better. So that differential, it's hard to look at that differential and not conclude it's relatively improving for the last few years and driving our mix equation. So we do feel pretty good about that mix performance. What I really feel good about is the profit performance behind that growth because they are a big contributor. So if you look at the performance that we saw in the quarter, at their relative mix, they drove about 42% of the profit growth that we have on a growth -- so that was a very strong contributor. If you look at the dependencies there, number one, I think we bring a lot of value to those geographies. So if you look at that value construct, I mean, a play like Smarter Planet plays in a very big way in our growth markets. Secondly, we're able to roll out with our structural advantage on the back-office, the central structure of the business, we can move into new cities without recreating that back-office. It's as if you have a -- kind of a -- for lack of a better word, a branch in a box and you plug in the back-office. And the back-office is running the systems across the geographies. I think that gives us an advantage. And then third, not to be loss, we have a very good reputation, very good reputation and very good brand image in our growth markets as well. So we feel pretty confident in that play. 
So a lot of good questions. Let me wrap up now, just make a few comments. We just delivered a great quarter to cap off what I think was a great 2011. For the year, we generated 7% revenue growth to almost $107 billion. We expanded margin in line with our model and delivered $13.44 of operating EPS, which is our ninth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth.
Looking forward to 2012, we see good opportunity in our growth markets and in our higher value solutions like analytics and Smarter Planet, where we believe our enterprise clients will continue to focus. And we'll leverage the strength and flexibility of our business model, driving productivity, improving mix and using our capital effectively.
So this all supports our expectation of at least $14.85 of operating earnings per share for the year. That's up 10.5% and keeps us right on track to deliver at least $20 in 2015. 
So thanks for joining us, and now it's back to work."

For the full year, we delivered revenue of almost $107 billion, which was up 7%, operating pretax income of $21.6 billion, up 9%, and operating EPS of $13.44, up 15%. Our 2011 results put us well on track to our 2015 roadmap objective.
Looking at the fourth quarter by segment, we continued to build our momentum in software, our performance reflecting both strong demand for our offerings and leadership sales execution. Our software revenue was up 9%, driven by aggressive growth in our focus areas like Smarter Commerce, business analytics and storage solutions. Our software profit was up 12%.
Our Services business delivered powerful margin and profit growth, with combined pretax income of 17%. Services revenue growth was again led by growth markets, which were up 13% at constant currency. Our total services backlog ended the year at $141 billion. At constant currency, that's flat year-to-year and up $5 billion since September. Within Hardware, Power Systems was up 6% as we continue to drive competitive displacements. We've now had 15 consecutive quarters of share gain in UNIX. In fact, with the exception of mainframe, which was coming off of the biggest quarter in its history last year, each of our 16 brands across the company gained or held share.
Turning to profit, our ongoing focus and productivity, together with the relative strength of our software business, drove strong margin performance. Our operating gross margin was up 1.1 points to over 50%. We expanded operating pretax margins almost a full point and grew pretax income 6%. And while our tax rate was up year-to-year, we still expanded net margin above our model rate. 
When you put this all together, we delivered operating EPS of $4.71, which was up 11% and $13.44 for the year, up 15%, making this our ninth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth.
Our strong earnings performance drove $9 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $16.6 billion for the year. With that cash, we continue to invest in capital and acquisitions and we delivered significant returns to shareholders with over $18 billion in share repurchase and dividends this year.
Looking forward, we're confident in our ability to continue to leverage our business model to expand margin, grow profit, generate cash and return value to shareholders. And in 2012, we expect to deliver at least $14.85 of operating earnings per share for the year.
For the fourth quarter, revenue at constant currency was in line with our expectations. While currency provided a benefit to revenue growth of about 25 basis points in the quarter, currency movement, since we announced our third quarter earnings in October, impacted our revenue by about a point of growth or $300 million.
Looking at the geographies on a constant currency basis, revenue in our major market countries was essentially flat year-to-year. In the Americas, Canada had terrific performance, up 13%. The U.S. grew 1% off of last year's very strong growth of 10%. In Europe, our growth rate improved compared to the third quarter. Germany returned to growth, up 4%, and once again, we had good growth in the U.K. and Spain, which were each up 9%. We've now had 9 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth in the U.K. and Spain has now grown 5 consecutive quarters, leveraging its global relationships.
Our growth markets outpaced the major markets by 8 points of revenue growth. The BRICS had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 11%. And with nearly 2/3 of our growth markets business outside the BRICS, all together, we had double-digit growth in 40 growth market countries, so our performance was broad based.
We're continuing to expand into new countries and territories to build out IT infrastructures in support of economic growth and to take a leadership position in key industries. This year, to drive market expansion, we opened 92 new branches and we added over 1,500 new sales reps. We gained 4 points of share in the quarter and 4 points for the year. In 2011, our growth markets grew 11%, which outpaced the majors by 10 points, and growth markets now make up 22% of our geographic revenue.
Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment, Global Technology Services constant currency revenue growth rate was consistent with the third quarter, while our Global Business Services growth rate improved. In both segments, we had great year-to-year performance in the growth markets, with double-digit constant currency revenue growth and expanding margins.
Our software business had another fantastic quarter, with strength across the portfolio, WebSphere, Information Management and Tivoli all had very good growth and gained share.
In Systems and Technology, last year, we had a great fourth quarter with over 20% growth driven by a new mainframe that had almost 70% revenue growth. This quarter, we wrapped around that performance. And we had strength in POWER as we continue to extend our share gains.
Turning to gross profit, our operating gross margins improved 1.1 points to over 50%, driven by a combination of good margin expansion in both Services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative strength of software. The services margin improvement was driven by a number of factors, including productivity improvements and mix to higher value offerings and markets. For hardware, our product mix negatively impacted margin. 
Finally, our Global Financing business, which is better measured by return on equity, this quarter delivered return on equity of 42%. Now that's impressive. So now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile.
Our total operating expense and other income was up 2%, in line with our revenue growth. Acquisitions over the last 12 months contributed a point of growth. And our base expense was up 1%. There was effectively no year-to-year impact from the combination of currency translation and hedging dynamics.
I'll comment on a couple of expense items that had larger year-to-year impacts to our profit. As you can see from our income statement, IP income was down $65 million year-to-year. Second, we had an increase of about $55 million in our accounts receivable provisions, though our reserve coverage is down 30 basis points from a year ago and down 20 points since September.
Typically, we talk about the impact of our hedging programs as a driver of expense. However, this quarter was effectively no year-to-year impact on expense due to our hedging programs, consistent with the fact that currency ended up being fairly neutral on a year-to-year basis.
So now let me get into the segments. The 2 Services segments delivered $15.3 billion in revenue, up 3%. The combined Services segments grew pretax profits 17%, and pretax margin was up 2.1 points. Total outsourcing revenue was $7.2 billion, up 4%, and total transactional revenue was $6.2 billion, up 3%.
Overall growth was driven by the growth markets, with constant currency revenue up double digits in the outsourcing, transactional and maintenance businesses. Total backlog in the quarter was $141 billion. At constant currency, that is flat year-to-year and up $5 billion quarter-to-quarter.
Moving on to the 2 segments in Global Technology Services, revenue was $10.5 billion, up 3%. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 3% and we gained share in the quarter and full year. Integrated Technology Services revenue grew 5%. We had great performance in the growth markets where we're seeing the benefits of geographic expansion in offerings like business continuity and resiliency services. Global Technology Services delivered very strong profit and margin this quarter, with pretax income up 18% and pretax margin up 2.3 points to 18%. This margin expansion was driven by productivity and cost management, along with a mix into higher-margin growth markets. We had gross margin improvement in all lines of business, outsourcing, ITS and maintenance.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.9 billion, up 3%. Application Outsourcing revenue was up 5%, led by strong performance in the growth markets. Consulting and Systems Integration, which includes consulting, AMS systems integration and the U.S. federal business, grew 2%. At constant currency, our growth rate improved over last quarter. 
Overall GBS revenue continued to be impacted by Japan and public sector. So total GBS revenue, excluding Japan and public sector, was up 9% at constant currency and up 8% for the year. And although the declines in Japan and public sector continued, we did see some improved performance in public sector.
Global Business Services delivered very strong profit and margin performance again this quarter. Pretax profit was up 14% year-to-year, with pretax margin up 1.8 points to 16.6%. Now I want to spend a minute on backlog and runout as we begin 2012.
Last year, in the fourth quarter, we took you through an analysis of the key drivers of Services revenue. We focused the discussion around outsourcing, and in particular, the revenue generated by the runout of the outsourcing backlog. This year, we have expanded that analysis to give a view of the Total Services backlog runout. This view is more comprehensive and more indicative of the Total Services business as we start the year. 
There are 3 primary drivers of Total Services revenue: backlog, sales into our existing contract base and new client signings. A very high percentage of services revenue, roughly 70%, comes from the runout of the backlog we start the year with. In 2012, we expect about 3% revenue growth from that backlog. This gives us a very solid base of revenue to begin the year, with the remaining revenue coming from sales into our existing accounts, which have been on a good trajectory, and new client signings.
So with that, let me wrap up the year in Services. We had very consistent revenue performance in the year driven by stability in the backlog. We continue to build out our services within the growth markets, with Total Services revenue up double digits in those markets and strong margins, with gross margin 2 points higher than that in the majors. We continue to get good traction in the growth initiatives, cloud, Business Analytics and Smarter Planet. And we had great profit and margin performance in both Services segments, with GTS pretax profit up 14% and GBS up 18% as we mixed a higher value offerings and markets and continued to drive productivity.
Software had another great quarter, with revenue of $7.6 billion, up 9%. Key Branded Middleware grew double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter and gained share for the 17th straight quarter as we continue to extend our lead in the middleware market.
Turning to brand performance, WebSphere was up 21% and continues to gain share. Each of WebSphere's 5 product areas grew 10% or better, including our Smarter Commerce offerings, which were up over 25%. This contributed to IBM's performance in the retail industry where we have grown in each of the last 9 quarters. Information Management grew 9% and again gained share. Our distributed database grew double digits, led by strong performances from our Netezza offerings, which were up nearly 70%. This appliance complements and extends our Business Analytics portfolio with a rapidly deployed low-cost of ownership solution for high performance queries and analytics.
For the quarter, almost 1/3 of the transactions were with new Netezza clients. Since acquiring Netezza, IBM has expanded its customer base by over 40%. And when we go head-to-head against competition in proof of concepts, we had a win rate of over 80% this quarter. 
Our Business Analytics software offerings, most of which are part of Information Management, continue to outpace the market with double-digit growth. IBM's acquisition of Algorithmics in the fourth quarter further strengthens our business analytics and optimization offerings by providing risk analytics capabilities that help customers make informed business decisions.
Tivoli software was up 14% and gained share, driven by storage software growth of 30%. Security solutions also delivered strong growth. With the recent acquisition of Q1 Labs, we can now offer clients a new level of intelligence around security to enable them to better predict, prevent and detect all types of security threats. Rational grew 4% and gained share, driven by strong performance in Telelogic.
The fourth quarter wrapped up another powerful year for our software business. In 2011, software revenue grew 11%, gross margin expanded by 0.5 point and software delivered nearly $10 billion of pretax profit.
Systems and Technology revenue of $5.8 billion was down 8%. This performance reflects very strong growth last year, driven by mainframe growth of almost 70%. Gross profit margin was down 3 points year-to-year, with a significant impact from product mix.
Now let me take you through the brands. System z revenue declined 31% as we wrapped on the successful launch of our zEnterprise 196 last year. MIPS declined 4% this quarter. System z gross profit margin was up, reflecting a higher proportion of microcode upgrades, which is typical at this point of the product cycle. POWER grew 6%. This is the 15th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER. 
We continued our success in competitive takeouts. In the fourth quarter, we had over 350 competitive displacements which resulted in over $350 million of business. This is our strongest quarter in terms of competitive displacements since we started tracking this in 2006. Roughly 60% of this business came from HP, with most of the balance coming from Oracle Sun. 2011 was the second year in a row we had over 1,000 competitive displacements, which this year generated over $1 billion of business. 
System x revenue declined 2%. We anticipate this is in line with the market. Storage hardware revenue was down 1%. When combined with the storage software growth of 30%, the total grew 5%. Retail Store Solutions had a great quarter, up 9%, and we continued to grow share.
When you look at the full year, Systems and Technology delivered solid performance, with revenue up 6%, gross margin up 1.6 points and $1.6 billion in pretax income, up 12% year-to-year.
Turning to cash flow on a full year basis, we generated $16.6 billion of free cash flow, which is up $300 million over last year. Excluding the impact of the income tax payments driven by audit settlement activity, which I discussed in prior quarters, full year free cash flow would have been up $1.1 billion, roughly in line with our net income growth.
We continue to invest in our business, spending another $4 billion in capital expenditures. When I look at the uses of cash for the year, we returned $18.5 billion to shareholders, including $3.5 billion in dividends, and we bought back almost 89 million shares for $15 billion. At the end of the year, we had $8.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
In addition, we spent almost $2 billion to acquire 5 companies. Over the last 2 years, we spent almost $8 billion. In addition, we've announced several acquisitions that didn't close by year end, including Emptoris, DemandTec, Platform Computing and earlier this month, Green Hat. With $9 billion of free cash flow generation in the quarter and $16.6 billion for the year, we're positioned to continue to invest in innovation and return value to shareholders.
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.9 billion, up $600 million from September. Total debt was $31.3 billion, of which $23.3 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at just over 7 to 1. Our non-financing debt was $8 billion, up $600 million from the third quarter and up $2.2 billion from a year ago.
Now let me spend a minute on our retirement-related plans and the impact to the balance sheet. Despite volatile market conditions in 2011, we had good returns on global assets. The discount rate environment was challenging, which resulted in an impact to equity at the end of the year. This took our debt-to-cap up to 32%. And we're comfortable operating in this range of 30% to 40%. 
At the end of 2011, our defined benefits qualified plans were well funded and our cash requirements remained stable. We have supplemental charts that show the specific performance in rates, as well as a forward-looking view of the P&L and cash implications based on year-end 2011 assumptions with sensitivities. 
Suffice it to say that as we look forward, while changes in the return on assets and discount rate may drive some volatility in nonoperating elements of the P&L, there is little implication to our cash requirements.
So now let me start to wrap up with the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance. Knowing that we faced a tough fourth quarter on revenue, we drove other elements of our model, productivity, mix and cash utilization to deliver our earnings performance. Our revenue growth contributed $0.07 to our earnings growth. Our solid gross margin expansion more than offset a higher level of expense and an increase in the tax rate. Gross margin drove $0.19 of EPS growth, while we had a $0.02 impact from expense and a $0.04 impact from a higher tax rate. All in, margin expansion contributed $0.13. And a lower share count resulting from our ongoing share repurchase program contributed $0.26. Bottom line, we delivered 11% EPS growth in the quarter. And for the full year, we delivered 15% growth. Revenue growth was the largest contributor to our earnings growth, though we had good contribution from share repurchase and margin expansion.
So 2011 was another very good year for us, with solid revenue performance, continued margin expansion, strong profit and cash generation and effective use of cash. Our focus on key growth initiatives and investments in innovation are enabling us to expand into new markets and capitalize on trends like analytics and cloud. Our growth market strategy to expand into new markets, build out IT infrastructures and lead in specific industries is driving powerful performance and share gains. These countries contributed almost 2/3 of IBM's constant currency revenue growth and now represent 22% of IBM's geographic revenue.
Our Business Analytics solutions help our clients leverage massive amounts of data and content to gain insight and optimize results. This year, Business Analytics grew 16%. Our Smarter Planet initiatives generated close to 50% growth. Smarter Commerce, in particular, is gaining momentum by helping companies buy, market, sell and service their products and services. We're not just addressing an existing market, we're actually making markets. 
And in cloud, we're helping our clients improve the economics of IT. This year, we continue to expand our offerings. And our cloud revenue in 2011 was more than 3x the prior year. With powerful contribution from these growth initiatives, we delivered 7% revenue growth. 
We said at the beginning of the year that we expect the growth in the first half of the year to be higher than the second half. By leveraging all of the elements of our model, productivity, mix and utilization of cash, we delivered operating pretax and net income growth of 9% and operating EPS growth of 15%, with double-digit growth in each of the 4 quarters.
So now, as we enter 2012, we expect to deliver operating EPS of at least $14.85 for the year, with the growth rate more skewed to the second half.
So we've just completed our centennial year. And as we reach this milestone, we've learned that you have to continually transform and reinvent yourself to be a leader in your industry. IBM's performance is the result of a transformation we started years ago. We've been shifting our business to higher-value areas, improving productivity and investing to drive future growth. These changes contributed to 9 consecutive years of double-digit earnings per share growth. But more importantly, they strengthened our business and put us on track to achieve our 2015 roadmap objective of at least $20 of operating EPS.
Now Patricia and I will take your questions."

To be honest, I don't know what they're doing with their budgets. I do know what we do with our budget, and it's very similar to the conversations that I have with other CFOs. They're looking for the best value to move their business and move their business rapidly. And so I think it's a measure of our ability to bring value to those clients. If you look at our business and evaluate that now and give us a report card on just those key investment priorities that we had, we did very, very well, I think. Business Analytics, up 16%; cloud computing, more than tripled; Smarter Planet, almost 50% growth. And you look -- now you look at the GMU, another very strong quarter from GMU, BRICS up 11%, GMU, 8 points faster than the majors. So obviously, we are satisfying value considerations within our customer set. You can see that, I think, in the surprising mix, in some respects, of our penetration within individual countries. So when you look at Europe. Europe at 1%, let's take it though and look at it by country, some pretty interesting statistics. Number one, we had Spain growing 9%. That's a fifth quarter of growth sequentially from Spain. We had the U.K. growing 9% for the 9th consecutive quarter. Germany returned to growth, up 4%. Let's look at North America. You look at the U.S., up 1%. That's on the back of that 10% growth last year, driven by our big mainframe announcement. If you look at that on a 2-year basis, that's a 5% compound growth rate, which is pretty strong performance. Canada, up 13%. Strong growth statistics on our growth markets, 40 countries at double-digit. So that's, I think, the best measure of our value, and you can see it in the individual countries. This isn't just a homogenous base across these individual geographies. You can also see it as you look at our overall share performance. So if you look at it and break down from a brand perspective into the 15, 16 composite brands in the business, I mean, we gained or held share in 15 of the 16. So we gained in ITS, Integrated Technology Services, we gained in global process services. We gained in AMS, both SO and SI. We gained in WebSphere, in Information Management, in Tivoli, in Rational, in POWER, Retail Store Solutions. The only brand that we lost share was in mainframe. Now who do you think we lost share to? We lost share to POWER series, our own product line. Every other brand held. So I think that's also a good view of how we're adding value really pretty consistently across the product line as we enter 2012. Now if you look at 2012, your second part of your question, we move into '12 starting with the software business. We had 9% growth in the quarter, about 12% profit growth, very strong performance out of our software base of business. And I’d remind you that software now in 2011 is almost $10 billion of profit. That's up from the beginning of the decade when they are $2.8 billion success, and we move into 2012 with a strong set of opportunities. So I would expect to see similar performance from our software business. When you look at the overall Services business, we gave you, I think, a much more comprehensive metric on revenue. This year, looking at the total backlog of $141 billion, and within that backlog, the runout of the total backlog should be up 3%, covering about 70% of the revenue we need in the year. And you look at our Hardware business, though the Hardware business was -- face a difficult compare in the first half of the year, with new announcement content by the time we get to the second half of the year, I'd expect them to generate mid-single digit growth. So once again, I think we entered the year on the value side, both brand and geographic, with a pretty strong hand."

Within Services, first of all, I think the Services business did a very, very good job in the year of driving towards higher value offerings and higher value content for their customer set that is able to bring in the other elements of the IBM equation from both software content and hardware business that our competitors are not able to bring to the table. So within the Services businesses, once again, they did a very good job on both the GBS side and the GTS side to continue to improve that value equation to their customer set. And as we look at the contracts that they're now moving and carrying into 2012, they've already done a very strong job on big contracts where we have more challenging financial dynamics that we know we're going to deliver in 2012. But the other point I'd make, Toni, we were very specific in the overall business model for both the 2010 roadmap and the 2015 roadmap of our attention to pull spend and drive productivity across the corporation as a global corporation. That's the $8 billion that we identified in the last Analyst Meeting. And we've done our first downpayment on that right on track. Now, who do you think is a beneficiary of a lot of that structural takeout? The Services business. The Services business are a big beneficiary at that large corporate structural takeout. And to a large degree, I think a lot of that operating leverage that we get is unique to IBM and differentiated from our competition and is not given away necessarily in price. So that structure element is a big assist to our overall services margin, right on track for the objectives that we had set and a strong complement. As far as opportunity and headroom, let's look at it from the IBM equation. I mean, we’re still not in the top quartile of the S&P in the tech universe. There's no reason, with the value that we bring to our customer base, that we shouldn't be in that top quartile. It's a very integrated part of our business model that we've integrated into our budgeting systems. And as I said, I do believe we ought to be able to achieve an overall economy of scale of a large corporation, and a lot of that displayed in our Services business. So as our game plan for IBM as a whole, we're going to drive that software mix within IBM, and you can see from the segment results that the PTI for our software business runs between 40% and 50%. We're going to continue to work to spend reductions and productivity, much of that delivering within our Services segment and drive value add in the customer engagement with assets, research and value-add approach."

Let me now take that from the IBM level and then I'll go specifically to your question on kind of the skew in the drivers and the SKU. So as I had said in the earlier questions, if you look at the software-base of business, I think we've got re",552,"Yes, sure. Let me now take that from the IBM level and then I'll go specifically to your question on kind of the skew in the drivers and the SKU. So as I had said in the earlier questions, if you look at the software-base of business, I think we've got real momentum going into 2012. You saw that in our fourth quarter achievement. Additionally, within that, I can tell you that our acquisition performance for the $6.2 billion of spend that we did in 2010, plus the $1.8 billion that we did, those business case and the performance of those acquisitions against the business case was about the best I've seen in years. Real traction. And I think we entered 2012 with traction on our software business. And I believe they ought to be able to generate double-digit profitability once again. I explained that in our Services business already, in the backlog runout, now against the total backlog for Services, that we already have about 3% in the backlog runout, which would comprise about 70% of our revenue. The balance of the revenue coming from new signings and base growth, even if that new signings base growth were flat, which I don't believe it will be, but even if it were, 70% of the 3 would drive 2% revenue growth in Services. And we showed last year that we could drive double-digit profitability on that base, and we will run the same plays to deliver against that again. So driving for double-digit profit growth in our Services business. The question you asked and the distinction between first half and second half, that's really the STG equation. So STG will have a tough compare in the first half compared to last year's announcement cycle on the high end. But when we get to the new announcements, we get into second half, I would expect that STG should return to mid-single digit revenue growth, and with that, double-digit profit growth. So that, all together, gives us a good handle. Now if you can compare that first half to second half, I'm talking about a couple of points difference between the growth rate that we would see in the first half and the second half. It's not like a major difference, but I do think it has a couple of points differentiation based on that hardware platform. This is, overall, very consistent, once again, with our model. Revenue growth, margin expansion on mix to software and productivity and improved usage of our cash to drive investments, acquisition and our balance sheet for share repurchase. Now like all years, we're going to acquire and we're going to divest businesses. We're going to invest in market opportunities and we're going to drive productivity where it's more challenging. We're going to rebalance our workforce to opportunities and skills aligned with our key investments and hire to drive in those growth initiatives. When you look at workforce rebalancing, I think it should be roughly consistent with what we've seen over the last 4 years. More specifically, I think, it would be more like 2010. Once again, if there's a charge associated to that, it would be offset above net income. But you put that all together, and I think we have a good hand as we enter 2012."

I still think the best guide over the longer period, Katy, we had said that in the 2015 time frame that we saw about $20 billion of acquisition spend. In that specific calendar time frame, we've only done about $1.8 billion. I still think the $20 billion is a realistic number. We are pretty tough on the financial returns in the cases. We're very, very tough on that. If it doesn't make very strong financial sense then we're either going to hold or we're going to walk. And there have not been exceptions to that rule, at least since I've been in the job. Consequently, we're there to perform against those. Now when the market gets more reasonable on a price level, we'll move in in a big way, and when it gets pricier, we’ll peel back. In 2010, I thought prices were pretty reasonable. We had a lot of good candidates. We did 17 acquisitions, as I remind you. Things got a little frothier as we went into 2011. We did pull back, but we still had some very strong acquisitions. You've seen in the last -- in the fourth quarter, we had about 4 acquisitions. We've already done 3 this year. Within that, one aspect of that improving performance, I think, and I can't give you a precise variance analysis on it, but we've built a tool with research based on the analytic performance in all of the acquisitions that we've done since 2000. You've got to imagine that's a pretty rich database to drive that. So now when we go in and do due diligence in an acquisition, we use that analytical tool, this is called eating your own cooking, we use that analytical tool to improve our performance. So when you do an acquisition, you’re going to put that team on the ground, we now know the 5 or 6 key elements that we have to actually -- absolutely nail to perform against that, and we can hit those very, very quickly. Analytics, I think, has really paid off for us. But I do think the acquisition play is a good one, and I do think the market’s in a more reasonable position."

On the GBS base of business, they were impacted in the year, and I think it was -- it would have been very difficult for them to offset this because about 1/3 of their business is in public sector in Japan. And with the difficulties in both of those, if you airlift them out of their results, in the fourth quarter, GBS did about 9% growth. So a bit of an acceleration off the 8% that they would have done on that basis in the first, second and third quarter. So we exit the year, I think, with the balance of that business performing pretty well. As we go into 2012, we should start to wrap on the public sector performance. We should also start to wrap on the issues in Japan. And so I do think that gives us an opportunity to improve performance, but we haven't banked on that as we built our budgets and our structure."

This year, consistent with year-to-year dynamics in backlog, more of that backlog runout is driven by the transactional businesses.

On the Services side, I mean, we've already had a very large win-back from one of our competitors that's driven pretty good quarter-to-date performance in our business. So I feel pretty good about those. As far as lengthening of the sales cycle and more approvals, I do think people and CFOs are cautious about their business, and they want to make sure they have the right processes engaged. And we did see that. But on the other hand, they're also looking for value to apply to the business equations.

Well, if you look at the growth market performance for the quarter, as we said, 8 points better than the majors for the year or 10 points better.

Well, if you look at the growth market performance for the quarter, as we said, 8 points better than the majors for the year or 10 points better. At 10 points better, we did 10 points better this year, we did 10 points better last year but the prior 2 years were both 8 points better. So that differential, it's hard to look at that differential and not conclude it's relatively improving for the last few years and driving our mix equation. So we do feel pretty good about that mix performance. What I really feel good about is the profit performance behind that growth because they are a big contributor. So if you look at the performance that we saw in the quarter, at their relative mix, they drove about 42% of the profit growth that we had on a growth -- so that was a very strong contributor. If you look at the dependencies there, number one, I think we bring a lot of value to those geographies. So if you look at that value construct, I mean, a play like Smarter Planet plays in a very big way in our growth markets. Secondly, we're able to roll out with our structural advantage on the back-office, the central structure of the business, we can move into new cities without recreating that back-office. It's as if you have a -- kind of a -- for lack of a better word, a branch in a box and you plug in the back-office. And the back-office is running the systems across the geographies. I think that gives us an advantage. And then third, not to be -- plus we have a very good reputation, very good reputation and very good brand image in our growth markets as well. So we feel pretty confident in that play. So a lot of good questions. Let me wrap up now, just make a few comments. We just delivered a great quarter to cap off what I think was a great 2011. For the year, we generated 7% revenue growth to almost $107 billion. We expanded margin in line with our model and delivered $13.44 of operating EPS, which is our ninth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. Looking forward to 2012, we see good opportunity in our growth markets and in our higher value solutions like analytics and Smarter Planet, where we believe our enterprise clients will continue to focus. And we'll leverage the strength and flexibility of our business model, driving productivity, improving mix and using our capital effectively. So this all supports our expectation of at least $14.85 of operating earnings per share for the year. That's up 10.5% and keeps us right on track to deliver at least $20 in 2015. So thanks for joining us, and now it's back to work."

In the first quarter, we reported $24.7 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $2.78, which is up 15% year-to-year. And now, 90 days into the year,",3114,"Thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter, we reported $24.7 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $2.78, which is up 15% year-to-year. And now, 90 days into the year, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15. This is up $0.15 from our previous view of at least $14.85. 
Looking at the results by segment. We continued our strong performance in software, as we aggressively address our opportunities in analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet. Our software profit was up 12%. 
In services, we expanded margins and increased Total Services profit by 11%, as we leverage our productivity initiatives and mixed a higher margin offerings in markets. Services revenue growth was again led by growth markets, which were up 10% at constant currency. And our backlog in growth markets was up 14% at constant currency. 
As expected, our hardware business declined as compared to a very strong growth of 19% in the first quarter of last year. This quarter, we extended our leadership in the units market, as we continued our competitive displacements in POWER. 
And just last week, we announced Pure Systems, the first new class of computing in over 20 years. This solution leverages IBM's decades long investment in innovation and radically simplifies enterprise computing. This should start to contribute to the system's performance in the second half of the year.
Turning to profit. Our ongoing focus on productivity, together with the relative strength of our software business drove strong margin performance. We expanded operating gross margin by over a point, led by services. And our operating net margin was up a similar amount, 1.1 points. Within that income, this quarter, we had a couple of unique items that impacted the dynamic between operating pretax income and our tax rate. You'll recall that in the first quarter of last year, our workforce rebalancing was essentially offset by one-time investment gains. 
This quarter, our workforce rebalancing was very similar to last year. But this year, the charge was offset by a one-time tax benefit associated with a tax restructuring in Latin America. Excluding this one-time benefit, we expect our full year annual effective tax rate to still be in the range of 25%.
So a very similar dynamic to last year, with a gain offsetting our workforce rebalance charges. Though this year, the offset is included below the PTI line in tax. So a few margin expansion, together with effective use of cash, we delivered operating EPS of $2.78, which was up 15% year-to-year.
Turning to cash flow. We generated almost $2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, really strong performance. In addition to returning value to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, our cash flow is enabling the ongoing transformation of the business, acquiring key capabilities and focusing our portfolio on the areas where we can add the most value. 
This quarter, we closed 5 acquisitions for a total of $1.3 billion. The acquisitions increased our capabilities and analytics and cloud and our Smarter Planet initiatives. Now we'll get into the first quarter details starting with revenue by geography, where as always, I'll discuss the results on a local currency basis.
In the first quarter, revenue at constant currency was very consistent with the fourth quarter, and in line with our expectations. Revenue in our major market countries was essentially flat year-to-year. Within the Americas, performance was led by Canada, which was up 9%. The U.S. was flat, off of last year's strong growth of 7%. Europe again grew at 1%, in line with the fourth quarter, so we're seeing some stability there. 
The most consistent performance has come from the U.K. and Spain. With 10% growth, U.K. has delivered 10 consecutive quarters of growth. And Spain continues to leverage its global relationships, now growing in each of the last 6 quarters. Germany posted modest growth, while France declined.
Our growth markets outpaced the major markets by 10 points of revenue growth, even with a tough compare, the BRICS had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 11%. And with about 60% of our growth markets business outside the BRICS, altogether, we had double-digit growth in 40 growth markets countries. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of share gains in the growth markets, and we're accelerating our market expansion initiative to continue that success.
Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment. Global Technology Services constant currency revenue growth rate was very consistent with the last few quarters. And Global Business Services growth rates continued to be impacted by weakness in Japan and public sector. Our software business had another great quarter, driven by our offerings in Business Analytics, Smarter Commerce and storage management. 
In Systems and Technology, last year, we had a very strong first quarter, driven by product cycles and mainframe and POWER. So our growth rate this quarter reflects that difficult compare though we continue to take share in UNIX.
Turning to gross profit. Our operating gross profit margin improved 1.2 points, driven by a combination of good margin expansion in both Services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative strength in software. Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile.
Our total operating expense and other income was up 3%. Acquisitions over the last 12 months contributed 2 points of the increase. Currency from both translation and hedging dynamics reduced expense growth by 2 points, and our base expense excluding currency and acquisitions was up 3 points. I'll comment on couple of expense item that had larger year-to-year impacts to our profit. 
First, in last year's results, we had investment gains of over $200 million, primarily for the sale of Lenovo shares. This gain effectively funded the $220 million of workforce rebalancing charges in last year's first quarter. This year, we had a one-time tax benefit from a tax restructuring in Latin America. And a tax benefit offset the workforce rebalancing charges, which again were about $220 million. So the net effect to net income was negligible, both within the period and year-to-year.
Another expense item I'll comment on is a year-to-year help from our hedging programs. We hedge our major cross border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in global cash planning. Last year, hedging programs generated losses in the quarter. This year, our hedging was down $125 million year-to-year. As you would expect, given the year-to-year currency changes in currencies. Of this, about $85 million year-to-year is an expense, most of which is in other income and expense. Now keep in mind that you can't look at hedges in isolation. They mitigate the translation impacts across the P&L.
So now let me go into the segments. The 2 Services segment delivered $14.7 billion in revenue, grew pretax profit by 11% and expanded pretax margin by 1.3 points. Backlog was $139 billion, down 2% at actual rates and up 1% at constant currency. We started 2012 with continued momentum in our growth initiatives, margin expansion and strong profit growth. Revenue in the growth markets was up double digits at constant currency again this quarter, driven by strong backlog growth. Total growth markets backlog was up 14% year-to-year at constant currency, reflecting strong demand for both our outsourcing and transactional services in these markets. We also had strong performance in Business Analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet offerings.
Moving onto the 2 segments. In Global Technology Services, revenue was $10 billion, up 2% or 3% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 2% or 3% at constant currency, and we gained share again this quarter. Integrated Technology Services revenue grew 3%. We had great performance in the growth markets, up 14% year-to-year at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered very strong profit and margin this quarter, with pretax income up 20% and pretax margin up 2.2 points. There were 3 primary drivers of this margin expansion. 
First, we continue to benefit from efforts to deliver productivity and efficiency within GTS and in conjunction with the enterprise productivity initiatives. Second, we continued to get higher margins in the faster growing growth markets. And finally, GTS has done a tremendous amount of work managing their large portfolio of outsourcing contracts. Within that portfolio, there's a mix of contracts with different profit characteristics. We have taken a systematic and disciplined approach to solving problems in a select set of lower margin contracts, and we're seeing the yield from these efforts in our margin.
Turning to Global Business Services. Revenue was $4.6 billion, down 2% or 1% at constant currency. We had modest declines in both Application Outsourcing and consulting and systems integration. I previously mentioned the strong results in Business Analytics and Smarter Planet, where GBS is leading many of the engagements across IBM. Within GBS, Business Analytics grew 16% and Smarter Planet grew 18%. These are very important initiatives for IBM. 
From a geographic perspective, the growth markets continued to perform well, with double-digit growth again this quarter, while the major markets continue to be weighed down by Japan and by public sector, which declined more sharply this quarter. Japan and public sector, which represent over 1/3 of total Global Business Services revenue, impacted the overall GBS constant currency growth rate by 6 points. GBS pretax income was also impacted by Japan this quarter. Two large contracts in Japan impacted our profit by almost $60 million. So Japan impacted both our profit growth and revenue growth in GBS this quarter. 
But as you know, we have a good track record of managing a broad portfolio of contracts. This quarter, our Total Services business delivered double-digit profit growth, and we feel confident that we can continue throughout the year.
Software had another strong quarter with revenue of $5.6 billion, up 5% or 7% at constant currency. Key Branded Middleware gained share for the 18th straight quarter as our software revenue mixes to the faster grower branded Middleware. This quarter, branded Middleware accounted for 62% of our total software, up a point from the same period last year. 
Gardner once again named IBM the worldwide market share leader in the application infrastructure and Middleware segment, an announcement that marks the beginning of the second decade of software leadership for IBM.
Segment pretax income was $1.9 billion, up 12% from last year. Now let me take you through the drivers by brand. WebSphere had another excellent quarter, growing 16% and gaining share for the 14th consecutive quarter. Within WebSphere, we had a strong contribution from our application server products and continued momentum in Smarter Commerce. 
In the first quarter, we strengthened our Smarter Commerce integrated portfolio by completing the acquisition of Demand Tech, a leader of pricing and promotion optimization solutions and our acquisition of forest, which helps clients reduce procurement costs and risks. With 5% growth, Information Management continues to perform well and gain share. Business Analytics had a very strong quarter, with double-digit growth in Cognos. Our acceleration in Cognos is driven by the successful integration of our predictive capabilities into recent product launches spanning both business intelligence and financial performance management. 
We continue to expand our global footprint with about 2/3 of our new client outside of North America. For the quarter, Netezza had a win rate of nearly 80% and head-to-head proof of concepts engagements.
Tivoli software was up 5% and we held share. Within Tivoli, our storage portfolio was up double digits once again. Security, including Q1 Labs, contributed to our Tivoli growth, as clients turned to IBM for intelligence, integration and expertise across our comprehensive framework of solutions. Rational grew 1% and we gained share. Performance was driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in teleological. Overall, software had another terrific quarter, with revenue up 7% at constant currency, pretax income of 12% and pretax margins of 1.9 points. With this performance, software was a strong contributor to our growth initiatives.
Systems and Technology revenue of $3.7 billion was down 7% following the very strong growth a year ago. System z revenue declined 25% versus last year's first quarter growth of over 40%. Nips declined 5% this quarter and we mixed towards specialty engines. System z gross profit margin was up again, which is typical at this point in the product cycle. POWER was flat and up 1% at constant currency. We had particular strength this quarter in POWER high-performance computing solutions. In POWER, we had over 250 competitive displacements, which resulted in over $200 million of business. Roughly 60% of this business came from HP, with most of the balance from Oracle Sun. This is the 16th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER.
System x revenue was flat and we held share. The System x revenue in the growth markets was up 17% at constant currency. This is the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in these emerging markets. The storage hardware revenue was down 4%. The value continues to shift to software. And this quarter, storage software was up 18%.
Last, week, we established the new category of competing with the introduction of Pure Systems, a new family of expert integrated systems that leverages decades of IBM's innovation with market-leading software to help clients address the economics and complexity of deploying new IT infrastructure. These revolutionary systems will enable clients to implement and manage new IT capabilities quickly and efficiently. 
Currently, company spends 70% of more of IT budgets on simple operations and maintenance. Pure Systems has the potential to lower total IT costs by more than 50% over 3 years, allowing the business to reinvest these savings towards new projects and innovation. These new expert-integrated systems demonstrate the breadth of our innovation and the value we bring to customers. This will start to contribute to our performance in the second half.
Also you may have seen we just announced the sale of our retail stores solutions business to Toshiba Tech, and the creation of a partnership to address the Smarter Commerce opportunity. The financial implications will be outlined on our investor website, including commentary on the expected gain and how we expect to offset it with additional workforce rebalancing activity, primarily outside the United States. But what's really important is the relationship going forward work. We're partnering with the world leader in point-of-sale systems. At the same time, we'll continue to build out our Smarter Commerce capabilities and our sweet spot, managing transactions and data and applying analytics. Combined, we'll have the best platform in the market for commerce.
Moving onto cash flow in the quarter. We generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, up $1.1 billion year-to-year. In the first quarter of last year, our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments, driven by audit settlement activity. Even if you adjust for the prior year tax impact, we had double-digit growth in free cash flow. The growth was driven by net income and working capital efficiencies. 
Looking at the uses of our cash, we spent $1.3 billion to acquire 5 companies, platform computing, Green Hat and Taurus, Work Lite and Demand Tech. These acquisitions add our capabilities in analytics and cloud and Smarter Planet. We returned $3.9 billion to shareholders, including almost $900 million in dividends, and we bought back 15.5 million shares for $3 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had $5.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12.3 billion, up $400 million from year end. Total debt was $32.1 billion, of which $23.6 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at 7 to 1. Our non-financing debt was $8.5 billion, up from $8 billion at year end. At these debt levels, non-financing debt-to-cap was 23%, up 1 point from year end. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility, and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long term.
So now let me start to wrap up with a summary of the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance this quarter. Our ongoing focus on productivity, together with the relative strength of our software business, drove strong margin performance, with gross pretax and net margins all up year-to-year. And the lower share count contributed $0.15, fairly consistent with last quarter. 
In fact, when you look at this quarter, it's really very similar to the fourth quarter in terms of the revenue growth, margin expansion and contribution from share repurchase. Even at the segment in the geography level, revenue growth was similar to the fourth. Once again, our growth initiatives led the performance. Our growth market's initiatives is based on expanding into new markets, building out IT infrastructures and leading in targeted industries. We've consistently delivered powerful performance and share gains. This quarter, growth markets revenue was up 9%, with 40 countries delivering double-digit growth at constant currency. 
In Business Analytics, we had a broad portfolio of analytic solutions to help our clients deal with the massive amounts of structured and unstructured data. Our solutions are built on decades of organic investments, 30 acquisitions since 2005 and more than 9,000 consultants in GBS. This quarter, IBMs Business Analytics revenue was up 14%.
Cloud provides an efficient and flexible delivery platform that improves the economics of IT. Our smart cloud portfolio addresses the full scope of enterprise client requirements. Total cloud revenue doubled over last year, with strong contribution from all areas: Private cloud, public cloud and our industry-based solutions. This all comes together in our Smarter Planet solutions. With over 25% growth this quarter, Smarter Planet continues to deliver strong growth driven by our new Smarter City solutions and continued strength in Smarter Commerce offerings.
When you look at our offerings in Business Analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet, about half of the revenue was software. So the success we're having in our growth initiatives is improving our business mix and margin. 
At the same time, we're continuing to invest in R&D, capital and acquisitions in support of these key areas. This investment is enabling us, not only to expand existing markets, but actually create new markets and new categories of computing. Last week's announcement of Pure Systems was a great example of how we're leveraging our organic research and development to create a game-changing solution for our clients.
So looking at our first quarter performance and all of these factors, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating earnings per share to at least $15. 
Now Patricia and I will take your questions."

I look at GBS and on a reported basis, it was down 2%, and I realized it's public in Japan contributing very negative growth overall. But do you actually see that getting any better going forward? And in fact, it seems like it's getting marginally worse. And when I look at the outsourcing side, your backlog is now down 5% relative to a year ago. And backlog is a good leading indicator, especially in the Outsourcing business. So perhaps you can help us understand how things get better from here. And on an as-reported basis, can GBS grow this year? And with minus 5% backlog in outsourcing, how does that go from here for the remainder of the year?"
112350,184180622,284735,"International Business Machines Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,"Earnings Calls","International Business Machines Corporation","Executives","Okay, Tony, thanks very much.

First of all, when we started the quarter, we told you that the backlog runout, we expected would be up 3% year-to-year. So in other words, we're looking at the one of backlog for Total Services that should influence revenue this year. And that backlog should affect about 70% of the revenue, so 70% of that 3% will drive about 2% revenue. And we had indicated that we felt confident that at that level of revenue, we could drive double-digit profit growth but for the year. So let's look at it now by individual units. If you look at GTS, I would argue they're right on track. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of 2.6% performance from our GTS team. And I think it's an indication that we do have that model specified correctly. And with that 2.6%, what do they do? They drove 20% profit growth and 2 points of margin improvement. So again, very consistent with our indication. When you look at GBS, actually the mechanics underneath that more on track, but we did get clipped by a couple of contracts that were more challenging for us. I gave you an example of a couple in Japan that impacted our profit by $60 million. Now outside of those 2 contracts, frankly, GBS would have grown their profit on a year-to-year basis. So if you consider those 2 contracts, I would tell you, number one, I think from a financial standpoint, we had the bulk of that behind us. And I don't expect, and I don't see contracts in the distribution that will have that kind of impact going forward. Now I can't predict the future, but I do have a pretty good view to the contracts that we're working on. Secondly, I'll tell you that GBS has a generally, over a longer period of time, pretty good at managing these challenging contract elements. So I think from my perspective, this is a bit of an anomaly. And GBS should get these 2 contracts behind them in the first and improve their performance to more typical levels as we go into the second quarter. By the way, just as a side I add, if you look at IBM's revenue growth for services up 1%, we were shy of 2% by $7 million. That's $7 million on a $15 billion base. So obviously, very close to the 2% level to begin with. I would also reiterate that even in the face of that, we had double-digit profit growth in services for the quarter. And we feel quite confident, given all of the elements that we see in the business equation for Services, we should be driving double-digit profit growth for the year."

Let's look of the drivers underneath the performance in our GTS business. Again profit up 20%, 2 points of margin. How did we achieve that and what do they have as far as sustainability going into the future? So number one, they -- GTS business, and frankly GBS as well, but GTS on a large part is a beneficiary of all the work that we're doing on productivity. Now you remember, at the Investor Day, Linda Sanford defined that in how we are managed across those elements. The objective is about $8 billion over the roadmap period. We felt that we did quite well on that base last year. And I'll tell you that our view is that we're right on track in the first quarter. GTS once again benefits from that work. And they are really, part and parcel, of the elements that we drive for the productivity and spend management. Number two, with those advanced tools and intellectual property, we're also working on not only the margins in the overall distribution but also the margins in the products that I recall the tale of the distribution, so more challenging contracts. And this year, the GTS team did a great piece of work on those contracts in the low-margin tale and the distribution of thousands of contracts and generated a very meaningful improvement in profitability that we know analytically extends throughout the year. And then lastly, I'll tell you, as we look at the dynamics in that business, our backlog growth for Total Services was up 14% in the growth markets. And then the growth markets, what we're seeing is we have 2 points better margin actually in those deals as well. So those 3 are ongoing dynamics, in my mind, and give us confidence that we have a strong play going forward."

If you look at the performance in the quarter, EPS up 15%, a very strong performance in our overall net income. Our cash flow, free cash flow and the business, up $1.1 billion year-to-year. Even if you take into consideration last year's tax payment, that was up $300 million or 16%. So to me, the characteristics of this first quarter is quite strong. And really, it was based on our confidence and characteristics of the quarter and the going-forward equation that encourage to take our view of the business up $0.15. Now remember, taking your view of the business, up $0.15, only 90 days into the quarter, I think is a real show of confidence. If you look at the next 3 quarters, we see them up about 10%. And that 10% is the underpinnings to what we view is in at least $15 for the year. Now that 10% across those quarters is reasonably uniform. I do think that the third quarter is probably a little tighter for us but usually uniform. And at 10%, given a $15 base of performance on at least basis for 2012, that's all the trajectory we need to get to $20 by 2015. So to me, I would say that the goal base of the business looks like it's been pretty darn good shape and on track to achieve our longer-term objective in 2015. Now to your point, what do we see going forward? There's a couple of dynamics that I would remind you off. Number one, the way to look at this is kind of the headwinds tailwinds. So as we look at it going forward for the second quarter or third quarter, we still will see the headwind from currency of about 3 points. We will still, as we go through the second quarter, have the compares challenge for us in the hardware base of business. As well, we will still be wrestling with the issues that we see in Japan in the second quarter. But I think, when we go to the second half, first of all, we have very strong software momentum. Second of all, we have a stable base of profitability and margin performance in our Services business. But when you get to the hardware base of business, we have new announcement content that should drive that performance, we should regain revenue growth in the second half based on those new announcement, pure systems being the first installment. And with that, we should see double-digit profitability in the second half from our hardware base as well. Rolling through all of that is the strength of our operating model and the strength of our growth initiatives. But I think stabilizing Japan in the second half and seeing the new announcement contribution from our hardware base of business, that's going to be a significant dynamic."

If we were sitting here in the meeting with the RCIO and Linda Sanford working on it, what do we work on? We work on the percentage of our IT budget that we're able to move into new content and new opportunity, as opposed to just maintaining our existing base of business. That's how we run it, and we've been doing this year after year after year. Why is that relevant in Pure Systems? If you look at it in a typical IT department, you could be spending about 70% of that budget on these kinds of simple operations and maintenance. We think we're the pure systems content. You'll have the opportunity to reduce that over a 3-year period by over 50%. That's an enormous contribution to your productivity. And as we would interpret that, if we were having that meeting today in my conference room, we would drive even more of our spend in the new announcement content, a new categories of IT spend.

They've had their 20th consecutive quarter of growth, so those 2 elements of overall public sector carried the business. On the government base of business, it's still pretty flat. And we see government spending really globally more challenged within that base of business. Your second question, really on Europe, again I would point out, as I think we've discussed before, Europe is not just a homogenous breakdown of countries. In the U.K., we had 10% growth in U.K. That's the 10th consecutive quarter of growth in the U.K. So it's not as if that's 10% on an easy compare. That's 10% on 2 years of real performance out of the U.K. business. And I think they've done a great job. Spain, we had growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. In Germany, we had growth for the second consecutive quarter. On the flip side, we're still down in France and down in Italy, but I think on balance, Europe to me, looks pretty stable. So if I would characterize it on a global basis going forward, I look at the major markets. We think they're relatively stable on a forward-looking basis. And the growth markets, I think, are showing some real strength."

But to your question on the robustness of our margin performance, I would look at the total services base of business. I mean these are very powerful aggregate margin performance from services. And again, as they went through those characteristics that were driving the workforce product initiatives with Linda Sanford, the systematic approach to deal with low margin content, the higher margins that we're seeing in Total Services, not just GTS but Total Services, in our growth markets unit, put all those together, we feel quite confident that we will see margin expansion for the year and generate double-digit profit growth for services."

As you look",361,"Well, my advice to you is that the best indicator to use now is $20 billion for acquisitions through 2015. Now, let's just go back to the math and the way we describe this in the investment meetings that we've had in the last couple of years. As you look at it, if you look at kind of the $4 billion a year run rate -- and by the way, this is not going to be linear because it's dependent on how frothy the market or attractive the market is and how it integrates with our initiatives. But if you look at that, we frankly exited 2010 in a very strong position. Remember, we did well over $6 billion in 2010. So when we went through the model at that time, we said, we frankly have a pretty substantial head start. And if you consider that, we don't expect this to be linear. If you look at those 2-year period of 2010 and 2011 come a 6% and 2% on average, we did about 4%. So I think that run rate on average is a good indicator. I don't think it's going to be $4 billion every year. This year, the $1.3 billion just for the first quarter, I would say we're kind of the half pace on a run-rate basis. The second point I would make is given that we did get ahead of the profile in 2010 with a very successful set of acquisitions, 17 in total, that frankly put us ahead of the game as we look at our EPS objective for acquisitions as part of the 2015 roadmap. Remember, we're looking for about $0.90. And given that the headstart that we had coming out of 2010, we had to be able to have that $0.90 at the spend rate of between 10 and $15 billion as opposed to $20 billion, so that provides, I think, opportunity for us. But from my perspective, I'd tell you form what I'm doing, I am viewing this as an opportunity for $20 billion in our treasury and our capital planning processes, believe me, we're reserving over $20 billion in our roadmap."

We just signed a deal. We've got a lot of work to do. We're just closing that deal. But I think were going to use that as kind of a guide on the workforce rebalancing charges. So let me now just take a few moments to wrap up the call.
From my perspective, the first quarter had a similar characteristics to the fourth and was a strong start to the year. We had great margin and profit cash performance and continued the momentum in all of our growth initiatives. Remember, last quarter, I said that in 2012, we'll take a number of actions that position us to achieve our 2015 roadmap objective, including acquisitions and divestitures, investing in key growth initiatives and rebalancing our workforce to where we see the best opportunities. In the last 90 days, we've made great progress. We have a couple of strategic announcements that demonstrate our focus on higher value and ongoing transformation of our business. Our Pure Systems announcement is a result of $2 billion of R&D and leverages that it's up technology innovation and know-how. It's a new platform, and we believe it's a game changing event for our clients. And we announced today a strategic partnership with Toshiba TEC that better positions us to address the important Smarter Commerce opportunity. So all of this gives us confidence to take up our expectation for the full year to at least $15 of operating EPS for the year. That's up almost 12% from last year and puts us on a good track to deliver at least $20 in 2015. So thanks for joining us. And now, as always, back to work."

In the first quarter, we have reported $24.7 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $2.78, which is up 15% year-to-year. And now, 90 days into the y",3103,"Thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter, we have reported $24.7 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $2.78, which is up 15% year-to-year. And now, 90 days into the year, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15. This is up $0.15 from our previous view of at least $14.85. 
Looking at the results by segment. We continued our strong performance in software as we aggressively address opportunities in analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet. Our software profit was up 12%. 
In services, we expanded margins and increased Total Services profit by 11% as we leverage our productivity initiatives and mix to higher margin offerings in markets. Services revenue growth was again led by growth markets, which were up 10% at constant currency. And our backlog in growth markets was up 14% at constant currency. 
As expected, our hardware business declined as compared to a very strong growth of 19% in the first quarter of last year. This quarter, we extended our leadership in the UNIX market as we continued our competitive displacements in POWER. 
And just last week, we announced PureSystems, the first new class of computing in over 20 years. This solution leverages IBM's decades-long investment in innovation and radically simplifies enterprise computing. This should start to contribute to the systems performance in the second half of the year.
Turning to profit. Our ongoing focus on productivity, together with the relative strength of our software business, drove strong margin performance. We expanded operating gross margin by over a point, led by services. And our operating net margin was up a similar amount, 1.1 points. Within that income, this quarter, we had a couple of unique items that impacted the dynamic between operating pretax income and our tax rate. 
You'll recall that in the first quarter of last year, our workforce rebalancing was essentially offset by one-time investment gains. This quarter, our workforce rebalancing was very similar to last year. But this year, the charge was offset by a one-time tax benefit associated with a tax restructuring in Latin America. Excluding this one-time benefit, we expect our full year annual effective tax rate to still be in the range of 25%.
So a very similar dynamic to last year: with a gain offsetting our workforce rebalance charges, though, this year, the offset is included below the PTI line in tax. So through margin expansion, together with effective use of cash, we delivered operating EPS of $2.78, which was up 15% year-to-year.
Turning to cash flow. We generated almost $2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, really strong performance. In addition to returning value to shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and dividends, our cash flow is enabling the ongoing transformation of the business, acquiring key capabilities and focusing our portfolio on the areas where we can add the most value. 
This quarter, we closed 5 acquisitions for a total of $1.3 billion. The acquisitions increased our capabilities in analytics and cloud and our Smarter Planet initiatives. Now we'll get into the first quarter details starting with revenue by geography, where, as always, I'll discuss the results on a local currency basis.
In the first quarter, revenue at constant currency was very consistent with the fourth quarter and in line with our expectations. Revenue in our major market countries was essentially flat year-to-year. Within the Americas, performance was led by Canada, which was up 9%. The U.S. was flat, off of last year's strong growth of 7%. Europe, again, grew at 1%, in line with the fourth quarter, so we're seeing some stability there. 
The most consistent performance has come from the U.K. and Spain. With 10% growth, the U.K. has delivered 10 consecutive quarters of growth. And Spain continues to leverage its global relationships, now growing in each of the last 6 quarters. Germany posted modest growth, while France declined.
Our growth markets outpaced the major markets by 10 points of revenue growth. Even with a tough compare, the BRICs had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 11%. And with about 60% of our growth markets business outside the BRICs, altogether, we had double-digit growth in 40 growth markets countries. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of share gains in the growth markets, and we're accelerating our market expansion initiative to continue that success.
Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment. Global Technology Services constant currency revenue growth rate was very consistent with the last few quarters. And Global Business Services growth rate continued to be impacted by weakness in Japan and public sector. Our software business had another great quarter, driven by our offerings in business analytics, Smarter Commerce and storage management. 
In Systems and Technology, last year, we had a very strong first quarter, driven by product cycles in mainframe and POWER. So our growth rate this quarter reflects that difficult compare, though we continued to take share in UNIX.
Turning to gross profit. Our operating gross profit margin improved 1.2 points, driven by a combination of good margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative strength in software. Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile.
Our total operating expense and other income was up 3%. Acquisitions over the last 12 months contributed 2 points of the increase. Currency from both translation and hedging dynamics reduced expense growth by 2 points, and our base expense, excluding currency and acquisitions, was up 3 points. I'll comment on a couple of expense items that had larger year-to-year impacts to our profit. 
First, in last year's results, we had investment gains of over $200 million, primarily for the sale of Lenovo shares. This gain effectively funded the $220 million of workforce rebalancing charges in last year's first quarter. This year, we had a one-time tax benefit from a tax restructuring in Latin America, and the tax benefit offset the workforce rebalancing charges, which, again, were about $220 million. So the net effect to net income was negligible, both within the period and year-to-year.
Another expense item I'll comment on is a year-to-year help from our hedging programs. We hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in global cash planning. Last year, hedging programs generated losses in the quarter. This year, our hedging was down $125 million year-to-year, as you would expect, given the year-to-year changes in currencies. Of this, about $85 million year-to-year is an expense, most of which is in other income and expense. Now keep in mind that you can't look at hedges in isolation. They mitigate the translation impacts across the P&L.
So now let me go into the segments. The 2 services segments delivered $14.7 billion in revenue, grew pretax profit by 11% and expanded pretax margin by 1.3 points. Backlog was $139 billion, down 2% at actual rates and up 1% at constant currency. We started 2012 with continued momentum in our growth initiatives, margin expansion and strong profit growth. 
Revenue in the growth markets was up double digits at constant currency again this quarter, driven by strong backlog growth. Total growth markets' backlog was up 14% year-to-year at constant currency, reflecting strong demand for both our outsourcing and transactional services in these markets. We also had strong performance in business analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet offerings.
Moving on to the 2 segments. In Global Technology Services, revenue was $10 billion, up 2% or 3% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 2% or 3% at constant currency, and we gained share again this quarter. Integrated technology services revenue grew 3%. We had great performance in the growth markets, up 14% year-to-year at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered very strong profit and margin this quarter, with pretax income up 20% and pretax margin up 2.2 points. 
There were 3 primary drivers of this margin expansion. First, we continued to benefit from efforts to deliver productivity and efficiency within GTS and in conjunction with the enterprise productivity initiatives. Second, we continued to get higher margins in the faster growing growth markets. And finally, GTS has done a tremendous amount of work managing their large portfolio of outsourcing contracts. Within that portfolio, there's a mix of contracts with different profit characteristics. We have taken a systematic and disciplined approach to solving problems in a select set of lower margin contracts, and we're seeing the yield from these efforts in our margin.
Turning to Global Business Services. Revenue was $4.6 billion, down 2% or 1% at constant currency. We had modest declines in both Application Outsourcing and consulting and systems integration. I previously mentioned the strong results in business analytics and Smarter Planet, where GBS is leading many of the engagements across IBM. Within GBS, business analytics grew 16% and Smarter Planet grew 18%. These are very important initiatives for IBM. 
From a geographic perspective, the growth markets continued to perform well, with double-digit growth again this quarter, while the major markets continued to be weighed down by Japan and by public sector, which declined more sharply this quarter. Japan and public sector, which represent over 1/3 of total Global Business Services revenue, impacted the overall GBS constant currency growth rate by 6 points. GBS pretax income was also impacted by Japan this quarter. Two large contracts in Japan impacted our profit by almost $60 million. So Japan impacted both our profit growth and revenue growth in GBS this quarter. 
But as you know, we have a good track record of managing a broad portfolio of contracts. This quarter, our Total Services business delivered double-digit profit growth, and we feel confident that we can continue throughout the year.
Software had another strong quarter, with revenue of $5.6 billion, up 5% or 7% at constant currency. Key branded middleware gained share for the 18th straight quarter as our software revenue mixes to the faster-growing branded middleware. This quarter, branded middleware accounted for 62% of our total software, up a point from the same period last year. Gartner once again named IBM the worldwide market share leader in the application infrastructure and middleware segment, an announcement that marks the beginning of the second decade of software leadership for IBM.
Segment pretax income was $1.9 billion, up 12% from last year. Now let me take you through the drivers by brand. WebSphere had another excellent quarter, growing 16% and gaining share for the 14th consecutive quarter. Within WebSphere, we had a strong contribution from our application server products and continued momentum in Smarter Commerce. 
In the first quarter, we strengthened our Smarter Commerce integrated portfolio by completing the acquisition of DemandTec, a leader of pricing and promotion optimization solutions and our acquisition of Emptoris, which helps clients reduce procurement costs and risks. 
With 5% growth, Information Management continues to perform well and gain share. Business analytics had a very strong quarter, with double-digit growth in Cognos. Our acceleration in Cognos is driven by the successful integration of our predictive capabilities into recent product launches spanning both business intelligence and financial performance management. 
We continue to expand our global Netezza footprint, with about 2/3 of our new clients outside of North America. For the quarter, Netezza had a win rate of nearly 80% and head-to-head proof of concepts engagements.
Tivoli software was up 5%, and we held share. Within Tivoli, our storage portfolio was up double digits once again. Security, including Q1 Labs, contributed to our Tivoli growth, as clients turned to IBM for intelligence, integration and expertise across our comprehensive framework of solutions. 
Rational grew 1%, and we gained share. Performance was driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in Telelogic. Overall, software had another terrific quarter, with revenue up 7% at constant currency, pretax income of 12% and pretax margins of 1.9 points. With this performance, software was a strong contributor to our growth initiatives.
Systems and Technology revenue of $3.7 billion was down 7% following the very strong growth a year ago. System z revenue declined 25% versus last year's first quarter growth of over 40%. MIPS declined 5% this quarter, and we mixed towards specialty engines. System z gross profit margin was up again, which is typical at this point in the product cycle. 
POWER was flat and up 1% at constant currency. We had particular strength this quarter in POWER high-performance computing solutions. In POWER, we had over 250 competitive displacements, which resulted in over $200 million of business. Roughly 60% of this business came from HP, with most of the balance from Oracle Sun. This is the 16th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER.
System x revenue was flat, and we held share. The System x revenue in the growth markets was up 17% at constant currency. This is the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in these emerging markets. The storage hardware revenue was down 4%. The value continues to shift to software. And this quarter, storage software was up 18%.
Last week, we established the new category of computing with the introduction of PureSystems, a new family of expert integrated systems that leverages decades of IBM's innovation with market-leading software to help clients address the economics and complexity of deploying new IT infrastructure. These revolutionary systems will enable clients to implement and manage new IT capabilities quickly and efficiently. 
Currently, companies spend 70% or more of IT budgets on simple operations and maintenance. PureSystems has the potential to lower total IT costs by more than 50% over 3 years, allowing the business to reinvest these savings towards new projects and innovation. These new expert integrated systems demonstrate the breadth of our innovation and the value we bring to our customers. This will start to contribute to our performance in the second half.
Also, you may have seen we just announced the sale of our retail store solutions business to Toshiba TEC and the creation of a partnership to address the Smarter Commerce opportunity. The financial implications will be outlined on our investor website, including commentary on the expected gain and how we expect to offset it with additional workforce rebalancing activity, primarily outside the United States. But what's really important is the relationship going forward. We're partnering with the world leader in point-of-sale systems. At the same time, we'll continue to build out our Smarter Commerce capabilities and our sweet spot, managing transactions and data and applying analytics. Combined, we'll have the best platform in the market for commerce.
Moving on to cash flow in the quarter. We generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, up $1.1 billion year-to-year. In the first quarter of last year, our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments, driven by audit settlement activity. Even if you adjust for the prior year tax impact, we had double-digit growth in free cash flow. The growth was driven by net income and working capital efficiencies. 
Looking at the uses of our cash. We spent $1.3 billion to acquire 5 companies: Platform Computing, Green Hat, Emptoris, Worklight and DemandTec. These acquisitions add to our capabilities in analytics and cloud and Smarter Planet. 
We returned $3.9 billion to shareholders, including almost $900 million in dividends, and we bought back 15.5 million shares for $3 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had $5.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12.3 billion, up $400 million from year-end. Total debt was $32.1 billion, of which $23.6 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at 7:1. Our non-financing debt was $8.5 billion, up from $8 billion at year-end. At these debt levels, non-financing debt-to-cap was 33%, up 1 point from year-end. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility, and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long term.
So now let me start to wrap up with a summary of the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance this quarter. Our ongoing focus on productivity, together with the relative strength of our software business, drove strong margin performance, with gross pretax and net margins all up year-to-year. And the lower share count contributed $0.15, fairly consistent with last quarter. 
In fact, when you look at this quarter, it's really very similar to the fourth quarter in terms of the revenue growth, margin expansion and contribution from share repurchase. Even at the segment in geography level, revenue growth was similar to the fourth. Once again, our growth initiatives led the performance. Our growth markets' initiatives is based on expanding into new markets, building out IT infrastructures and leading in targeted industries. We have consistently delivered powerful performance and share gains. This quarter, growth markets revenue was up 9%, with 40 countries delivering double-digit growth at constant currency. 
In business analytics, we have a broad portfolio of analytic solutions to help our clients deal with the massive amounts of structured and unstructured data. Our solutions are built on decades of organic investments, 30 acquisitions since 2005 and more than 9,000 consultants in GBS. This quarter, IBM's business analytics revenue was up 14%.
Cloud provides an efficient and flexible delivery platform that improves the economics of IT. Our smart cloud portfolio addresses the full scope of enterprise client requirements. Total cloud revenue doubled over last year, with strong contribution from all areas: private cloud, public cloud and our industry-based solutions. This all comes together in our Smarter Planet solutions. With over 25% growth this quarter, Smarter Planet continues to deliver strong growth driven by our new Smarter City solutions and continued strength in Smarter Commerce offerings. When you look at our offerings in business analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet, about half of the revenue is software, so the success we're having in our growth initiatives is improving our business mix and margin. 
At the same time, we're continuing to invest in R&D, capital and acquisitions in support of these key areas. This investment is enabling us not only to expand existing markets, but actually create new markets and new categories of computing. Last week's announcement of PureSystems was a great example of how we're leveraging our organic research and development to create a game-changing solution for our clients.
So looking at our first quarter performance and all of these factors, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating earnings per share to at least $15.

I look at GBS and on a reported basis, it was down 2%, and I realized it's public and Japan contributing very negative growth overall. But do you actually see that getting any better going forward? And in fact, it seems like it's getting marginally worse. And when I look at the outsourcing side, your backlog is now down 5% relative to a year ago. And backlog is a good leading indicator, especially in the outsourcing business. So perhaps you can help us understand how things get better from here. And on an as-reported basis, can GBS grow this year? And with a minus 5% backlog in outsourcing, how does that go from here for the remainder of the year?"

Let's start from first principles. First of all, when we started the quarter, we told you that the backlog runout we expected would be up 3% year-to-year.

First of all, when we started the quarter, we told you that the backlog runout we expected would be up 3% year-to-year. So in other words, we're looking at one, at the backlog for total services that it should influence revenue this year. And that backlog should affect about 70% of the revenue, so 70% of that 3% will drive about 2% revenue. And we had indicated that we felt confident that at that level of revenue, we could drive double-digit profit growth for the year. So let's look at it now by the individual units. If you look at GTS, I would argue they're right on track. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of 2.6% performance from our GTS team, and I think it's an indication that we do have that model specified correctly. And with that 2.6%, what did they do? They drove 20% profit growth and 2 points of margin improvement. So again, very consistent with our indication. When you look at GBS, actually the mechanics underneath that more on track, but we did get clipped by a couple of contracts that were more challenging for us. I gave you an example of a couple in Japan that impacted our profit by $60 million. Now outside of those 2 contracts, frankly, GBS would have grown their profit on a year-to-year basis. So if you consider those 2 contracts, I would tell you, number one, I think from a financial standpoint, we had the bulk of that behind us. And I don't expect and I don't see contracts in the distribution that will have that kind of impact going forward. Now I can't predict the future, but I do have a pretty good preview to the contracts that we're working on. Secondly, I'll tell you that GBS has, generally, over a longer period of time, been pretty good at managing these challenging contract elements. So I think from my perspective, this is a bit of an anomaly, and GBS should get these 2 contracts behind them in the first and improve their performance to more typical levels as we go into the second quarter. By the way, just as in the side I'd add, that if you look at IBM's revenue growth for services, up 1%, we were shy of 2% by $7 million. That's $7 million on a $15 billion base, so obviously, very close to the 2% level to begin with. I would also reiterate that even in the face of that, we had double-digit profit growth in services for the quarter, and we feel quite confident, given all of the elements that we see in the business equation for Services, we should be driving double-digit profit growth for the year."

If you look at -- let's look of the drivers underneath the performance in our GTS business, again, profit up 20%, 2 points of margin. How did we achieve that and what do they have as far as sustainability going into the future? So number one, they -- GTS business, and frankly GBS as well, but GTS on a large part is a beneficiary of all the work that we're doing on productivity. Now you remember, at the Investor Day, Linda Sanford defined that and how we were  managing that across those elements. The objective is about $8 billion over the roadmap period. We felt that we did quite well on that base last year. And I'll tell you that our view is that we're right on track in the first quarter. GTS once again benefits from that work. And they are really part and parcel of all the elements that we drive for productivity and spend management. Number two, with those advanced tools and intellectual property, we're also working on not only the margins in the overall distribution but also the margins in the products that I would call the tail of the distribution, so more challenging contracts. And this year, the GTS team did a great piece of work on those contracts in the low-margin tail in the distribution of thousands of contracts and generated a very meaningful improvement in profitability that we know analytically extends throughout the year. And then lastly, I'll tell you, as we look at the dynamics in that business, our backlog growth for Total Services was up 14% in the growth markets. And then the growth markets, what we're seeing is we have 2 points better margin actually in those deals as well. So those 3 are ongoing dynamics, in my mind, and give us confidence that we have a strong play going forward."

If you look at the performance in the quarter, EPS up 15%, a very strong performance in our overall net income. Our cash flow -- free cash flow in the business, up $1.1 billion year-to-year. Even if you take into consideration last year's tax payment, that was up $300 million or 16%. So to me, the characteristics of this first quarter are quite strong. And really, it was based on our confidence in characteristics of the quarter and the going-forward equation that encouraged us to take our view of the business up $0.15. Now remember, taking your view of the business, up $0.15 only 90 days into the quarter, I think is a real show of confidence. If you look at the next 3 quarters, we see them up about 10%. And that 10% is the underpinnings to what we view as an at least $15 for the year. Now that 10% across those quarters is reasonably uniform. I do think the third quarter is probably a little tighter for us, but we're usually uniform. And at 10%, given a $15 base performance on  -- at the least basis for 2012, that's all the trajectory we need to get to $20 by 2015. So to me, I would say that the base of the business looks like it's in pretty darn good shape and on track to achieve our longer-term objective in 2015. Now to your point, what do we see going forward? There's a couple of dynamics that I would remind you of. Number one -- and maybe a way to look at this is kind of headwinds, tailwinds. So as we look at it going forward for the second quarter or third quarter, we still will see the headwind from currency at about 3 points. We will still, as we go through the second quarter, have the compares challenged for us in the hardware base of business. As well, we will still be wrestling with the issues that we see in Japan in the second quarter. But I think, when we go to the second half, first of all, we have very strong software momentum. Second of all, we have a stable base of profitability and margin performance in our services business. But when you get to the hardware base of business, we have new announcement content that should drive that performance. We should regain revenue growth in the second half based on those new announcement, PureSystems being the first installment. And with that, we should see double-digit profitability in the second half from our hardware base as well. Rolling through all of that is the strength of our operating model and the strength of our growth initiatives. But I think stabilizing Japan in the second half and seeing the new announcement contribution from our hardware base of business, that's going to be a significant dynamic."

If we were sitting here in the meeting with the RCIO and Linda Sanford working on it, what do we work on? We work on the percentage of our IT budget that we're able to move into the new content and new opportunity, as opposed to just maintaining our existing base of business. That's how we run it, and we've been doing this year after year after year. Why is that relevant in PureSystems? Well, If you look at it, in a typical IT department, you could be spending about 70% of that budget on these kinds of simple operations and maintenance. We think with the PureSystems content, you'll have the opportunity to reduce that over a 3-year period by over 50%. That's an enormous contribution to your productivity. And as we would interpret that, if we were having that meeting today in my conference room, we would drive even more of our spend in the new announcement content and new categories of IT spend. So I think it's a very powerful opportunity for us on a financial base. That doesn't even get to the unique capabilities and patterns of expertise that it has, built-in expertise, then the complex of business, integration by design. I mean, this can be up and running in as little as 4 hours. So to us, PureSystems is a first new system in 2 decades to hit this kind of an industry rollout, and we're very confident that it would go into the second half and as a big element of our game plan going into 2015."

They've had their 20th consecutive quarter of growth. So those 2 elements of overall public sector carried the business. On the government base of business, it's still pretty flat. And we see government spending, really globally, more challenged within that base of business. Your second question, really on Europe. Again, I would point out, as I think we've discussed before, Europe is not just a homogenous breakdown of countries. In the U.K., we had 10% growth, U.K. That's the 10th consecutive quarter of growth in the U.K. So it's not as if that's 10% on an easy compare. That's 10% on 2 years of real performance out of the U.K. business. So I think they've done a great job. Spain, we had growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. In Germany, we had growth for the second consecutive quarter. On the flip side, we're still down in France and down in Italy, but I think on balance, Europe to me, looks pretty stable. So if I would characterize it on a global basis going forward, I look at the major markets, we think they're relatively stable on a forward-looking basis.

You can however -- if you look at those 2 contracts that I described that were more challenging in Japan, that $60 million, if you strip that out, it would have grown on a year-to-year basis and obviously, given the  realm of characteristics, that would have been expanding margin. Now on a go-forward basis, we expect them in the second quarter to get a lot of those large challenging contracts, that we had in Japan behind us from a financial perspective, get back to more normal operating conditions. But to your question on the robustness of our margin performance, I would look at the total services base of business. I mean, this is a very powerful aggregate margin performance from services. And again, as I went through those characteristics that were driving the workforce productivity initiatives with Linda Sanford, the systematic approach to deal with low margin content, the higher margins that we're seeing in total services, not just GTS but total services and our growth markets unit put all those together, we feel quite confident that we will see margin expansion for the year and generate double-digit profit growth for services."

It's been a real win for us. In a way, I kind of look at it and say, we're a good proof of concept that is not only its application in current deal pools, but as an indicator of the kind of opportunity we have with PureSystems going forward. So I think that's been very, very successful. On the software base of business, they had a great quarter. I mean, if you look at that performance, the profitability in the first quarter, $1.9 billion profit, up 12%; the base software content, up 7%; real double-digit strength in that WebSphere platform. I think we have a very, very competitive offering. So the software base of business is doing very, very well competitively. I think Netezza on that kind of integrated offering, really good proof point for us since the acquisition and again, gives us a lot of confidence on this integrated offering of PureSystems, which is not just hardware but hardware, software and services going forward into the second half."

Now let's just go back to the math and the way we've describe this in the investment meetings that we've had in the last couple of years. As you look at it, if you look at that kind of $4 billion a year run rate -- and by the way, this is not going to be linear because it's dependent on how frothy the market or attractive the market is and how it integrates with our initiatives. But if you look at that, we frankly exited 2010 in a very strong position. Remember, we did well over $6 billion in 2010. So when we went through the model at that time, we said, we frankly have a pretty substantial head start. And if you have considered that, we don't expect this to be linear. If you look at those -- that 2-year period of 2010 and 2011, $6 billion and $2 billion . On average, we did about $4 billion. So I think that run rate, on average, is a good indicator. I don't think it's going to be $4 billion every year. This year, $1.3 billion just for the first quarter, I would say we're kind of a hit pace [ph] on a run-rate basis. The second point I would make is given that we did get ahead of the profile in 2010 with a very successful set of acquisitions, 17 in total, that, frankly, put us ahead of the game as we looked at our EPS objective for acquisitions as part of the 2015 roadmap. Remember, we're looking for about $0.90. And given that the head start that we had coming out of 2010, we had to be able to hit that $0.90 at a spend rate of between $10 billion and  $15 billion as opposed to $20 billion. So that provides, I think, opportunity for us. But from my perspective, I'd tell you from what I'm doing, I am viewing this as an opportunity for $20 billion in our treasury and our capital planning processes, believe me, we're reserving about $20 billion over the roadmap."

Now this year, it could be a little richer than that, as you correctly pointed out. On a full year basis, the vast majority is going to be spent outside the U.S. So we'll have slightly longer payback periods. But in the dollars that we spent on workforce rebalancing at the first quarter, we expect that to payback in the year. So I think we have a good plan. We still have a lot of work to do. We just signed a deal. We've got a lot of work to do if you get to closing that deal. But I think I would use that as kind of a guide on the workforce rebalancing charges. 
So let me now just take a few moments to wrap up the call. From my perspective, the first quarter had a similar characteristic to the fourth and was a strong start to the year. We had great margin and profit and cash performance and continued the momentum in all of our growth initiatives. Remember, last quarter, I said that in 2012, we'll take a number of actions that position us to achieve our 2015 roadmap objective, including acquisitions and divestitures, investing in key growth initiatives and rebalancing our workforce to where we see the best opportunities. In the last 90 days, we've made great progress. We have a couple of strategic announcements that demonstrate our focus on higher value and ongoing transformation of our business. Our PureSystems announcement is a result of $2 billion of R&D and leverages decades of technology innovation and know-how. It's a new platform, and we believe it's a game-changing event for our clients. And we announced today a strategic partnership with Toshiba TEC that better positions us to address the important Smarter Commerce opportunity. So all of this gives us confidence to take up our expectation for the full year to at least $15 of operating EPS for the year. That's up almost 12% from last year and puts us on a good track to deliver at least $20 in 2015. So thanks for joining us. And now, as always, back to work."

In the first quarter, we have reported $24.7 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $2.78, which is up 15% year-to-year. And now, 90 days into the y",3103,"Thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter, we have reported $24.7 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $2.78, which is up 15% year-to-year. And now, 90 days into the year, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15. This is up $0.15 from our previous view of at least $14.85. 
Looking at the results by segment. We continued our strong performance in software as we aggressively address opportunities in analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet. Our software profit was up 12%. 
In services, we expanded margins and increased Total Services profit by 11% as we leverage our productivity initiatives and mix to higher margin offerings in markets. Services revenue growth was again led by growth markets, which were up 10% at constant currency. And our backlog in growth markets was up 14% at constant currency. 
As expected, our hardware business declined as compared to a very strong growth of 19% in the first quarter of last year. This quarter, we extended our leadership in the UNIX market as we continued our competitive displacements in POWER. 
And just last week, we announced PureSystems, the first new class of computing in over 20 years. This solution leverages IBM's decades-long investment in innovation and radically simplifies enterprise computing. This should start to contribute to the systems performance in the second half of the year.
Turning to profit. Our ongoing focus on productivity, together with the relative strength of our software business, drove strong margin performance. We expanded operating gross margin by over a point, led by services. And our operating net margin was up a similar amount, 1.1 points. Within net income, this quarter, we had a couple of unique items that impacted the dynamic between operating pretax income and our tax rate. 
You'll recall that in the first quarter of last year, our workforce rebalancing was essentially offset by one-time investment gains. This quarter, our workforce rebalancing was very similar to last year. But this year, the charge was offset by a one-time tax benefit associated with a tax restructuring in Latin America. Excluding this one-time benefit, we expect our full year annual effective tax rate to still be in the range of 25%.
So a very similar dynamic to last year: with a gain offsetting our workforce rebalance charges, though, this year, the offset is included below the PTI line in tax. So through margin expansion, together with effective use of cash, we delivered operating EPS of $2.78, which was up 15% year-to-year.
Turning to cash flow. We generated almost $2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, really strong performance. In addition to returning value to shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and dividends, our cash flow is enabling the ongoing transformation of the business, acquiring key capabilities and focusing our portfolio on the areas where we can add the most value. 
This quarter, we closed 5 acquisitions for a total of $1.3 billion. The acquisitions increased our capabilities in analytics and cloud and our Smarter Planet initiatives. Now we'll get into the first quarter details starting with revenue by geography, where, as always, I'll discuss the results on a local currency basis.
In the first quarter, revenue at constant currency was very consistent with the fourth quarter and in line with our expectations. Revenue in our major market countries was essentially flat year-to-year. Within the Americas, performance was led by Canada, which was up 9%. The U.S. was flat, off of last year's strong growth of 7%. Europe, again, grew at 1%, in line with the fourth quarter, so we're seeing some stability there. 
The most consistent performance has come from the U.K. and Spain. With 10% growth, the U.K. has delivered 10 consecutive quarters of growth. And Spain continues to leverage its global relationships, now growing in each of the last 6 quarters. Germany posted modest growth, while France declined.
Our growth markets outpaced the major markets by 10 points of revenue growth. Even with a tough compare, the BRICs had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 11%. And with about 60% of our growth markets business outside the BRICs, altogether, we had double-digit growth in 40 growth markets countries. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of share gains in the growth markets, and we're accelerating our market expansion initiative to continue that success.
Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment. Global Technology Services constant currency revenue growth rate was very consistent with the last few quarters. And Global Business Services growth rate continued to be impacted by weakness in Japan and public sector. Our software business had another great quarter, driven by our offerings in business analytics, Smarter Commerce and storage management. 
In Systems and Technology, last year, we had a very strong first quarter, driven by product cycles in mainframe and POWER. So our growth rate this quarter reflects that difficult compare, though we continued to take share in UNIX.
Turning to gross profit. Our operating gross profit margin improved 1.2 points, driven by a combination of good margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative strength in software. Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile.
Our total operating expense and other income was up 3%. Acquisitions over the last 12 months contributed 2 points of the increase. Currency from both translation and hedging dynamics reduced expense growth by 2 points, and our base expense, excluding currency and acquisitions, was up 3 points. I'll comment on a couple of expense items that had larger year-to-year impacts to our profit. 
First, in last year's results, we had investment gains of over $200 million, primarily for the sale of Lenovo shares. This gain effectively funded the $220 million of workforce rebalancing charges in last year's first quarter. This year, we had a one-time tax benefit from a tax restructuring in Latin America, and the tax benefit offset the workforce rebalancing charges, which, again, were about $220 million. So the net effect to net income was negligible, both within the period and year-to-year.
Another expense item I'll comment on is a year-to-year help from our hedging programs. We hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in global cash planning. Last year, hedging programs generated losses in the quarter. This year, our hedging was down $125 million year-to-year, as you would expect, given the year-to-year changes in currencies. Of this, about $85 million year-to-year is an expense, most of which is in other income and expense. Now keep in mind that you can't look at hedges in isolation. They mitigate the translation impacts across the P&L.
So now let me go into the segments. The 2 Services segments delivered $14.7 billion in revenue, grew pretax profit by 11% and expanded pretax margin by 1.3 points. Backlog was $139 billion, down 2% at actual rates and up 1% at constant currency. We started 2012 with continued momentum in our growth initiatives, margin expansion and strong profit growth. 
Revenue in the growth markets was up double digits at constant currency again this quarter, driven by strong backlog growth. Total growth markets' backlog was up 14% year-to-year at constant currency, reflecting strong demand for both our outsourcing and transactional services in these markets. We also had strong performance in business analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet offerings.
Moving on to the 2 segments. In Global Technology Services, revenue was $10 billion, up 2% or 3% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 2% or 3% at constant currency, and we gained share again this quarter. Integrated Technology Services revenue grew 3%. We had great performance in the growth markets, up 14% year-to-year at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered very strong profit and margin this quarter, with pretax income up 20% and pretax margin up 2.2 points. 
There were 3 primary drivers of this margin expansion. First, we continued to benefit from efforts to deliver productivity and efficiency within GTS and in conjunction with the enterprise productivity initiatives. Second, we continued to get higher margins in the faster growing growth markets. And finally, GTS has done a tremendous amount of work managing their large portfolio of outsourcing contracts. Within that portfolio, there's a mix of contracts with different profit characteristics. We have taken a systematic and disciplined approach to solving problems in a select set of lower margin contracts, and we're seeing the yield from these efforts in our margin.
Turning to Global Business Services. Revenue was $4.6 billion, down 2% or 1% at constant currency. We had modest declines in both Application Outsourcing and consulting and systems integration. I previously mentioned the strong results in business analytics and Smarter Planet, where GBS is leading many of the engagements across IBM. Within GBS, business analytics grew 16% and Smarter Planet grew 18%. These are very important initiatives for IBM. 
From a geographic perspective, the growth markets continued to perform well, with double-digit growth again this quarter, while the major markets continued to be weighed down by Japan and by public sector, which declined more sharply this quarter. Japan and public sector, which represent over 1/3 of total Global Business Services revenue, impacted the overall GBS constant currency growth rate by 6 points. GBS pretax income was also impacted by Japan this quarter. Two large contracts in Japan impacted our profit by almost $60 million. So Japan impacted both our profit growth and revenue growth in GBS this quarter. 
But as you know, we have a good track record of managing a broad portfolio of contracts. This quarter, our Total Services business delivered double-digit profit growth, and we feel confident that we can continue throughout the year.
Software had another strong quarter, with revenue of $5.6 billion, up 5% or 7% at constant currency. Key branded middleware gained share for the 18th straight quarter as our software revenue mixes to the faster-growing branded middleware. This quarter, branded middleware accounted for 62% of our total software, up a point from the same period last year. Gartner once again named IBM the worldwide market share leader in the application infrastructure and middleware segment, an announcement that marks the beginning of the second decade of software leadership for IBM.
Segment pretax income was $1.9 billion, up 12% from last year. Now let me take you through the drivers by brand. WebSphere had another excellent quarter, growing 16% and gaining share for the 14th consecutive quarter. Within WebSphere, we had a strong contribution from our application server products and continued momentum in Smarter Commerce. 
In the first quarter, we strengthened our Smarter Commerce integrated portfolio by completing the acquisition of DemandTec, a leader of pricing and promotion optimization solutions and our acquisition of Emptoris, which helps clients reduce procurement costs and risks. 
With 5% growth, Information Management continues to perform well and gain share. Business analytics had a very strong quarter, with double-digit growth in Cognos. Our acceleration in Cognos is driven by the successful integration of our predictive capabilities into recent product launches spanning both business intelligence and financial performance management. 
We continue to expand our global Netezza footprint, with about 2/3 of our new clients outside of North America. For the quarter, Netezza had a win rate of nearly 80% and head-to-head proof of concepts engagements.
Tivoli software was up 5%, and we held share. Within Tivoli, our storage portfolio was up double digits once again. Security, including Q1 Labs, contributed to our Tivoli growth, as clients turned to IBM for intelligence, integration and expertise across our comprehensive framework of solutions. 
Rational grew 1%, and we gained share. Performance was driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in Telelogic. Overall, software had another terrific quarter, with revenue up 7% at constant currency, pretax income up 12% and pretax margins up 1.9 points. With this performance, software was a strong contributor to our growth initiatives.
Systems and Technology revenue of $3.7 billion was down 7% following the very strong growth a year ago. System z revenue declined 25% versus last year's first quarter growth of over 40%. MIPS declined 5% this quarter, and we mixed towards specialty engines. System z gross profit margin was up again, which is typical at this point in the product cycle. 
POWER was flat and up 1% at constant currency. We had particular strength this quarter in POWER high-performance computing solutions. In POWER, we had over 250 competitive displacements, which resulted in over $200 million of business. Roughly 60% of this business came from HP, with most of the balance from Oracle Sun. This is the 16th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER.
System x revenue was flat, and we held share. The System x revenue in the growth markets was up 17% at constant currency. This is the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in these emerging markets. The storage hardware revenue was down 4%. The value continues to shift to software. And this quarter, storage software was up 18%.
Last week, we established a new category of computing with the introduction of PureSystems, a new family of expert integrated systems that leverages decades of IBM's innovation with market-leading software to help clients address the economics and complexity of deploying new IT infrastructure. These revolutionary systems will enable clients to implement and manage new IT capabilities quickly and efficiently. 
Currently, companies spend 70% or more of IT budgets on simple operations and maintenance. PureSystems has the potential to lower total IT costs by more than 50% over 3 years, allowing the business to reinvest these savings towards new projects and innovation. These new expert integrated systems demonstrate the breadth of our innovation and the value we bring to our customers. This will start to contribute to our performance in the second half.
Also, you may have seen we just announced the sale of our retail store solutions business to Toshiba TEC and the creation of a partnership to address the Smarter Commerce opportunity. The financial implications will be outlined on our investor website, including commentary on the expected gain and how we expect to offset it with additional workforce rebalancing activity, primarily outside the United States. But what's really important is the relationship going forward. We're partnering with the world leader in point-of-sale systems. At the same time, we'll continue to build out our Smarter Commerce capabilities and our sweet spot, managing transactions and data and applying analytics. Combined, we'll have the best platform in the market for commerce.
Moving on to cash flow in the quarter. We generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, up $1.1 billion year-to-year. In the first quarter of last year, our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments, driven by audit settlement activity. Even if you adjust for the prior year tax impact, we had double-digit growth in free cash flow. The growth was driven by net income and working capital efficiencies. 
Looking at the uses of our cash. We spent $1.3 billion to acquire 5 companies: Platform Computing, Green Hat, Emptoris, Worklight and DemandTec. These acquisitions add to our capabilities in analytics and cloud and Smarter Planet. 
We returned $3.9 billion to shareholders, including almost $900 million in dividends, and we bought back 15.5 million shares for $3 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had $5.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12.3 billion, up $400 million from year-end. Total debt was $32.1 billion, of which $23.6 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at 7:1. Our non-financing debt was $8.5 billion, up from $8 billion at year-end. At these debt levels, non-financing debt-to-cap was 33%, up 1 point from year-end. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility, and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long term.
So now let me start to wrap up with a summary of the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance this quarter. Our ongoing focus on productivity, together with the relative strength of our software business, drove strong margin performance, with gross pretax and net margins all up year-to-year. And the lower share count contributed $0.15, fairly consistent with last quarter. 
In fact, when you look at this quarter, it's really very similar to the fourth quarter in terms of the revenue growth, margin expansion and contribution from share repurchase. Even at the segment in geography level, revenue growth was similar to the fourth. Once again, our growth initiatives led the performance. Our growth markets' initiatives is based on expanding into new markets, building out IT infrastructures and leading in targeted industries. We have consistently delivered powerful performance and share gains. This quarter, growth markets revenue was up 9%, with 40 countries delivering double-digit growth at constant currency. 
In business analytics, we have a broad portfolio of analytic solutions to help our clients deal with the massive amounts of structured and unstructured data. Our solutions are built on decades of organic investments, 30 acquisitions since 2005 and more than 9,000 consultants in GBS. This quarter, IBM's business analytics revenue was up 14%.
Cloud provides an efficient and flexible delivery platform that improves the economics of IT. Our smart cloud portfolio addresses the full scope of enterprise client requirements. Total cloud revenue doubled over last year, with strong contribution from all areas: private cloud, public cloud and our industry-based solutions. This all comes together in our Smarter Planet solutions. With over 25% growth this quarter, Smarter Planet continues to deliver strong growth driven by our new Smarter City solutions and continued strength in Smarter Commerce offerings. When you look at our offerings in business analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet, about half of the revenue is software, so the success we're having in our growth initiatives is improving our business mix and margin. 
At the same time, we're continuing to invest in R&D, capital and acquisitions in support of these key areas. This investment is enabling us not only to expand existing markets, but actually create new markets and new categories of computing. Last week's announcement of PureSystems was a great example of how we're leveraging our organic research and development to create a game-changing solution for our clients.

I look at GBS and on a reported basis, it was down 2%, and I realize its public and Japan contributing very negative growth overall. But do you actually see that getting any better going forward? And in fact, it seems like it's getting marginally worse. And when I look at the outsourcing side, your backlog is now down 5% relative to a year ago. And backlog is a good leading indicator, especially in the outsourcing business. So perhaps you can help us understand how things get better from here. And on an as-reported basis, can GBS grow this year? And with a minus 5% backlog in outsourcing, how does that grow from here for the remainder of the year?"

Let's start from first principles. First of all, when we started the quarter, we told you that the backlog run out we expected would be up 3% year-to-year. So in other words, we're looking at one, at the backlog for total",466,"Okay, Toni, a very good question. Let's start from first principles. First of all, when we started the quarter, we told you that the backlog run out we expected would be up 3% year-to-year. So in other words, we're looking at one, at the backlog for total services that it should influence revenue this year. And that backlog should affect about 70% of the revenue, so 70% of that 3% will drive about 2% revenue. And we had indicated that we felt confident that at that level of revenue, we could drive double-digit profit growth for the year. So let's look at it now by the individual units. If you look at GTS, I would argue they're right on track. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of 2.6% performance from our GTS team, and I think it's an indication that we do have that model specified correctly. And with that 2.6%, what did they do? They drove 20% profit growth and 2 points of margin improvement. So again, very consistent with our indication. When you look at GBS, actually the mechanics underneath that more on track, but we did get clipped by a couple of contracts that were more challenging for us. I gave you an example of a couple in Japan that impacted our profit by $60 million. Now outside of those 2 contracts, frankly, GBS would have grown their profit on a year-to-year basis. So if you consider those 2 contracts, I would tell you, number one, I think from a financial standpoint, we had the bulk of that behind us. And I don't expect and I don't see contracts in the distribution that will have that kind of impact going forward. Now I can't predict the future, but I do have a pretty good purview to the contracts that we're working on. Secondly, I'll tell you that GBS has, generally, over a longer period of time, been pretty good at managing these challenging contract elements. So I think from my perspective, this is a bit of an anomaly, and GBS should get these 2 contracts behind them in the first and improve their performance to more typical levels as we go into the second quarter. By the way, just as an aside I'd add, that if you look at IBM's revenue growth for services, up 1%, we were shy of 2% by $7 million. That's $7 million on a $15 billion base, so obviously, very close to the 2% level to begin with. I would also reiterate that even in the face of that, we had double-digit profit growth in services for the quarter, and we feel quite confident, given all of the elements that we see in the business equation for Services, we should be driving double-digit profit growth for the year."

If you look at -- let's look of the drivers underneath the performance in our GTS business, again, profit up 20%, 2 points of margin. How did we achieve that and what do they have as far as sustainability going into the future? So number one, they -- GTS business, and frankly GBS as well, but GTS on a large part is a beneficiary of all the work that we're doing on productivity. Now you remember, at the Investor Day, Linda Sanford defined that and how we were  managing that across those elements. The objective is about $8 billion over the roadmap period. We felt that we did quite well on that base last year. And I'll tell you that our view is that we're right on track in the first quarter. GTS once again benefits from that work. And they are really part and parcel of all the elements that we drive for productivity and spend management. Number 2, with those advanced tools and intellectual property, we're also working on not only the margins in the overall distribution but also the margins in the products that I would call the tail of the distribution, so more challenging contracts. And this year, the GTS team did a great piece of work on those contracts in the low-margin tail in the distribution of thousands of contracts and generated a very meaningful improvement in profitability that we know analytically extends throughout the year. And then lastly, I'll tell you, as we look at the dynamics in that business, our backlog growth for Total Services was up 14% in the growth markets. And in the growth markets, what we're seeing is we have 2 points better margin actually in those deals as well. So those 3 are ongoing dynamics, in my mind, and give us confidence that we have a strong play going forward."

If you look at the performance in the quarter, EPS up 15%, a very strong performance in our overall net income. Our cash flow -- free cash flow in the business, up $1.1 billion year-to-year. Even if you take into consideration last year's tax payment, that was up $300 million or 16%. So to me, the characteristics of this first quarter are quite strong. And really, it was based on our confidence in characteristics of the quarter and the going-forward equation that encouraged us to take our view of the business up $0.15. Now remember, taking your view of the business, up $0.15 only 90 days into the quarter, I think is a real show of confidence. If you look at the next 3 quarters, we see them up about 10%. And that 10% is the underpinnings to what we view is an at least $15 for the year. Now that 10% across those quarters is reasonably uniform. I do think the third quarter is probably a little tighter for us, but reasonably uniform. And at 10%, given a $15 base of performance on  -- at the least basis for 2012, that's all the trajectory we need to get to $20 by 2015. So to me, I would say that to build base of the business looks like it's in pretty darn good shape and on track to achieve our longer-term objective in 2015. Now to your point, what do we see going forward? There's a couple of dynamics that I would remind you of. Number 1 -- and maybe a way to look at this is kind of headwinds, tailwinds. So as we look at it going forward for the second quarter or third quarter, we still will see the headwind from currency at about 3 points. We will still, as we go through the second quarter, have the compares challenged for us in the hardware base of business. As well, we will still be wrestling with the issues that we see in Japan in the second quarter. But I think, when we go to the second half, first of all, we have very strong software momentum. Second of all, we have a stable base of profitability and margin performance in our services business. But when you get to the hardware base of business, we have new announcement content that should drive that performance. We should regain revenue growth in the second half based on those new announcement, PureSystems being the first installment. And with that, we should see double-digit profitability in the second half from our hardware base as well. Rolling through all of that is the strength of our operating model and the strength of our growth initiatives. But I think stabilizing Japan in the second half and seeing the new announcement contribution from our hardware base of business, that's going to be a significant dynamic."

If we were sitting here in the meeting with the RCIO and Linda Sanford working on it, what do we work on? We work on the percentage of our IT budget that we're able to move into new content and new opportunity, as opposed to just maintaining our existing base of business. That's how we run it, and we've been doing this year after year after year. Why is that relevant in PureSystems? Well, if you look at it, in a typical IT department, you could be spending about 70% of that budget on these kinds of simple operations and maintenance. We think with the PureSystems content, you'll have the opportunity to reduce that over a 3-year period by over 50%. That's an enormous contribution to your productivity. And as we would interpret that, if we were having that meeting today in my conference room, we would drive even more of our spend into new announcement content and new categories of IT spend. So I think it's a very powerful opportunity for us on a financial base. That doesn't even get to the unique capabilities and patterns of expertise that it has, built-in expertise, then the complex of business, integration by design. I mean, this can be up and running in as little as 4 hours. So to us, PureSystems is a first new system in 2 decades to hit this kind of an industry rollout, and we're very confident that it would go into the second half and as a big element of our game plan going into 2015."

We have a lot of very strong performance on our high-performance computing in our research centers. And secondly, we had real strength in health care and life sciences. They've had their 20th consecutive quarter of growth. So those 2 elements of overall public sector carried the business. On the government base of business, it's still pretty flat. And we see government spending, really globally, more challenged within that base of business. Your second question, really on Europe. Again, I would point out, as I think we've discussed before, Europe is not just a homogenous breakdown of countries. In the U.K., we had 10% growth, U.K. That's the 10th consecutive quarter of growth in the U.K. So it's not as if that's 10% on an easy compare. That's 10% on 2 years of real performance out of the U.K. business. So I think they've done a great job. Spain, we had growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. In Germany, we had growth for the second consecutive quarter. On the flip side, we're still down in France and down in Italy, but I think on balance, Europe to me, looks pretty stable. So if I would characterize it on a global basis going forward, I look at the major markets, we think they're relatively stable on a forward-looking basis.

But if you look at that, we frankly exited 2010 in a very strong position. Remember, we did well over $6 billion in 2010. So when we went through the model at that time, we said, we frankly have a pretty substantial head start. And if you have considered that we don't expect this to be linear. If you look at those -- that 2-year period of 2010 and 2011, $6 billion and $2 billion . On average, we did about $4 billion. So I think that run rate, on average, is a good indicator. I don't think it's going to be $4 billion every year. This year, $1.3 billion just for the first quarter, I would say we're kind of a hit pace [ph] on a run-rate basis. The second point I would make is given that we did get ahead of the profile in 2010 with a very successful set of acquisitions, 17 in total, that, frankly, put us ahead of the game as we looked at our EPS objective for acquisitions as part of the 2015 roadmap. Remember, we're looking for about $0.90. And given that the head start that we had coming out of 2010, we had to be able to hit that $0.90 at a spend rate of between $10 billion and  $15 billion as opposed to $20 billion. So that provides, I think, opportunity for us. But from my perspective, I'd tell you from what I'm doing, I am viewing this as an opportunity for $20 billion in our treasury and our capital planning processes, believe me, we're reserving about $20 billion over the roadmap."

If you look at the overall view, I would use the 2010 as kind of a guide here. Now this year, it could be a little richer than that, as you correctly pointed out.

Now this year, it could be a little richer than that, as you correctly pointed out. On a full year basis, the vast majority is going to be spent outside the U.S. So we'll have slightly longer payback periods. But in the dollars that we spent on workforce rebalancing at the first quarter, we expect that to payback in the year. So I think we have a good plan. We still have a lot of work to do. We just signed a deal. We've got a lot of work to do if you get to closing that deal. But I think I would use that as kind of a guide on the workforce rebalancing charges. 
So let me now just take a few moments to wrap up the call. From my perspective, the first quarter had a similar characteristic to the fourth and was a strong start to the year. We had great margin and profit and cash performance and continued the momentum in all of our growth initiatives. Remember, last quarter, I said that in 2012, we'll take a number of actions that position us to achieve our 2015 roadmap objective, including acquisitions and divestitures, investing in key growth initiatives and rebalancing our workforce to where we see the best opportunities. In the last 90 days, we've made great progress. We have a couple of strategic announcements that demonstrate our focus on higher value and ongoing transformation of our business. Our PureSystems announcement is a result of $2 billion of R&D and leverages decades of technology innovation and know-how. It's a new platform, and we believe it's a game-changing event for our clients. And we announced today a strategic partnership with Toshiba TEC that better positions us to address the important Smarter Commerce opportunity. So all of this gives us confidence to take up our expectation for the full year to at least $15 of operating EPS for the year. That's up almost 12% from last year and puts us on a good track to deliver at least $20 in 2015. So thanks for joining us. And now, as always, back to work."

In the first quarter, we have reported $24.7 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $2.78, which is up 15% year-to-year. And now, 90 days into the y",3103,"Thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter, we have reported $24.7 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $2.78, which is up 15% year-to-year. And now, 90 days into the year, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15. This is up $0.15 from our previous view of at least $14.85. 
Looking at the results by segment. We continued our strong performance in software as we aggressively address opportunities in analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet. Our software profit was up 12%. 
In services, we expanded margins and increased Total Services profit by 11% as we leverage our productivity initiatives and mix to higher margin offerings in markets. Services revenue growth was again led by growth markets, which were up 10% at constant currency. And our backlog in growth markets was up 14% at constant currency. 
As expected, our hardware business declined as compared to a very strong growth of 19% in the first quarter of last year. This quarter, we extended our leadership in the UNIX market as we continued our competitive displacements in POWER. 
And just last week, we announced PureSystems, the first new class of computing in over 20 years. This solution leverages IBM's decades-long investment in innovation and radically simplifies enterprise computing. This should start to contribute to the systems performance in the second half of the year.
Turning to profit. Our ongoing focus on productivity, together with the relative strength of our software business, drove strong margin performance. We expanded operating gross margin by over a point, led by services. And our operating net margin was up a similar amount, 1.1 points. Within net income, this quarter, we had a couple of unique items that impacted the dynamic between operating pretax income and our tax rate. 
You'll recall that in the first quarter of last year, our workforce rebalancing was essentially offset by one-time investment gains. This quarter, our workforce rebalancing was very similar to last year. But this year, the charge was offset by a one-time tax benefit associated with a tax restructuring in Latin America. Excluding this one-time benefit, we expect our full year annual effective tax rate to still be in the range of 25%.
So a very similar dynamic to last year: with a gain offsetting our workforce rebalance charges, though, this year, the offset is included below the PTI line in tax. So through margin expansion, together with effective use of cash, we delivered operating EPS of $2.78, which was up 15% year-to-year.
Turning to cash flow. We generated almost $2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, really strong performance. In addition to returning value to shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and dividends, our cash flow is enabling the ongoing transformation of the business, acquiring key capabilities and focusing our portfolio on the areas where we can add the most value. 
This quarter, we closed 5 acquisitions for a total of $1.3 billion. The acquisitions increased our capabilities in analytics and cloud and our Smarter Planet initiatives. Now we'll get into the first quarter details starting with revenue by geography, where, as always, I'll discuss the results on a local currency basis.
In the first quarter, revenue at constant currency was very consistent with the fourth quarter and in line with our expectations. Revenue in our major market countries was essentially flat year-to-year. Within the Americas, performance was led by Canada, which was up 9%. The U.S. was flat, off of last year's strong growth of 7%. Europe, again, grew at 1%, in line with the fourth quarter, so we're seeing some stability there. 
The most consistent performance has come from the U.K. and Spain. With 10% growth, the U.K. has delivered 10 consecutive quarters of growth. And Spain continues to leverage its global relationships, now growing in each of the last 6 quarters. Germany posted modest growth, while France declined.
Our growth markets outpaced the major markets by 10 points of revenue growth. Even with a tough compare, the BRICs had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 11%. And with about 60% of our growth markets business outside the BRICs, altogether, we had double-digit growth in 40 growth markets countries. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of share gains in the growth markets, and we're accelerating our market expansion initiative to continue that success.
Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment. Global Technology Services constant currency revenue growth rate was very consistent with the last few quarters. And Global Business Services growth rate continued to be impacted by weakness in Japan and public sector. Our software business had another great quarter, driven by our offerings in business analytics, Smarter Commerce and storage management. 
In Systems and Technology, last year, we had a very strong first quarter, driven by product cycles in mainframe and POWER. So our growth rate this quarter reflects that difficult compare, though we continued to take share in UNIX.
Turning to gross profit. Our operating gross profit margin improved 1.2 points, driven by a combination of good margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative strength in software. Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile.
Our total operating expense and other income was up 3%. Acquisitions over the last 12 months contributed 2 points of the increase. Currency from both translation and hedging dynamics reduced expense growth by 2 points, and our base expense, excluding currency and acquisitions, was up 3 points. I'll comment on a couple of expense items that had larger year-to-year impacts to our profit. 
First, in last year's results, we had investment gains of over $200 million, primarily for the sale of Lenovo shares. This gain effectively funded the $220 million of workforce rebalancing charges in last year's first quarter. This year, we had a one-time tax benefit from a tax restructuring in Latin America, and the tax benefit offset the workforce rebalancing charges, which, again, were about $220 million. So the net effect to net income was negligible, both within the period and year-to-year.
Another expense item I'll comment on is a year-to-year help from our hedging programs. We hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in global cash planning. Last year, hedging programs generated losses in the quarter. This year, our hedging was down $125 million year-to-year, as you would expect, given the year-to-year changes in currencies. Of this, about $85 million year-to-year is an expense, most of which is in other income and expense. Now keep in mind that you can't look at hedges in isolation. They mitigate the translation impacts across the P&L.
So now let me go into the segments. The 2 Services segments delivered $14.7 billion in revenue, grew pretax profit by 11% and expanded pretax margin by 1.3 points. Backlog was $139 billion, down 2% at actual rates and up 1% at constant currency. We started 2012 with continued momentum in our growth initiatives, margin expansion and strong profit growth. 
Revenue in the growth markets was up double digits at constant currency again this quarter, driven by strong backlog growth. Total growth markets' backlog was up 14% year-to-year at constant currency, reflecting strong demand for both our outsourcing and transactional services in these markets. We also had strong performance in business analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet offerings.
Moving on to the 2 segments. In Global Technology Services, revenue was $10 billion, up 2% or 3% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 2% or 3% at constant currency, and we gained share again this quarter. Integrated Technology Services revenue grew 3%. We had great performance in the growth markets, up 14% year-to-year at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered very strong profit and margin this quarter, with pretax income up 20% and pretax margin up 2.2 points. 
There were 3 primary drivers of this margin expansion. First, we continued to benefit from efforts to deliver productivity and efficiency within GTS and in conjunction with the enterprise productivity initiatives. Second, we continued to get higher margins in the faster growing growth markets. And finally, GTS has done a tremendous amount of work managing their large portfolio of outsourcing contracts. Within that portfolio, there's a mix of contracts with different profit characteristics. We have taken a systematic and disciplined approach to solving problems in a select set of lower margin contracts, and we're seeing the yield from these efforts in our margin.
Turning to Global Business Services. Revenue was $4.6 billion, down 2% or 1% at constant currency. We had modest declines in both Application Outsourcing and consulting and systems integration. I previously mentioned the strong results in business analytics and Smarter Planet, where GBS is leading many of the engagements across IBM. Within GBS, business analytics grew 16% and Smarter Planet grew 18%. These are very important initiatives for IBM. 
From a geographic perspective, the growth markets continued to perform well, with double-digit growth again this quarter, while the major markets continued to be weighed down by Japan and by public sector, which declined more sharply this quarter. Japan and public sector, which represent over 1/3 of total Global Business Services revenue, impacted the overall GBS constant currency growth rate by 6 points. GBS pretax income was also impacted by Japan this quarter. Two large contracts in Japan impacted our profit by almost $60 million. So Japan impacted both our profit growth and revenue growth in GBS this quarter. 
But as you know, we have a good track record of managing a broad portfolio of contracts. This quarter, our Total Services business delivered double-digit profit growth, and we feel confident that we can continue throughout the year.
Software had another strong quarter, with revenue of $5.6 billion, up 5% or 7% at constant currency. Key branded middleware gained share for the 18th straight quarter as our software revenue mixes to the faster-growing branded middleware. This quarter, branded middleware accounted for 62% of our total software, up a point from the same period last year. Gartner once again named IBM the worldwide market share leader in the application infrastructure and middleware segment, an announcement that marks the beginning of the second decade of software leadership for IBM.
Segment pretax income was $1.9 billion, up 12% from last year. Now let me take you through the drivers by brand. WebSphere had another excellent quarter, growing 16% and gaining share for the 14th consecutive quarter. Within WebSphere, we had a strong contribution from our application server products and continued momentum in Smarter Commerce. 
In the first quarter, we strengthened our Smarter Commerce integrated portfolio by completing the acquisition of DemandTec, a leader of pricing and promotion optimization solutions and our acquisition of Emptoris, which helps clients reduce procurement costs and risks. 
With 5% growth, Information Management continues to perform well and gain share. Business analytics had a very strong quarter, with double-digit growth in Cognos. Our acceleration in Cognos is driven by the successful integration of our predictive capabilities into recent product launches spanning both business intelligence and financial performance management. 
We continue to expand our global Netezza footprint, with about 2/3 of our new clients outside of North America. For the quarter, Netezza had a win rate of nearly 80% and head-to-head proof of concepts engagements.
Tivoli software was up 5%, and we held share. Within Tivoli, our storage portfolio was up double digits once again. Security, including Q1 Labs, contributed to our Tivoli growth, as clients turned to IBM for intelligence, integration and expertise across our comprehensive framework of solutions. 
Rational grew 1%, and we gained share. Performance was driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in Telelogic. Overall, software had another terrific quarter, with revenue up 7% at constant currency, pretax income up 12% and pretax margins up 1.9 points. With this performance, software was a strong contributor to our growth initiatives.
Systems and Technology revenue of $3.7 billion was down 7% following the very strong growth a year ago. System z revenue declined 25% versus last year's first quarter growth of over 40%. MIPS declined 5% this quarter, and we mixed towards specialty engines. System z gross profit margin was up again, which is typical at this point in the product cycle. 
POWER was flat and up 1% at constant currency. We had particular strength this quarter in POWER high-performance computing solutions. In POWER, we had over 250 competitive displacements, which resulted in over $200 million of business. Roughly 60% of this business came from HP, with most of the balance from Oracle Sun. This is the 16th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER.
System x revenue was flat, and we held share. The System x revenue in the growth markets was up 17% at constant currency. This is the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in these emerging markets. The storage hardware revenue was down 4%. The value continues to shift to software. And this quarter, storage software was up 18%.
Last week, we established a new category of computing with the introduction of PureSystems, a new family of expert integrated systems that leverages decades of IBM's innovation with market-leading software to help clients address the economics and complexity of deploying new IT infrastructure. These revolutionary systems will enable clients to implement and manage new IT capabilities quickly and efficiently. 
Currently, companies spend 70% or more of IT budgets on simple operations and maintenance. PureSystems has the potential to lower total IT costs by more than 50% over 3 years, allowing the business to reinvest these savings towards new projects and innovation. These new expert integrated systems demonstrate the breadth of our innovation and the value we bring to our customers. This will start to contribute to our performance in the second half.
Also, you may have seen we just announced the sale of our retail store solutions business to Toshiba TEC and the creation of a partnership to address the Smarter Commerce opportunity. The financial implications will be outlined on our investor website, including commentary on the expected gain and how we expect to offset it with additional workforce rebalancing activity, primarily outside the United States. But what's really important is the relationship going forward. We're partnering with the world leader in point-of-sale systems. At the same time, we'll continue to build out our Smarter Commerce capabilities and our sweet spot, managing transactions and data and applying analytics. Combined, we'll have the best platform in the market for commerce.
Moving on to cash flow in the quarter. We generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, up $1.1 billion year-to-year. In the first quarter of last year, our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments, driven by audit settlement activity. Even if you adjust for the prior year tax impact, we had double-digit growth in free cash flow. The growth was driven by net income and working capital efficiencies. 
Looking at the uses of our cash. We spent $1.3 billion to acquire 5 companies: Platform Computing, Green Hat, Emptoris, Worklight and DemandTec. These acquisitions add to our capabilities in analytics and cloud and Smarter Planet. 
We returned $3.9 billion to shareholders, including almost $900 million in dividends, and we bought back 15.5 million shares for $3 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had $5.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12.3 billion, up $400 million from year-end. Total debt was $32.1 billion, of which $23.6 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at 7:1. Our non-financing debt was $8.5 billion, up from $8 billion at year-end. At these debt levels, non-financing debt-to-cap was 33%, up 1 point from year-end. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility, and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long term.
So now let me start to wrap up with a summary of the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance this quarter. Our ongoing focus on productivity, together with the relative strength of our software business, drove strong margin performance, with gross pretax and net margins all up year-to-year. And the lower share count contributed $0.15, fairly consistent with last quarter. 
In fact, when you look at this quarter, it's really very similar to the fourth quarter in terms of the revenue growth, margin expansion and contribution from share repurchase. Even at the segment in geography level, revenue growth was similar to the fourth. Once again, our growth initiatives led the performance. Our growth markets' initiatives is based on expanding into new markets, building out IT infrastructures and leading in targeted industries. We have consistently delivered powerful performance and share gains. This quarter, growth markets revenue was up 9%, with 40 countries delivering double-digit growth at constant currency. 
In business analytics, we have a broad portfolio of analytic solutions to help our clients deal with the massive amounts of structured and unstructured data. Our solutions are built on decades of organic investments, 30 acquisitions since 2005 and more than 9,000 consultants in GBS. This quarter, IBM's business analytics revenue was up 14%.
Cloud provides an efficient and flexible delivery platform that improves the economics of IT. Our smart cloud portfolio addresses the full scope of enterprise client requirements. Total cloud revenue doubled over last year, with strong contribution from all areas: private cloud, public cloud and our industry-based solutions. This all comes together in our Smarter Planet solutions. With over 25% growth this quarter, Smarter Planet continues to deliver strong growth driven by our new Smarter City solutions and continued strength in Smarter Commerce offerings. When you look at our offerings in business analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet, about half of the revenue is software, so the success we're having in our growth initiatives is improving our business mix and margin. 
At the same time, we're continuing to invest in R&D, capital and acquisitions in support of these key areas. This investment is enabling us not only to expand existing markets, but actually create new markets and new categories of computing. Last week's announcement of PureSystems was a great example of how we're leveraging our organic research and development to create a game-changing solution for our clients.
So looking at our first quarter performance and all of these factors, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating earnings per share to at least $15. 
Now Patricia and I will take your questions."

I look at GBS and on a reported basis, it was down 2%, and I realize its public and Japan contributing very negative growth overall. But do you actually see that getting any better going forward? And in fact, it seems like it's getting marginally worse. And when I look at the outsourcing side, your backlog is now down 5% relative to a year ago. And backlog is a good leading indicator, especially in the outsourcing business. So perhaps you can help us understand how things get better from here. And on an as-reported basis, can GBS grow this year? And with a minus 5% backlog in outsourcing, how does that grow from here for the remainder of the year?"

Let's start from first principles. First of all, when we started the quarter, we told you that the backlog run out we expected would be up 3% year-to-year.

First of all, when we started the quarter, we told you that the backlog run out we expected would be up 3% year-to-year. So in other words, we're looking at one, at the backlog for total services that it should influence revenue this year. And that backlog should affect about 70% of the revenue, so 70% of that 3% will drive about 2% revenue. And we had indicated that we felt confident that at that level of revenue, we could drive double-digit profit growth for the year. So let's look at it now by the individual units. If you look at GTS, I would argue they're right on track. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of 2.6% performance from our GTS team, and I think it's an indication that we do have that model specified correctly. And with that 2.6%, what did they do? They drove 20% profit growth and 2 points of margin improvement. So again, very consistent with our indication. When you look at GBS, actually the mechanics underneath that more on track, but we did get clipped by a couple of contracts that were more challenging for us. I gave you an example of a couple in Japan that impacted our profit by $60 million. Now outside of those 2 contracts, frankly, GBS would have grown their profit on a year-to-year basis. So if you consider those 2 contracts, I would tell you, number one, I think from a financial standpoint, we had the bulk of that behind us. And I don't expect and I don't see contracts in the distribution that will have that kind of impact going forward. Now I can't predict the future, but I do have a pretty good purview to the contracts that we're working on. Secondly, I'll tell you that GBS has, generally, over a longer period of time, been pretty good at managing these challenging contract elements. So I think from my perspective, this is a bit of an anomaly, and GBS should get these 2 contracts behind them in the first and improve their performance to more typical levels as we go into the second quarter. By the way, just as an aside I'd add, that if you look at IBM's revenue growth for services, up 1%, we were shy of 2% by $7 million. That's $7 million on a $15 billion base, so obviously, very close to the 2% level to begin with.

If you look at -- let's look of the drivers underneath the performance in our GTS business, again, profit up 20%, 2 points of margin. How did we achieve that and what do they have as far as sustainability going into the future? So number one, they -- GTS business, and frankly GBS as well, but GTS on a large part is a beneficiary of all the work that we're doing on productivity. Now you remember, at the Investor Day, Linda Sanford defined that and how we were  managing that across those elements. The objective is about $8 billion over the roadmap period. We felt that we did quite well on that base last year. And I'll tell you that our view is that we're right on track in the first quarter. GTS once again benefits from that work. And they are really part and parcel of all the elements that we drive for productivity and spend management. Number 2, with those advanced tools and intellectual property, we're also working on not only the margins in the overall distribution but also the margins in the products that I would call the tail of the distribution, so more challenging contracts. And this year, the GTS team did a great piece of work on those contracts in the low-margin tail in the distribution of thousands of contracts and generated a very meaningful improvement in profitability that we know analytically extends throughout the year. And then lastly, I'll tell you, as we look at the dynamics in that business, our backlog growth for Total Services was up 14% in the growth markets. And in the growth markets, what we're seeing is we have 2 points better margin actually in those deals as well. So those 3 are ongoing dynamics, in my mind, and give us confidence that we have a strong play going forward."

If you look at the performance in the quarter, EPS up 15%, a very strong performance in our overall net income. Our cash flow -- free cash flow in the business, up $1.1 billion year-to-year. Even if you take into consideration last year's tax payment, that was up $300 million or 16%. So to me, the characteristics of this first quarter are quite strong. And really, it was based on our confidence in characteristics of the quarter and the going-forward equation that encouraged us to take our view of the business up $0.15. Now remember, taking your view of the business, up $0.15 only 90 days into the quarter, I think is a real show of confidence. If you look at the next 3 quarters, we see them up about 10%. And that 10% is the underpinnings to what we view is an at least $15 for the year. Now that 10% across those quarters is reasonably uniform. I do think the third quarter is probably a little tighter for us, but reasonably uniform. And at 10%, given a $15 base of performance on  -- at the least basis for 2012, that's all the trajectory we need to get to $20 by 2015. So to me, I would say that to build base of the business looks like it's in pretty darn good shape and on track to achieve our longer-term objective in 2015. Now to your point, what do we see going forward? There's a couple of dynamics that I would remind you of. Number one -- and maybe a way to look at this is kind of headwinds, tailwinds. So as we look at it going forward for the second quarter or third quarter, we still will see the headwind from currency at about 3 points. We will still, as we go through the second quarter, have the compares challenged for us in the hardware base of business. As well, we will still be wrestling with the issues that we see in Japan in the second quarter. But I think, when we go to the second half, first of all, we have very strong software momentum. Second of all, we have a stable base of profitability and margin performance in our services business. But when you get to the hardware base of business, we have new announcement content that should drive that performance. We should regain revenue growth in the second half based on those new announcement, PureSystems being the first installment. And with that, we should see double-digit profitability in the second half from our hardware base as well. Rolling through all of that is the strength of our operating model and the strength of our growth initiatives. But I think stabilizing Japan in the second half and seeing the new announcement contribution from our hardware base of business, that's going to be a significant dynamic."

If we were sitting here in the meeting with the RCIO and Linda Sanford working on it, what do we work on? We work on the percentage of our IT budget that we're able to move into new content and new opportunity, as opposed to just maintaining our existing base of business. That's how we run it, and we've been doing this year after year after year. Why is that relevant in PureSystems? Well, if you look at it, in a typical IT department, you could be spending about 70% of that budget on these kinds of simple operations and maintenance. We think with the PureSystems content, you'll have the opportunity to reduce that over a 3-year period by over 50%. That's an enormous contribution to your productivity. And as we would interpret that, if we were having that meeting today in my conference room, we would drive even more of our spend into new announcement content and new categories of IT spend. So I think it's a very powerful opportunity for us on a financial base. That doesn't even get to the unique capabilities and patterns of expertise that it has, built-in expertise, then the complex of business, integration by design. I mean, this can be up and running in as little as 4 hours. So to us, PureSystems is a first new system in 2 decades to hit this kind of an industry rollout, and we're very confident that it would go into the second half and as a big element of our game plan going into 2015."

They've had their 20th consecutive quarter of growth. So those 2 elements of overall public sector carried the business. On the government base of business, it's still pretty flat. And we see government spending, really globally, more challenged within that base of business. Your second question, really on Europe. Again, I would point out, as I think we've discussed before, Europe is not just a homogenous breakdown of countries. In the U.K., we had 10% growth, U.K. That's the 10th consecutive quarter of growth in the U.K. So it's not as if that's 10% on an easy compare. That's 10% on 2 years of real performance out of the U.K. business. So I think they've done a great job. Spain, we had growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. In Germany, we had growth for the second consecutive quarter. On the flip side, we're still down in France and down in Italy, but I think on balance, Europe to me, looks pretty stable. So if I would characterize it on a global basis going forward, I look at the major markets, we think they're relatively stable on a forward-looking basis.

Now let's just go back to the math and the way we've describe this in the investment meetings that we've had in the last couple of years. As you look at it, if you look at that kind of $4 billion a year run rate -- and by the way, this is not going to be linear because it's dependent on how frothy the market or attractive the market is and how it integrates with our initiatives. But if you look at that, we frankly exited 2010 in a very strong position. Remember, we did well over $6 billion in 2010. So when we went through the model at that time, we said, we frankly have a pretty substantial head start. And if you have considered that we don't expect this to be linear. If you look at those -- that 2-year period of 2010 and 2011, $6 billion and $2 billion . On average, we did about $4 billion. So I think that run rate, on average, is a good indicator. I don't think it's going to be $4 billion every year. This year, $1.3 billion just for the first quarter, I would say we're kind of a hit pace [ph] on a run-rate basis. The second point I would make is given that we did get ahead of the profile in 2010 with a very successful set of acquisitions, 17 in total, that, frankly, put us ahead of the game as we looked at our EPS objective for acquisitions as part of the 2015 roadmap. Remember, we're looking for about $0.90. And given that the head start that we had coming out of 2010, we had to be able to hit that $0.90 at a spend rate of between $10 billion and  $15 billion as opposed to $20 billion. So that provides, I think, opportunity for us. But from my perspective, I'd tell you from what I'm doing, I am viewing this as an opportunity for $20 billion in our treasury and our capital planning processes, believe me, we're reserving about $20 billion over the roadmap."

So let me now just take a few moments to wrap up the call. From my perspective, the first quarter had a similar characteristic to the fourth and was a strong start to the year. We had great margin and profit and cash performance and continued the momentum in all of our growth initiatives. Remember, last quarter, I said that in 2012, we'll take a number of actions that position us to achieve our 2015 roadmap objective, including acquisitions and divestitures, investing in key growth initiatives and rebalancing our workforce to where we see the best opportunities. In the last 90 days, we've made great progress. We have a couple of strategic announcements that demonstrate our focus on higher value and ongoing transformation of our business. Our PureSystems announcement is a result of $2 billion of R&D and leverages decades of technology innovation and know-how. It's a new platform, and we believe it's a game-changing event for our clients. And we announced today a strategic partnership with Toshiba TEC that better positions us to address the important Smarter Commerce opportunity. So all of this gives us confidence to take up our expectation for the full year to at least $15 of operating EPS for the year. That's up almost 12% from last year and puts us on a good track to deliver at least $20 in 2015. So thanks for joining us. And now, as always, back to work."

In the fourth quarter, we grew revenue, expanded growth, pretax and net margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $4.71, up 11% year-to-year. For the full year, we delivered revenue of almost $107 billion, which was up 7%, operating pretax income of $21.6 billion, up 9%, and operating EPS of $13.44, up 15%. 
Our 2011 results put us well on track to our 2015 roadmap objective. Looking at the fourth quarter by segment, we continued to build our momentum in software, our performance reflecting both strong demand for our offerings and leadership sales execution. Our software revenue was up 9%, driven by aggressive growth in our focus areas like Smarter Commerce, business analytics and storage solutions. Our software profit was up 12%. 
Our Services business delivered powerful margin and profit growth, with combined pretax income of 17%. Services revenue growth was again led by growth markets, which were up 13% at constant currency. Our total services backlog ended the year at $141 billion. At constant currency, that's flat year-to-year and up $5 billion since September. 
Within Hardware, Power Systems was up 6% as we continue to drive competitive displacements. We've now had 15 consecutive quarters of share gain in UNIX. In fact, with the exception of mainframe, which was coming off of the biggest quarter in its history last year, each of our 16 brands across the company gained or held share. 
Turning to profit, our ongoing focus and productivity, together with the relative strength of our software business, drove strong margin performance. Our operating gross margin was up 1.1 points to over 50%. We expanded operating pretax margins almost a full point and grew pretax income 6%. And while our tax rate was up year-to-year, we still expanded net margin above our model rate. 
When you put this all together, we delivered operating EPS of $4.71, which was up 11% and $13.44 for the year, up 15%, making this our ninth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. Our strong earnings performance drove $9 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $16.6 billion for the year. With that cash, we continue to invest in capital and acquisitions and we delivered significant returns to shareholders with over $18 billion in share repurchase and dividends this year. 
Looking forward, we're confident in our ability to continue to leverage our business model to expand margin, grow profit, generate cash and return value to shareholders. And in 2012, we expect to deliver at least $14.85 of operating earnings per share for the year. 
For the fourth quarter, revenue at constant currency was in line with our expectations. While currency provided a benefit to revenue growth of about 25 basis points in the quarter, currency movement, since we announced our third quarter earnings in October, impacted our revenue by about 1 point of growth or $300 million. 
Looking at the geographies on a constant currency basis, revenue in our major market countries was essentially flat year-to-year. In the Americas, Canada had terrific performance, up 13%. The U.S. grew 1% off of last year's very strong growth of 10%. 
In Europe, our growth rate improved compared to the third quarter. Germany returned to growth, up 4%, and once again, we had good growth in the U.K. and Spain, which were each up 9%. We've now had 9 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth in the U.K. and Spain has now grown 5 consecutive quarters, leveraging its global relationships. 
Our growth markets outpaced the major markets by 8 points of revenue growth. The BRICS had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 11%. And with nearly 2/3 of our growth markets business outside the BRICS, all together, we had double-digit growth in 40 growth market countries, so our performance was broad based. 
We're continuing to expand into new countries and territories to build out IT infrastructures in support of economic growth and to take a leadership position in key industries. This year, to drive market expansion, we opened 92 new branches and we added over 1,500 new sales reps. We gained 4 points of share in the quarter and 4 points for the year. In 2011, our growth markets grew 11%, which outpaced the majors by 10 points, and growth markets now make up 22% of our geographic revenue. 
Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment, Global Technology Services constant currency revenue growth rate was consistent with the third quarter, while our Global Business Services growth rate improved. In both segments, we had great year-to-year performance in the growth markets, with double-digit constant currency revenue growth and expanding margins. 
Our software business had another fantastic quarter, with strength across the portfolio, WebSphere, Information Management and Tivoli all had very good growth and gained share. In Systems and Technology, last year, we had a great fourth quarter with over 20% growth driven by a new mainframe that had almost 70% revenue growth. This quarter, we wrapped around that performance. And we had strength in POWER as we continued to extend our share gains. 
Turning to gross profit, our operating gross margins improved 1.1 points to over 50%, driven by a combination of good margin expansion in both Services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative strength of software. The services margin improvement was driven by a number of factors, including productivity improvements and mix to higher value offerings and markets. For hardware, our product mix negatively impacted margin. 
Finally, our Global Financing business, which is better measured by return on equity, this quarter delivered return on equity of 42%. Now that's impressive. So now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile. Our total operating expense and other income was up 2%, in line with our revenue growth. 
Acquisitions over the last 12 months contributed a point of growth. And our base expense was up 1%. There was effectively no year-to-year impact from the combination of currency translation and hedging dynamics. I'll comment on a couple of expense items that had larger year-to-year impacts to our profit. As you can see from our income statement, IP income was down $65 million year-to-year. 
Second, we had an increase of about $55 million in our accounts receivable provisions, though our reserve coverage is down 30 basis points from a year ago and down 20 points since September. Typically, we talk about the impact of our hedging programs as a driver of expense. However, this quarter was effectively no year-to-year impact on expense due to our hedging programs, consistent with the fact that currency ended up being fairly neutral on a year-to-year basis. 
So now let me get into the segments. The 2 Services segments delivered $15.3 billion in revenue, up 3%. The combined Services segments grew pretax profits 17%, and pretax margin was up 2.1 points. Total outsourcing revenue was $7.2 billion, up 4%, and total transactional revenue was $6.2 billion, up 3%. Overall growth was driven by the growth markets, with constant currency revenue up double digits in the outsourcing, transactional and maintenance businesses. Total backlog in the quarter was $141 billion. At constant currency, that is flat year-to-year and up $5 billion quarter-to-quarter. 
Moving on to the 2 segments in Global Technology Services, revenue was $10.5 billion, up 3%. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 3% and we gained share in the quarter and full year. Integrated Technology Services revenue grew 5%. We had great performance in the growth markets where we're seeing the benefits of geographic expansion in offerings like business continuity and resiliency services. 
Global Technology Services delivered very strong profit and margin this quarter, with pretax income up 18% and pretax margin up 2.3 points to 18%. This margin expansion was driven by productivity and cost management, along with a mix into higher-margin growth markets. We had gross margin improvement in all lines of business, outsourcing, ITS and maintenance. 
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.9 billion, up 3%. Application Outsourcing revenue was up 5%, led by strong performance in the growth markets. Consulting and Systems Integration, which includes consulting, AMS systems integration and the U.S. federal business, grew 2%. At constant currency, our growth rate improved over last quarter. 
Overall GBS revenue continued to be impacted by Japan and public sector. So total GBS revenue, excluding Japan and public sector, was up 9% at constant currency and up 8% for the year. And although declines in Japan and public sector continued, we did see some improved performance in public sector. Global Business Services delivered very strong profit and margin performance again this quarter. Pretax profit was up 14% year-to-year, with pretax margin up 1.8 points to 16.6%. 
Now I want to spend a minute on backlog and runout as we begin 2012. Last year, in the fourth quarter, we took you through an analysis of the key drivers of Services revenue. We focused the discussion around outsourcing, and in particular, the revenue generated by the runout of the outsourcing backlog. 
This year, we have expanded that analysis to give a view of the Total Services backlog runout. This view is more comprehensive and more indicative of the Total Services business as we start the year. 
There are 3 primary drivers of Total Services revenue: backlog, sales into our existing contract base and new client signings. A very high percentage of services revenue, roughly 70%, comes from the runout of the backlog we start the year with. In 2012, we expect about 3% revenue growth from that backlog. This gives us a very solid base of revenue to begin the year, with the remaining revenue coming from sales into our existing accounts, which have been on a good trajectory, and new client signings. 
So with that, let me wrap up the year in Services. We had very consistent revenue performance in the year driven by stability in the backlog. We continue to build out our services within the growth markets, with Total Services revenue up double digits in those markets and strong margins, with gross margin 2 points higher than that in the majors. 
We continue to get good traction in the growth initiatives, cloud, business analytics and Smarter Planet. And we had great profit and margin performance in both Services segments, with GTS pretax profit up 14% and GBS up 18% as we mixed a higher value offerings and markets and continued to drive productivity. 
Software had another great quarter, with revenue of $7.6 billion, up 9%. Key Branded Middleware grew double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter and gained share for the 17th straight quarter as we continue to extend our lead in the middleware market. 
Turning to brand performance, WebSphere was up 21% and continues to gain share. Each of WebSphere's 5 product areas grew 10% or better, including our Smarter Commerce offerings, which were up over 25%. This contributed to IBM's performance in the retail industry where we have grown in each of the last 9 quarters. Information Management grew 9% and again gained share. Our distributed database grew double digits, led by strong performances from our Netezza offerings, which were up nearly 70%. This appliance complements and extends our Business Analytics portfolio with a rapidly deployed low-cost of ownership solution for high performance queries and analytics. 
For the quarter, almost 1/3 of the transactions were with new Netezza clients. Since acquiring Netezza, IBM has expanded its customer base by over 40%. And when we go head-to-head against competition in proof of concepts, we had a win rate of over 80% this quarter. Our Business Analytics software offerings, most of which are part of Information Management, continue to outpace the market with double-digit growth. IBM's acquisition of Algorithmics in the fourth quarter further strengthens our business analytics and optimization offerings by providing risk analytics capabilities that help customers make informed business decisions. 
Tivoli software was up 14% and gained share, driven by storage software growth of 30%. Security solutions also delivered strong growth. With the recent acquisition of Q1 Labs, we can now offer clients a new level of intelligence around security to enable them to better predict, prevent and detect all types of security threats. Rational grew 4% and gained share, driven by strong performance in Telelogic. The fourth quarter wrapped up another powerful year for our software business. 
In 2011, software revenue grew 11%, gross margin expanded by 0.5 point and software delivered nearly $10 billion of pretax profit. Systems and Technology revenue of $5.8 billion was down 8%. This performance reflects very strong growth last year, driven by mainframe growth of almost 70%. Gross profit margin was down 3 points year-to-year, with a significant impact from product mix. 
Now let me take you through the brands. System z revenue declined 31% as we wrapped on the successful launch of our zEnterprise 196 last year. MIPS declined 4% this quarter. System z gross profit margin was up, reflecting a higher proportion of microcode upgrades, which is typical at this point of the product cycle. POWER grew 6%. This is the 15th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER. 
We continued our success in competitive takeouts. In the fourth quarter, we had over 350 competitive displacements which resulted in over $350 million of business. This is our strongest quarter in terms of competitive displacements since we started tracking this in 2006. Roughly 60% of this business came from HP, with most of the balance coming from Oracle/Sun.
2011 was the second year in a row we had over 1,000 competitive displacements, which this year generated over $1 billion of business. System x revenue declined 2%. We anticipate this is in line with the market. Storage hardware revenue was down 1%. When combined with the storage software growth of 30%, the total grew 5%. Retail Store Solutions had a great quarter, up 9%, and we continued to grow share. 
When you look at the full year, Systems and Technology delivered solid performance, with revenue up 6%, gross margin up 1.6 points and $1.6 billion in pretax income, up 12% year-to-year. 
Turning to cash flow on a full year basis, we generated $16.6 billion of free cash flow, which is up $300 million over last year. Excluding the impact of the income tax payments driven by audit settlement activity, which I discussed in prior quarters, full year free cash flow would have been up $1.1 billion, roughly in line with our net income growth. 
We continue to invest in our business, spending another $4 billion in capital expenditures. When I look at the uses of cash for the year, we returned $18.5 billion to shareholders, including $3.5 billion in dividends, and we bought back almost 89 million shares for $15 billion. At the end of the year, we had $8.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. 
In addition, we spent almost $2 billion to acquire 5 companies. Over the last 2 years, we spent almost $8 billion. In addition, we've announced several acquisitions that didn't close by year end, including Emptoris, DemandTec, Platform Computing and earlier this month, Green Hat. With $9 billion of free cash flow generation in the quarter and $16.6 billion for the year, we're positioned to continue to invest in innovation and return value to shareholders. 
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.9 billion, up $600 million from September. Total debt was $31.3 billion, of which $23.3 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at just over 7 to 1. Our non-financing debt was $8 billion, up $600 million from the third quarter and up $2.2 billion from a year ago. 
Now let me spend a minute on our retirement-related plans and the impact to the balance sheet. Despite volatile market conditions in 2011, we had good returns on global assets. The discount rate environment was challenging, which resulted in an impact to equity at the end of the year. This took our debt-to-cap up to 32%. And we're comfortable operating in this range of 30% to 40%. 
At the end of 2011, our defined benefits qualified plans were well funded and our cash requirements remained stable. We have supplemental charts that show the specific performance in rates, as well as a forward-looking view of the P&L and cash implications based on year-end 2011 assumptions with sensitivities. Suffice it to say that as we look forward, while changes in the return on assets and discount rate may drive some volatility in nonoperating elements of the P&L, there is little implication to our cash requirements. 
So now let me start to wrap up with the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance. Knowing that we faced a tough fourth quarter on revenue, we drove other elements of our model, productivity, mix and cash utilization to deliver our earnings performance. Our revenue growth contributed $0.07 to our earnings growth. Our solid gross margin expansion more than offset a higher level of expense and an increase in the tax rate. 
Gross margin drove $0.19 of EPS growth, while we had a $0.02 impact from expense and a $0.04 impact from a higher tax rate. All in, margin expansion contributed $0.13. And a lower share count resulting from our ongoing share repurchase program contributed $0.26. Bottom line, we delivered 11% EPS growth in the quarter. And for the full year, we delivered 15% growth. Revenue growth was the largest contributor to our earnings growth, though we had good contribution from share repurchase and margin expansion. 
So 2011 was another very good year for us, with solid revenue performance, continued margin expansion, strong profit and cash generation and effective use of cash. Our focus on key growth initiatives and investments in innovation are enabling us to expand into new markets and capitalize on trends like analytics and cloud. 
Our growth market strategy to expand into new markets, build out IT infrastructures and lead in specific industries is driving powerful performance and share gains. These countries contributed almost 2/3 of IBM's constant currency revenue growth and now represent 22% of IBM's geographic revenue. 
Our Business Analytics solutions help our clients leverage massive amounts of data and content to gain insight and optimize results. This year, Business Analytics grew 16%. Our Smarter Planet initiatives generated close to 50% growth. Smarter Commerce, in particular, is gaining momentum by helping companies buy, market, sell and service their products and services. We're not just addressing an existing market, we're actually making markets. And in cloud, we're helping our clients improve the economics of IT. 
This year, we continue to expand our offerings. And our cloud revenue in 2011 was more than 3x the prior year. With powerful contribution from these growth initiatives, we delivered 7% revenue growth. We said at the beginning of the year that we expect the growth in the first half of the year to be higher than the second half. By leveraging all of the elements of our model, productivity, mix and utilization of cash, we delivered operating pretax and net income growth of 9% and operating EPS growth of 15%, with double-digit growth in each of the 4 quarters. 
So now, as we enter 2012, we expect to deliver operating EPS of at least $14.85 for the year, with the growth rate more skewed to the second half. So we've just completed our centennial year. And as we reach this milestone, we've learned that you have to continually transform and reinvent yourself to be a leader in your industry. IBM's performance is the result of a transformation we started years ago. 
We've been shifting our business to higher-value areas, improving productivity and investing to drive future growth. These changes contributed to 9 consecutive years of double-digit earnings per share growth. But more importantly, they strengthened our business and put us on track to achieve our 2015 roadmap objective of at least $20 of operating EPS. 
Now Patricia and I will take your questions."

To be honest, I don't know what they're doing with their budgets. I do know what we do with our budget, and it's very similar to the conversations that I have with other CFOs. They're looking for the best value to move their business and move their business rapidly. And so I think it's a measure of our ability to bring value to those clients. If you look at our business and evaluate that now and give us a report card on just those key investment priorities that we had, we did very, very well, I think. Business Analytics, up 16%; cloud computing, more than tripled; Smarter Planet, almost 50% growth. And you look -- now you look at the GMU, another very strong quarter from GMU, BRICS up 11%, GMU, 8 points faster than the majors. So obviously, we are satisfying value considerations within our customer set. You can see that, I think, in the surprising mix, in some respects, of our penetration within individual countries. So when you look at Europe. Europe at 1%, let's take it though and look at it by country, some pretty interesting statistics. Number one, we had Spain growing 9%. That's a fifth quarter of growth sequentially from Spain. We had the U.K. growing 9% for the 9th consecutive quarter. Germany returned to growth, up 4%. Let's look at North America. You look at the U.S., up 1%. That's on the back of that 10% growth last year, driven by our big mainframe announcement. If you look at that on a 2-year basis, that's a 5% compound growth rate, which is pretty strong performance. Canada, up 13%. Strong growth statistics on our growth markets, 40 countries at double-digit. So that's, I think, the best measure of our value, and you can see it in the individual countries. This isn't just a homogenous base across these individual geographies. You can also see it as you look at our overall share performance. So if you look at it and break down from a brand perspective into the 15, 16 composite brands in the business, I mean, we gained or held share in 15 of the 16. So we gained in ITS, Integrated Technology Services, we gained in global process services. We gained in AMS, both SO and SI. We gained in WebSphere, in Information Management, in Tivoli, in Rational, in POWER, Retail Store Solutions. The only brand that we lost share was in mainframe. Now who do you think we lost share to? We lost share to POWER series, our own product line. Every other brand held. So I think that's also a good view of how we're adding value really pretty consistently across the product line as we enter 2012. Now if you look at 2012, your second part of your question, we move into '12 starting with the software business. We had 9% growth in the quarter, about 12% profit growth, very strong performance out of our software base of business. And I’d remind you that software now in 2011 is almost $10 billion of profit. That's up from the beginning of the decade when they were $2.8 billion. Big success, and we move into 2012 with a strong set of opportunities. So I would expect to see similar performance from our software business. When you look at the overall Services business, we gave you, I think, a much more comprehensive metric on revenue. This year, looking at the total backlog of $141 billion, and within that backlog, the runout of the total backlog should be up 3%, covering about 70% of the revenue we need in the year. And you look at our Hardware business, though the Hardware business was -- face a difficult compare in the first half of the year, with new announcement content by the time we get to the second half of the year, I'd expect them to generate mid-single digit growth. So once again, I think we entered the year on the value side, both brand and geographic, with a pretty strong hand."

Within Services, first of all, I think the Services business did a very, very good job in the year of driving towards higher value offerings and higher value content for their customer set that is able to bring in the other elements of the IBM equation from both software content and hardware business that our competitors are not able to bring to the table. So within the Services businesses, once again, they did a very good job on both the GBS side and the GTS side to continue to improve that value equation to their customer set. And as we look at the contracts that they're now moving and carrying into 2012, they've already done a very strong job on big contracts where we have more challenging financial dynamics that we know we're going to deliver in 2012. But the other point I'd make, Toni, we were very specific in the overall business model for both the 2010 roadmap and the 2015 roadmap of our attention to pull spend and drive productivity across the corporation as a global corporation. That's the $8 billion that we identified in the last Analyst Meeting. And we've done our first down payment on that right on track. Now, who do you think is a beneficiary of a lot of that structural takeout? The Services business. The Services business are a big beneficiary at that large corporate structural takeout. And to a large degree, I think a lot of that operating leverage that we get is unique to IBM and differentiated from our competition and is not given away necessarily in price. So that structure element is a big assist to our overall services margin, right on track for the objectives that we had set and a strong complement. As far as opportunity and headroom, let's look at it from the IBM equation. I mean, we’re still not in the top quartile of the S&P in the tech universe. There's no reason, with the value that we bring to our customer base, that we shouldn't be in that top quartile. It's a very integrated part of our business model that we've integrated into our budgeting systems. And as I said, I do believe we ought to be able to achieve an overall economy of scale of a large corporation, and a lot of that displayed in our Services business. So as our game plan for IBM as a whole, we're going to drive that software mix within IBM, and you can see from the segment results that the PTI for our software business runs between 40% and 50%. We're going to continue to work to spend reductions and productivity, much of that delivering within our Services segment and drive value add in the customer engagement with assets, research and value-add approach."

So as I had said in the earlier questions, if you look at the software-base of business, I think we've got re",552,"Yes, sure. Let me now take that from the IBM level and then I'll go specifically to your question on kind of the skew in the drivers and the SKU. So as I had said in the earlier questions, if you look at the software-base of business, I think we've got real momentum going into 2012. You saw that in our fourth quarter achievement. Additionally, within that, I can tell you that our acquisition performance for the $6.2 billion of spend that we did in 2010, plus the $1.8 billion that we did, those business case and the performance of those acquisitions against the business case was about the best I've seen in years. Real traction. And I think we entered 2012 with traction on our software business. And I believe they ought to be able to generate double-digit profitability once again. I explained that in our Services business already, in the backlog runout, now against the total backlog for Services, that we already have about 3% in the backlog runout, which would comprise about 70% of our revenue. The balance of the revenue coming from new signings and base growth, even if that new signings base growth were flat, which I don't believe it will be, but even if it were, 70% of the 3 would drive 2% revenue growth in Services. And we showed last year that we could drive double-digit profitability on that base, and we will run the same plays to deliver against that again. So driving for double-digit profit growth in our Services business. The question you asked and the distinction between first half and second half, that's really the STG equation. So STG will have a tough compare in the first half compared to last year's announcement cycle on the high end. But when we get to the new announcements, we get into second half, I would expect that STG should return to mid-single digit revenue growth, and with that, double-digit profit growth. So that, all together, gives us a good handle. Now if you can compare that first half to second half, I'm talking about a couple of points difference between the growth rate that we would see in the first half and the second half. It's not like a major difference, but I do think it has a couple of points differentiation based on that hardware platform. This is, overall, very consistent, once again, with our model. Revenue growth, margin expansion on mix to software and productivity and improved usage of our cash to drive investments, acquisition and our balance sheet for share repurchase. Now like all years, we're going to acquire and we're going to divest businesses. We're going to invest in market opportunities and we're going to drive productivity wherever it's more challenging. We're going to rebalance our workforce to opportunities and skills aligned with our key investments and hire to drive in those growth initiatives. When you look at workforce rebalancing, I think it should be roughly consistent with what we've seen over the last 4 years. More specifically, I think, it would be more like 2010. Once again, if there's a charge associated to that, it would be offset above net income. But you put that all together, and I think we have a good hand as we enter 2012."

I still think the best guide over the longer period, Katy, we had said that in the 2015 time frame that we saw about $20 billion of acquisition spend. In that specific calendar time frame, we've only done about $1.8 billion. I still think the $20 billion is a realistic number. We are pretty tough on the financial returns in the cases. We're very, very tough on that. If it doesn't make very strong financial sense then we're either going to hold or we're going to walk. And there have not been exceptions to that rule, at least since I've been in the job. Consequently, we're there to perform against those. Now when the market gets more reasonable on a price level, we'll move in, in a bigger way, and when it gets pricier, we’ll peel back. In 2010, I thought prices were pretty reasonable. We had a lot of good candidates. We did 17 acquisitions, as I'll remind you. Things got a little frothier as we went into 2011. We did pull back, but we still had some very strong acquisitions. You've seen in the last -- in the fourth quarter, we had about 4 acquisitions. We've already done 3 this year. Within that, one aspect of that improving performance, I think, and I can't give you a precise variance analysis on it, but we've built a tool with research based on the analytic performance in all of the acquisitions that we've done since 2000. You've got to imagine that's a pretty rich database to drive that. So now when we go in and do due diligence in an acquisition, we use that analytical tool, this is called ""eating your own cooking,"" we use that analytical tool to improve our performance. So when you do an acquisition, you’re going to put that team on the ground, we now know the 5 or 6 key elements that we have to actually -- absolutely nail to perform against that, and we can hit those very, very quickly. Analytics, I think, has really paid off for us. But I do think the acquisition play is a good one, and I do think the market’s in a more reasonable position."

On the GBS base of business, they were impacted in the year, and I think it was -- it would have been very difficult for them to offset this because about 1/3 of their business is in public sector in Japan. And with the difficulties in both of those, if you airlift them out of their results, in the fourth quarter, GBS did about 9% growth. So a bit of an acceleration off the 8% that they would have done on that basis in the first, second and third quarter. So we exit the year, I think, with the balance of that business performing pretty well. As we go into 2012, we should start to wrap on the public sector performance. We should also start to wrap on the issues in Japan. And so I do think that gives us an opportunity to improve performance, but we haven't banked on that as we built our budgets and our structure."

This year, consistent with year-to-year dynamics in backlog, more of that backlog runout is driven by the transactional businesses.

As far as lengthening of the sales cycle and more approvals, I do think people and CFOs are cautious about their business, and they want to make sure they have the right processes engaged.

At 10 points better, we did 10 points better this year, we did 10 points better last year but the prior 2 years were both 8 points better. So that differential, it's hard to look at that differential and not conclude it's relatively improving for the last few years and driving our mix equation. So we do feel pretty good about that mix performance. What I really feel good about is the profit performance behind that growth because they are a big contributor. So if you look at the performance that we saw in the quarter, at their relative mix, they drove about 42% of the profit growth that we had on a growth -- so that was a very strong contributor. If you look at the dependencies there, number one, I think we bring a lot of value to those geographies. So if you look at that value construct, I mean, a play like Smarter Planet plays in a very big way in our growth markets. Secondly, we're able to roll out with our structural advantage on the back-office, the central structure of the business, we can move into new cities without recreating that back-office. It's as if you have a -- kind of a -- for lack of a better word, a branch in a box and you plug in the back-office. And the back-office is running the systems across the geographies. I think that gives us an advantage. And then third, not to be -- plus we have a very good reputation, very good reputation and very good brand image in our growth markets as well. So we feel pretty confident in that play. So a lot of good questions. Let me wrap up now, just make a few comments. We just delivered a great quarter to cap off what I think was a great 2011. For the year, we generated 7% revenue growth to almost $107 billion. We expanded margin in line with our model and delivered $13.44 of operating EPS, which is our ninth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. Looking forward to 2012, we see good opportunity in our growth markets and in our higher value solutions like analytics and Smarter Planet, where we believe our enterprise clients will continue to focus. And we'll leverage the strength and flexibility of our business model, driving productivity, improving mix and using our capital effectively. So this all supports our expectation of at least $14.85 of operating earnings per share for the year. That's up 10.5% and keeps us right on track to deliver at least $20 in 2015. So thanks for joining us, and now it's back to work."

112350,213858593,326904,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2012",2012-07-18,"Earnings Calls","International Business Machines Corporation","Executives","Thank you for joining us today. In the second quarter, we reported $25.8 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins, delivered operating earnings per share of $3.51, up 14% year-to-year and generated free cash flow of $3.7 billion",2890,"Thank you for joining us today. In the second quarter, we reported $25.8 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins, delivered operating earnings per share of $3.51, up 14% year-to-year and generated free cash flow of $3.7 billion, up 9%. So when you look at it, our results demonstrate the strength of IBM's business model, which is designed to deliver profit and cash on a sustainable basis. Consistent with this performance, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15.10. This is up $0.10 from our previews view of at least $15. I'll comment on a couple of the second quarter highlights by segment.
In Software, we had mid single digits constant currency growth in Europe and Japan, double-digit growth in the growth markets, while the U.S. growth was lower due to very strong performance a year ago. 
Services growth at constant currency was consistent with last quarter, where there are newly content providing a solid base of revenue and profit. Our backlog was flat year-to-year at constant currency, and we again expanded margins and grew our combined services and segment profit by 18%. 
Our Hardware business declined, as you would expect, at this point in our product cycles. Though we continue to extend our share leadership in our 2 high and server brands.
In total, IBM's revenue growth at constant currency was fairly consistent with the first quarter. We ended the quarter with a currency headwind, but it got even tougher over the last 90 days. When you look at the reported revenue, currency impacted our revenue growth by almost 4 points or $1 billion of revenue. But in spite of this headwind, we generated strong operating performance, with pretax and net income each up 8%.
Now an important element of our long-term model is to expand margin through a combination of productivity and mix to higher margin businesses. This quarter, we expanded operating gross margin by 1.5 points, with 2/3 due to improvement in segment margins and the other 1/3 from mix. We improved operating PTI margins by more than 2 points and operating net margin by 1.6 points. So this quarter, again, we demonstrated the flexibility in our model. Bottom line, we delivered operating EPS of $3.51, which was up 14% year-to-year.
Turning to cash. We've generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. That's up 9%, slightly faster than net income. When you consider the last 12 months, we've generated a record $18 billion of free cash flow. With this strong cash performance, we delivered significant returns to shareholders with $4 billion in share repurchases and dividends this quarter and nearly $17 billion over the last 12 months. 
Now I'll get into the second quarter details starting with revenue by geography, where I'll discuss the results on a constant currency basis.
In the Americas, Canada was up while the U.S. again was flat year-to-year. EMEA was also flat year-to-year, slowing just 1 point from last quarter's growth rate. But in total, still relatively stable. As in the past, there is a good bit of variability by country. 
We had growth again in the U.K. and Spain. Germany was flat well France and Italy declined. Overall, revenue in our major market countries was down 1% year-to-year. With 8% growth, our growth markets rate outpaced the major markets by 9 points. Even with the tough compare, the BRICs had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 12%. We had particular strength in Russia and China. In fact, China was up over 20% this quarter, again gaining share. We're continuing to build our capabilities here. We've expanded a number of branch offices, and now have 68 face-to-face and over 100 virtual branch offices open across all of China.
Across the growth markets this quarter, more than 30 countries grew at a double-digit growth rate, so our strength is broad-based. We're capturing the opportunity from these faster growing economies and importantly, we're taking share due in part to the acceleration of our market expansion initiative. In fact, this is our eighth consecutive quarter of share gains in the growth markets.
So now, let me add a little color to our revenue and gross margin by segment. 
For Total Services, both outsourcing and transactional revenues were up 1% at constant currency, and we're continuing to deliver strong growth in our growth markets countries. In Software, this quarter, we had good growth in our business analytics and storage management offerings. Our Systems and Technology revenue decline was roughly in line with our first quarter rate. This quarter, we again took share on POWER, driven by competitive displacements.
Turning to gross profit. Our operating gross margin improved 1.5 points, driven by a combination of solid margin expansion in both Services segment and in improving segment mix due to the relative growth of Software.
Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile. 
Our total operating expense and other income was down 6%. This is driven by currency for both translation and hedging dynamics. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 2 points of expense growth. And our base expense, excluding currency and acquisitions, was down 1 point. I'll comment in a couple of expense items.
First, though it wasn't a significant driver year-to-year, we had about $150 million of workforce rebalancing in the quarter, primarily in Europe. Second, we had the year-to-year benefit from our hedging programs, which, as you know, cannot be looked at in isolation as it mitigates the translation impact across the P&L. We hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in our global cash planning. 
Last year, hedging programs generated fairly significant losses and impact to expense of $195 million. While this year, the programs generated gains of about $85 million in expense. This represents over 3/4 of our hedging activity. The balance is in cost.
This is the dynamic you would expect given the year-to-year change in currencies. But again, this hedge activity mitigates translation impacts throughout the P&L.
So now, let me go into the segments. 
The 2 Services segment delivered $14.7 billion in revenue, grew pretax profit by 18% and expanded pretax margin by 3 points. Backlog was $136 billion, down 6% year-to-year at actual rates and flat at constant currency. Overall, services revenue performance at constant currency was fairly consistent with last quarter. The growth markets were up 10% at constant currency with good backlog growth and the major markets were down 1% at constant currency. 
Within the major markets, looking at revenue, North America was stable; Japan was still down, though we did see some improvement over last quarter; and Europe decelerated compared to last quarter. And we continued the strong performance in our Business Analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet offerings. Overall, profit performance was very strong, with 24% growth in Global Technology Services pretax profit and 7% growth in Global Business Services profit.
Moving onto the 2 segments. 
In Global Technology Services, revenue was $10 billion, down 2% as reported and up 2% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 2% at constant currency. Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 4% at constant currency with the growth markets up nearly 16% at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered very strong profit in margin, with pretax income up 24% and pretax margin up 3.6 points. 
Last quarter, I commented on the tremendous amount of work that GTS has done to manage their large portfolio of outsourcing contracts. Specifically, by taking a disciplined approach to solving problems in the select set of lower margin contracts, this work continues to yield benefits in both profit and margin and accounted for about 1/3 of the gross margin expansion in GTS this quarter. Although there would be some modest impact to revenue from this work going forward, we should see ongoing benefits to the portfolio.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.7 billion, down 4% as reported and down 1% at constant currency. Consulting and systems integration revenues were flat year-to-year at constant currency and Application Outsourcing revenues declined 1% at constant currency.
Looking at revenue from a geographic perspective, that growth markets continue to perform well with their fifth consecutive quarter of at 10% growth or better. North America was relatively stable while Japan was down. This quarter, revenue in Europe decreased 3% at constant currency after being flat last quarter.
Now looking at the growth initiatives, within GBS, we have been remixing and shifting more resources to these higher value-growth initiatives. This quarter, GBS revenue included strong growth in Business Analytics, which was up 28% and Smarter Planet up 15%. But GBS value extended beyond what is reported in the GBS segment. They play a key role in driving the growth initiatives across IBM, where we are seeing continued strong performance. And finally, GBS returned to a more typical level of profitability as we indicated in our last call. So this quarter, pretax income grew 7% and pretax margin improved by 1.8 points.
Software revenue was $6.2 billion was flat as reported and up 4% at constant currency. Key Branded Middleware, which accounted for 64% of total software revenue in the second quarter, increased 4% at constant currency, in line with the market. 
Software performed well in the growth markets where revenue was up double digits, and Europe and Japan both grew at mid single digits, all in constant currency. Growth in the U.S. was impacted by a very tough compare. We see great opportunity in our Global Software business and are hiring 200 to 300 sales representatives each month through the year end.
Now let me take you through the drivers for a few other brands. 
WebSphere grew 7% at constant currency and gained share for the 15th consecutive quarter. Within WebSphere, we had good growth in commerce and portal offerings. This quarter, we acquired Tealeaf, a provider of customer experience management software, which enables our clients to analyze interactions on websites and mobile devices. Information Management was up 3% at constant currency in held share. Netezza continues to expand its global footprint with very strong growth in Europe, Japan and growth markets, and added nearly 70 new clients worldwide. 
This quarter, we closed 2 more acquisitions expanding our Business Analytics and optimization software capabilities. Analytics of the company that helps optimize sales performance management and, which enhances IBM's Big Data initiative by helping clients analyze volume, variety and velocity of Big Data for strategic advantage.
Tivoli software was up 6% at constant currency and gained share, driven by storage software growth of 13% at constant currency. Tivoli storage management continues to perform exceptionally well, growing double digits at constant currency for the sixth consecutive quarter. Within our security offerings, we're utilizing recent acquisitions such as Q1 Labs to provide end-to-end risk management solutions to protect our clients against the latest threats, while reducing the costs and complexity of security.
Turning to profit. Software pretax income grew 8% to $2.5 billion, and pretax margins increased 2.7 points to 35.9%.
Systems and Technology revenue of $4.3 billion was down 9% or 7% at constant currency, following very strong growth across the portfolio a year ago. Systems z revenue declined 9% at constant currency and myths declined 8% with a mix towards specialty engines. Systems z profit margin was up again, which is typical at this point in the upgrade cycle.
POWER revenue was down 4% at constant currency this quarter. We had continued strength this quarter in POWER high-performance computing solutions. In June, IBM achieved the top speed rating in the world. And we earned 3 of the top 4 spots on the top 500 project, which ranks the world's most powerful computers.
We continued our success and competitive displacements in the second quarter, with over 320 displacements that drive over $265 million of business. As you would expect, these came from a combination of HP and Oracle Sun. This initiative has helped drive our 17th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER.
System x revenue was down 5% at constant currency, our high end segment grew double digits. Storage hardware revenue was flat at constant currency, with the value continuing to shift to software, as you saw with the ongoing success we're having in our Tivoli storage software offerings. 
In the second quarter, we introduced and began shipping PureFlex, the first offering from our new PureSystems family of expert integrated systems. PureFlex optimizes workloads and drives harder efficiencies. In the third quarter, the Pure application system will become available, and we expect volume shipments in the fourth quarter. Pure application will do for software what PureFlex does for hardware by driving application efficiency and rapid deployment to enable faster time to value.
Turning to cash flow. We generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is up $300 million year-to-year. Over the last 12 months, we've generated a record $18 billion in free cash flow. For the first half, our free cash flow of $5.5 billion was up $1.4 billion year-to-year. The growth was driven by net income. 
As I've mentioned previously, in the first quarter of last year, our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments, driven by settlement activity. But even if you adjust for the prior year tax impact, we had double-digit growth in free cash flow.
Looking at the uses of our cash in the first half, we've spent almost $2 billion to acquire 8 companies, including Tivisimo, Verisant and Tealeaf, which closed in the second quarter. We returned almost $8 billion to shareholders in the first half. We spent $6 billion in share repurchase to buy back almost 31 million shares. At the end of the second quarter, we had $9.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
We took our dividend up 13% in April and through June, we paid out $1.8 billion. This is the 17th consecutive year that we've raised our dividend and the ninth year in the row of double-digit increases.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.2 billion. Total debt was $32.4 billion, of which, $22.6 billion was in support of a financing business, which is leveraged at 7:1. Our non-financing that was $9.8 billion, and our non-financing debt to cap was 36%.
We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long term.
So now let me start to wrap up with a summary of the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance this quarter. Once again, margin expansion was our largest contributor to growth, as our continued focus on productivity and mixed to higher value drove improvement in gross pretax and net margins year-to-year. An ongoing share repurchase program budgeted the balance at a level fairly consistent with last quarter.
This quarter, we delivered 14% EPS growth and $3.7 billion in free cash flow, despite facing a couple of headwinds. First, we had a strong second quarter last year with 12% revenue growth, so we had a challenging compare. And second, we're dealing with pretty significant currency dynamics, which impacted our revenue line by about $1 billion. But in spite of these, IBM's business model enabled our strong profit performance in the current environment.
Now let me comment on a few of the key elements of our model. 
First, we have been investing to capture opportunities and deliver client value on high-growth markets, emerging countries as well as our key growth initiatives. In the first half, our growth market country delivered 9% growth at constant currency. Our Business Analytics portfolio of services and offerings were up 13% in the first half, led by our GBS consulting practice. In cloud, we doubled last year's revenue with contribution from all areas, private cloud, public cloud and our industry-based solutions.
And in the first half, we had revenue growth of more than 20% in the Smarter Planet portfolio, driven by industry-specific solutions and our Smarter Commerce and Smarter Cities offerings. So we're getting real performance from the investments we're making in our growth initiatives.
Another important and unique aspect of our model is the balance between annuity business and transaction businesses. Our annuity businesses, which make up the majority of services and software and reflect our long-term relationship with our clients, provide a solid base of revenue, profit and cash. 
Third, we have had underway for sometime a series of initiatives to drive productivity. These are real structural changes that improve our business and margins over time on a sustained, durable basis. This quarter, we again expanded our margins. And this year, we'll make further progress towards delivering the productivity savings included in our roadmap.
Finally, we continue to grow our free cash flow and have a solid balance sheet, which allows us to invest in the business while returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.
So a combination of our strategy and our business model enable us to generate strong profit growth in the current environment. And now looking at our first half performance, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15.10, on track to at least $20 in 2015.
Now Patricia and I will take your questions."

Absent from that with any commentary on the macroeconomic environment, and I'm wondering if you can comment on that, particularly in light of services performance. Because I think, when we enter 2012, you said 70% of services revenue in 2012 will come from backlog, and that 70% will be up 3% while your Total Services business in the first half is tracking well below that. So perhaps, you can address the macroeconomic question in the context of the fact that the services revenue that you're generating this year appears to be very weak."
112350,213858593,326904,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2012",2012-07-18,"Earnings Calls","International Business Machines Corporation","Executives","Okay, Toni, very good question. Let me start from a macro perspective for the second quarter.

Let me start from a macro perspective for the second quarter. First of all, if you look at the kind of geographic breakdown, going first quarter to second quarter, Americas was up by 2% and the first 1% to [ph] 1% in the second quarter, really that differential was due to the software compare that we had in the second quarter of last year. And if you look at the third quarter, just based on a compare basis, we'll pick up another 2.5 points. So I feel pretty confident about that content as we're going to the third. Europe was up 1% in the first quarter, relatively flat in the second quarter. We'll talk about that alluded more. In Asia, it went from plus 1% in the first quarter to up 4%, so real strength in Asia. If you look at the distribution of that performance across the month, that was relatively linear. In other words, it didn't have the fluctuations across the month. But if anything, it relatively strengthen as we went through the quarter. So June was a little stronger than the rest of the quarter. In some of our transactional businesses like our hardware-based business, in fact, we noticed that against typical rates of performance had a pretty darn good last week of the quarter, indicating momentum as we're going to the third. So that's what give you kind of an overview. Now from a markets perspective, let's talk about the growth markets. They continue to perform well across the board. BRIC countries were up 12%. They represent about 1/3 of our overall growth market business. Within that, China was up a very impressive 24%. And I remind you, we now have opened our 68th face-to-face branch in China. We have over 100 virtual branches. Total growth markets outpaced the majors again by 9 points this quarter, up 8% on a constant currency basis. And within that, we had 32 countries up double digits. Every sector grew, every brand grew, software and services were up 10%. Our z business in the growth markets was up 7%. So this reflects our broad-based strong performance in those markets. Major markets, as you would expect, a little more mix. I was going to spend a lot more time in Europe. Within Europe, we did see growth within U.K. and Spain, U.K. for the 11th quarter in the row, Spain, the seventh quarter. Germany was flat and now the third quarter of either flat to modest growth out of Germany. And again, Italy and France were down. So kind of mixed performance within the European geography. Third, I kind of look at brand performance. So on a software-based, we have strong performance in Europe and Asia. And in North America really, as I said earlier, kind of issue with compares which we talk about a little later. However, at this point in the cycle, no real surprises. And I said earlier, if anything, z did a little better job as it went to the quarter. Again, real strength in z, up 11% in growth markets. And so services, I would say, really pretty consistent with last quarter. Now to your services point, if you do the math, we had said that opening backlog drives about 70% of revenue. So 70% of the 3% backlog runout would be about 2%. So if you look at GTS, certainly that a conform with the kind of relationship. In GBS, we're down 1%. We did see, in GBS, some improvement in Japan and public sector, but they were still down. Now within the GBS business, what I'd point out within the organizational structure, as we move resource from kind of historical big rollout complex product structures that are oftentimes custom into our growth initiatives, you'll see some impact in that translation. But what we see in those growth initiatives, within GBS, really strong growth performance, up double digit across the board within GBS, and likewise, within IBM, up strong double digit across the board, pulling with it about 50% software mix. Within that GBS content alone, the margins within those growth initiatives are about 3 points richer than the balance of the business, and that help contribute to return to profit growth in the GBS in the second quarter, up 7%."

Great question, Bill. So if you look at the full year, we've taken our guidance up to at least $15.10, and that would imply, for the second half, about 10% EPS growth.

So if you look at the full year, we've taken our guidance up to at least $15.10, and that would imply, for the second half, about 10% EPS growth. Now within that EPS growth, it's reasonably distributed across both the third and the fourth quarter. If anything, a little skewed to the fourth quarter with any product announcements. Currency, in the second half, is going to be a headwind of about 4 to 5 points in the third quarter, 2 to 3 points in the fourth. And that spot rates, that would be a headwind to us of about $2 billion in the second half compared to $1 billion that we just had in the second quarter. On a third quarter basis, I would say that our constant currency revenue growth should be approximately equal to what we saw in the dynamics in the first half of the year, with the fourth quarter really presenting opportunity for -- with our new announcements for additional growth. So back to your -- second half of the year question, we regard this really as an all in forecast, we realize that we do have some tax headwind as we ended the third and the fourth quarter. The divestiture of our Retail Store systems business should generate a gain of about $450 million to $550 million in the second half. We do expect to close that shortly with the major countries really closing first. So the gain will be recognized as we close those countries and get the cash. And I would expect the bulk of that to happen in the third quarter. But based on country closing, some extended in the fourth. Now as we've discussed a number of times in the past, when we get that cash inflow from a divestiture, we put that to good work to improve the productivity of our business, and that's why these divestitures are accretive to IBM. So consequently, we will also have workforce rebalancing in the second half. I expect slightly greater than the first half of 2012. Now that workforce rebalancing will be focused on our non-U.S. operations, very little really in the U.S. So all in all, we feel optimistic about our hand for the second half in spite of the headwinds that we see."

So first of all, in the context, as we go into the second half of the year for our services business, we see strong profit growth across services from both the GTS and GBS organizations.

So first of all, in the context, as we go into the second half of the year for our services business, we see strong profit growth across services from both the GTS and GBS organizations. So I think we have a very good had in doing it. Now you know we run this business for profit and cash contribution. A couple of key dynamics within that, within GMU, we have very good market performance in our business there. Our revenue in GMU are growth markets unit is up 10%. That's 10 points faster than we see in the major markets. In fact, over time, that's driven our backlog to also be up 10% in our growth markets unit. Our transactional business -- if you look at the growth initiatives, cloud has more than doubled. So consequently, we see our backlog up 6%. We have growth in really 14 straight quarters in our transactional business. And I want to return again to the work that we're doing on an ongoing basis on productivity, because I think a lot of this is really leadership work in the front of our services organizations, especially the GTS content that we saw this quarter driving that 24% increase year-to-year. A lot of that is driven by automation and a partnering that they've done with research that gives us unique capability that I don't think you'd see in our competitors, as well as utilizing the global scale. But once again, I want to return to the work that we've been on the distribution of profitability in our contracts. So once again, if you imagine this as a normal curve distribution of the profitably within the services contracts, they did a very discreet piece of work on how to improve the value contribution and the context of those -- contracts in that weaker end of the distribution. And that contributed about 1/3 of that 24%. We should see that ongoing to some degree as we go through the year. And I think as we continue to work on that weaker side of the distribution move actually the average to the right, it will continue to contribute. Again, if you want to put that in the context of backlog, to generate that same level of profitability in our Outsourcing business, our opening backlog this year would have needed to have been richer by about $5 billion to $10 billion. So once again, you can see how the impact of that work, how it is relative to the backlog, and I think it's very consistent with our overall objective to manage this business for profit and cash generation."

So -- and the objective was, we do so much work in driving our competitive position on engagement, what can we do to really help drive our level of productivity on an ongoing basis as well. And so to start that, it seemed very logical, let's pick the contract that really in that left tail of the distribution contracts. So that was the first starting point that they took. And then they applied kind of leadership delivery content, real value-add content. And these are elements that when you apply them to the left-hand tail of the distribution, if you can move that average, it has tremendous impact. So I think that approach, that approach of really, on an ongoing basis, working hard to apply better value contribution to drive that margin is something that we can continue to apply both in our GTS and GBS businesses. And they really have substantial impact that contribute to that operational performance that we saw in GTS."

So the z performance did improve. Some of that was back-end loaded in the quarter.

On an x basis, they really did face a very tough compare last year. If you remember, they are 15% in 2011, so that really did contribute to a lot of it.

Secondly, in public, public was up 4%. And if you look underneath the public sector, government was up 4%; education was up 16%; and our health and life sciences business was up 3% for the 21st quarter of growth in that area. Within our public sector and education, we've installed the fastest computer in the world in the Lawrence Livermore laboratory. So very good performance in public and an indication of the kind of rollout our initiatives have had. In industrial, we were up 3%. That was highly driven by automotive. That was up 11%.

So for software, outside of the U.S., we had 4% growth in Europe. Now that's very, very good performance in my book in Europe and current conditions. In Japan, we had 6% growth in software. In growth markets, we had 10% growth in software. So all of those constant currency references all strong performance from my perspective. All were meeting the objectives that we had set. The U.S. organization really faced just a difficult compare and last year. I mean, that's kind of a function in their achievements. And the prior year, they're up 17%. So that 17% historical achievement drove the performance last year for the total software business of 10.5% growth. So as we look at the compare for the third quarter, that's about 8% growth. So we're going to pick up about 2.5 points just on the compare as the software business moves into the third quarter. Now the other point I wanted to make is we're continuing to invest in the software business in a very big way, acquisitions to drive and integrate with those solutions, continuing to hire 100 to 200 software reps every month. So we think of anything -- we have a very strong hand as a go into the second half. I think the first half performance was a very, very good, and in the third quarter, we should see growth rates that were consistent with the first quarter performance."

One way to look at that relative mix is to look at it both from kind of a sectors stand -- let's look at it from a sector standpoint, then let's look at it from a brand standpoint and then we'll look at it distributed across the growth within countries. So first of all, if you look at the performance in the growth markets, I mean, I think for them to once again be stronger than we had seen in the major markets by 9 points -- and that's a trend line that we've seen in 2008, 2009, 2010. We've seen that for a long time. 2011, first half of this year, that has been a very, very consistent phenomena for us. And that, if you look at the individual quarters, it's been pretty strong by individual quarters. Now if you look at the BRICs, the BRICs were up 12%. Within that, as I've said, China was up a very strong 12.4%. Russia was up very, very strong. Within that mix of business, we had real power within the z side of the house in China. But if you look across the sector dimension and the brand dimension, I mean, we have really strong growth in our sectors. Every single sector had growth, strong growth in the growth markets. We had very strong growth across every single brand. Our software business grew double digits. Our services business could growth double digit within our SPD content with z going 11%. And I remind you that it's just not constructive within the BRICs. That's about 1/3 of our business. So 2/3 of our business was also growing very, very well. And we had this double-digit growth phenomena across 32 countries. So I think the composition of our growth this quarter was balanced across the sectors, was balanced across the brands and indicative of both the BRIC countries and the broader growth markets.
So with that, let me wrap up the call. Now I think that results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of IBM is business model, delivering profit and cash on a sustained basis. And despite currency headwinds and a tough top line compare, we delivered strong performance. 8% growth in profit, 14% growth in operating EPS, both in the quarter and for the first half. But I don't want to miss what I consider to be the most important metric this quarter, and that's our cash performance. I mean, we generated $18 billion of free cash flow over the last 12 months, and that's a milestone for IBM. Let me put that in perspective.
We generated $16.6 billion last year. 10 years ago, we generated just under $6 billion. So in the last decade, we've increased the level of free cash flow generation by 3 times, and I think that's a real achievement, because it's that free cash flow that's in fact the fuel that we used to power this engine. So all of this gives us confidence to take up our expectation for the full year to at least $15.10 of operating EPS. That's up 12% from last year and on track at least $20 in 2015.
So thanks for joining us, and now, as always, back to work."

In the second quarter, we reported $25.8 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins, delivered operating earnings per share of $3.51, up 14% year-to-year and generated free cash flow of $3.7 billion",2891,"Thank you for joining us today. In the second quarter, we reported $25.8 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins, delivered operating earnings per share of $3.51, up 14% year-to-year and generated free cash flow of $3.7 billion, up 9%. So when you look at it, our results demonstrate the strength of IBM's business model, which is designed to deliver profit and cash on a sustainable basis. 
Consistent with this performance, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15.10. This is up $0.10 from our previews view of at least $15. I'll comment on a couple of the second quarter highlights by segment.
In Software, we had mid single digits constant currency growth in Europe and Japan, double-digit growth in the growth markets, while the U.S. growth was lower due to very strong performance a year ago.
Services growth at constant currency was consistent with last quarter, with our annuity content providing a solid base of revenue and profit. Our backlog was flat year-to-year at constant currency, and we again expanded margins and grew our combined Services segment profit by 18%.
Our Hardware business declined, as you would expect, at this point in our product cycles. Though we continue to extend our share leadership in our 2 high-end server brands.
In total, IBM's revenue growth at constant currency was fairly consistent with the first quarter. We ended the quarter with a currency headwind, but it got even tougher over the last 90 days. When you look at the reported revenue, currency impacted our revenue growth by almost 4 points or $1 billion of revenue. But in spite of this headwind, we generated strong operating performance, with pretax and net income each up 8%.
Now an important element of our long-term model is to expand margin through a combination of productivity and mix to higher margin businesses. This quarter, we expanded operating gross margin by 1.5 points, with 2/3 due to improvement in segment margins and the other 1/3 from mix. We improved operating PTI margins by more than 2 points and operating net margin by 1.6 points. So this quarter, again, we demonstrated the flexibility in our model. Bottom line, we delivered operating EPS of $3.51, which was up 14% year-to-year.
Turning to cash. We generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. That's up 9%, slightly faster than net income. When you consider the last 12 months, we've generated a record $18 billion of free cash flow. With this strong cash performance, we delivered significant returns to shareholders with $4 billion in share repurchases and dividends this quarter and nearly $17 billion over the last 12 months.
Now I'll get into the second quarter details starting with revenue by geography, where I'll discuss the results on a constant currency basis.
In the Americas, Canada was up while the U.S. again was flat year-to-year. EMEA was also flat year-to-year, slowing just 1 point from last quarter's growth rate. But in total, still relatively stable. As in the past, there is a good bit of variability by country.
We had growth again in the U.K. and Spain. Germany was flat, while France and Italy declined. Overall, revenue in our major market countries was down 1% year-to-year. With 8% growth, our growth markets rate outpaced the major markets by 9 points. Even with the tough compare, the BRICs had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 12%. 
We had particular strength in Russia and China. In fact, China was up over 20% this quarter, again gaining share. We're continuing to build our capabilities here. We've expanded a number of branch offices and now have 68 face-to-face and over 100 virtual branch offices open across all of China.
Across the growth markets this quarter, more than 30 countries grew at a double-digit growth rate, so our strength is broad-based. We're capturing the opportunity from these faster-growing economies and importantly, we're taking share, due in part to the acceleration of our market expansion initiative. In fact, this is our eighth consecutive quarter of share gains in the growth markets.
So now, let me add a little color to our revenue and gross margin by segment. For Total Services, both outsourcing and transactional revenues were up 1% at constant currency, and we're continuing to deliver strong growth in our growth markets countries. 
In Software, this quarter, we had good growth in our business analytics and storage management offerings. Our Systems and Technology revenue decline was roughly in line with our first quarter rate. This quarter, we again took share on POWER, driven by competitive displacements.
Turning to gross profit. Our operating gross margin improved 1.5 points, driven by a combination of solid margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative growth of Software.
Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile.  Our total operating expense and other income was down 6%. This is driven by currency for both translation and hedging dynamics. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 2 points of expense growth. And our base expense, excluding currency and acquisitions, was down 1 point. I'll comment on a couple of expense items.
First, though it wasn't a significant driver year-to-year, we had about $150 million of workforce rebalancing in the quarter, primarily in Europe. Second, we had the year-to-year benefit from our hedging programs, which, as you know, cannot be looked at in isolation as it mitigates the translation impacts across the P&L. 
We hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in our global cash planning.  Last year, hedging programs generated fairly significant losses and impact to expense of $195 million. While this year, the programs generated gains of about $85 million in expense. This represents over 3/4 of our hedging activity. The balance is in cost.
This is the dynamic you would expect given the year-to-year change in currencies. But again, this hedge activity mitigates translation impacts throughout the P&L.
So now, let me go into the segments.  The 2 Services segments delivered $14.7 billion in revenue, grew pretax profit by 18% and expanded pretax margin by 3 points. Backlog was $136 billion, down 6% year-to-year at actual rates and flat at constant currency. 
Overall, services revenue performance at constant currency was fairly consistent with last quarter. The growth markets were up 10% at constant currency with good backlog growth and the major markets were down 1% at constant currency.
Within the major markets, looking at revenue, North America was stable; Japan was still down, though we did see some improvement over last quarter; and Europe decelerated compared to last quarter. And we continued the strong performance in our business analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet offerings. Overall, profit performance was very strong, with 24% growth in Global Technology Services pretax profit and 7% growth in Global Business Services profit.
Moving onto the 2 segments.  In Global Technology Services, revenue was $10 billion, down 2% as reported and up 2% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 2% at constant currency.  Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 4% at constant currency with the growth markets up nearly 16% at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered very strong profit and margin, with pretax income up 24% and pretax margin up 3.6 points.
Last quarter, I commented on the tremendous amount of work that GTS has done to manage their large portfolio of outsourcing contracts. Specifically, by taking a disciplined approach to solving problems in a select set of lower margin contracts, this work continues to yield benefits in both profit and margin and accounted for about 1/3 of the gross margin expansion in GTS this quarter. Although there would be some modest impact to revenue from this work going forward, we should see ongoing benefits to the portfolio.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.7 billion, down 4% as reported and down 1% at constant currency. Consulting and systems integration revenues were flat year-to-year at constant currency and Application Outsourcing revenues declined 1% at constant currency.
Looking at revenue from a geographic perspective, the growth markets continued to perform well with their fifth consecutive quarter at 10% growth or better. North America was relatively stable while Japan was down. This quarter, revenue in Europe decreased 3% at constant currency after being flat last quarter.
Now looking at the growth initiatives. Within GBS, we have been remixing and shifting more resources to these higher value-growth initiatives. This quarter, GBS revenue included strong growth in business analytics, which was up 28% and Smarter Planet up 15%. But GBS value extended beyond what is reported in the GBS segment. They play a key role in driving the growth initiatives across IBM, where we are seeing continued strong performance. And finally, GBS returned to a more typical level of profitability as we indicated on our last call. So this quarter, pretax income grew 7% and pretax margin improved by 1.8 points.
Software revenue was $6.2 billion, was flat as reported and up 4% at constant currency. Key Branded Middleware, which accounted for 64% of total software revenue in the second quarter, increased 4% at constant currency, in line with the market.
Software performed well in the growth markets where revenue was up double digits, and Europe and Japan both grew at mid single digits, all in constant currency. Growth in the U.S. was impacted by a very tough compare. We see great opportunity in our Global Software business and are hiring 200 to 300 sales representatives each month through the year end.
Now let me take you through the drivers for a few of the brands.  WebSphere grew 7% at constant currency and gained share for the 15th consecutive quarter. Within WebSphere, we had good growth in commerce and portal offerings. This quarter, we acquired Tealeaf, a provider of customer experience management software, which enables our clients to analyze interactions on websites and mobile devices. 
Information Management was up 3% at constant currency and held share. Netezza continued to expand its global footprint with very strong growth in Europe, Japan and growth markets, and added nearly 70 new clients worldwide.
This quarter, we closed 2 more acquisitions, expanding our business analytics and optimization software capabilities: Varicent, an analytics software company that helps optimize sales performance management and Vivisimo, which enhances IBM's Big Data initiative by helping clients analyze volume, variety and velocity of Big Data for strategic advantage.
Tivoli software was up 6% at constant currency and gained share, driven by storage software growth of 13% at constant currency. Tivoli storage management continues to perform exceptionally well, growing double digits at constant currency for the sixth consecutive quarter. 
Within our security offerings, we're utilizing recent acquisitions such as Q1 Labs to provide end-to-end risk management solutions to protect our clients against the latest threats, while reducing the cost and complexity of security.
Turning to profit. Software pretax income grew 8% to $2.5 billion and pretax margins increased 2.7 points to 35.9%.
Systems and Technology revenue of $4.3 billion was down 9% or 7% at constant currency, following very strong growth across the portfolio a year ago. 
Systems z revenue declined 9% at constant currency and MIPS declined 8% with a mix towards specialty engines. Systems z profit margin was up again, which is typical at this point in the upgrade cycle.
POWER revenue was down 4% at constant currency this quarter. We had continued strength this quarter in POWER high-performance computing solutions. In June, IBM achieved the top speed rating in the world. And we earned 3 of the top 4 spots on the top 500 project, which ranks the world's most powerful computers.
We continued our success and competitive displacements in the second quarter, with over 320 displacements that drive over $265 million of business. As you would expect, these came from a combination of HP and Oracle/Sun. This initiative has helped drive our 17th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER.
System x revenue was down 5% at constant currency, our high-end segment grew double digits. Storage hardware revenue was flat at constant currency, with the value continuing to shift to software, as you saw with the ongoing success we're having in our Tivoli storage software offerings.
In the second quarter, we introduced and began shipping PureFlex, the first offering from our new PureSystems family of expert integrated systems. PureFlex optimizes workloads and drives hardware efficiencies. 
In the third quarter, the Pure application system will become available, and we expect volume shipments in the fourth quarter. Pure application will do for software what PureFlex does for hardware, by driving application efficiency and rapid deployment to enable faster time to value.
Turning to cash flow. We generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is up $300 million year-to-year. Over the last 12 months, we generated a record $18 billion in free cash flow. For the first half, our free cash flow of $5.5 billion was up $1.4 billion year-to-year. The growth was driven by net income.
As I've mentioned previously, in the first quarter of last year, our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments, driven by audit settlement activity. But even if you adjust for the prior year tax impact, we had double-digit growth in free cash flow.
Looking at the uses of our cash in the first half, we've spent almost $2 billion to acquire 8 companies, including Vivisimo, Varicent and Tealeaf, which closed in the second quarter.  We returned almost $8 billion to shareholders in the first half. We spent $6 billion in share repurchase to buy back almost 31 million shares. At the end of the second quarter, we had $9.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
We took our dividend up 13% in April. And through June, we paid out $1.8 billion. This is the 17th consecutive year that we've raised our dividend and the ninth year in a row of double-digit increases.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.2 billion. Total debt was $32.4 billion, of which $22.6 billion was in support of a financing business, which is leveraged at 7 to 1. Our nonfinancing debt was $9.8 billion, and our nonfinancing debt to cap was 36%.
We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long term.
So now let me start to wrap up with a summary of the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance this quarter. Once again, margin expansion was the largest contributor to growth, as our continued focus on productivity and mix to higher value drove improvement in gross, pretax and net margins year-to-year. An ongoing share repurchase program contributed to balance, at a level fairly consistent with last quarter.
This quarter, we delivered 14% EPS growth and $3.7 billion in free cash flow, despite facing a couple of headwinds. First, we had a strong second quarter last year with 12% revenue growth, so we had a challenging compare; and second, we're dealing with pretty significant currency dynamics, which impacted our revenue line by about $1 billion. But in spite of these, IBM's business model enabled our strong profit performance in the current environment.
Now let me comment on a few of the key elements of our model.  First, we have been investing to capture opportunities and deliver client value on high-growth markets, emerging countries, as well as our key growth initiatives. In the first half, our growth market country delivered 9% growth at constant currency. Our business analytics portfolio of services and offerings were up 13% in the first half, led by our GBS consulting practice. 
In cloud, we doubled last year's revenue with contribution from all areas, private cloud, public cloud and our industry-based solutions.
And in the first half, we had revenue growth of more than 20% in the Smarter Planet portfolio, driven by industry-specific solutions and our Smarter Commerce and Smarter Cities offerings. So we're getting real performance from the investments we're making in our growth initiatives.
Another important and unique aspect of our model is the balance between annuity business and transaction businesses. Our annuity businesses, which make up the majority of services and software and reflect our long-term relationship with our clients, provide a solid base of revenue, profit and cash.
Third, we have had underway for some time a series of initiatives to drive productivity. These are real structural changes that improve our business and margins over time on a sustained, durable basis. 
This quarter, we again expanded our margins. And this year, we'll make further progress towards delivering the productivity savings included in our road map.
Finally, we continue to grow our free cash flow and have a solid balance sheet, which allows us to invest in the business while returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.
So a combination of our strategy and our business model enable us to generate strong profit growth in the current environment. 
And now looking at our first half performance, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15.10, on track to at least $20 in 2015.
Now, Patricia and I will take your questions."

Absent from that with any commentary on the macroeconomic environment, and I'm wondering if you can comment on that, particularly in light of services performance. Because I think when we enter 2012, you said 70% of services revenue in 2012 will come from backlog, and that 70% will be up 3%. Well your Total Services business in the first half is tracking well below that. So perhaps, you can address the macroeconomic question in the context of the fact that the services revenue that you're generating this year appears to be very weak."

Let me start from a macro perspective for the second quarter. First of all, if you look at the kind of geographic breakdown, going first quarter to second quarter, Americas was up by 2%. In the first, it went to 1% in the s",736,"Okay, Toni, very good question. Let me start from a macro perspective for the second quarter. First of all, if you look at the kind of geographic breakdown, going first quarter to second quarter, Americas was up by 2%. In the first, it went to 1% in the second quarter. Really, that differential was due to the software compare that we had in the second quarter of last year. And if you look at the third quarter, just based on a compare basis, we'll pick up another 2.5 points. So I feel pretty confident about that content as we go into the third. Europe was up 1% in the first quarter, relatively flat in the second quarter. We'll talk about that a little more. In Asia, it went from plus 1% in the first quarter to up 4%, so real strength in Asia. If you look at the distribution of that performance across the month, it was relatively linear. In other words, it didn't have big fluctuations across the month. But if anything, it relatively strengthened as we went through the quarter. So June was a little stronger than the rest of the quarter. In some of our transactional businesses like our hardware-based business, in fact, we noticed that against typical -- rates of performance had a pretty darn good last week of the quarter, indicating momentum as we go into the third. So that's the way it gives kind of an overview. Now from a markets perspective, let's talk about the growth markets. They continued to perform well across the board. BRIC countries were up 12%. They represent about 1/3 of our overall growth market business. Within that, China was up a very impressive 24%. And I remind you, we now have opened our 68th face-to-face branch in China. We have over 100 virtual branches. Total growth markets outpaced the majors again by 9 points this quarter, up 8% on a constant currency basis. And within that, we had 32 countries up double digits. Every sector grew, every brand grew, software and services were up 10%. Our z business in the growth markets was up 11%. So I think this reflects a really kind of broad-based strong performance in those markets. Major markets, as you would expect, a little more mixed. I was going to spend a little time on Europe. Within Europe, we did see growth within U.K. and Spain, U.K. for the 11th quarter in a row; Spain, the seventh quarter. Germany was flat, and now this is the third quarter of either flat to modest growth out of Germany. But again, Italy and France were down. So kind of mixed performance within the European geography. Third, I kind of look at brand performance. So on a software base, we had strong performance in Europe and Asia. And in North America,  it was really, as I said earlier, kind of an issue of compares, which we can talk about a little later. Hardware, at this point in the cycle, no real surprises. And I said earlier, if anything, z did a little better job as it went through the quarter. Again, real strength in z, up 11% in growth markets. And services, I would say, really pretty consistent with last quarter. Now to your services point, if you do the math, we had said that opening backlog drives about 70% of revenue. So 70% of the 3% backlog runout would be about 2%. So if you look at GTS, certainly that -- a conform with that kind of relationship. In GBS, we were down 1%. We did see, in GBS, some improvement in Japan and public sector, but they were still down. Now within the GBS business, what I'd point out within the organizational structure, as we move resource from kind of historical big rollout, complex product structures that are oftentimes customed into our growth initiatives, you'll see some impact in that translation. But what we see in those growth initiatives within GBS, really strong growth performance, up double digit across the board within GBS. And likewise, within IBM, up strong double digit across the board, pulling with it about 50% software mix. Within that GBS content alone, the margins within those growth initiatives are about 3 points richer than the balance of the business, and that helped contribute to return to profit growth in the GBS in the second quarter, up 7%."

And that would imply, for the second half, about 10% EPS growth. Now within that EPS growth, it's reasonably distributed across both the third and the fourth quarter. If anything, a little skewed to the fourth quarter with the new product announcements. Currency, in the second half, it's going to be a headwind of about 4 to 5 points in the third quarter, 2 to 3 points in the fourth. And that spot rates, that would be a headwind for us, about $2 billion in the second half compared to the $1 billion that we just had in the second quarter. On a third quarter basis, I would say that our constant currency revenue growth should be approximately equal to what we saw in the dynamics in the first half of the year, with the fourth quarter really presenting opportunity for -- with our new announcements for additional growth. So back to your second half of the year question, we regard this really as an all-in forecast, we realized that we do have some tax headwind as we ended the third and the fourth quarter. The divestiture of our Retail Store systems business should generate a gain of about $450 million to $550 million in the second half. We do expect to close that shortly with the major countries really closing first. So the gain will be recognized as we close those countries and get the cash. And I would expect the bulk of that to happen in the third quarter. But based on country closing, some may extend in the fourth. Now as we've discussed a number of times in the past, when we get that cash inflow from a divestiture, we put that to good work to improve the productivity of our business, and that's why these divestitures are accretive to IBM. So consequently, we will also have workforce rebalancing in the second half, I expect slightly greater than the first half of 2012. Now that workforce rebalancing will be focused on our non-U.S. operations, very little really in the U.S. So all in all, we feel optimistic about our hand for the second half in spite of the headwinds that we see."

So first of all, in the context, as we go into the second half of the year for our Services business, we see strong profit growth across services from both the GTS and GBS organizations.

So first of all, in the context, as we go into the second half of the year for our Services business, we see strong profit growth across services from both the GTS and GBS organizations. So I think we have a very good had as we go into it. Now you know we run this business for profit and cash contribution. A couple of key dynamics within that, within GMU, we have very good margin performance in our business there. Our revenue in GMU, our growth markets unit is up 10%. That's 10 points faster than we see in the major markets. In fact, over time, that's driven our backlog to also be up 10% in our growth markets unit. Our transactional business -- if you look at the growth initiatives, cloud has more than doubled. So consequently, we see our backlog up 6%. We have growth in really 14 straight quarters in that transactional business. And I want to return again to the work that we're doing on an ongoing basis on productivity, because I think a lot of this is really leadership work on the core of our services organizations, especially the GTS content that we saw this quarter driving that 24% increase year-to-year. A lot of that is driven by automation and a partnering that they've done with research that gives us unique capability that I don't think you'd see in our competitors, as well as utilizing the global scale. But once again, I want to return to the work that we've been on the distribution of profitability in our contracts. So once again, if you imagine this as a normal curve distribution of the profitably within the services contracts, they did a very discreet piece of work on how to improve the value contribution and the context of those -- contracts in that weaker end of the distribution. And that contributed about 1/3 of that 24%. We should see that ongoing to some degree as we go through the year. And I think as we continue to work on that weaker side of the distribution and move actually the average to the right, it will continue to contribute. Again, if you want to put that in a context of backlog, to generate that same level of profitability in our Outsourcing business, our opening backlog this year would have needed to have been richer by about $5 billion to $10 billion. So once again, you can see how the impact of that work, how it is relative to the backlog, and I think it's very consistent with our overall objective to manage this business for profit and cash generation."

And so to start that, it seemed very logical, let's pick the contract that really in that left tail of the distribution contracts. So that was the first starting point that they took. And then they applied kind of leadership delivery content, real value-add content. And these are elements that when you apply them to the left-hand tail of the distribution, if you can move that average, it has tremendous impact.

Well, you can drive 11% growth in the substantial part of your business in those growth markets, it had new opportunities for us that obviously has substantial leverage in our business. So the z performance did improve. Some of that was back-end loaded in the quarter. And we did see, as I pointed out earlier that, that last week of the quarter, we saw an uptick in our STG business as we left the second, entering the third. On an x basis, they really did face a very tough compare last year. If you remember, they were 15% in 2011, so that really did contribute to a lot of it. The high end, we did have double-digit growth, and we've had double-digit growth on the high end for 8 of the last 9 quarters, including the second quarter. So as we go into the second half, we do have some very good content. The x series business will take advantage of their content within PureSystems, and they will be part of the move as we go into our second half announcements of volume rollout."

Secondly, in public, public was up 4%. And if you look underneath the public sector, government was up 4%; education was up 16%; and our health and life sciences business was up 3% for the 21st quarter of growth in that area. Within our public sector and education, we installed the fastest computer in the world in the Lawrence Livermore laboratory. So very good performance in public, and an indication on the kind of rollout our initiatives have had. In industrial, we were up 3%. That was highly driven by automotive. That was up 11%. And as you said, when you opened -- Financial Services was in line with IBM. Interestingly, within Financial Services, our growth markets unit was up 12%.

So if you look at the Software business -- let's first look at the performance we had in the non-U.S. business. So for Software outside of U.S., we had 4% growth in Europe. Now that's very, very good performance in my book in Europe in current conditions. In Japan, we had 6% growth in Software. In growth markets, we had 10% growth in Software. So all of those constant currency references, all strong performance from my perspective. All were meeting the objectives that we had set. The U.S. organization really faced just a difficult compare in last year. I mean that's kind of a function of their achievement. In the prior year, they were up 17%. So that 17% historical achievement drove the performance last year for the total software business of 10.5% growth. So as we look at the compare for the third quarter, that's about 8% growth. So we're going to pick up about 2.5 points just on the compare as the Software business moves into the third quarter. Now the other point I wanted to make is we're continuing to invest in the Software business in a very big way, acquisitions to drive and integrate with those solutions, continuing to hire 100 to 200 software reps every month. So we think, if anything, we have a very strong hand as we go into the second half. I think the first half performance was very, very good. And in the third quarter, we should see growth rates that were consistent with the first quarter performance."

One way to look at that relative mix is to look at it both from kind of a sector -- let's look at it from a sector standpoint, then let's look at from a brand standpoint, and then we'll look at the distributed across the growth within country. So fir",542,"Yes. One way to look at that relative mix is to look at it both from kind of a sector -- let's look at it from a sector standpoint, then let's look at from a brand standpoint, and then we'll look at the distributed across the growth within country. So first of all, if you look at the performance in the growth markets, I mean, I think for them to once again be stronger than we had seen in the major markets by 9 points -- and that's a trend line that we've seen in 2008, 2009, 2010. We've seen that for a long time. 2011, first half of this year, that has been a very, very consistent phenomena for us. And that if you look at the individual quarters, it's been pretty strong by individual quarters. Now if you look at the BRICs, the BRICs were up 12%. Within that, as I have said, China was up a very strong 24%. Russia was up very, very strong. Within that mix of business, we had real power within the z side of the house in China. But if you look at across the sector dimension and the brand dimension, I mean we have really strong growth in our sectors. Every single sector had growth, strong growth in the growth markets. We had very strong growth across every single brand. Our Software business grew double digits. Our Services business grew double digit within our STG content, with z growing 11%. And I remind you that it's just not constructed within the BRICs. That's about 1/3 of our business. So 2/3 of our business was also growing very, very well. And we had this double-digit growth phenomena across 32 countries. So I think the composition of our growth this quarter was balance across the sectors, was balance across the brands and indicative of both the BRIC countries and the broader view of the growth markets.
So with that, let me wrap up the call. Now I think our results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of IBM's business model, delivering profit and cash on a sustained basis. And despite currency headwinds and a tough top line compare, we delivered strong performance: 8% growth in profit, 14% growth in operating EPS, both in the quarter and for the first half. 
But I don't want you to miss what I consider to be the most important metric this quarter, and that's our cash performance. I mean we generated $18 billion of free cash flow over the last 12 months, and that's a milestone for IBM. 
Let me put that in perspective.  We generated $16.6 billion last year. 10 years ago, we generated just under $6 billion. So in the last decade, we've increased the level of free cash flow generation by 3x. And I think that's a real achievement, because it's that free cash flow that's in fact the fuel that we use to power this engine. So all of this gives us confidence to take up our expectation for the full year to at least $15.10 of operating EPS. That's up 12% from last year and on track to at least $20 in 2015.
So thanks for joining us. And now, as always, back to work."

In the second quarter, we reported $25.8 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins, delivered operating earnings per share of $3.51, up 14% year-to-year and generated free cash flow of $3.7 billion",2890,"Thank you for joining us today. In the second quarter, we reported $25.8 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins, delivered operating earnings per share of $3.51, up 14% year-to-year and generated free cash flow of $3.7 billion, up 9%. So when you look at it, our results demonstrate the strength of IBM's business model, which is designed to deliver profit and cash on a sustainable basis. 
Consistent with this performance, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15.10. This is up $0.10 from our previous view of at least $15. I'll comment on a couple of the second quarter highlights by segment.
In Software, we had mid single digits constant currency growth in Europe and Japan, double-digit growth in the growth markets, while the U.S. growth was lower due to very strong performance a year ago.
Services growth at constant currency was consistent with last quarter, with our annuity content providing a solid base of revenue and profit. Our backlog was flat year-to-year at constant currency, and we again expanded margins and grew our combined Services segment profit by 18%.
Our Hardware business declined, as you would expect at this point in our product cycles. Though we continue to extend our share leadership in our 2 high-end server brands.
In total, IBM's revenue growth at constant currency was fairly consistent with the first quarter. We ended the quarter with a currency headwind, but it got even tougher over the last 90 days. When you look at the reported revenue, currency impacted our revenue growth by almost 4 points or $1 billion of revenue. But in spite of this headwind, we generated strong operating performance, with pretax and net income each up 8%.
Now an important element of our long-term model is to expand margin through a combination of productivity and mix to higher margin businesses. This quarter, we expanded operating gross margin by 1.5 points, with 2/3 due to improvement in segment margins and the other 1/3 from mix. We improved operating PTI margins by more than 2 points and operating net margin by 1.6 points. So this quarter, again, we demonstrated the flexibility in our model. Bottom line, we delivered operating EPS of $3.51, which was up 14% year-to-year.
Turning to cash. We generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. That's up 9%, slightly faster than net income. When you consider the last 12 months, we've generated a record $18 billion of free cash flow. With this strong cash performance, we delivered significant returns to shareholders with $4 billion in share repurchases and dividends this quarter and nearly $17 billion over the last 12 months.
Now I'll get into the second quarter details starting with revenue by geography, where I'll discuss the results on a constant currency basis.
In the Americas, Canada was up while the U.S. again was flat year-to-year. EMEA was also flat year-to-year, slowing just 1 point from last quarter's growth rate but in total, still relatively stable. As in the past, there is a good bit of variability by country.
We had growth again in the U.K. and Spain, Germany was flat, while France and Italy declined. Overall, revenue in our major market countries was down 1% year-to-year. With 8% growth, our growth markets rate outpaced the major markets by 9 points. Even with the tough comparative, BRICs had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 12%. 
We had particular strength in Russia and China. In fact, China was up over 20% this quarter, again gaining share. We're continuing to build our capabilities here. We've expanded the number of branch offices and now have 68 face-to-face and over 100 virtual branch offices open across all of China.
Across the growth markets this quarter, more than 30 countries grew at a double-digit growth rate, so our strength is broad-based. We're capturing the opportunity from these faster-growing economies and importantly, we're taking share, due in part to the acceleration of our market expansion initiative. In fact, this is our eighth consecutive quarter of share gains in the growth markets.
So now, let me add a little color to our revenue and gross margin by segment. For Total Services, both outsourcing and transactional revenues were up 1% at constant currency and we're continuing to deliver strong growth in our growth markets countries. 
In Software this quarter, we had good growth in our business analytics and storage management offerings. Our Systems and Technology revenue decline was roughly in line with our first quarter rate. This quarter, we again took share on POWER, driven by competitive displacements.
Turning to gross profit, our operating gross margin improved 1.5 points, driven by a combination of solid margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative growth of Software.
Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile.  Our total operating expense and other income was down 6%. This is driven by currency for both translation and hedging dynamics. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 2 points of expense growth. And our base expense, excluding currency and acquisitions, was down 1 point. I'll comment on a couple of expense items.
First, though it wasn't a significant driver year-to-year, we had about $150 million of workforce rebalancing in the quarter, primarily in Europe. Second, we had the year-to-year benefit from our hedging programs which, as you know, cannot be looked at in isolation as it mitigates the translation impacts across the P&L. 
We hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in our global cash planning.  Last year, hedging programs generated fairly significant losses and impact to expense of $195 million while this year, the programs generated gains of about $85 million in expense. This represents over 3/4 of our hedging activity. The balance is in cost.
This is the dynamic you would expect given the year-to-year change in currencies. But again, this hedge activity mitigates translation impacts throughout the P&L.
So now, let me go into the segments.  The 2 Services segments delivered $14.7 billion in revenue, grew pretax profit by 18% and expanded pretax margin by 3 points. Backlog was $136 billion, down 6% year-to-year at actual rates and flat at constant currency. 
Overall, services revenue performance at constant currency was fairly consistent with last quarter. The growth markets were up 10% at constant currency with good backlog growth and the major markets were down 1% at constant currency.
Within the major markets, looking at revenue, North America was stable; Japan was still down, though we did see some improvement over last quarter; and Europe decelerated compared to last quarter. And we continued the strong performance in our business analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet offerings. Overall, profit performance was very strong, with 24% growth in Global Technology Services pretax profit and 7% growth in Global Business Services profit.
Moving onto the 2 segments.  In Global Technology Services, revenue was $10 billion, down 2% as reported and up 2% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 2% at constant currency.  Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 4% at constant currency with the growth markets up nearly 16% at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered very strong profit and margin, with pretax income up 24% and pretax margin up 3.6 points.
Last quarter, I commented on the tremendous amount of work that GTS has done to manage their large portfolio of outsourcing contracts. Specifically, by taking a disciplined approach to solving problems in a select set of lower margin contracts, this work continues to yield benefits in both profit and margin and accounted for about 1/3 of the gross margin expansion in GTS this quarter. Although there would be some modest impact to revenue from this work going forward, we should see ongoing benefits to the portfolio.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.7 billion, down 4% as reported and down 1% at constant currency. Consulting and systems integration revenues were flat year-to-year at constant currency and Application Outsourcing revenues declined 1% at constant currency.
Looking at revenue from a geographic perspective, the growth markets continued to perform well with their fifth consecutive quarter at 10% growth or better. North America was relatively stable while Japan was down. This quarter, revenue in Europe decreased 3% at constant currency after being flat last quarter.
Now looking at the growth initiatives. Within GBS, we have been remixing and shifting more resources to these higher value-growth initiatives. This quarter, GBS revenue included strong growth in business analytics, which was up 28% and Smarter Planet up 15%. But GBS value extended beyond what is reported in the GBS segment. They play a key role in driving the growth initiatives across IBM, where we are seeing continued strong performance. And finally, GBS returned to a more typical level of profitability as we indicated on our last call. So this quarter, pretax income grew 7% and pretax margin improved by 1.8 points.
Software revenue was $6.2 billion, was flat as reported and up 4% at constant currency. Key Branded Middleware, which accounted for 64% of total software revenue in the second quarter, increased 4% at constant currency, in line with the market.
Software performed well in the growth markets where revenue was up double digits, and Europe and Japan both grew at mid single digits, all in constant currency. Growth in the U.S. was impacted by a very tough compare. We see great opportunity in our Global Software business and are hiring 200 to 300 sales representatives each month through the year end.
Now let me take you through the drivers for a few of the brands.  WebSphere grew 7% at constant currency and gained share for the 15th consecutive quarter. Within WebSphere, we had good growth in commerce and portal offerings. This quarter we acquired Tealeaf, a provider of customer experience management software, which enables our clients to analyze interactions on websites and mobile devices. 
Information Management was up 3% at constant currency and held share. Netezza continued to expand its global footprint with very strong growth in Europe, Japan and growth markets and added nearly 70 new clients worldwide.
This quarter we closed 2 more acquisitions, expanding our business analytics and optimization software capabilities: Varicent, an analytics software company that helps optimize sales performance management and Vivisimo, which enhances IBM's Big Data initiative by helping clients analyze volume, variety and velocity of Big Data for strategic advantage.
Tivoli software was up 6% at constant currency and gained share, driven by storage software growth of 13% at constant currency. Tivoli storage management continues to perform exceptionally well, growing double digits at constant currency for the sixth consecutive quarter. 
Within our security offerings, we're utilizing recent acquisitions such as Q1 Labs to provide end-to-end risk management solutions to protect our clients against the latest threats, while reducing the cost and complexity of security.
Turning to profit, software pretax income grew 8% to $2.5 billion and pretax margins increased 2.7 points to 35.9%.
Systems and Technology revenue of $4.3 billion was down 9% or 7% at constant currency, following very strong growth across the portfolio a year ago. 
Systems z revenue declined 9% at constant currency and MIPS declined 8% with a mix towards specialty engines. Systems z profit margin was up again, which is typical at this point in the upgrade cycle.
POWER revenue was down 4% at constant currency this quarter. We had continued strength this quarter in POWER high-performance computing solutions. In June, IBM achieved the top speed rating in the world and we earned 3 of the top 4 spots on the top 500 project, which ranks the world's most powerful computers.
We continued our success and competitive displacements in the second quarter, with over 320 displacements that drive over $265 million of business. As you would expect, these came from a combination of HP and Oracle/Sun. This initiative has helped drive our 17th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER.
System x revenue was down 5% at constant currency, our high-end segment grew double digits. Storage hardware revenue was flat at constant currency, with the value continuing to shift to software, as you saw with the ongoing success we're having in our Tivoli storage software offerings.
In the second quarter, we introduced and began shipping PureFlex, the first offering from our new PureSystems family of expert integrated systems. PureFlex optimizes workloads and drives hardware efficiencies. 
In the third quarter, the Pure application system will become available and we expect volume shipments in the fourth quarter. Pure application will do for software what PureFlex does for hardware, by driving application efficiency and rapid deployment to enable faster time to value.
Turning to cash flow, we generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is up $300 million year-to-year. Over the last 12 months, we generated a record $18 billion in free cash flow. For the first half, our free cash flow of $5.5 billion was up $1.4 billion year-to-year. The growth was driven by net income.
As I've mentioned previously, in the first quarter of last year, our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments, driven by audit settlement activity. But even if you adjust for the prior year tax impact, we had double-digit growth in free cash flow.
Looking at the uses of our cash in the first half, we've spent almost $2 billion to acquire 8 companies, including Vivisimo, Varicent and Tealeaf, which closed in the second quarter.  We returned almost $8 billion to shareholders in the first half. We spent $6 billion in share repurchase to buy back almost 31 million shares. At the end of the second quarter, we had $9.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
We took our dividend up 13% in April and through June, we paid out $1.8 billion. This is the 17th consecutive year that we've raised our dividend and the ninth year in a row of double-digit increases.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.2 billion. Total debt was $32.4 billion, of which $22.6 billion was in support of a financing business, which is leveraged at 7 to 1. Our nonfinancing debt was $9.8 billion, and our nonfinancing debt to cap was 36%.
We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long term.
So now let me start to wrap up with a summary of the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance this quarter. Once again, margin expansion was the largest contributor to growth, as our continued focus on productivity and mix to higher value drove improvement in gross, pretax and net margins year-to-year. An ongoing share repurchase program contributed to balance, at a level fairly consistent with last quarter.
This quarter we delivered 14% EPS growth and $3.7 billion in free cash flow, despite facing a couple of headwinds. First, we had a strong second quarter last year with 12% revenue growth, so we had a challenging compare; and second, we're dealing with pretty significant currency dynamics which impacted our revenue line by about $1 billion. But in spite of these, IBM's business model enabled our strong profit performance in the current environment.
Now let me comment on a few of the key elements of our model. First, we have been investing to capture opportunities and deliver client value on high-growth markets, emerging countries, as well as our key growth initiatives. In the first half, our growth market countries delivered 9% growth at constant currency. Our business analytics portfolio of services and offerings were up 13% in the first half, led by our GBS consulting practice. 
In cloud, we doubled last year's revenue with contribution from all areas, private cloud, public cloud and our industry-based solutions.
And in the first half, we had revenue growth of more than 20% in the Smarter Planet portfolio, driven by industry-specific solutions and our Smarter Commerce and Smarter Cities offerings. So we're getting real performance from the investments we're making in our growth initiatives.
Another important and unique aspect of our model is the balance between annuity business and transaction businesses. Our annuity businesses, which make up the majority of services and software and reflect our long-term relationship with our clients, provide a solid base of revenue, profit and cash.
Third, we have had underway for some time a series of initiatives to drive productivity. These are real structural changes that improve our business and margins over time on a sustained, durable basis. 
This quarter, we again expanded our margins and this year, we'll make further progress towards delivering the productivity savings included in our road map.
Finally, we continue to grow our free cash flow and have a solid balance sheet, which allows us to invest in the business while returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.
So a combination of our strategy and our business model enable us to generate strong profit growth in the current environment. 
And now looking at our first half performance, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15.10, on track to at least $20 in 2015.
Now, Patricia and I will take your questions."

Absent from that with any commentary on the macroeconomic environment, and I'm wondering if you can comment on that, particularly in light of services performance. Because I think when we enter 2012, you said 70% of services revenue in 2012 will come from backlog, and that 70% will be up 3%. Well, your Total Services business in the first half is tracking well below that. So perhaps you can address the macroeconomic question in the context of the fact that the services revenue that you're generating this year appears to be very weak."

Let me start from a macro perspective for the second quarter. First of all, if you look at the kind of geographic breakdown, going first quarter to second quarter, Americas was up by 2%.

First of all, if you look at the kind of geographic breakdown, going first quarter to second quarter, Americas was up by 2%. In the first, it went to 1% in the second quarter. Really, that differential was due to the software compare that we had in the second quarter of last year. And if you look at the third quarter, just based on a compare basis, we'll pick up another 2.5 points. So I feel pretty confident about that content as we go into the third. Europe was up 1% in the first quarter, relatively flat in the second quarter. We'll talk about that a little more. In Asia, it went from plus 1% in the first quarter to up 4%, so real strength in Asia. If you look at the distribution of that performance across the month, it was relatively linear. In other words, it didn't have big fluctuations across the month. But if anything, it relatively strengthened as we went through the quarter. So June was a little stronger than the rest of the quarter. In some of our transactional businesses like our hardware-based business in fact, we noticed that against typical -- rates of performance had a pretty darn good last week of the quarter, indicating momentum as we go into the third. So that's the way I'd give kind of an overview. Now from a markets perspective, let's talk about the growth markets. They continued to perform well across the board. BRIC countries were up 12%. They represent about 1/3 of our overall growth market business. Within that, China was up a very impressive 24%. And I remind you, we now have opened our 68th face-to-face branch in China. We have over 100 virtual branches. Total growth markets outpaced the majors again by 9 points this quarter, up 8% on a constant currency basis. And within that, we had 32 countries up double digits. Every sector grew, every brand grew, software and services were up 10%. Our z business in the growth markets was up 11%. So I think this reflects a really kind of broad-based strong performance in those markets. Major markets, as you would expect, a little more mixed. I was going to spend a little time on Europe. Within Europe, we did see growth within U.K. and Spain, U.K. for the 11th quarter in a row; Spain, the seventh quarter. Germany was flat, and now this is the third quarter of either flat to modest growth out of Germany. But again, Italy and France were down. So kind of mixed performance within the European geography. Third, I kind of look at brand performance. So on a software base, we had strong performance in Europe and Asia. And in North America it was really, as I said earlier, kind of an issue of compares, which we can talk about a little later. Hardware, at this point in the cycle, no real surprises. And I said earlier, if anything, z did a little better job as it went through the quarter. Again, real strength in z, up 11% in growth markets. And services, I would say really pretty consistent with last quarter. Now to your services point, if you do the math, we had said that opening backlog drives about 70% of revenue. So 70% of the 3% backlog runout would be about 2%. So if you look at GTS, certainly that conformed conform with that kind of relationship. In GBS, we were down 1%. We did see, in GBS, some improvement in Japan and public sector, but they were still down. Now within the GBS business, what I'd point out within the organizational structure, as we move resource from kind of historical big rollout, complex product structures that are oftentimes custom into our growth initiatives, you'll see some impact in that translation. But what we see in those growth initiatives within GBS, really strong growth performance, up double digit across the board within GBS. And likewise, within IBM, up strong double digit across the board, pulling with it about 50% software mix. Within that GBS content alone, the margins within those growth initiatives are about 3 points richer than the balance of the business, and that helped contribute to return to profit growth in the GBS in the second quarter, up 7%."

And that would imply, for the second half, about 10% EPS growth. Now within that EPS growth, it's reasonably distributed across both the third and the fourth quarter. If anything, a little skewed to the fourth quarter with the new product announcements. Currency, in the second half, is going to be a headwind of about 4 to 5 points in the third quarter, 2 to 3 points in the fourth. And that spot rates, that would be a headwind for us, about $2 billion in the second half compared to the $1 billion that we just had in the second quarter. On a third quarter basis, I would say that our constant currency revenue growth should be approximately equal to what we saw in the dynamics in the first half of the year, with the fourth quarter really presenting opportunity for -- with our new announcements for additional growth. So back to your second half of your question, we regard this really as an all-in forecast. We realize that we do have some tax headwind as we entered the third and the fourth quarter. The divestiture of our Retail Store systems business should generate a gain of about $450 million to $550 million in the second half. We do expect to close that shortly with the major countries really closing first. So the gain will be recognized as we close those countries and get the cash. And I would expect the bulk of that to happen in the third quarter. But based on country closing, some may extend in the fourth. Now as we've discussed a number of times in the past, when we get that cash inflow from a divestiture, we put that to good work to improve the productivity of our business, and that's why these divestitures are accretive to IBM. So consequently, we will also have workforce rebalancing in the second half, I expect slightly greater than the first half of 2012. Now that workforce rebalancing will be focused on our non-U.S. operations, very little really of it in the U.S. So all in all, we feel optimistic about our hand for the second half in spite of the headwinds that we see."

So first of all in the context, as we go into the second half of the year for our Services business, we see strong profit growth across services from both the GTS and GBS organizations. So I think we have a very good had as we go in",445,"Sure, absolutely, Ben. So first of all in the context, as we go into the second half of the year for our Services business, we see strong profit growth across services from both the GTS and GBS organizations. So I think we have a very good had as we go into it. Now you know we run this business for profit and cash contribution. A couple of key dynamics within that, within GMU, we have very good margin performance in our business there. Our revenue in GMU, our growth markets unit is up 10%. That's 10 points faster than we see in the major markets. In fact over time, that's driven our backlog to also be up 10% in our growth markets unit. Our transactional business -- if you look at the growth initiatives, cloud has more than doubled. So consequently, we see our backlog up 6%. We have growth in really 14 straight quarters in that transactional business. And I want to return again to the work that we're doing on an ongoing basis on productivity, because I think a lot of this is really leadership work on the core of our services organizations, especially the GTS content that we saw this quarter driving that 24% increase year-to-year. A lot of that is driven by automation and the partnering that they've done with research that gives us unique capability that I don't think you'd see in our competitors, as well as utilizing the global scale. But once again, I want to return to the work that we've done on the distribution of profitability in our contracts. So once again, if you imagine this as a normal curve distribution of the profitably within the services contracts, they did a very discreet piece of work on how to improve the value contribution and the context of those -- contracts in that weaker end of the distribution, and that contributed about 1/3 of that 24%. We should see that ongoing to some degree as we go through the year and I think as we continue to work on that weaker side of the distribution and move actually the average to the right, it will continue to contribute. Again, if you wanted to put that in a context of backlog, to generate that same level of profitability in our Outsourcing business, our opening backlog this year would have needed to have been richer by about $5 billion to $10 billion. So once again, you can see how the impact of that work, how it is relative to the backlog and I think it's very consistent with our overall objective to manage this business for profit and cash generation."

So -- and the objective was, we do so much work in driving our competitive position on the engagement, what can we do to really help drive our level of productivity on an ongoing basis as well? And so to start that it seemed very logical, let's pick the contract that really in that left tail of the distribution contracts. So that was the first starting point that they took. And then they applied kind of leadership delivery content, real value-add content. And these are elements that when you apply them to the left-hand tail of the distribution, if you can move that average, it has tremendous impact. So I think that approach, that approach of really, on an ongoing basis, working hard to apply better value contribution to drive that margin is something that we can continue to apply both in our GTS and GBS businesses.

Well, if you can drive 11% growth in the substantial part of your business in those growth markets that have new opportunities for us, that obviously has substantial leverage in our business. So the z performance did improve. Some of that was back-end loaded in the quarter and we did see, as I pointed out earlier that, that last week of the quarter we saw an uptick in our STG business as we left the second, entering the third. On an x basis, they really did face a very tough compare last year. If you remember, they were up 15% in 2011, so I think that really did contribute to a lot of it. The high end, we did have double-digit growth and we've had double-digit growth on the high end for 8 of the last 9 quarters, including the second quarter. So as we go into the second half, we do have some very good content.

So if you look at General Business, GB, I mean that was up 5%. Frankly, within GB, we have really 60% of our Smarter Planet references. So it's a pretty strong sector in its own right, but is also a good vehicle for many of our growth initiatives. And that plus 5% is representative of 10 consecutive quarters of growth. Secondly in public, public was up 4%. And if you look underneath the public sector, government was up 4%; education was up 16%; and our health and life sciences business was up 3% for the 21st quarter of growth in that area. Within our public sector and education, we installed the fastest computer in the world in the Lawrence Livermore laboratory. So very good performance in public, and an indication on the kind of rollout our initiatives have had. In industrial, we were up 3%. That was highly driven by automotive. That was up 11%. And as you said, when you opened -- Financial Services was in line with IBM. Interestingly within Financial Services, our growth markets unit was up 12%. So really, really strong performance in the Financial Services in our growth markets business."

So if you look at the Software business -- let's first look at the performance we had in the non-U.S. business. So for Software outside of U.S., we had 4% growth in Europe. Now that's very, very good performance in my book in Europe in current conditions. In Japan, we had 6% growth in Software. In growth markets, we had 10% growth in Software. So all of those constant currency references, all strong performance from my perspective, all were meeting the objectives that we had set. The U.S. organization really faced just a difficult compare in last year. I mean that's kind of a function of their achievement. In the prior year, they were up 17%. So that 17% historical achievement drove the performance last year for the total software business of 10.5% growth. So as we look at the compare for the third quarter, that's about 8% growth. So we're going to pick up about 2.5 points just on the compare as the Software business moves into the third quarter. Now the other point I wanted to make is we're continuing to invest in the Software business in a very big way, acquisitions to drive and integrate with those solutions, continuing to hire 100 to 200 software reps every month. So we think if anything, we have a very strong hand as we go into the second half. I think the first half performance was very, very good. And in the third quarter, we should see growth rates that were consistent with the first quarter performance."

One way to look at that relative mix is to look at it both from kind of a sector -- let's look at it from a sector standpoint, then let's look at it from a brand standpoint and then we'll look at the distributed across the growth within country. So f",543,"Yes. One way to look at that relative mix is to look at it both from kind of a sector -- let's look at it from a sector standpoint, then let's look at it from a brand standpoint and then we'll look at the distributed across the growth within country. So first of all, if you look at the performance in the growth markets, I mean, I think for them to once again be stronger than we had seen in the major markets by 9 points -- and that's a trend line that we've seen in 2008, 2009, 2010. We've seen that for a long time. 2011, first half of this year, that has been a very, very consistent phenomena for us. And that if you look at the individual quarters, it's been pretty strong by individual quarters. Now if you look at the BRICs, the BRICs were up 12%. Within that, as I have said, China was up a very strong 24%. Russia was up very, very strong. Within that mix of business, we had real power within the z side of the house in China. But if you look at across the sector dimension and the brand dimension, I mean we had really strong growth in our sectors. Every single sector had growth, strong growth in the growth markets. We had very strong growth across every single brand. Our Software business grew double digits. Our Services business grew double digit within our STG content, with z growing 11%. And I remind you that it's just not constructed within the BRICs, that's about 1/3 of our business. So 2/3 of our business was also growing very, very well. And we had this double-digit growth phenomena across 32 countries. So I think the composition of our growth this quarter was balanced across the sectors, was balanced across the brands and indicative of both the BRIC countries and the broader view of the growth markets.
So with that, let me wrap up the call. Now I think our results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of IBM's business model, delivering profit and cash on a sustained basis. And despite currency headwinds and a tough top line compare, we delivered strong performance: 8% growth in profit, 14% growth in operating EPS, both in the quarter and for the first half. 
But I don't want you to miss what I consider to be the most important metric this quarter, and that's our cash performance. I mean we generated $18 billion of free cash flow over the last 12 months, and that's a milestone for IBM. 
Let me put that in perspective. We generated $16.6 billion last year. 10 years ago, we generated just under $6 billion. So in the last decade, we've increased the level of free cash flow generation by 3x. And I think that's a real achievement, because it's that free cash flow that's in fact the fuel that we use to power this engine. So all of this gives us confidence to take up our expectation for the full year to at least $15.10 of operating EPS. That's up 12% from last year and on track to at least $20 in 2015.
So thanks for joining us. And now, as always, back to work."

In the second quarter, we reported $25.8 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins, delivered operating earnings per share of $3.51, up 14% year-to-year and generated free cash flow of $3.7 billion",2890,"Thank you for joining us today. In the second quarter, we reported $25.8 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins, delivered operating earnings per share of $3.51, up 14% year-to-year and generated free cash flow of $3.7 billion, up 9%. So when you look at it, our results demonstrate the strength of IBM's business model, which is designed to deliver profit and cash on a sustainable basis. 
Consistent with this performance, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15.10. This is up $0.10 from our previous view of at least $15. I'll comment on a couple of the second quarter highlights by segment.
In Software, we had mid single digits constant currency growth in Europe and Japan, double-digit growth in the growth markets, while the U.S. growth was lower due to very strong performance a year ago.
Services growth at constant currency was consistent with last quarter, with our annuity content providing a solid base of revenue and profit. Our backlog was flat year-to-year at constant currency, and we again expanded margins and grew our combined Services segment profit by 18%.
Our Hardware business declined, as you would expect at this point in our product cycles. Though we continue to extend our share leadership in our 2 high-end server brands.
In total, IBM's revenue growth at constant currency was fairly consistent with the first quarter. We ended the quarter with a currency headwind, but it got even tougher over the last 90 days. When you look at the reported revenue, currency impacted our revenue growth by almost 4 points or $1 billion of revenue. But in spite of this headwind, we generated strong operating performance, with pretax and net income each up 8%.
Now an important element of our long-term model is to expand margin through a combination of productivity and mix to higher margin businesses. This quarter, we expanded operating gross margin by 1.5 points, with 2/3 due to improvement in segment margins and the other 1/3 from mix. We improved operating PTI margins by more than 2 points and operating net margin by 1.6 points. So this quarter, again, we demonstrated the flexibility in our model. Bottom line, we delivered operating EPS of $3.51, which was up 14% year-to-year.
Turning to cash. We generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. That's up 9%, slightly faster than net income. When you consider the last 12 months, we've generated a record $18 billion of free cash flow. With this strong cash performance, we delivered significant returns to shareholders with $4 billion in share repurchases and dividends this quarter and nearly $17 billion over the last 12 months.
Now I'll get into the second quarter details starting with revenue by geography, where I'll discuss the results on a constant currency basis.
In the Americas, Canada was up while the U.S. again was flat year-to-year. EMEA was also flat year-to-year, slowing just 1 point from last quarter's growth rate but in total, still relatively stable. As in the past, there is a good bit of variability by country.
We had growth again in the U.K. and Spain, Germany was flat, while France and Italy declined. Overall, revenue in our major market countries was down 1% year-to-year. With 8% growth, our growth markets rate outpaced the major markets by 9 points. Even with the tough comparative, BRICs had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 12%. 
We had particular strength in Russia and China. In fact, China was up over 20% this quarter, again gaining share. We're continuing to build our capabilities here. We've expanded the number of branch offices and now have 68 face-to-face and over 100 virtual branch offices open across all of China.
Across the growth markets this quarter, more than 30 countries grew at a double-digit growth rate, so our strength is broad-based. We're capturing the opportunity from these faster-growing economies and importantly, we're taking share, due in part to the acceleration of our market expansion initiative. In fact, this is our eighth consecutive quarter of share gains in the growth markets.
So now, let me add a little color to our revenue and gross margin by segment. For Total Services, both outsourcing and transactional revenues were up 1% at constant currency and we're continuing to deliver strong growth in our growth markets countries. 
In Software this quarter, we had good growth in our business analytics and storage management offerings. Our Systems and Technology revenue decline was roughly in line with our first quarter rate. This quarter, we again took share on POWER, driven by competitive displacements.
Turning to gross profit, our operating gross margin improved 1.5 points, driven by a combination of solid margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative growth of Software.
Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile.  Our total operating expense and other income was down 6%. This is driven by currency for both translation and hedging dynamics. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 2 points of expense growth. And our base expense, excluding currency and acquisitions, was down 1 point. I'll comment on a couple of expense items.
First, though it wasn't a significant driver year-to-year, we had about $150 million of workforce rebalancing in the quarter, primarily in Europe. Second, we had the year-to-year benefit from our hedging programs which, as you know, cannot be looked at in isolation as it mitigates the translation impacts across the P&L. 
We hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in our global cash planning.  Last year, hedging programs generated fairly significant losses and impact to expense of $195 million while this year, the programs generated gains of about $85 million in expense. This represents over 3/4 of our hedging activity. The balance is in cost.
This is the dynamic you would expect given the year-to-year change in currencies. But again, this hedge activity mitigates translation impacts throughout the P&L.
So now, let me go into the segments.  The 2 Services segments delivered $14.7 billion in revenue, grew pretax profit by 18% and expanded pretax margin by 3 points. Backlog was $136 billion, down 6% year-to-year at actual rates and flat at constant currency. 
Overall, services revenue performance at constant currency was fairly consistent with last quarter. The growth markets were up 10% at constant currency with good backlog growth and the major markets were down 1% at constant currency.
Within the major markets, looking at revenue, North America was stable; Japan was still down, though we did see some improvement over last quarter; and Europe decelerated compared to last quarter. And we continued the strong performance in our business analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet offerings. Overall, profit performance was very strong, with 24% growth in Global Technology Services pretax profit and 7% growth in Global Business Services profit.
Moving onto the 2 segments.  In Global Technology Services, revenue was $10 billion, down 2% as reported and up 2% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 2% at constant currency.  Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 4% at constant currency with the growth markets up nearly 16% at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered very strong profit and margin, with pretax income up 24% and pretax margin up 3.6 points.
Last quarter, I commented on the tremendous amount of work that GTS has done to manage their large portfolio of outsourcing contracts. Specifically, by taking a disciplined approach to solving problems in a select set of lower margin contracts, this work continues to yield benefits in both profit and margin and accounted for about 1/3 of the gross margin expansion in GTS this quarter. Although there would be some modest impact to revenue from this work going forward, we should see ongoing benefits to the portfolio.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.7 billion, down 4% as reported and down 1% at constant currency. Consulting and systems integration revenues were flat year-to-year at constant currency and Application Outsourcing revenues declined 1% at constant currency.
Looking at revenue from a geographic perspective, the growth markets continued to perform well with their fifth consecutive quarter at 10% growth or better. North America was relatively stable while Japan was down. This quarter, revenue in Europe decreased 3% at constant currency after being flat last quarter.
Now looking at the growth initiatives. Within GBS, we have been remixing and shifting more resources to these higher value-growth initiatives. This quarter, GBS revenue included strong growth in business analytics, which was up 28% and Smarter Planet up 15%. But GBS value extended beyond what is reported in the GBS segment. They play a key role in driving the growth initiatives across IBM, where we are seeing continued strong performance. And finally, GBS returned to a more typical level of profitability as we indicated on our last call. So this quarter, pretax income grew 7% and pretax margin improved by 1.8 points.
Software revenue was $6.2 billion, was flat as reported and up 4% at constant currency. Key Branded Middleware, which accounted for 64% of total software revenue in the second quarter, increased 4% at constant currency, in line with the market.
Software performed well in the growth markets where revenue was up double digits, and Europe and Japan both grew at mid single digits, all in constant currency. Growth in the U.S. was impacted by a very tough compare. We see great opportunity in our Global Software business and are hiring 200 to 300 sales representatives each month through the year end.
Now let me take you through the drivers for a few of the brands.  WebSphere grew 7% at constant currency and gained share for the 15th consecutive quarter. Within WebSphere, we had good growth in commerce and portal offerings. This quarter we acquired Tealeaf, a provider of customer experience management software, which enables our clients to analyze interactions on websites and mobile devices. 
Information Management was up 3% at constant currency and held share. Netezza continued to expand its global footprint with very strong growth in Europe, Japan and growth markets and added nearly 70 new clients worldwide.
This quarter we closed 2 more acquisitions, expanding our business analytics and optimization software capabilities: Varicent, an analytics software company that helps optimize sales performance management and Vivisimo, which enhances IBM's Big Data initiative by helping clients analyze volume, variety and velocity of Big Data for strategic advantage.
Tivoli software was up 6% at constant currency and gained share, driven by storage software growth of 13% at constant currency. Tivoli storage management continues to perform exceptionally well, growing double digits at constant currency for the sixth consecutive quarter. 
Within our security offerings, we're utilizing recent acquisitions such as Q1 Labs to provide end-to-end risk management solutions to protect our clients against the latest threats, while reducing the cost and complexity of security.
Turning to profit, software pretax income grew 8% to $2.5 billion and pretax margins increased 2.7 points to 35.9%.
Systems and Technology revenue of $4.3 billion was down 9% or 7% at constant currency, following very strong growth across the portfolio a year ago. 
Systems z revenue declined 9% at constant currency and MIPS declined 8% with a mix towards specialty engines. Systems z profit margin was up again, which is typical at this point in the upgrade cycle.
POWER revenue was down 4% at constant currency this quarter. We had continued strength this quarter in POWER high-performance computing solutions. In June, IBM achieved the top speed rating in the world and we earned 3 of the top 4 spots on the top 500 project, which ranks the world's most powerful computers.
We continued our success and competitive displacements in the second quarter, with over 320 displacements that drive over $265 million of business. As you would expect, these came from a combination of HP and Oracle/Sun. This initiative has helped drive our 17th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER.
System x revenue was down 5% at constant currency, our high-end segment grew double digits. Storage hardware revenue was flat at constant currency, with the value continuing to shift to software, as you saw with the ongoing success we're having in our Tivoli storage software offerings.
In the second quarter, we introduced and began shipping PureFlex, the first offering from our new PureSystems family of expert integrated systems. PureFlex optimizes workloads and drives hardware efficiencies. 
In the third quarter, the Pure application system will become available and we expect volume shipments in the fourth quarter. Pure application will do for software what PureFlex does for hardware, by driving application efficiency and rapid deployment to enable faster time to value.
Turning to cash flow, we generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is up $300 million year-to-year. Over the last 12 months, we generated a record $18 billion in free cash flow. For the first half, our free cash flow of $5.5 billion was up $1.4 billion year-to-year. The growth was driven by net income.
As I've mentioned previously, in the first quarter of last year, our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments, driven by audit settlement activity. But even if you adjust for the prior year tax impact, we had double-digit growth in free cash flow.
Looking at the uses of our cash in the first half, we've spent almost $2 billion to acquire 8 companies, including Vivisimo, Varicent and Tealeaf, which closed in the second quarter.  We returned almost $8 billion to shareholders in the first half. We spent $6 billion in share repurchase to buy back almost 31 million shares. At the end of the second quarter, we had $9.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
We took our dividend up 13% in April and through June, we paid out $1.8 billion. This is the 17th consecutive year that we've raised our dividend and the ninth year in a row of double-digit increases.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.2 billion. Total debt was $32.4 billion, of which $22.6 billion was in support of a financing business, which is leveraged at 7 to 1. Our nonfinancing debt was $9.8 billion, and our nonfinancing debt to cap was 36%.
We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long term.
So now let me start to wrap up with a summary of the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance this quarter. Once again, margin expansion was the largest contributor to growth, as our continued focus on productivity and mix to higher value drove improvement in gross, pretax and net margins year-to-year. An ongoing share repurchase program contributed to balance, at a level fairly consistent with last quarter.
This quarter we delivered 14% EPS growth and $3.7 billion in free cash flow, despite facing a couple of headwinds. First, we had a strong second quarter last year with 12% revenue growth, so we had a challenging compare; and second, we're dealing with pretty significant currency dynamics which impacted our revenue line by about $1 billion. But in spite of these, IBM's business model enabled our strong profit performance in the current environment.
Now let me comment on a few of the key elements of our model. First, we have been investing to capture opportunities and deliver client value on high-growth markets, emerging countries, as well as our key growth initiatives. In the first half, our growth market countries delivered 9% growth at constant currency. Our business analytics portfolio of services and offerings were up 13% in the first half, led by our GBS consulting practice. 
In cloud, we doubled last year's revenue with contribution from all areas, private cloud, public cloud and our industry-based solutions.
And in the first half, we had revenue growth of more than 20% in the Smarter Planet portfolio, driven by industry-specific solutions and our Smarter Commerce and Smarter Cities offerings. So we're getting real performance from the investments we're making in our growth initiatives.
Another important and unique aspect of our model is the balance between annuity business and transaction businesses. Our annuity businesses, which make up the majority of services and software and reflect our long-term relationship with our clients, provide a solid base of revenue, profit and cash.
Third, we have had underway for some time a series of initiatives to drive productivity. These are real structural changes that improve our business and margins over time on a sustained, durable basis. 
This quarter, we again expanded our margins and this year, we'll make further progress towards delivering the productivity savings included in our road map.
Finally, we continue to grow our free cash flow and have a solid balance sheet, which allows us to invest in the business while returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.
So a combination of our strategy and our business model enable us to generate strong profit growth in the current environment. 
And now looking at our first half performance, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15.10, on track to at least $20 in 2015.
Now, Patricia and I will take your questions."

Absent from that with any commentary on the macroeconomic environment, and I'm wondering if you can comment on that, particularly in light of services performance. Because I think when we enter 2012, you said 70% of services revenue in 2012 will come from backlog, and that 70% will be up 3%. Well, your Total Services business in the first half is tracking well below that. So perhaps you can address the macroeconomic question in the context of the fact that the services revenue that you're generating this year appears to be very weak."

Let me start from a macro perspective for the second quarter. First of all, if you look at the kind of geographic breakdown, going first quarter to second quarter, Americas was up by 2%. In the first, it went to 1% in the s",735,"Okay, Toni, very good question. Let me start from a macro perspective for the second quarter. First of all, if you look at the kind of geographic breakdown, going first quarter to second quarter, Americas was up by 2%. In the first, it went to 1% in the second quarter. Really, that differential was due to the software compare that we had in the second quarter of last year. And if you look at the third quarter, just based on a compare basis, we'll pick up another 2.5 points. So I feel pretty confident about that content as we go into the third. Europe was up 1% in the first quarter, relatively flat in the second quarter. We'll talk about that a little more. In Asia, it went from plus 1% in the first quarter to up 4%, so real strength in Asia. If you look at the distribution of that performance across the month, it was relatively linear. In other words, it didn't have big fluctuations across the month. But if anything, it relatively strengthened as we went through the quarter. So June was a little stronger than the rest of the quarter. In some of our transactional businesses like our hardware-based business in fact, we noticed that against typical -- rates of performance had a pretty darn good last week of the quarter, indicating momentum as we go into the third. So that's the way I'd give kind of an overview. Now from a markets perspective, let's talk about the growth markets. They continued to perform well across the board. BRIC countries were up 12%. They represent about 1/3 of our overall growth market business. Within that, China was up a very impressive 24%. And I remind you, we now have opened our 68th face-to-face branch in China. We have over 100 virtual branches. Total growth markets outpaced the majors again by 9 points this quarter, up 8% on a constant currency basis. And within that, we had 32 countries up double digits. Every sector grew, every brand grew, software and services were up 10%. Our z business in the growth markets was up 11%. So I think this reflects a really kind of broad-based strong performance in those markets. Major markets, as you would expect, a little more mixed. I was going to spend a little time on Europe. Within Europe, we did see growth within U.K. and Spain, U.K. for the 11th quarter in a row; Spain, the seventh quarter. Germany was flat, and now this is the third quarter of either flat to modest growth out of Germany. But again, Italy and France were down. So kind of mixed performance within the European geography. Third, I kind of look at brand performance. So on a software base, we had strong performance in Europe and Asia. And in North America it was really, as I said earlier, kind of an issue of compares, which we can talk about a little later. Hardware, at this point in the cycle, no real surprises. And I said earlier, if anything, z did a little better job as it went through the quarter. Again, real strength in z, up 11% in growth markets. And services, I would say really pretty consistent with last quarter. Now to your services point, if you do the math, we had said that opening backlog drives about 70% of revenue. So 70% of the 3% backlog runout would be about 2%. So if you look at GTS, certainly that conformed conform with that kind of relationship. In GBS, we were down 1%. We did see, in GBS, some improvement in Japan and public sector, but they were still down. Now within the GBS business, what I'd point out within the organizational structure, as we move resource from kind of historical big rollout, complex product structures that are oftentimes custom into our growth initiatives, you'll see some impact in that translation. But what we see in those growth initiatives within GBS, really strong growth performance, up double digit across the board within GBS. And likewise, within IBM, up strong double digit across the board, pulling with it about 50% software mix. Within that GBS content alone, the margins within those growth initiatives are about 3 points richer than the balance of the business, and that helped contribute to return to profit growth in the GBS in the second quarter, up 7%."

And that would imply, for the second half, about 10% EPS growth. Now within that EPS growth, it's reasonably distributed across both the third and the fourth quarter. If anything, a little skewed to the fourth quarter with the new product announcements. Currency, in the second half, is going to be a headwind of about 4 to 5 points in the third quarter, 2 to 3 points in the fourth. And that spot rates, that would be a headwind for us, about $2 billion in the second half compared to the $1 billion that we just had in the second quarter. On a third quarter basis, I would say that our constant currency revenue growth should be approximately equal to what we saw in the dynamics in the first half of the year, with the fourth quarter really presenting opportunity for -- with our new announcements for additional growth. So back to your second half of your question, we regard this really as an all-in forecast. We realize that we do have some tax headwind as we entered the third and the fourth quarter. The divestiture of our Retail Store systems business should generate a gain of about $450 million to $550 million in the second half. We do expect to close that shortly with the major countries really closing first. So the gain will be recognized as we close those countries and get the cash. And I would expect the bulk of that to happen in the third quarter. But based on country closing, some may extend in the fourth. Now as we've discussed a number of times in the past, when we get that cash inflow from a divestiture, we put that to good work to improve the productivity of our business, and that's why these divestitures are accretive to IBM. So consequently, we will also have workforce rebalancing in the second half, I expect slightly greater than the first half of 2012. Now that workforce rebalancing will be focused on our non-U.S. operations, very little really of it in the U.S. So all in all, we feel optimistic about our hand for the second half in spite of the headwinds that we see."

So first of all in the context, as we go into the second half of the year for our Services business, we see strong profit growth across services from both the GTS and GBS organizations. So I think we have a very good had as we go in",445,"Sure, absolutely, Ben. So first of all in the context, as we go into the second half of the year for our Services business, we see strong profit growth across services from both the GTS and GBS organizations. So I think we have a very good had as we go into it. Now you know we run this business for profit and cash contribution. A couple of key dynamics within that, within GMU, we have very good margin performance in our business there. Our revenue in GMU, our growth markets unit is up 10%. That's 10 points faster than we see in the major markets. In fact over time, that's driven our backlog to also be up 10% in our growth markets unit. Our transactional business -- if you look at the growth initiatives, cloud has more than doubled. So consequently, we see our backlog up 6%. We have growth in really 14 straight quarters in that transactional business. And I want to return again to the work that we're doing on an ongoing basis on productivity, because I think a lot of this is really leadership work on the core of our services organizations, especially the GTS content that we saw this quarter driving that 24% increase year-to-year. A lot of that is driven by automation and the partnering that they've done with research that gives us unique capability that I don't think you'd see in our competitors, as well as utilizing the global scale. But once again, I want to return to the work that we've done on the distribution of profitability in our contracts. So once again, if you imagine this as a normal curve distribution of the profitably within the services contracts, they did a very discreet piece of work on how to improve the value contribution and the context of those -- contracts in that weaker end of the distribution, and that contributed about 1/3 of that 24%. We should see that ongoing to some degree as we go through the year and I think as we continue to work on that weaker side of the distribution and move actually the average to the right, it will continue to contribute. Again, if you wanted to put that in a context of backlog, to generate that same level of profitability in our Outsourcing business, our opening backlog this year would have needed to have been richer by about $5 billion to $10 billion. So once again, you can see how the impact of that work, how it is relative to the backlog and I think it's very consistent with our overall objective to manage this business for profit and cash generation."

So -- and the objective was, we do so much work in driving our competitive position on the engagement, what can we do to really help drive our level of productivity on an ongoing basis as well? And so to start that it seemed very logical, let's pick the contract that really in that left tail of the distribution contracts. So that was the first starting point that they took. And then they applied kind of leadership delivery content, real value-add content. And these are elements that when you apply them to the left-hand tail of the distribution, if you can move that average, it has tremendous impact. So I think that approach, that approach of really, on an ongoing basis, working hard to apply better value contribution to drive that margin is something that we can continue to apply both in our GTS and GBS businesses.

Well, if you can drive 11% growth in the substantial part of your business in those growth markets that have new opportunities for us, that obviously has substantial leverage in our business. So the z performance did improve. Some of that was back-end loaded in the quarter and we did see, as I pointed out earlier that, that last week of the quarter we saw an uptick in our STG business as we left the second, entering the third. On an x basis, they really did face a very tough compare last year. If you remember, they were up 15% in 2011, so I think that really did contribute to a lot of it. The high end, we did have double-digit growth and we've had double-digit growth on the high end for 8 of the last 9 quarters, including the second quarter. So as we go into the second half, we do have some very good content.

So if you look at the Software business -- let's first look at the performance we had in the non-U.S. business. So for Software outside of U.S., we had 4% growth in Europe. Now that's very, very good performance in my book in Europe in current conditions. In Japan, we had 6% growth in Software. In growth markets, we had 10% growth in Software. So all of those constant currency references, all strong performance from my perspective, all were meeting the objectives that we had set. The U.S. organization really faced just a difficult compare in last year. I mean that's kind of a function of their achievement. In the prior year, they were up 17%. So that 17% historical achievement drove the performance last year for the total software business of 10.5% growth. So as we look at the compare for the third quarter, that's about 8% growth. So we're going to pick up about 2.5 points just on the compare as the Software business moves into the third quarter.

So we think if anything, we have a very strong hand as we go into the second half. I think the first half performance was very, very good. And in the third quarter, we should see growth rates that were consistent with the first quarter performance."

One way to look at that relative mix is to look at it both from kind of a sector -- let's look at it from a sector standpoint, then let's look at it from a brand standpoint and then we'll look at the distributed across the growth within country. So f",543,"Yes. One way to look at that relative mix is to look at it both from kind of a sector -- let's look at it from a sector standpoint, then let's look at it from a brand standpoint and then we'll look at the distributed across the growth within country. So first of all, if you look at the performance in the growth markets, I mean, I think for them to once again be stronger than we had seen in the major markets by 9 points -- and that's a trend line that we've seen in 2008, 2009, 2010. We've seen that for a long time. 2011, first half of this year, that has been a very, very consistent phenomena for us. And that if you look at the individual quarters, it's been pretty strong by individual quarters. Now if you look at the BRICs, the BRICs were up 12%. Within that, as I have said, China was up a very strong 24%. Russia was up very, very strong. Within that mix of business, we had real power within the z side of the house in China. But if you look at across the sector dimension and the brand dimension, I mean we had really strong growth in our sectors. Every single sector had growth, strong growth in the growth markets. We had very strong growth across every single brand. Our Software business grew double digits. Our Services business grew double digit within our STG content, with z growing 11%. And I remind you that it's just not constructed within the BRICs, that's about 1/3 of our business. So 2/3 of our business was also growing very, very well. And we had this double-digit growth phenomena across 32 countries. So I think the composition of our growth this quarter was balanced across the sectors, was balanced across the brands and indicative of both the BRIC countries and the broader view of the growth markets.
So with that, let me wrap up the call. Now I think our results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of IBM's business model, delivering profit and cash on a sustained basis. And despite currency headwinds and a tough top line compare, we delivered strong performance: 8% growth in profit, 14% growth in operating EPS, both in the quarter and for the first half. 
But I don't want you to miss what I consider to be the most important metric this quarter, and that's our cash performance. I mean we generated $18 billion of free cash flow over the last 12 months, and that's a milestone for IBM. 
Let me put that in perspective. We generated $16.6 billion last year. 10 years ago, we generated just under $6 billion. So in the last decade, we've increased the level of free cash flow generation by 3x. And I think that's a real achievement, because it's that free cash flow that's in fact the fuel that we use to power this engine. So all of this gives us confidence to take up our expectation for the full year to at least $15.10 of operating EPS. That's up 12% from last year and on track to at least $20 in 2015.
So thanks for joining us. And now, as always, back to work."

For the year, we're maintaining our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS of at least $15.10, that's up 12% over last year. 
Looking at our third quarter revenue by geography, Europe was fairly consistent with last quarter, Japan's revenue stabilized, the BRIC countries in total performed well again, but North America declined.
When I look at our skew of business in the third quarter, through the first 2 months, our revenue was fairly consistent with our second quarter performance. The third month of the quarter was more challenging. This quarter, we delivered double-digit operating earnings per share growth, driven by our strength in our solutions offerings, a solid annuity based and our ongoing work on productivity. First, we've continued to drive very good results in our solutions offerings across software and services that addressed key demand areas like Smarter Planet, Business Analytics and cloud. Second, our annuity businesses, which represent about half of our annual revenue and 60% of our profit provided a solid base of revenue and profit. And third, we're continuing to execute on our productivity initiatives on track to deliver $8 billion of productivity over the 2015 roadmap. The benefit from these initiatives, together with our mixed and more profitable businesses, helped to drive our margin expansion.
Now before I get into the financial metrics, I want to remind you that this quarter, we closed the sale of our Retail Store Solutions point-of-sale business to Toshiba TEC in most countries. The transaction results in a loss of revenue and profit for the divested operations, a gain on the sale and an impact to our tax rate. As we go through the presentation, I'll clarify the impact of these. 
In the quarter, IBM's revenue was down 5%, including the currency headwind of nearly 4 points. At constant currency, we were down 2% or down 1% if you normalize for the RSS divestiture. But despite of this revenue declined, we had solid operating profit growth with pretax income up 7% and net income up 5%. 
Our margin expansion was driven by our productivity initiatives, improving business mix and the overall currency dynamics. This quarter, we expanded operating gross margin by 1.2 points with about 60% due to improvements in margins and the balance from mix. With good expense management, we improved operating PTI margin by 2.5 points. 
This quarter, our tax rate was up over 1 point year-to-year. The increase was driven by a higher tax rate on the gain from the sale of our RSS business. We now expect an operating effective tax rate, excluding onetime items in the range of 24.5% for the year. Bottom line, we delivered operating EPS of $3.62, which was up 10% year-to-year. 
When you look at the year-to-year drivers of our operating EPS performance, the 5% decline in revenue of constant margin impacted profit growth by $0.17 per share. Margin expansion was the largest contributor to our growth. Within that, the gain on the RSS divestiture contributed $0.23, gross margin expansion added $0.19 and our expense productivity, another $0.16. On the other hand, we did have an increase in our workforce for balancing activity for an impact of $0.24. 
Our ongoing share repurchase program contributed to balance at a level fairly consistent with the first 2 quarters of the year.
As you can see, the dynamics are very similar to our first half performance. Now get into the third quarter details, starting with revenue by geography, discuss the results on a at constant currency basis. Americas revenue was down 3%, with declines in both the U.S. and Canada. In North America, software is up 4%, services was down, and we had a double-digit decline in hardware. With revenue performance relatively consistent with last quarter, EMEA was stable. 
Looking at the performance by country, Germany and Spain grew, the U.K. was flat, while France and Italy declined. Turning to Asia Pacific, last quarter, I said that I expanded our business in Japan to stabilize. This quarter, our revenue in Japan was flat year-to-year so certainly, an improvement over the last several quarters. We had good performance in both Europe and Japan given the environment.
In our growth market countries, which we referred to as GMU, the BRICs had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 11%. We had double-digit growth in Russia, which was up 11%, India, up 13% and China, up 19%. Brazil however, was down 3%. Looking beyond the BRICs, Australia and Mexico were down double digits this quarter, while most of the other countries continue to do well. In fact, this quarter, 35 of the growth market countries grew at a double-digit rate, reflecting ongoing broad-based strength.
Looking at IBM revenue in gross margin by segment, our total services revenue was flat, as modest revenue growth from our backlog was offset by impacts from shorter-term and volume-related activity. Software performance was driven by double-digit growth across our solutions area like Business Analytics, commerce and Social Business. Our Systems and Technology revenue declined each month, though performance in September improved as we introduced our next-generation System z. 
Turning to gross profit. Our operating gross margins improved 1.2 points, driven by a combination of margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative performance of software. 
Now let's take a look below the growth profit line to our expense and spending profile. Our total operating expense and other income was down 10%. The primary driver was currency, which drove 8 points from both translation and hedging dynamics. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 3 points of expense growth. So consequently, our basic expense was better by 5 points. 
Now I'll comment on a few expense items. SG&A includes a pretax charge of over $400 million for workforce rebalancing activity, which at IBM average tax rate impacted net income by about $310 million. Other income and expense had 2 drivers. First, a pretax gain for the sale of our Retail Store Solutions business and second, we had a year-to-year impact from our hedging activity. The pretax gain for the RSS sale is almost $450 million. With the discrete tax rate on that gain based on the country's closed, the transaction contributed about $280 million of net income.
Turning to the hedging activity, we hedged our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility and our global cash planning. Last year, hedging programs generated losses, resulting in an impact to expense of about $175 million. While these year, the programs generated gains of about $100 million in expense, roughly 90% of our hedging activity this quarter was an expense. The balance is in cost. As you know, this hedging activity can't be looked at in isolation as it mitigates translation impacts throughout the P&L.
Looking at how all of these translates into pretax margins by segment, we've provided here a normalized view of the profit and margin dynamics by removing the workforce rebalancing charges in both years to give you a better view of the underlying operational performance of the segments. On this basis, you can see good profit growth and margin expansion in Global Technology Services, Global Business Services and Software. 
Now let's turn to the segments, starting with services. The 2 services segments delivered $14.5 billion in revenue and, excluding workforce rebalancing charges, grew pretax profit 9% and expanded pretax margins by just over 2 points. Backlog was $138 billion, up 1% year-to-year. We continued to see strong performance in the growth markets, with backlog up 15% at constant currency. And globally, transactional backlog was up 7% constant currency. 
Turning to the 2 segments. In Global Technology Services, revenue was $9.9 billion, down 4% as reported and up 1% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue was flat at constant currency. As we previously discussed, there are 3 primary sources of revenue in outsourcing.
First, revenue from backlog, which makes up the majority of the revenue in the year. Second, revenue from new client signings within the year and finally, revenue from base growth, which comes from new business sold into the existing accounts and from volumes generated within the quarter.
This quarter, we continue to record revenue growth from our backlog. However, we did see a decline in revenue from base growth after growing through the first half. Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 3% at constant currency, with the growth markets up 13% at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered flat pretax profit growth in the quarter though, excluding workforce rebalancing charges, pretax profit was up 9% with 2 points of margin expansion. This quarter, there are a number of drivers of margin expansion. First, increased contributions from the growth markets which continue to drive higher gross margin than our major markets. Second, lift from our continued focus on automation and process, primarily through our enterprise productivity initiatives. And finally, we continue to benefit from the work GTS has done to improve performance in a select set of lower margin contracts within Strategic Outsourcing. 
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.5 billion, down 6% as reported or down 3% at constant currency. Looking at revenue from a geographic perspective, the growth markets continued to drive the strongest performance. Japan returned to growth this quarter, with revenue up 2% at constant currency, while North America and Europe were both down 6% at constant currency. Looking at the GBS business by offering, the growth initiatives continue to drive strong growth. We had solid double-digit growth in Business Analytics, Smarter Planet and cloud. Together, these initiatives represent about 1/3 of total GBS revenue. 
So we continue to get great traction in these growth initiatives, and we're seeing the benefits across IBM. The overall growth rate of GBS is being impacted by declines in some of the more traditional packets application projects. 
Turning to profit, GBS pretax income declined 5% year-to-year. However, when adjusting for workforce percentage rebalancing, pretax income grew 9% and pretax margin expanded 2.5 points.
Margin expansion benefited from prior quarters workforce rebalancing, yield from enterprise productivity initiatives and a help from currency. 
Software revenue of $5.8 billion was down 1% and up 3% at constant currency. Through August, revenue was up 5% at constant currency. However, performance in September was weak, particularly in North America and the growth markets. Our portfolio of solutions offerings was up double digits year-to-year, while the complementary infrastructure portfolio was essentially flat. 
Now let me take you through the drivers for the brands. WebSphere grew 5% at constant currency and continued to extend its market-leading position. We had good growth from our commerce offerings, which target not only the CIO but also the CMO so we reaching new Breyers. This performance was bolstered by our recent acquisition of Tea Leaf, which enables clients to analyze interactions on websites and mobile devices.
Information Management was up 3% at constant currency. Performance was driven by strong growth in our Business Analytics offerings, led by our growth mix, which together with our deep analytics expertise helps our clients manage risks and better enable faster decision-making. Just last week, software announced new members of systems family, the IBM Pure Data systems. These expert integrated systems are optimized to deliver high performance data services for transactional and analytics applications. 
Tivoli software was up 9% at constant currency and gained share. Revenue from our Storage portfolio was up 14% at constant currency, reflecting the value of Storage software. Tivoli security was up 9% at constant currency, driven by Q1 Labs, which provides next-generation security intelligence. Lotus declined 7% at constant currency in the quarter. Although notes declined, we had strong performance in our Social Business offerings. In the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of Kenexa, which further expand our solution portfolio for Social Business. We expect Kenexa to close late in the fourth quarter.
Software pretax income was $2.4 billion, up 6% from last year. Normalized for the high level of workforce rebalancing, software pretax income was up 10% and pretax margin expanded 3.5 points. 
Systems and Technology delivered revenue of $3.9 billion, down 13%. Adjusting for the divestiture of Retail Store Solutions, revenue was down 11% or 9% at constant currency. 
System z revenue declined 19% at constant currency and MIPS declined 2%. Late in the third quarter, we started shipping the zEnterprise EC12 server, which delivers up to 25% improved application performance and up to 50% enhanced capacity, making it the fastest and most capable enterprise system to date. This new mainframe will be ramping through the fourth quarter.
POWER revenue was down 1% at constant currency. We had strength again this quarter and POWER high performance solutions. We continued our success in competitive takeouts. This quarter, we had over 260 competitive displacements, which resulted in over $200 million of business which came almost equally from HP and Oracle Sun. This initiative helped drive our 18th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER. 
Early in October, we announced the new POWER7 plus based servers. These new systems offer performance boost of 30% to 40% compared to prior versions and new capabilities for cloud and security. System x revenue was down 3% at constant currency. Our Storage hardware revenue was down 8% at constant currency, while Storage software, which is supported in Tivoli, was up 14% at constant currency. We continue to see value shifting to software. 
Earlier this month, we announced the new high-end DS 8870, which enables clients to take full advantage of the increase performance in our new high-end enterprise servers. We're expanding our Storage software capabilities as well. Last week, we announced the virtual storage center, which integrates multiple software solutions to deliver fast backup and restoring in a virtualized storage environment.
As you look to the fourth quarter, we have significantly enhanced our systems portfolio with our new zEnterprise EC12 mainframe, Power Systems based on the new POWER7 plus architecture and new storage systems, including the high-end DS 8870.
Across all of our segment, we're continuing the strong performance in our key growth initiatives. In the growth markets, we're expanding into new markets, building out IT infrastructures and focusing on targeted industries. For the year, revenue was up 7% at constant currency, and we gained share. Our business analytic solutions help our clients to identify, manage and predict outcomes by leveraging huge amounts of data. Our broad portfolio of analytic solutions was up 14% through the third quarter, led by our GBS consulting practice. Our SmartCloud portfolio addresses the full scope of enterprise client requirements with strong growth across the offerings from private cloud to public cloud to our industry-based solutions. Cloud revenue, so far this year, has already exceeded our full year revenue for 2011. 
All of these comes together on our Smarter Planet solutions. Through the third quarter, we had record growth of more than 20% in the Smarter Planet portfolio, with traction in our Smarter Commerce and industry solutions.
When you look at our offerings in our Business Analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet, about half of the revenue was software. So the success we're having in these areas is improving our business mix and our margin. 
Turning to cash flow, we generate $3.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. Now let me walk through the year-to-year drivers. Our operating net income was up $200 million year-to-year and GAAP income is flat. One of the nonoperating items this quarter is the charge for U.K. pension. On October 12, the U.K. court issued a ruling regarding an IBM U.K. pension plan. We took a pretax charge of approximately $160 million or $125 million after-tax. Though the charge impacted GAAP net income, it did not impact operating income. And since it's a noncash item, it's reverse in a fee cash flow analysis. 
Looking to the items that impacted cash year-to-year, our cash tax payments increased $300 million. We had an increase of almost $100 million for our workforce rebalancing payments and our capital expenditures were also up year-to-year. So though operating profit was up $200 million, free cash flow was down almost $350 million based on the increased tax, capital and restructuring payments.
Through the first 3 quarters of the year, our free cash flow was up $1 billion year-over-year to $8.7 billion. Our growth in net income was partially offset with increased capital investments. As I mentioned previously, in the first quarter of last year, our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments, driven by auto settlement activity. 
Looking at the uses of our cash through September, we spent $2.3 billion to acquired 10 companies, including Texas Memory Systems, which closed in the third quarter. We've returned almost $12 billion to shareholders this year. We paid out over $2.8 billion in dividends and spent $9 billion in share repurchase to buyback almost 4 million to 6 million shares. At the end of the third quarter, we had $6.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12.3 billion. Total debt was $33.7 billion of which $23.3 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at just over 7:1. Our non-financing debt was $10.3 billion, and our nonfinancing debt to cap was 36%, consistent with June. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long-term.
Ramping up our discussion of the quarter, we delivered 10% operating EPS growth and $3.1 billion in free cash flow. Within our operations, we had solid contributions from our annuity businesses and strong performance in our growth initiatives, Smarter Planet, Business Analytics and cloud. Our productivity initiatives helped to drive margin expansion and our solid balance sheet and cash generation supported shareholder returns. 
As we move into the fourth quarter, we have new product introductions under systems portfolio, not just in Systems z, but also in POWER and Storage. We've just announced PureSystems offerings that leverage our software capabilities. And late in the quarter, we expect to close the acquisition of Kenexa.
Taking all of these into account, we're maintaining our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS of at least $15.10. This keeps us on track to at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015. Now Patricia and I will take your questions."

So if you look at the third quarter performance, we did start off the first 2 months of the quarter on a stronger trajectory that we saw from the full quarter as we saw a fall-off in our growth rates in the third month of the quarter. Now within that, third month phenomena, I would point to look at it from a brand perspective, it was really a fall-off that we saw in our GBS business, number one. In our software business, number two. And from a geographic perspective, it was really a fall-off that we saw in North America and our growth markets unit, which referred to as GMU. Now elementary, as you walk down those, the software content, I would attribute to a handful of deals that fell out of the quarter. Frankly, we thought we had those right through the end of the quarter. They rolled through the fourth quarter they would have accounted for about 2 points improved performance, which would have been more consistent with what we saw in the first 2 months of the quarter. And those software deals were also part of the GMU performance. So just as our software business would have performed better in the quarter, with the roll up of those handful of deals, so would our GMU performance. Now as you look at our growth market performance in addition, they were impacted really by a couple of very large countries that had disappointing performance on a year-to-year basis. So that will be Mexico and Australia. They are both down double digits. Our BRIC countries is all were up 11% and within that plus 11% positive performance, very consistent what we seen historically, Brazil was, in fact, down 3%. But on the other countries, Russia was up 11%, India was up 13% and China was up a very strong 19%. Now let's look at the countries in GMU outside of the BRIC countries. Again, if we exclude Australia and Mexico, where we had the double-digit decline, the balance of the countries outside of the BRICs grew double-digit. In fact, we had 35 countries with double-digit performance. So I would not attribute some broader trend to either of those perspectives. In our GBS business, GBS once again produced very strong results on a solutions-based. But we did have a more challenging environment for the more additional packet solutions. The other solution content is linked to our key growth initiatives, so it's very important we do well there. So now if you take that data forward, end of the fourth quarter, I think on the software business, in the hardware business outside of the impact of the Retail Store systems divestiture, we should be seeing mid-single-digit performance from both of them and driving double-digit profitability. I think our services business will have a revenue base similar to what we saw in the third quarter. But let me add, the services profitability that they each drove at 9% growth was right in the midpoint of their model performance. And with that, as well as the new announcement content that we're getting out of our hardware business, we have a new z, we have a new POWER7 plus entering the high-end of our EPC series, the new store and content, we feel quite confident in the at least 15, 10 [ph] for the year."

I think the overall opportunity we have across really goes back fundamentally to the business model and how we drive that business model over a longer periods of time. The workforce rebalancing that we've done this year in total, that was about $800 million predominantly outside the U.S. and should have a payback about 15 months. Now we are constantly driving workforce rebalancing to a population the best growth opportunities that we have. If you look at the overall cost and spending improvement that we saw in the third quarter, the first point I would make is that in a period of currency headwind that impact that has in the overall translational effect of currency, that's mitigated and partially offset, obviously, by [indiscernible]. And you could kind of see that in the margin performance in our business. Our gross profit margins were up 1.2 points. Where our PT I was up 2.5 points and up 2.5 points [ph] in that differential, large is the offset of the heads helping to offset the impact that we saw on the revenue line and it's flow-through to gross profit margin. The 1.2 points that we had in gross profit, that had a very solid mix component in about 4/10 points [ph] for mix and a various solid expand component. And I think both of those are strong ongoing place that we should leverage as we go into the fourth quarter in 2013. That mix component is predominantly the mix that we see in the Software that we've been driving for a decade. And the spend efficiencies overall $8 billion plan that we have for the 2015 roadmap, obviously, break that down by year, it's $1.6 billion, by quarter, it's about $400 million if we get 30% to 40% to the bottom line, that's an advantage of about $150 million. The balance, I remind you, that really goes to making our offerings and our products more competitive. On a price basis, given the ability to move spend to more aggressive growth opportunities."

When you look at the overall issue of a fiscal cliff and a budget flush, I got to be honest, Steve, I've kind of react to the position because I don't think it'd be a responsible kind of performance for either public or private sector. I mean if we had spending requirements, I don't think people will rollout and maximize their spend rate this budget period to the expense of the overall spend requirements. I know if it was my business and one of my controllers, the CFOs, was ""driving a budget flush"", I was driving him out of the business. So certainly, the Controller is that I have met in government, they're very responsible. They're driving do exactly the right thing and if they see spending pressure, they do their work to help us fund to that. To me, on a global basis, we look around the world. Governments are under pressure. Spending is under pressure. I don't think this is news to anybody. But I think, Steve, from my perspective, when you look at this proposition that there'll be a budget flush, to me, as I had said there, I think of react to that I think the there wouldn't be responding from the base economic challenges and I don't think that's the case."

If you look at the overall backlog, our total backlog for the quarter was up 1%. Within that, our outsourcing backlog was relatively flat. Our transactional backlog, if you just do the math, was up 7%. Now there are some dynamics that are pretty compelling within that. So when you look at that outsourcing backlog, and you break that down by unit, you see much more momentum in our growth markets. So if you take the total backlog for the business and break that down between major markets and growth markets, the backlog in our growth markets is up 15%. And that's kind of an ongoing momentum that we've seen in our services business in the growth markets. If you break this then down by unit, on the GTS base of business, I think they had a pretty good quarter there. And actually, the GTS business is up more than 1% as we enter the fourth quarter. I would also analyze the revenue performance in the quarter, remind you that we did take this very specific set of actions on the weak tail of the profitability dissolution of our contracts. And as we took that action on the weak tail that enhances and improves our overall profitability, you saw in the first 9 months of the year, this year, with the strong performance we got out of the GTS business, but it does have an impact on the other side to revenue. And we knew that and we made that trade-off. Because our objective is to derive real gross profit, real profitability in those contracts in the backlog. It's not that hard to go through a services business and drive big signings, but you have to live with that decision for a number of years in your relationship with your customer. And our objective is to establish strong relationships right upfront with a profitable set of contracts that we know we can deliver over the longer term. So I think I would caution you from looking at that GTS business. You've got to recognize that there was some revenue impacts as we optimize to profitability."

But underneath it, if you look at our software business, the solutions content underneath it had a very strong quarter, up double-digit once again. And the solutions content is both organically generated, as well as the implementation of the integration with our acquisition profile, and that's been very strong across the portfolio of offerings. It was a little more challenging and muted performance on the infrastructure side. But as you look at the fourth quarter, I think we have opportunities across both. And so again, adjusting for that handful of deals in software that fell out of the quarter, we would have seen performance more consistent with what we saw in the first 2 months of the quarter. And I think we have the opportunity to close those deals to get back on a stronger trajectory as we go into the fourth quarter.

And we're, I think that has a lot of key technology offerings. Solely part of the product line however, but it is the high-end. So we look at that as a real margin opportunity within the mix of their product line. Likewise, in the Storage business, we're announcing the new high-end content, introducing POWER7 to our architecture. We think that likely has real opportunity in a high-end for not just revenue, but margin contribution within our product line. But clearly, the big announcement for the quarter is the new z series. And as we look at the new z series, now we have a full quarter of opportunity into third quarter, we really on the shifting the new z series about 11 days into the very back end of the quarter. And it in front of that, shift made, we only had about 3 weeks of selling time. So now it gives us the opportunity for a full quarter shift worth it as I look at it, I think they have very strong case on hardware basis for the new z platform to generate 20% to 30% growth. So within all that, that gives us confidence within our objectives that the hardware base of business will be generating about 5% revenue growth outside of the impact of the divestiture, the Retail Store systems content. Now that divestment has about a 4-point impact to the hardware-based the business and about a 1 point impact to IBM. But I think we do have a hand of that content, and we'll see it improve the overall hardware performance, not just in North America, but as we go through the global rollout as well."

So let's look at the overall margin dynamics for the corporation. When you look at it, we are driving that very focused piece of work that Linda Sanford took you through at the Analyst Meeting to generate about $8 billion of spent take out across the",673,"Yes. So let's look at the overall margin dynamics for the corporation. When you look at it, we are driving that very focused piece of work that Linda Sanford took you through at the Analyst Meeting to generate about $8 billion of spent take out across the business and as I had said earlier, if you just kind of mathematically break it down, it's about $1.6 billion a year or $400 million a quarter, that content is in some respects outside of the business unit per view. And it gets to applied to those business units based on their kind of metrics and participation. So in other words, if we take big spend rate out of the back-office support organizations, the business units are the beneficiary that's been take out, but they didn't have to drive a lot of the content since we manage in a globally integrated enterprise. And that's a very structured play that we're driving, not only across our back office content but now into systematic areas that span across our processes and also spend rates within business units that collectively have more opportunities. So we intend to continue that overall spend dynamic. And as I had said earlier, our services business will certainly be a beneficiary there. Now in your question about the overall workforce rebalancing that we do, just given the fact that the services business have the largest share of our overall population, of course, they're going to be the beneficiary of that as well. But to me, on the longer-term basis, I think that the model base that we provided as part of the 2015 roadmap is the best criteria, the best content that you can see as you look at that long-term run rate. So as you look at how we would attempt to implement those as we go into 2013, I mean, believe me, this team is going to look at the actuals that we drive in 2012. We're going to draw a [indiscernible] line to that 2015 objective, and then we're going to base our profitability, our free cash flow, all of those content, our budget support it, as well as our compensation. So that's how we'll be driving that.
So let me just take a moment now to wrap up the call. Now despite facing challenges, we did deliver a 7% growth in profit, 10% growth in our operating EPS. And I think consistent with the last conversation, that performance reflects our disciplined approach to delivering profit growth. The quarter we had 10% growth on our software profit, 9% from our services businesses, both of which benefit from a large annuity base. We're continuing to move up the value chain, shifting our portfolio to more strategic areas. Now we had continued momentum and our growth initiatives, both Smarter Planet, Business Analytics, as well as our cloud, were all up strong double digits. And this quarter, we completed the divestiture of our Retail Store Solutions business. The benefits from our ongoing work were competitively, shareholder through to our margin. And we're returning value to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. So looking forward, as we enter the fourth quarter as always, we need to execute. And we need the growth market in software to close those rollover deals that we discussed and drive an improved trajectory in the fourth quarter. We need GBS to drive more of that traditional packet transactions content, while maintaining the good momentum they shown in our growth initiatives. And I think North America, needs to capitalized on the great hardware product lineup we have for the fourth quarter with then new z, the new p and Storage to drive transactional sales performance in the fourth quarter. So based on this, we are confident in our plans to achieve at least $15.10 of operating EPS for the year. That's up 12% from last year and on track to at least $20 in 2015. 
So once again, thanks for joining us and now, as always, it's back to work."

For the year, we're maintaining our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS of at",3077,"In the third quarter, we reported $24.7 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins, and increased operating earnings per share by 10% to $3.62. For the year, we're maintaining our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS of at least $15.10, that's up 12% over last year. 
Looking at our third quarter revenue by geography: Europe was fairly consistent with last quarter; Japan's revenue stabilized; the BRIC countries, in total, performed well again; but North America declined.
When I look at our skew of business in the quarter, through the first 2 months, our revenue was fairly consistent with our second quarter performance. The third month of the quarter was more challenging. This quarter, we delivered double-digit operating earnings per share growth, driven by our strength in our solutions offerings, a solid annuity base and our ongoing work on productivity. First, we continued to drive very good results in our solutions offerings across software and services that addressed key demand areas like Smarter Planet, Business Analytics and Cloud. Second, our annuity businesses, which represent about half of our annual revenue and 60% of our profit provided a solid base of revenue and profit. And third, we're continuing to execute on our productivity initiatives on track to deliver $8 billion of productivity over the 2015 roadmap. The benefit from these initiatives, together with our mixed and more profitable businesses, help to drive our margin expansion.
Now before I get into the financial metrics, I want to remind you that this quarter, we closed the sale of our Retail Store Solutions point-of-sale business to Toshiba TEC in most countries. The transaction results in a loss of revenue and profit for the divested operations, a gain on the sale and an impact to our tax rate. As we go through the presentation, I'll clarify the impact of each of these. 
In the quarter, IBM's revenue was down 5%, including the currency headwind of nearly 4 points. At constant currency, we were down 2% or down 1%, if you normalize for the RSS divestiture. But despite of this revenue declined, we had solid operating profit growth with pretax income up 7% and net income up 5%. 
Our margin expansion was driven by our productivity initiatives, improving business mix and the overall currency dynamics. This quarter, we expanded operating gross margin by 1.2 points with about 60% due to improvements in margins and the balance from mix. With good expense management, we improved operating PTI margin by 2.5 points. 
This quarter, our tax rate was up over 1 point year-to-year. The increase was driven by a higher tax rate on the gain from the sale of our RSS business. We now expect an operating effective tax rate, excluding one-time items in the range of 24.5% for the year. Bottom line, we delivered operating EPS of $3.62, which was up 10% year-to-year. 
When you look at the year-to-year drivers of our operating EPS performance, the 5% decline in revenue of constant margin impacted profit growth by $0.17 per share. Margin expansion was the largest contributor to our growth. Within that, the gain on the RSS divestiture contributed $0.23, gross margin expansion added $0.19 and our expense productivity, another $0.16. On the other hand, we did have an increase in our workforce for balancing activity for an impact of $0.24. 
Our ongoing share repurchase program contributed to balance at a level fairly consistent with the first 2 quarters of the year.  As you can see, the dynamics are very similar to our first half performance. 
Now I'll get into the third quarter details, starting with revenue by geography, where I'll discuss the results on a constant currency basis. Americas revenue was down 3%, with declines in both the U.S. and Canada. In North America, software is up 4%, services was down, and we had a double-digit decline in hardware. With revenue performance relatively consistent with last quarter, EMEA was stable. 
Looking at the performance by country, Germany and Spain grew, the U.K. was flat, while France and Italy declined. Turning to Asia Pacific, last quarter, I said that I expect that our business in Japan to stabilize. This quarter, our revenue in Japan was flat year-to-year. So, certainly, an improvement over the last several quarters. We had good performance in both Europe and Japan given the environment.
In our growth markets countries, which we refer to as GMU, the BRICs had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 11%. We had double-digit growth in Russia, which was up 11%; India, up 13%; and China, up 19%. Brazil, however, was down 3%. Looking beyond the BRICs, Australia and Mexico were down double digits this quarter, while most of the other countries continue to do well. In fact, this quarter, 35 of the growth market countries grew at a double-digit rate, reflecting ongoing broad-based strength.
Looking at IBM revenue and gross margin by segment, our total services revenue was flat, as modest revenue growth from our backlog was offset by impacts from shorter-term and volume-related activity. Software performance was driven by double-digit growth across our solutions area like Business Analytics, commerce and Social Business. Our Systems and Technology revenue declined each month, though performance in September improved as we introduced our next-generation System z. 
Turning to gross profit. Our operating gross margins improved 1.2 points, driven by a combination of margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative performance of software. 
Now let's take a look below the growth profit line to our expense and spending profile. Our total operating expense and other income was down 10%. The primary driver was currency, which drove 8 points from both translation and hedging dynamics. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 3 points of expense growth. So consequently, our base expense was better by 5 points. 
Now I'll comment on a few expense items. SG&A includes a pretax charge of over $400 million for workforce rebalancing activity, which, at IBM's average tax rate, impacted net income by about $310 million. Other income and expense had 2 drivers. First, a pretax gain for the sale of our Retail Store Solutions business and second, we had a year-to-year impact from our hedging activity. The pretax gain for the RSS sale is almost $450 million. With the discrete tax rate on that gain based on the country's closed, the transaction contributed about $280 million of net income.
Turning to the hedging activity, we hedged our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility and our global cash planning. Last year, hedging programs generated losses, resulting in an impact to expense of about $175 million. While these year, the program's generated gains of about $100 million in expense, roughly 90% of our hedging activity this quarter was an expense. The balance is in cost. As you know, this hedging activity can't be looked at in isolation as it mitigates translation impacts throughout the P&L.
Looking at how all of these translates into pretax margins by segment, we've provided here a normalized view of the profit and margin dynamics, by removing the workforce rebalancing charges in both years to give you a better view of the underlying operational performance of the segments. On this basis, you can see good profit growth and margin expansion in Global Technology Services, Global Business Services and Software. 
Now let's turn to the segments, starting with services. The 2 services segments delivered $14.5 billion in revenue and, excluding workforce rebalancing charges, grew pretax profit, 9%, and expanded pretax margins by just over 2 points. Backlog was $138 billion, up 1% year-to-year. We continued to see strong performance in the growth markets, with backlog up 15% at constant currency. And globally, transactional backlog was up 7% at constant currency. 
Turning to the 2 segments. In Global Technology Services, revenue was $9.9 billion, down 4% as reported and up 1% at constant; currency; GTS outsourcing revenue was flat at constant currency. As we've previously discussed, there were 3 primary sources of revenue in outsourcing: First, revenue from backlog, which makes up the majority of the revenue in the year; second, revenue from new client signings within the year; and finally, revenue from base growth, which comes from new business sold into the existing accounts and from volumes generated within the quarter.
This quarter, we continue to get revenue growth from our backlog. However, we did see a decline in revenue from base growth after growing through the first half. Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 3% at constant currency, with the growth markets up 13% at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered flat pretax profit growth in the quarter though, excluding workforce rebalancing charges, pretax profit was up 9% with 2 points of margin expansion. 
This quarter, there are a number of drivers of margin expansion: First, increased contribution from the growth markets, which continue to drive higher gross margin than our major markets; second, lift from our continued focus on automation and process, primarily through our enterprise productivity initiatives; and finally, we continue to benefit from the work GTS has done to improve performance in a select set of lower margin contracts within Strategic Outsourcing. 
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.5 billion, down 6% as reported or down 3% at constant currency. Looking at revenue from a geographic perspective, the growth markets continued to drive the strongest performance. Japan returned to growth this quarter, with revenue up 2% at constant currency, while North America and Europe were both down 6% at constant currency. Looking at the GBS business by offering, the growth initiatives continue to drive strong growth. We had solid double-digit growth in Business Analytics, Smarter Planet and Cloud. Together, these initiatives represent about 1/3 of total GBS revenue. 
So we continue to get great traction in these growth initiatives, and we're seeing the benefits across IBM. The overall growth rate of GBS is being impacted by declines in some of the more traditional packaged application projects. 
Turning to profit, GBS pretax income declined 5% year-to-year. However, when adjusting for workforce rebalancing, pretax income grew 9% and pretax margin expanded 2.5 points.  Margin expansion benefited from prior quarters' workforce rebalancing, yield from enterprise productivity initiatives and a help from currency. 
Software revenue of $5.8 billion was down 1% and up 3% at constant currency. Through August, revenue was up 5% at constant currency. However, performance in September was weak, particularly in North America and the growth markets. Our portfolio of solutions offerings was up double digits year-to-year, while the complementary infrastructure portfolio was essentially flat. 
Now let me take you through the drivers for the brands. WebSphere grew 5% at constant currency and continued to extend its market-leading position. We had good growth from our commerce offerings, which target not only the CIO but also the CMO, so we're reaching new buyers. This performance was bolstered by our recent acquisition of Tealeaf, which enables clients to analyze interactions on websites and mobile devices.
Information Management was up 3% at constant currency. Performance was driven by strong growth in our Business Analytics offerings, led by Algorithmics, which, together with our deep analytics expertise, helps our clients manage risks and better enable faster decision-making. Just last week, Software announced new members of PureSystems family, the IBM PureData systems. These expert integrated systems are optimized to deliver high performance data services for transactional and analytics applications. 
Tivoli software was up 9% at constant currency and gained share. Revenue from our Storage portfolio was up 14% at constant currency, reflecting the value of Storage software. Tivoli Security was up 9% at constant currency, driven by Q1 Labs, which provides next-generation security intelligence. Lotus declined 7% at constant currency in the quarter. Although Notes declined, we had strong performance in our Social Business offerings. In the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of Kenexa, which further expand our solution portfolio for Social Business. We expect Kenexa to close late in the fourth quarter.
Software pretax income was $2.4 billion, up 6% from last year. Normalized for the high level of workforce rebalancing, Software pretax income was up 10% and pretax margin expanded 3.5 points. 
Systems and Technology delivered revenue of $3.9 billion, down 13%. Adjusting for the divestiture of Retail Store Solutions, revenue was down 11% or 9% at constant currency. 
System z revenue declined 19% at constant currency and MIPS declined 2%. Late in the third quarter, we started shipping the zEnterprise EC12 server, which delivers up to 25% improved application performance and up to 50% enhanced capacity, making it the fastest and most capable enterprise system to date. This new mainframe will be ramping through the fourth quarter.
POWER revenue was down 1% at constant currency. We had strength again this quarter in POWER high performance solutions. We've continued our success in competitive takeouts. This quarter, we had over 260 competitive displacements, which resulted in over $200 million of business which came almost equally from HP and Oracle/Sun. This initiative helped drive our 18th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER. 
Early in October, we announced the new POWER7+ base servers. These new systems offer performance boost of 30% to 40% compared to prior versions and new capabilities for cloud and security. 
System x revenue was down 3% at constant currency. Our Storage hardware revenue was down 8% at constant currency, while Storage software, which is reported in Tivoli, was up 14% at constant currency. We continue to see value shifting to software. 
Earlier this month, we announced the new high-end DS8870, which enables clients to take full advantage of the increased performance in our new high-end enterprise servers. We're expanding our Storage software capabilities as well. Last week, we announced the virtual storage center, which integrates multiple software solutions to deliver fast backup and restoring in a virtualized storage environment.
As you look to the fourth quarter, we have significantly enhanced our systems portfolio with our new zEnterprise EC12 mainframe, Power Systems based on the new POWER7+ architecture and new storage systems, including the high-end DS8870.
Across all of our segment, we're continuing the strong performance in our key growth initiatives. In the growth markets, we're expanding into new markets, building out IT infrastructures and focusing on targeted industries. For the year, revenue was up 7% at constant currency, and we've gained share. Our business analytic solutions help our clients to identify, manage and predict outcomes by leveraging huge amounts of data. Our broad portfolio of analytic solutions was up 14% through the third quarter, led by our GBS consulting practice. Our SmartCloud portfolio addresses the full scope of enterprise client requirements with strong growth across the offerings from private cloud to public cloud to our industry-based solutions. Cloud revenue, so far this year, has already exceeded our full year revenue for 2011. 
All of this comes together on our Smarter Planet solutions. Through the third quarter, we had revenue growth of more than 20% in the Smarter Planet portfolio, with traction in our Smarter Commerce and industry solutions.
When you look at our offerings in our Business Analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet, about half of the revenue was software. So the success we're having in these areas is improving our business mix and our margin. 
Turning to cash flow, we generate $3.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. 
Now let me walk through the year-to-year drivers. Our operating net income was up $200 million year-to-year and GAAP income is flat. One of the nonoperating items this quarter is a charge for U.K. pension. On October 12, the U.K. court issued a ruling regarding an IBM U.K. pension plan. We took a pretax charge of approximately $160 million or $125 million after-tax. Though the charge impacted GAAP net income, it did not impact operating income. And since it's a noncash item, it's reversed in a fee cash flow analysis. 
Looking to the items that impacted cash year-to-year, our cash tax payments increased $300 million. We had an increase of almost $100 million for our workforce rebalancing payments and our capital expenditures were also up year-to-year. So though operating profit was up $200 million, free cash flow was down almost $350 million based on the increased tax, capital and restructuring payments.
Through the first 3 quarters of the year, our free cash flow was up $1 billion year-over-year to $8.7 billion. Our growth in net income was partially offset with increased capital investments. As I mentioned previously, in the first quarter of last year, our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments, driven by audit settlement activity. 
Looking at the uses of our cash through September, we spent $2.3 billion to acquire 10 companies, including Texas Memory Systems, which closed in the third quarter. 
We've returned almost $12 billion to shareholders this year. We paid out over $2.8 billion in dividends and spent $9 billion in share repurchase to buyback almost 46 million shares. At the end of the third quarter, we had $6.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12.3 billion. Total debt was $33.7 billion of which $23.3 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at just over 7:1. Our non-financing debt was $10.3 billion, and our nonfinancing debt to cap was 36%, consistent with June. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long-term.
Wrapping up our discussion on the quarter, we delivered 10% operating EPS growth and $3.1 billion in free cash flow. Within our operations, we had solid contributions from our annuity businesses and strong performance in our growth initiatives: Smarter Planet, Business Analytics and Cloud. Our productivity initiatives helped to drive margin expansion and our solid balance sheet and cash generation supported shareholder returns. 
As we move into the fourth quarter, we have new product introductions in our systems portfolio, not just in System z, but also in POWER and Storage. We've just announced PureSystems offerings that leverage our software capabilities. And late in the quarter, we expect to close the acquisition of Kenexa.
Taking all of this into account, we're maintaining our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS of at least $15.10. This keeps us on track to at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015. 
Now Patricia and I will take your questions."

Relative to expectations, revenues were short. Your tone, I think, sounded a bit more cautious and you made several references to the U.S. being weaker and the third month of the quarter being more challenging. So specifically on those latter points, can you help us understand what you think happened? Is this being driven by macroeconomic issues? Are these IBM execution issues? And if we roll -- if we look forward, are you expecting either the execution or the macro issues to reverse or improve in the fourth quarter?"
112350,222673428,365518,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2012",2012-10-16,"Earnings Calls","International Business Machines Corporation","Executives","Yes, good question, Toni. So if you look at the third quarter performance, we did start off the first 2 months of the quarter on a stronger trajectory that we saw from the full quarter as we saw a fall-off in our growth rates in the third month of the qua",566,"Yes, good question, Toni. So if you look at the third quarter performance, we did start off the first 2 months of the quarter on a stronger trajectory that we saw from the full quarter as we saw a fall-off in our growth rates in the third month of the quarter. Now within that third month phenomena, I would point to look at it from a brand perspective, it was really a fall-off that we saw in our GBS business, number one; in our software business, number two; and from a geographic perspective, it was really a fall-off that we saw in North America and our growth markets unit, which referred to as GMU. Now elementally, as you walk down those, the software content, I would attribute to a handful of deals that fell out of the quarter. Frankly, we thought we had those right through the end of the quarter. They rolled to the fourth quarter. They would have accounted for about 2 points improved performance, which would have been more consistent with what we saw in the first 2 months of the quarter. And those software deals were also part of the GMU performance. So just as our software business would have performed better in the quarter, with the roll up of those, that handful of deals, so would our GMU performance. Now as you look at our growth market performance in addition, they were impacted really by a couple of very large countries that had disappointing performance on a year-to-year basis. So that would be Mexico and Australia. They're both down double digits. Our BRIC countries, as a whole, were up 11% and within that plus 11% positive performance, very consistent with what we've seen historically, Brazil was, in fact, down 3%. But on the other countries, Russia was up 11%, India was up 13% and China was up a very strong 19%. Now let's look at the countries in GMU outside of the BRIC countries. Again, if we exclude Australia and Mexico, where we had the double-digit decline, the balance of the countries outside of the BRICs grew double-digit. In fact, we had 35 countries with double-digit performance. So I would not attribute some broader trend to either of those perspectives. In our GBS business, GBS once again produced very strong results on a solutions base, but we did have a more challenging environment for the more traditional packaged solutions. The other solution content is linked to our key growth initiatives, so it's very important that we do well there. So now if you take that data forward, end of the fourth quarter, I think on the software business, in the hardware business, outside of the impact of the Retail Store systems divestiture, we should be seeing mid-single-digit performance from both of them and driving double-digit profitability. I think our services business will have a revenue base similar to what we saw in the third quarter. But let me add, the services profitability that they each drove at 9% growth was right in the midpoint of their model performance. And with that, as well as the new announcement content that we're getting out of our hardware business, we have a new z, we have a new POWER7+ entering the high-end of our pSeries. We've got new storage content. We feel quite confident in the at least 15, 10 [ph] for the year."

I think the overall opportunity we have in cost really goes back, fundamentally, to the business model and how we drive that business model over longer periods of time. The workforce rebalancing that we've done this year, in total, that was about $800 million predominantly outside the U.S. and should have a payback about 15 months. Now we are constantly driving workforce rebalancing to [ph] our population to the best growth opportunities that we have. If you look at the overall cost and spending improvement that we saw in the third quarter, the first point I would make is that in a period of currency headwind that impact that, that has in the overall translational effect of currency, that's mitigated and partially offset obviously by the hedge. And you could kind of see that in the margin performance in our business. Our gross profit margins were up 1.2 points. Our PT I was up 2.5 points. In that differential, a large part [indiscernible] is the offset of the hedge helping to offset the impact that we saw on the revenue line and this flow-through the gross profit margin. The 1.2 points that we had in gross profit, that had a very solid mix component in about 4x a points for mix and a very solid spend component. And I think both of those are strong ongoing plays that we should leverage as we go into the fourth quarter in 2013. That mix component is predominantly the mix that we see in the Software that we've been driving for a decade. And the spend efficiencies are part of that overall $8 billion plan that we have for the 2015 roadmap, obviously, break that down by year, it's $1.6 billion; by quarter, it's about $400 million, if we get 30% to 40% to the bottom line, that's an advantage of about $150 million. The balance, I remind you, that really goes to making our offerings and our products more competitive. On a price basis, giving us the ability to move spend to more aggressive growth opportunities."

But I think I heard the substance to your question, so let me answer that. I think, I'm not going to kind of comment on the environment as if I were an economist, but I can tell you the facts that we saw in the substance of the business, which I kind of described so far. When you look at the overall issue of a fiscal cliff and a budget flush, I got to be honest, Steve, I've kind of react to the position because I don't think it'd be a responsible kind of performance for either public or private sector. I mean if we have spending requirements, I don't think people would rollout and maximize their spend rate this budget period to the expense of the overall spend requirements. I know if it was my business and one of my controllers, the CFOs, was ""driving a budget flush"", I'd be driving them out of the business. So certainly, the Controllers that I have met in government, they're very responsible. They're driving to do exactly the right thing. And if they see spending pressure, they're doing their work to help respond to that. To me, on a global basis, we look around the world. Governments are under pressure. Spending is under pressure. I don't think this is news to anybody. But I think, Steve, from my perspective, when you look at this proposition that there'll be a budget flush, to me, as I had said there, I cannot react to that because it implies, I think, that they wouldn't be responding to the base economic challenges they have and I don't think that's the case."

If you look at the overall backlog, our total backlog for the quarter was up 1%. Within that, our outsourcing backlog was relatively flat. Our transactional backlog, if you just do the math, was up 7% now. There are some dynamics that are pretty compelling within that. So when you look at that outsourcing backlog, and you break that down by unit, you see much more momentum in our growth markets. So if you take the total backlog for the business and break that down between major markets and growth markets, the backlog in our growth markets is up 15%. And that's kind of an ongoing momentum that we've seen in our services business in the growth markets. If you break this then down by unit, on the GTS base of business, I think they had a pretty good quarter there. And actually, the GTS business is up more than 1% as we enter the fourth quarter. I would also analyze the revenue performance in the quarter and remind you that we did take this very specific set of actions on the weak tail of the profitability distribution of our contracts. And as we took that action on the weak tail, that enhances, it improves our overall profitability, you saw in the first 9 months of the year, this year, with the strong performance we got out of the GTS business, but it does have an impact on the other side to revenue. And we knew that and we made that trade-off. Because our objective is derive real gross profit and real profitability in those contracts in the backlog. It's not that hard to go through a services business and drive big signings, but you have to live with that decision for a number of years in your relationship with your customer. And our objective is to establish a strong relationship right upfront with a profitable set of contracts that we know we can deliver over the longer term. So I think I would caution you from looking at that GTS business. You've got to recognize that there was some revenue impact as we optimize to profitability."

It was a little more challenging and muted [ph] performance on the infrastructure side. But as you look at the fourth quarter, I think we have opportunities across both. And so, again, adjusting for that handful of deals in software that fell out of the quarter, we would have seen performance more consistent with what we saw in the first 2 months of the quarter.

The first 2 we are introducing the new high-end POWER7+ and we're -- I think that has a lot of key technology offerings. It's only a part of the product line however, but it is a high-end. So we look at that as a real margin opportunity within the mix of their product line. Likewise, in the Storage business, we're announcing the new high-end content, introducing POWER7 to our architecture, and we think that likely has real opportunity in a high-end for not just revenue but margin contribution within our product line. But clearly, the big announcement for the quarter is the new z series. And as we look at the new z series, now we have a full quarter of opportunity. In third quarter, we're really only shipping the new z for about 11 days in the very back end of the quarter. And in front of that ship date, we only had about 3 weeks of selling time. So now it gives us the opportunity for a full quarter's worth. And as I look at it, I think they have very strong case on hardware basis for the new z platform to generate 20% to 30% growth. So within all that, that gives us confidence within our objectives that the hardware base of business, we'll be generating about 5% revenue growth outside of the impact of the divestiture, the Retail Store systems content. Now that divestment has about a 4-point impact to the hardware base of business and about a 1 point impact to IBM. But I think we do have a hand of that content, and we'll see it improve, the overall hardware performance, not just in North America, but as we go through the global rollout as well."

So let's look at the overall margin dynamics for the corporation. When you look at it, we are driving that very focused piece of work that Linda Sanford took you through at the Analyst Meeting to generate about $8 billion of spent take out across the",673,"Yes. So let's look at the overall margin dynamics for the corporation. When you look at it, we are driving that very focused piece of work that Linda Sanford took you through at the Analyst Meeting to generate about $8 billion of spent take out across the business and as I had said earlier, if you just kind of mathematically break it down, it's about $1.6 billion a year or $400 million a quarter, that content is in some respects outside of the business unit per view. And it gets to applied to those business units based on their kind of metrics and participation. So in other words, if we take big spend rate out of the back-office support organizations, the business units are the beneficiary that's been take out, but they didn't have to drive a lot of the content since we manage in a globally integrated enterprise. And that's a very structured play that we're driving, not only across our back office content but now into systematic areas that span across our processes and also spend rates within business units that collectively have more opportunities. So we intend to continue that overall spend dynamic. And as I had said earlier, our services business will certainly be a beneficiary there. Now in your question about the overall workforce rebalancing that we do, just given the fact that the services business have the largest share of our overall population, of course, they're going to be the beneficiary of that as well. But to me, on the longer-term basis, I think that the model base that we provided as part of the 2015 roadmap is the best criteria, the best content that you can see as you look at that long-term run rate. So as you look at how we would attempt to implement those as we go into 2013, I mean, believe me, this team is going to look at the actuals that we drive in 2012. We're going to draw a [indiscernible] line to that 2015 objective, and then we're going to base our profitability, our free cash flow, all of those content, our budget support it, as well as our compensation. So that's how we'll be driving that.
So let me just take a moment now to wrap up the call. Now despite facing challenges, we did deliver a 7% growth in profit, 10% growth in our operating EPS. And I think consistent with the last conversation, that performance reflects our disciplined approach to delivering profit growth. The quarter we had 10% growth on our software profit, 9% from our services businesses, both of which benefit from a large annuity base. We're continuing to move up the value chain, shifting our portfolio to more strategic areas. Now we had continued momentum and our growth initiatives, both Smarter Planet, Business Analytics, as well as our Cloud, were all up strong double digits. And this quarter, we completed the divestiture of our Retail Store Solutions business. The benefits from our ongoing work on productivity showed through to our margin. And we're returning value to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. So looking forward, as we enter the fourth quarter, as always, we need to execute. And we need the growth market in software to close those rollover deals that we discussed and drive an improved trajectory in the fourth quarter. We need GBS to drive more of that traditional packaged transactions content, while maintaining the good momentum they've shown in our growth initiatives. And I think North America needs to capitalize on the great hardware product lineup we have for the fourth quarter with then new z, a new p and storage to drive transactional sales performance in the fourth quarter. So based on this, we are confident on our plans to achieve at least $15.10 of operating EPS for the year. That's up 12% from last year and on track to at least $20 in 2015. 
So once again, thanks for joining us and, now, as always, it's back to work."

For the year, we're maintaining our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS of at least $15.10. That's up 12% over last year. 
Looking at our third quarter revenue by geography, Europe was fairly consistent with last quarter; Japan's revenue stabilized; the BRIC countries, in total, performed well again; but North America declined.
When I look at our skew of business in the quarter, through the first 2 months, our revenue was fairly consistent with our second quarter performance. The third month of the quarter was more challenging. This quarter, we delivered double-digit operating earnings per share growth, driven by our strength in our solutions offerings, a solid annuity base and our ongoing work on productivity. First, we continued to drive very good results in our solutions offerings across software and services that addressed key demand areas like Smarter Planet, Business Analytics and Cloud. Second, our annuity businesses, which represent about half of our annual revenue and 60% of our profit provided a solid base of revenue and profit. And third, we're continuing to execute on our productivity initiatives on track to deliver $8 billion of productivity over the 2015 roadmap. The benefit from these initiatives, together with our mixed and more profitable businesses, help to drive our margin expansion.
Now before I get into the financial metrics, I want to remind you that this quarter, we closed the sale of our Retail Store Solutions point-of-sale business to Toshiba TEC in most countries. The transaction results in a loss of revenue and profit for the divested operations, a gain on the sale and an impact to our tax rate. As we go through the presentation, I'll clarify the impact of each of these. 
In the quarter, IBM's revenue was down 5%, including the currency headwind of nearly 4 points. At constant currency, we were down 2%, or down 1% if you normalize for the RSS divestiture. But despite of this revenue decline, we had solid operating profit growth with pretax income up 7% and net income up 5%. 
Our margin expansion was driven by our productivity initiatives, improving business mix and the overall currency dynamics. This quarter, we expanded operating gross margin by 1.2 points with about 60% due to improvements in margins and the balance from mix. With good expense management, we improved operating PTI margin by 2.5 points. 
This quarter, our tax rate was up over 1 point year-to-year. The increase was driven by a higher tax rate on the gain from the sale of our RSS business. We now expect an operating effective tax rate, excluding one-time items in the range of 24.5% for the year. Bottom line, we delivered operating EPS of $3.62, which was up 10% year-to-year. 
When you look at the year-to-year drivers of our operating EPS performance, the 5% decline in revenue of constant margin impacted profit growth by $0.17 per share. Margin expansion was the largest contributor to our growth. Within that, the gain on the RSS divestiture contributed $0.23, gross margin expansion added $0.19 and our expense productivity, another $0.16. On the other hand, we did have an increase in our workforce for balancing activity for an impact of $0.24. 
Our ongoing share repurchase program contributed to balance at a level fairly consistent with the first 2 quarters of the year.  As you can see, the dynamics are very similar to our first half performance. 
Now I'll get into the third quarter details, starting with revenue by geography, where I'll discuss the results on a constant currency basis. Americas revenue was down 3%, with declines in both the U.S. and Canada. In North America, software was up 4%, services was down, and we had a double-digit decline in hardware. With revenue performance relatively consistent with last quarter, EMEA was stable. 
Looking at the performance by country, Germany and Spain grew, the U.K. was flat, while France and Italy declined. Turning to Asia Pacific, last quarter, I said that I expected our business in Japan to stabilize. This quarter, our revenue in Japan was flat year-to-year. So certainly, an improvement over the last several quarters. We had good performance in both Europe and Japan given the environment.
In our growth markets countries, which we refer to as GMU, the BRICs had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 11%. We had double-digit growth in Russia, which was up 11%; India, up 13%; and China, up 19%. Brazil, however, was down 3%. Looking beyond the BRICs, Australia and Mexico were down double digits this quarter, while most of the other countries continue to do well. In fact, this quarter, 35 of the growth market countries grew at a double-digit rate, reflecting ongoing broad-based strength.
Looking at IBM revenue and gross margin by segment, our total services revenue was flat, as modest revenue growth from our backlog was offset by impacts from shorter-term and volume-related activity. Software performance was driven by double-digit growth across our solutions area like Business Analytics, commerce and Social Business. Our Systems and Technology revenue declined each month, though performance in September improved as we introduced our next-generation System z. 
Turning to gross profit. Our operating gross margins improved 1.2 points, driven by a combination of margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative performance of software. 
Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile. Our total operating expense and other income was down 10%. The primary driver was currency, which drove 8 points from both translation and hedging dynamics. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 3 points of expense growth. So consequently, our base expense was better by 5 points. 
Now I'll comment on a few expense items. SG&A includes a pretax charge of over $400 million for workforce rebalancing activity, which, at IBM's average tax rate, impacted net income by about $310 million. Other income and expense had 2 drivers. First, a pretax gain for the sale of our Retail Store Solutions business and second, we had a year-to-year impact from our hedging activity. The pretax gain for the RSS sale is almost $450 million. With the discrete tax rate on that gain based on the countries closed, the transaction contributed about $280 million of net income.
Turning to the hedging activity, we hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility and our global cash planning. Last year, hedging programs generated losses, resulting in an impact to expense of about $175 million. While these year, the programs generated gains of about $100 million in expense, roughly 90% of our hedging activity this quarter was an expense. The balance is in cost. As you know, this hedging activity can't be looked at in isolation as it mitigates translation impacts throughout the P&L.
Looking at how all of this translates into pretax margins by segment, we've provided here a normalized view of the profit and margin dynamics, by removing the workforce rebalancing charges in both years to give you a better view of the underlying operational performance of the segments. On this basis, you can see good profit growth and margin expansion in Global Technology Services, Global Business Services and Software. 
Now let's turn to the segments, starting with services. The 2 services segments delivered $14.5 billion in revenue and, excluding workforce rebalancing charges, grew pretax profit 9% and expanded pretax margins by just over 2 points. Backlog was $138 billion, up 1% year-to-year. We continue to see strong performance in the growth markets, with backlog up 15% at constant currency. And globally, transactional backlog was up 7% at constant currency. 
Turning to the 2 segments. In Global Technology Services, revenue was $9.9 billion, down 4% as reported and up 1% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue was flat at constant currency. As we've previously discussed, there were 3 primary sources of revenue in outsourcing: First, revenue from backlog, which makes up the majority of the revenue in the year; second, revenue from new client signings within the year; and finally, revenue from base growth, which comes from new business sold into the existing accounts and from volumes generated within the quarter.
This quarter, we continued to get revenue growth from our backlog. However, we did see a decline in revenue from base growth after growing through the first half. Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 3% at constant currency, with the growth markets up 13% at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered flat pretax profit growth in the quarter, though excluding workforce rebalancing charges, pretax profit was up 9% with 2 points of margin expansion. 
This quarter, there are a number of drivers of margin expansion: First, increased contribution from the growth markets, which continued to drive higher gross margin than our major markets; second, lift from our continued focus on automation and process, primarily through our enterprise productivity initiatives; and finally, we continue to benefit from the work GTS has done to improve performance in a select set of lower margin contracts within Strategic Outsourcing. 
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.5 billion, down 6% as reported or down 3% at constant currency. Looking at revenue from a geographic perspective, the growth markets continued to drive the strongest performance. Japan returned to growth this quarter, with revenue up 2% at constant currency, while North America and Europe were both down 6% at constant currency. Looking at the GBS business by offering, the growth initiatives continued to drive strong growth. We had solid double-digit growth in Business Analytics, Smarter Planet and Cloud. Together, these initiatives represent about 1/3 of total GBS revenue. 
So we continue to get great traction in these growth initiatives, and we're seeing the benefits across IBM. The overall growth rate of GBS is being impacted by declines in some of the more traditional packaged application projects. 
Turning to profit, GBS pretax income declined 5% year-to-year. However, when adjusting for workforce rebalancing, pretax income grew 9% and pretax margin expanded 2.5 points.  Margin expansion benefited from prior quarters' workforce rebalancing, yield from enterprise productivity initiatives and a help from currency. 
Software revenue of $5.8 billion was down 1% and up 3% at constant currency. Through August, revenue was up 5% at constant currency. However, performance in September was weak, particularly in North America and the growth markets. Our portfolio of solutions offerings was up double digits year-to-year, while the complementary infrastructure portfolio was essentially flat. 
Now let me take you through the drivers for the brands. WebSphere grew 5% at constant currency and continued to extend its market-leading position. We had good growth from our commerce offerings, which target not only the CIO but also the CMO, so we're reaching new buyers. This performance was bolstered by our recent acquisition of Tealeaf, which enables clients to analyze interactions on websites and mobile devices.
Information Management was up 3% at constant currency. Performance was driven by strong growth in our Business Analytics offerings, led by Algorithmics, which, together with our deep analytics expertise, helps our clients manage risk and better enable faster decision-making. Just last week, Software announced new members of the PureSystems family, the IBM PureData systems. These expert integrated systems are optimized to deliver high performance data services for transactional and analytics applications. 
Tivoli software was up 9% at constant currency and gained share. Revenue from our Storage portfolio was up 14% at constant currency, reflecting the value of Storage software. Tivoli Security was up 9% at constant currency, driven by Q1 Labs, which provides next-generation security intelligence. Lotus declined 7% at constant currency in the quarter. Although Notes declined, we had strong performance in our Social Business offerings. In the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of Kenexa, which further expand our solution portfolio for Social Business. We expect Kenexa to close late in the fourth quarter.
Software pretax income was $2.4 billion, up 6% from last year. Normalized for the high level of workforce rebalancing, Software pretax income was up 10% and pretax margin expanded 3.5 points. 
Systems and Technology delivered revenue of $3.9 billion, down 13%. Adjusting for the divestiture of Retail Store Solutions, revenue was down 11% or 9% at constant currency. 
System z revenue declined 19% at constant currency and MIPS declined 2%. Late in the third quarter, we started shipping the zEnterprise EC12 server, which delivers up to 25% improved application performance and up to 50% enhanced capacity, making it the fastest and most capable enterprise system to date. This new mainframe will be ramping through the fourth quarter.
POWER revenue was down 1% at constant currency. We had strength again this quarter in POWER high performance computing solutions. We continued our success in competitive takeouts. This quarter, we had over 260 competitive displacements, which resulted in over $200 million of business which came almost equally from HP and Oracle/Sun. This initiative helped drive our 18th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER. 
Early in October, we announced the new POWER7+ based servers. These new systems offer performance boosts of 30% to 40% compared to prior versions and new capabilities for cloud and security. 
System x revenue was down 3% at constant currency. Our Storage hardware revenue was down 8% at constant currency, while Storage software, which is reported in Tivoli, was up 14% at constant currency. We continue to see value shifting to software. 
Earlier this month, we announced the new high-end DS8870, which enables clients to take full advantage of the increased performance in our new high-end enterprise servers. We're expanding our Storage software capabilities as well. Last week, we announced a virtual storage center, which integrates multiple software solutions to deliver fast backup and restore in a virtualized storage environment.
As you look to the fourth quarter, we have significantly enhanced our systems portfolio with our new zEnterprise EC12 mainframe, Power Systems based on the new POWER7+ architecture and new storage systems, including the high-end DS8870.
Across all of our segment, we're continuing the strong performance in our key growth initiatives. In the growth markets, we're expanding into new markets, building out IT infrastructures and focusing on targeted industries. For the year, revenue was up 7% at constant currency, and we've gained share. Our business analytic solutions help our clients to identify, manage and predict outcomes by leveraging huge amounts of data. Our broad portfolio of analytic solutions was up 14% through the third quarter, led by our GBS consulting practice. Our SmartCloud portfolio addresses the full scope of enterprise client requirements with strong growth across the offerings from private cloud to public cloud to our industry-based solutions. Cloud revenue, so far this year, has already exceeded our full year revenue for 2011. 
All of this comes together on our Smarter Planet solutions. Through the third quarter, we had revenue growth of more than 20% in the Smarter Planet portfolio, with traction in our Smarter Commerce and industry solutions.
When you look at our offerings in our Business Analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet, about half of the revenue is software. So the success we're having in these areas is improving our business mix and our margin. 
Turning to cash flow, we generated $3.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. 
Now let me walk through the year-to-year drivers. Our operating net income was up $200 million year-to-year and GAAP income is flat. One of the nonoperating items this quarter is a charge for U.K. pension. On October 12, the U.K. court issued a ruling regarding an IBM U.K. pension plan. We took a pretax charge of approximately $160 million or $125 million after tax. Though the charge impacted GAAP net income, it did not impact operating income. And since it's a noncash item, it's reversed in a fee cash flow analysis. 
Looking at the items that impacted cash year-to-year, our cash tax payments increased $300 million. We had an increase of almost $100 million for our workforce rebalancing payments and our capital expenditures were also up year-to-year. So though operating profit was up $200 million, free cash flow was down almost $350 million based on the increased tax, capital and restructuring payments.
Through the first 3 quarters of the year, our free cash flow was up $1 billion year-over-year to $8.7 billion. Our growth in net income was partially offset with increased capital investments. As I mentioned previously, in the first quarter of last year, our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments, driven by audit settlement activity. 
Looking at the uses of our cash through September, we spent $2.3 billion to acquire 10 companies, including Texas Memory Systems, which closed in the third quarter. 
We've returned almost $12 billion to shareholders this year. We paid out over $2.8 billion in dividends and spent $9 billion in share repurchase to buyback almost 46 million shares. At the end of the third quarter, we had $6.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12.3 billion. Total debt was $33.7 billion, of which $23.3 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at just over 7:1. Our non-financing debt was $10.3 billion, and our nonfinancing debt to cap was 36%, consistent with June. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long-term.
Wrapping up our discussion on the quarter, we delivered 10% operating EPS growth and $3.1 billion in free cash flow. Within our operations, we had solid contribution from our annuity businesses and strong performance in our growth initiatives: Smarter Planet, Business Analytics and Cloud. Our productivity initiatives helped to drive margin expansion and our solid balance sheet and cash generation supported shareholder returns. 
As we move into the fourth quarter, we have new product introductions in our systems portfolio, not just in System z, but also in POWER and Storage. We've just announced PureSystems offerings that leverage our software capabilities. And late in the quarter, we expect to close the acquisition of Kenexa.
Taking all of this into account, we're maintaining our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS of at least $15.10. This keeps us on track to at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015. 
Now Patricia and I will take your questions."

Relative to expectations, revenues were short. Your tone, I think, sounded a bit more cautious and you made several references to the U.S. being weaker and the third month of the quarter being more challenging. So specifically on those latter 2 points, can you help us understand what you think happened? Is this being driven by macroeconomic issues? Are these IBM execution issues? And if we roll -- if we look forward, are you expecting either the execution or the macro issues to reverse or improve in the fourth quarter?"
112350,222673428,365536,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2012",2012-10-16,"Earnings Calls","International Business Machines Corporation","Executives","Yes, good question, Toni. So if you look at the third quarter performance, we did start off the first 2 months of the quarter on a stronger trajectory that we saw for the full quarter as we saw a falloff in our growth rates in the third month of the quart",566,"Yes, good question, Toni. So if you look at the third quarter performance, we did start off the first 2 months of the quarter on a stronger trajectory that we saw for the full quarter as we saw a falloff in our growth rates in the third month of the quarter. Now within that third month phenomena, I would point to look at it from a brand perspective, it was really a falloff that we saw in our GBS business, number one; in our software business, number two; and from a geographic perspective, it was really a falloff that we saw in North America in our growth markets unit, which we refer to as GMU. Now elementally, as you walk down those, the software content, I would attribute to a handful of deals that fell out of the quarter. Frankly, we thought we had those right through the end of the quarter. They rolled to the fourth quarter. They would have accounted for about 2 points improved performance, which would have been more consistent with what we saw in the first 2 months of the quarter. And those software deals were also part of the GMU performance. So just as our software business would have performed better in the quarter, with the roll up of those, that handful of deals, so would our GMU performance. Now as you look at our growth market performance in addition, they were impacted really by a couple of very large countries that had disappointing performance on a year-to-year basis. So that would be Mexico and Australia. They're both down double digits. Our BRIC countries, as a whole, were up 11% and within that plus 11% positive performance, very consistent with what we've seen historically, Brazil was, in fact, down 3%. But on the other countries, Russia was up 11%, India was up 13% and China was up a very strong 19%. Now let's look at the countries in GMU outside of the BRIC countries. Again, if we exclude Australia and Mexico, where we had the double-digit decline, the balance of the countries outside of the BRICs grew double-digit. In fact, we had 35 countries with double-digit performance. So I would not attribute some broader trend to either of those perspectives. In our GBS business, GBS once again produced very strong results on a solutions base, but we did have a more challenging environment for the more traditional packaged solutions. The other solution content is linked to our key growth initiatives, so it's very important that we do well there. So now if you take that data forward into the fourth quarter, I think on the software business, in the hardware business, outside of the impact of the Retail Store systems divestiture, we should be seeing mid-single-digit performance from both of them and driving double-digit profitability. I think our services business will have a revenue base similar to what we saw in the third quarter. But let me add, the services profitability that they each drove, that 9% growth was right in the midpoint of their model performance. And with that, as well as the new announcement content that we're getting out of our hardware business, we have a new z, we have a new POWER7+ entering the high-end of our pSeries. We've got new storage content. We feel quite confident in the at least 15, 10 [ph] for the year."

I think the overall opportunity we have in cost really goes back, fundamentally, to the business model and how we drive that business model over longer periods of time. The workforce rebalancing that we've done this year, in total, that was about $800 million predominantly outside the U.S. and should have a payback of about 15 months. Now we are constantly driving, workforcing, balancing to attune our population to the best growth opportunities that we have. If you look at the overall cost and spending improvement that we saw in the third quarter, the first point I would make is that in a period of currency headwind, that impact that, that has in the overall translational effect of currency, that's mitigated and partially offset obviously by the hedge. And you could kind of see that in the margin performance in our business. Our gross profit margins were up 1.2 points. Our PTI was up 2.5 points. In that differential, a large part [indiscernible] is the offset of the hedge helping to offset the impact that we saw on the revenue line and this flow-through the gross profit margin. The 1.2 points that we had in gross profit, that had a very solid mix component, about 4x a points for mix and a very solid spend component. And I think both of those are strong ongoing plays that we should leverage as we go into the fourth quarter in 2013. That mix component is predominantly the mix that we see in the Software that we've been driving for a decade. And the spend efficiencies are part of that overall $8 billion plan that we have for the 2015 roadmap, obviously, break that down by year, it's $1.6 billion; by quarter, it's about $400 million, if we get 30% to 40% to the bottom line, that's an advantage of about $150 million. The balance, I remind you, that really goes to making our offerings and our products more competitive. On a price basis, giving us the ability to move spend to more aggressive growth opportunities."

I think, as I'm not going to kind of comment on the environment as if I were an economist, but I can tell you the facts that we saw in the substance of the business, which I kind of described so far. When you look at the overall issue of a fiscal cliff and a budget flush, I got to be honest, Steve, I've kind of react to the position because I don't think it'd be a responsible kind of a performance for either public or private sector. I mean if we have spending requirements, I don't think people would roll out and maximize their spend rate this budget period to the expense of the overall spend requirements. I know if it was my business and one of my controllers, the CFOs, was ""driving a budget flush"", I'd be driving them out of business. So certainly, the Controllers that I have met in government, they're very responsible. They're driving to do exactly the right thing. And if they see spending pressure, they're doing their work to help respond to that. To me, on a global basis, we look around the world. Governments are under pressure. Spending is under pressure. I don't think this is news to anybody. But I think, Steve, from my perspective, when you look at this proposition that there'll be a budget flush, to me, as I had said earlier, I couldn't react to that because it implies, I think, that they wouldn't be responding to the base economic challenges they have and I don't think that's the case."

If you look at the overall backlog, our total backlog for the quarter was up 1%. Within that, our outsourcing backlog was relatively flat. Our transactional backlog, if you just do the math, was up 7% now. There are some dynamics that are pretty compelling within that. So when you look at that outsourcing backlog, and you break that down by unit, you see much more momentum in our growth markets. So if you take the total backlog for the business and break that down between major markets and growth markets, the backlog in our growth markets is up 15%. And that's kind of an ongoing momentum that we've seen in our services business in the growth markets. If you break this then down by unit, on the GTS base of business, I think they had a pretty good quarter there. And actually, the GTS business is up more than 1% as we enter the fourth quarter. I would also analyze the revenue performance in the quarter and remind you that we did take this very specific set of actions on the weak tail of the profitability distribution of our contracts. And as we took that action on the weak tail, that enhances, it improves our overall profitability, you saw in the first 9 months of the year, this year, with the strong performance we got out of the GTS business, but it does have an impact on the other side to revenue. And we knew that and we made that trade-off. Because our objective is to derive real gross profit and real profitability in those contracts in the backlog. It's not that hard to go through a services business and drive big signings, but you have to live with that decision for a number of years in your relationship with your customer. And our objective is to establish a strong relationship right up front with a profitable set of contracts that we know we can deliver over the longer term. So I think I would caution you from looking at that GTS business. You've got to recognize that there was some revenue impact as we optimize to profitability."

And I got to say, the services business is not like the software business. It is not like the hardware business. It is a specific skill set. So to the point that there is impact to one of our competitors' profile, that certainly should provide us opportunity. But when you look at the kind of broader trends that I think are more significant, I think you got to look at the opportunity we're seeing in the growth market. And again, when you look at an opportunity set in growth markets where we have about 20% of our backlog to be up 15%, that's a pretty strong statement at very strong levels of profitability where if you want to see where we can really put talent on the field differentiated from the competition, there are a lot of examples in the growth markets."

Now that period of bringing that sales resource up to speed takes some time. But underneath that, if you look at our software business, the solutions content underneath it had a very strong quarter, up double-digit once again. And the solutions content is both organically generated, as well as the implementation of the integration with our acquisition profile, and that's been very strong across the portfolio of offerings. It was a little more challenging and muted performance on the infrastructure side. But as you look at the fourth quarter, I think we have opportunities across both. And so again, adjusting for that handful of deals in software that fell out of the quarter, we would have seen performance more consistent with what we saw in the first 2 months of the quarter. And I think we have the opportunity to close those deals and get back on a stronger trajectory as we go into the fourth quarter. So I think we've got a good software play here, and I would look for them to generate mid-single-digits revenue growth in the fourth."

I think the business did what we said we were going to drive in Japan. We did stabilize our business in Japan. I think the team in Japan did a nice job. What we really wrestled with a little here was the challenge that we had in those more traditional packaged solutions. And they were generally kind of third-party offerings and HR supply chain or ERP. On the flip side of the coin though, we did a great job in GBS on those key growth initiatives in the solutions attached to those. So on one hand, I would have liked to have seen -- I know the team would have liked to have seen better performance in those additional packaged areas and we're going to be rebuilding capability as we go into the fourth quarter in 2013, but I thought they did a very nice job on the solutions business, which is so important because it cuts across our business profile into hardware, software and services business. And let me remind you, as we all know, those solutions drive about 50% mix in overall software business. So we can do better as we work on that traditional packaged solutions, but I think they deserve a lot of credit for the work they have done on the solutions business."

The first 2 we are introducing the new high-end POWER7+ and we're -- I think that has a lot of key technology offerings. It's only a part of the product line however, but it is a high-end. So we look at that as a real margin opportunity within the mix of their product line. Likewise, in the Storage business, we're announcing the new high-end content, introducing POWER7 to our architecture, and we think that likely has real opportunity in a high-end for not just revenue but margin contribution within their product line. But clearly, the big announcement for the quarter is the new z series. And as we look at the new z series, now we have a full quarter of opportunity. In third quarter, we're really only shipping the new z for about 11 days in the very back end of the quarter. And in front of that ship date, we only had about 3 weeks of selling time. So now it gives us the opportunity for a full quarter's worth. And as I look at it, I think they have a very strong case on hardware basis for the new z platform to generate 20% to 30% growth. So within all that, that gives us confidence within our objectives that the hardware base of business ought to be generating about 5% revenue growth outside of the impact of the divestiture to the Retail Store systems content. Now that divestment has about a 4-point impact to the hardware base of business and about a 1 point impact to IBM. But I think we do have a good hand on that content, and we'll see it improve, the overall hardware performance, not just in North America, but as we go through the global rollout as well."

And then secondarily, are most of the workforce rebalancing efforts targeted at driving services margins? And if so, can you frame a medium-term margin target for the services business say in 2013? Do you expect margins to improve further from these levels?"
112350,222673428,365536,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2012",2012-10-16,"Earnings Calls","International Business Machines Corporation","Executives","Yes. So let's look at the overall margin dynamics for the corporation. When you look at it, we are driving that very focused piece of work that Linda Sanford took you through at the Analyst Meeting to generate about $8 billion of spend takeout across the",673,"Yes. So let's look at the overall margin dynamics for the corporation. When you look at it, we are driving that very focused piece of work that Linda Sanford took you through at the Analyst Meeting to generate about $8 billion of spend takeout across the business and as I had said earlier, if you just kind of mathematically break it down, it's about $1.6 billion a year or $400 million a quarter, that content is in some respects outside of the business unit purview. And it gets to applied to those business units based on their kind of metrics and participation. So in other words, if we take big spend rate out of the back-office support organizations, the business units are the beneficiary that's been take out, but they didn't have to drive a lot of the content since we manage on a globally integrated enterprise. And that's a very structured play that we're driving, not only across our back office content but now into systematic areas that span across our processes and also spend rates within business units that collectively have more opportunities. So we intend to continue that overall spend dynamic. And as I had said earlier, our services business will certainly be a beneficiary there. Now in your question about the overall workforce rebalancing that we do, just given the fact that the services business have the largest share of our overall population, of course, they're going to be the beneficiary of that as well. But to me, on the longer-term basis, I think that the model base that we provided as part of the 2015 roadmap is the best criteria, the best content that you can see as you look at that long-term run rate. So as you look at how we would attempt to implement those as we go into 2013, I mean, believe me, this team is going to look at the actuals that we drive in 2012. We're going to draw a plum line to that 2015 objective, and then we're going to base our profitability, our free cash flow, all of those content and our budget to support it, as well as our compensation. So that's how we'll be driving that.
So let me just take a moment now to wrap up the call. Now despite facing challenges, we did deliver a 7% growth in profit, 10% growth in our operating EPS. And I think consistent with the last conversation, that performance reflects our disciplined approach to delivering profit growth. The quarter we had 10% growth on our software profit, 9% from our services businesses, both of which benefit from a large annuity base. We're continuing to move up the value chain, shifting our portfolio to more strategic areas. Now we had continued momentum in our growth initiatives, both Smarter Planet, Business Analytics, as well as our Cloud were all up strong double digits. And this quarter, we completed the divestiture of our Retail Store Solutions business. 
The benefits from our ongoing work on productivity showed through to our margin. And we're returning value to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. So looking forward, as we enter the fourth quarter, as always, we need to execute. And we need the growth market in software to close those rollover deals that we discussed and drive an improved trajectory in the fourth quarter. We need GBS to drive more of that traditional packaged transactions content, while maintaining the good momentum they've shown in our growth initiatives. And I think North America needs to capitalize on the great hardware product lineup we have for the fourth quarter with the new z, a new p and storage to drive transactional sales performance in the fourth quarter. So based on this, we are confident in our plans to achieve at least $15.10 of operating EPS for the year. That's up 12% from last year and on track to at least $20 in 2015. 
So once again, thanks for joining us and now, as always, it's back to work."
