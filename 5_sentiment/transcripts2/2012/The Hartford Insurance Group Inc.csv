Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Last evening, we announced fourth quarter results that were in line with what we discussed in December with book value per diluted share up 17% over the last year. Results were i",992,"Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Last evening, we announced fourth quarter results that were in line with what we discussed in December with book value per diluted share up 17% over the last year. Results were improved from the third quarter but 2011 was a challenging year with the weak macroeconomic environment and unusually bad weather.
We're encouraged by some of the recent economic developments. Domestic business activity, employment data and consumption trends also just returned to moderate GDP growth. And the European central banks' additional support measures have had a positive impact in the marketplace. But we remain cautious about the operating environment for 2012. Many of the factors, low interest rates and market volatility are likely to continue to have some impact in 2012.
So given this environment, as we said in December, we are aggressively managing the levers within our control to increase profitability and generate shareholder value. Across the organization, as you'll hear we're prioritizing profit over sales volume, driving greater expense efficiencies and growing where we are generating appropriate return.
In Commercial Markets, we achieved accelerated rate increase across most P&C Commercial lines. As we expected, pricing crossed the inflection point and exceeded loss costs for most of our lines in the fourth quarter. As these written pricing changes erring in over 2012, we expect to see margin expansion throughout the P&C commercial portfolio, particularly in our Middle Market books.
Doug and his team have accomplished a great deal since his arrival. They are making material improvements across their business like building our property capabilities to move us to a more diversified P&C Commercial book. We now have dedicated property specialists in each of our Middle Market region. And In addition, we've hired several senior underwriters to strengthen our core property that significantly enhanced our property risk tools. This focused effort has already turned several strong prospects into Hartford customers. We've also realigned the sales force against customer segments for both Commercial and Consumer Markets. This will increase our response against customers, brokers and agents, while heightening accountability for results.
In Consumer Markets, Andy and his team has focused the book on the more targeted, preferred customer segment. This strategy is paying off with notable margin improvement in the fourth quarter.
The AARP relationship continues to be a competitive advantage for us, along with strong new business growth in the AARP Direct business we are seeing good momentum with the AARP products sold through the agency channel. About 80% of new business is hitting our targeted, mature preferred demographic.
For Wealth Management, as you know we separated several of the division's businesses into a Runoff segment in December. The financials are broken up for the first time this quarter so you can better evaluate progress in our ongoing businesses, as well as those on Runoff Operations.
Earlier this week, we appointed and use separate dedicated leadership team for the group, with Dave Bedard, the former CFO for Wealth Management heading the team. David is a 26-year finance veteran with expert knowledge of this and other complex financial products. Dave will be joined by Adan Kidney, who is the CEO and President of our Japan business and Peter Sanda Tzero who is more recently CEO of the Global Annuity business. I'm pleased that Dave, Adan and Peter are taking on these important new roles.
This team is charged with more efficiently managing these blocks of business, reducing their size, risk, volatility and capital consumption and we will run this business as its own segment with segregated financials.
In the ongoing Wealth Management businesses, Dave Levenson and his team are focused on increasing returns and managing risks in this low rate environment. As an example, we raised rates on Life Insurance several times in the last 18 months. We also believe that our targeted product and distribution initiatives are ensuring that we successfully compete in the marketplace and achieve adequate returns.
For example, we recently announced an agreement where Wellington management will serve as the sole subadvisor, pending the mutual fund board approval for The Hartford's fixed income and equity mutual fund. Our largest distribution partners are excited about this relationship as it positions The Hartford as a more significant player in the fixed income space and the mutual fund industry overall.
In Life Insurance, we have significantly expanded our distribution efforts, opening up new sales channels. We're maintaining our leadership in wire houses and banks but the independent channel now makes up about 48% of our total sales.
As you know, we are also focused on driving greater efficiency at The Hartford and are making good progress toward our aggregate $450 million target by streamlining operations, rationalizing management layers and leveraging technology. This is a 3-year effort. We reduced run rate expenses by $150 million in 2011 and we'll continue to deliver on this objective in '12 and '13.
Fourth quarter results also demonstrated the effectiveness of our risk management capabilities. We discussed our Japan hedging program in detail back in October and the year end surplus performed in line with what we told you in December. As a result of continued confidence in our capital position, in December we began repurchasing shares. We have bought back just under $100 million of shares to date and expect to be active in the market again shortly. We intend to complete the full $500 million share buyback by early second quarter 2012.
With the company stabilized and strengthened, our entire team is working to increase shareholder value. We do not believe the current stock price reflects the true value of the company. And so as I said in December, at our investor presentation, we are evaluating our strategy and our business portfolio for opportunities to deliver greater value for shareholders. We will be objective and pragmatic about the best ways to achieve this goal.
I'll now turn the call over to Chris."
341546,145779037,217198,"Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2012",2012-02-08,"Earnings Calls","The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone, I'll begin on Slide 5. As Liam mentioned, fourth quarter results were in line with the outlook we provided in December. We saw areas of good performance throughout the ongoing businesses that provide positive momen",2274,"Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone, I'll begin on Slide 5. As Liam mentioned, fourth quarter results were in line with the outlook we provided in December. We saw areas of good performance throughout the ongoing businesses that provide positive momentum for 2012. Fourth quarter core earnings were $339 million, including a $47 million DAC unlock benefit.
On Slide 5, you'll see several items that adversely impacted core earnings this quarter. These items totaled $69 million, including several items that I estimated at our Investor Day. The principal difference was that the original estimate was for catastrophe losses, which totaled $14 million pretax.
During the quarter, we had $39 million of new cat losses that were offset by $25 million of favorable development on second and third quarter cats. This compares to our fourth quarter estimate of about $50 million. In addition, we had favorable DAC unlock of $47 million. In Investor Day, we estimated fourth quarter quarter earnings would be between $0.80 and $0.85 per diluted share adjusted for the items that we just discussed. Actual results were $0.83.
Returns on alternative investments, which are volatile where essentially 0 in the quarter versus $67 million pretax in the third quarter. Fund valuations were negatively impacted by third quarter equity market performance. Given the typical one quarter lag, we'd expect alternative returns to rebound in the first quarter of 2012.
On Slide 6, we have broken out fourth quarter core earnings into our ongoing and Runoff divisions. These numbers exclude the Corporate division, which reflects holding company interest income and expenses. Going forward, we'll provide you this breakout on a quarterly basis to clearly show the on earnings performance of our ongoing businesses.
On Slide 7, book value per diluted share rose to $47.25, an increase of 17% over the last 12 months. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share rose by 6% to $44.86. These amounts do not reflect the implementation of the new DAC accounting standard, which is effective January 1 of this year. After adoption, all-in book value would declined about $1.5 billion or $3.09 per share. We will publish restated 2011 segment results that reflect the impact of the new accounting standard in March.
As Liam mentioned, we began our share repurchase program in December. Through early 2012, we have completed $94 million of the $500 million authorization. We will be active in the market very soon and intend to complete the authorization by early second quarter of 2012.
Let's turn to our business results by segment. Slide 8 shows the summary results for Commercial Markets. Core earnings were $40 million compared with $231 million in the prior year. This quarter results reflect adverse reserve development in P&C Commercial, as well as challenges in Group Benefits. P&C Commercial reported core earnings of $25 million, reflecting the $109 million pretax of net prior year development and $87 million pretax of current year development.
These increases, which we discussed in early December, reflect higher claim frequency on the 2010 accident year in our Worker's Compensation book and the roll forward impact on the 2011 accident year. The increase in frequency is an industry-wide trend. The current accident year reserve strengthening was 5.6 points on the fourth quarter combined ratio of 101.5 ex cats ex prior year. Early indications of claim activity since this adjustment show our estimates for 2010 and 2011 are holding. But it's still early for these accident years.
As Liam mentioned, we saw accelerating rate increases across all lines in the fourth quarter. Overall, renewal pricing increased 5% with stronger results in our Middle Market business, where we achieved a 10% increase on workers comp renewals. This grew from 7.5% in October to over 11% in December. We did see a decline in retention, but we are willing to shed some renewal business to improve margins.
Shifting to Group Benefits. Core earnings of $15 million were below our expectations. The loss ratio of 80.5 reflected elevated disability incidents. Our management actions have been focused on improving pricing to offset loss ratio pressure. We continue our highly selective pricing approach, targeting specific rate actions on a case-by-case basis. While we are making progress in putting more rate into the book, the market remains competitive for well performing accounts.
Consumer Markets core quarter earnings of $83 million are summarized on Slide 9. The combined ratio ex cats ex prior year was 93.0, 3.8 points better than prior-year year, this largely reflects 2011 price increases earning into our book of business, particularly in auto. New business written premium rebounded strongly in the second half of 2011. It's now back to acceptable levels after a decline in 2010 and the first half of 2011. These improvements are a direct result of targeted new business initiatives and the expansion of the AARP Agency platform. While new business and retention have increased significantly year-over-year, we have not yet reached the pivot point where new business outweighs non-renewals. Our retention levels in auto has improved by 2 points to 83%, still a few points below our target. Improving retention remains a key goal for this segment.
Turning to Slide 10. Wealth Management core earnings ex DAC unlock were $155 million 11% lower than prior year. This decrease was largely due to 11% decline on assets under management primarily from net outflows in Individual Annuities. As a reminder, results for International Annuity, Individual Annuity and Private Placement Life Insurance are included in the Runoff division, not Wealth Management.
Individual core earnings -- Individual Annuity core earnings ex the DAC unlock unlock were $86 million down 10% from prior year. Sales improved in the quarter, marking the first sequential sales increase since 2008. We also have began rolling out our new fixed indexed annuity. As we said in December, we are optimistic about growing the annuity business but our timeframe is not unlimited.
In terms of risk return trade-off, we like or balanced product position. Our VA product is priced for competitive returns and the product design prudently balances our risk management appetite with customer needs. This innovative design is working from a risk management perspective and offers features that appeal to consumers.
Individual Life core earnings ex DAC unlock were $40 million, $4 million lower than prior year reflecting modestly elevated mortality in the quarter. Fourth quarter Individual Life sales were strong. It's important to note that we did not win this business by being the low-cost provider. Our pricing is responsible and we can achieve adequate returns on the business we're putting on the books.
With that said, the current interest rate environment is causing pricing pressure. In order to stay ahead of this, we have made periodic pricing adjustments, including the increase we made earlier this week. The candles behind the increase in  fourth quarter Life Insurance sales were our innovative product riders and the focus on expanded distribution. Sales grew in every distribution channel, including a 58% increase in sales through P&C agents.
Retirement Plans core earnings ex DAC unlock were $9 million, $2 million lower than prior year, reflecting spread compression on the general account products. Assets under management were flat and deposits were down 2%, primarily reflecting weakness in the tax-exempt market. We are pleased with the progress we're making to grow the 401(k) business. Sales were up modestly in the quarter and our efforts this expand distribution are beginning to pay off. Sales in the $5 million to $25 million Middle Market space were up 29% and sales in the P&C channel grew 33%.
Mutual fund core earnings at $20 million were $4 million lower than last year, reflecting a 15% decline in retail assets under management. This quarter was challenging for the mutual fund industry, in particular for equity funds. Right now, about 2/3 of our mutual fund AUM is in equity funds. As Liam mentioned, our expanded partnership with Wellington strengthens our product offering by providing competitive products for various economic environments. As a result, over time we expect our concentration in equity funds to be reduced and to have a more balanced fund family.
The results for our Runoff division are on Slide 11. Core earnings ex DAC unlock were $84 million. We have provided additional details on the Runoff division in the ISS. As Liam mentioned, we have recently named and you management team for the lower Life portion of the division. We look forward to updating you on the progress we are making to more efficiently manage these blocks of business in the quarters ahead.
Slide 12 has the results of the hedging program. The program continues to work as designed. As you would expect, in a rising equity market we generate realized losses but these losses are offset by reductions in required reserves. On a GAAP basis, VA generated a net loss of $430 million. On a statutory basis VA, generated a gain of $107 million as the decline in the VA carbon liability was greater than the change in value of the hedges. The difference in results on a GAAP versus statutory basis reflects the inherent differences in the accounting for the liabilities.
The investment portfolio performed well this quarter. As you can see on Slide 13, impairments and changes to the mortgage loan loss reserve were $35 million. Our net unrealized gain position improved to $2.8 billion pretax, largely due to declining interest rates. Our portfolio yield was 4.1% excluding alternatives down 10 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2010.
Given the Fed's recent announcement that it plans to keep short-term interest rates at historic lows through 2014, we updated our sensitivity analysis of lower rates at our investment portfolio on Slide 14. If interest rates stay flat through 2014 as opposed to following the forward curve, the impact to our outlook for after-tax core earnings is negligible in 2012, given the lower level of the rates. The impact on the current portfolio rises from $30 million to $40 million in 2013 and up to $100 million in 2014 under this scenario. Importantly, these impacts do not reflect any changes we would make in our investment strategy to offset the extended period of low interest rates.
On Slide 15 is our statutory surplus roll forward. Surplus levels at the end of the quarter were essentially unchanged at both the P&C and Life companies. VA related impacts to surplus were a positive $300 million. Increased reserves related to cash flow testing resulted in a negative non-VA statutory earnings for the Life company of $100 million.
During the quarter, we contributed $100 million to [indiscernible] Life Insurance, our Life Insurance captive, to reflect the impact of lower interest rates on Life Insurance-related reserves. This contribution was primarily funded from Life company resources.
On Slide 16 you can see that we ended the year with a strong balance sheet. We have over $17.7 billion of resources in the U.S. insurance operations in Japan and at the holding company. We ended the year with $1.6 billion of holding company resources, down $500 million from September 30. $400 million of this decline relates to the October debt repayment. In addition, we completed $51 million of share repurchases before the end of the year.
For the first quarter of 2012, we expect results to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.90 per diluted share. The improvement reflects the rebound in alternative investment returns, as well as seasonality and catastrophe budgets and assumed weather-related losses. The budget for first quarter catastrophes is about $70 million pretax.
For the full year 2012, as we discussed in December, we see core earnings of $3.30 to $3.60 per diluted share ex DAC unlocks and prior-year development.
Before I wrap up, we have received a number of calls from investors recently looking for our perspectives on the idea of separating the P&C and Life companies. The company has reviewed this idea in the past but this management team recently took a fresh look with assistance from advisors. We wanted to share with you some of the meaningful challenges to creating shareholder value via a split that may not be fully understood.
As you can see on Slide 17, these challenges fall into 3 categories, the interplay of ratings in debt allocation, the need for regulatory approval and other costs. But briefly, due to the Life company's current limited capacity to generate statutory earnings and dividends, at least 2/3 of our current holding company debt will need to be allocated to the P&C group. As a consequence, we would need to take potentially dilutive actions at the P&C company to de-lever its balance sheet. As a condition of approval, our regulators might require capital contributions or keep-well agreements between the standalone companies. In addition, we would have to deal with other challenges to creating shareholder value including those listed on the slide.
So you can see that there are significant challenges to creating shareholder value from a separation of the companies. In closing, although we accomplished much over the past 2 years we know more is required in order to create ROE expansion and deliver more consistent operating performance. As we've said, we are evaluating our strategy and business portfolio for opportunities to deliver greater value for shareholders. We will be objective and pragmatic about the best way to achieve these goals.
As we start 2012, we are confident that our portfolio review, balance sheet strength, business momentum and efficiency plans will position us well to achieve these goals we have set for the organization.
At this point I'd like to tell turn the call over to Sabra to begin the Q&A session."

Our timeframe, as I said in December, and as Chris reiterated is not limited. We do need and I do need to see meaningful progress in profitable sales in the near future. So I think that's very consistent with the tone and the statements we made in December and I think appropriate position. In terms of ratings, I'll say higher-level. First of all, I think the notion that if we were to decide to put U.S. VA into Runoff, it would create immediate material amounts of capital is not true in our view, #1. And #2, remember that you have other businesses, the mutual fund business, the Life business and the Retirement business that are very-ratings sensitive and if you are able to do that scenario, we would not want to do anything that would destroy their value. Chris, anything to add to that?"

That said, I think you're really trying to -- and we've talked about it before, measures out of the end inflection point of where things dye to turn positive from a capital generation side. I'll just go back to our comments that we do see substantial capital generation in '13 and beyond, obviously as market levels improve. I don't think there's a precise number I'd give you, but when your in North of 13, 70 and approaching those types of levels it really does take a lot of pressure off in the VA carbon reserves and you know we talked about some of those being on a lag. But there's not a precise thing, I'll call it continued healing, but there's also I would say, a lot of continued pressure in the low interest rate environment also.

The ROE and the product we have today is not what I would say on a fully hedged basis, very close to the cost of capital at scale. And from a risk perspective we're-- we think that the product that we sell today is more than acceptable. So 3 things to add to that. First, we hedged the product fully, second the NAR of the business that we put on the books is less than 1% of our total sales and third, the personal protection portfolios, which are the core part of the products had a volatility last year that was about 1/3 of the level of the S&P.

The PDF fund, which again is the secret sauce underlying the product, it's very innovative and frankly, it needed some proof of concept, which I think took a little bit longer than we expected. But with 6 months behind our belt, I feel very good about where that is right now. As it relates to the fourth quarter specifically, as was mentioned earlier in the remarks, 2008 was the first time that we saw our sequential increase in sales and when you start looking inter-quarter, our story gets a little bit interesting where December was the best month we had in the year and was up 45% over October. So let me address your question about 2012 and whether or not I still feel like we can achieve it. The answer is yes. Clearly, As Liam mentioned, the market is rationalizing, competitors are raising fees, they're reducing benefits, they're getting out of the business, we think the this is all very good for us. Our biggest distributor in Wealth Management added the products just recently, it was the end of October. We're in very good discussions right now to add the product to shelves at 2 of the top 20 firms. The only top 2 -- the only 2 of the 20 firms in that industry that don't carry this product today. We changed our national sales manager in September and we have much greater discipline, focus and accountability. And as importantly, we're attracting some of the top wholesalers from many of our competitors. But with that backdrop, I think the punch line is that we really know what we have to do it with respect to showing sales and sales momentum and the management team is confident and committed to getting there."

Liam, I want to go back to Slide 17 talking about the potential of separating Life and P&C business. I know you're doing a strategic review but it's talking about what the potential will be but just these challenges. Goldman Sachs came out with I think a very good analysis a few months ago, where they show -- in that they estimate the upside to doing that tax re-spinoff off P&C can be over 70% of what the current stock price is trading at. Now I agree that there's going to be challenges, but isn't your job to really overcome those challenges to achieve the maximum value for shareholders? Now, I would say that Hartford needs to do something drastic because the stock is the lowest valuation relative to book value of any major insurance company. Last year, Hartford stock was down 38% while the P&C stock we're up 14% and even declined much more than the Life index, which was down 21%. So what I'd like to see you do is not merely come back and say yes, we're looking at strategic options, but there's challenges to achieving them. What -- first of all, do you agree that you could create as much as 70% value for your shareholders by spinning, off separating P&C?

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Last evening, we announced fourth quarter results that were in line with what we discussed in December, with book value per diluted share up 17% over the last year. Results were",992,"Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Last evening, we announced fourth quarter results that were in line with what we discussed in December, with book value per diluted share up 17% over the last year. Results were improved from the third quarter, but 2011 was a challenging year with the weak macroeconomic environment and unusually bad weather.
We're encouraged by some of the recent economic developments. Domestic business activity, employment data and consumption trends all suggest a return to moderate GDP growth. And the European Central Bank's additional support measures have had a positive impact in the marketplace. But we remain cautious about the operating environment for 2012. Many of the factors -- low interest rates and market volatility -- are likely to continue to have some impact in 2012.
So given this environment, as we said in December, we are aggressively managing the levers within our control to increase profitability and generate shareholder value. Across the organization, as you'll hear, we are prioritizing profit over sales volume, driving greater expense efficiencies and growing where we are generating appropriate return.
In Commercial Markets, we achieved accelerated rate increase across most P&C Commercial lines. As we expected, pricing crossed the inflection point and exceeded loss costs for most of our lines in the fourth quarter. As these written pricing changes earn in over 2012, we expect to see margin expansion throughout the P&C Commercial portfolio, particularly in our Middle Market book.
Doug and his team have accomplished a great deal since his arrival. They're making material improvements across their business like building our property capabilities to move us to a more diversified P&C Commercial book. We now have dedicated property specialists in each of our Middle Market regions. And in addition, we've hired several senior underwriters to strengthen our core property team and have significantly enhanced our property risk tools. This focused effort has already turned several strong prospects into Hartford customers. 
We've also realigned the sales force against customer segments for both Commercial and Consumer Markets. This will increase our responsiveness to customers, brokers and agents, while heightening accountability for results.
In Consumer Markets, Andy and his team have focused the book on a more targeted, preferred customer segment. This strategy is paying off with notable margin improvement in the fourth quarter.
The AARP relationship continues to be a competitive advantage for us. Along with strong new business growth in the AARP Direct business, we are seeing good momentum with the AARP products sold through the agency channel. About 80% of new business is hitting our targeted, mature preferred demographic.
For Wealth Management, as you know, we separated several of the division's businesses into a Runoff segment in December. The financials are broken out for the first time this quarter, so you can better evaluate progress on our ongoing businesses as well as those in Runoff.
Earlier this week, we appointed a new, separate, dedicated leadership team for the group, with Dave Bedard, the former CFO for Wealth Management, heading the team. Dave is a 26-year finance veteran with expert knowledge of these and other complex financial products. Dave will be joined by Aidan Kidney, who was the CEO and President of our Japan business; and Peter Sannizzaro, who was most recently CFO of the Global Annuity business. I'm pleased that Dave, Aidan and Peter are taking on these important new roles.
This team is charged with more efficiently managing these blocks of businesses, reducing their size, risk, volatility and capital consumption, and we will run this business as its own segment with segregated financials.
In the ongoing Wealth Management businesses, Dave Levenson and his team are focused on increasing returns and managing risk in this low-rate environment. As an example, we've raised rates on Life Insurance several times in the last 18 months. We also believe that our targeted product and distribution initiatives are ensuring that we successfully compete in the marketplace and achieve adequate returns.
For example, we recently announced an agreement where Wellington Management will serve as the sole subadvisor, pending the mutual fund board approval for The Hartford's fixed income and equity mutual funds. Our largest distribution partners are excited about this relationship as it positions The Hartford as a more significant player in the fixed income space and the mutual fund industry overall.
In Life Insurance, we have significantly expanded our distribution efforts, opening up new sales channels. We're maintaining our leadership in wirehouses and banks, but the independent channel now makes up about 48% of our total sales.
As you know, we are also focused on driving greater efficiency at The Hartford and are making good progress toward our aggregate $450 million target by streamlining operations, rationalizing management layers and leveraging technology. This is a 3-year effort. We reduced run rate expenses by $150 million in 2011, and we'll continue to deliver on this objective in '12 and '13.
Fourth quarter results also demonstrated the effectiveness of our risk management capabilities. We discussed our Japan hedging program in detail back in October and the year-end surplus performed in line with what we told you in December. As a result of continued confidence in our capital position, in December, we began repurchasing shares. We have bought back just under $100 million of shares to date and expect to be active in the market again shortly. We intend to complete the full $500 million share buyback by early second quarter 2012.
With the company stabilized and strengthened, our entire team is working to increase shareholder value. We do not believe the current stock price reflects the true value of the company. And so as I said in December at our investor presentation, we are evaluating our strategy and our business portfolio for opportunities to deliver greater value for shareholders. We will be objective and pragmatic about the best ways to achieve this goal.
I'll now turn the call over to Chris."
341546,145779037,217457,"Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2012",2012-02-08,"Earnings Calls","The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 5. As Liam mentioned, fourth quarter results were in line with the outlook we provided in December.

As Liam mentioned, fourth quarter results were in line with the outlook we provided in December. We saw areas of good performance throughout the ongoing businesses that provide positive momentum for 2012. Fourth quarter core earnings were $339 million, including a $47 million DAC unlock benefit.
On Slide 5, you'll see several items that adversely impacted core earnings this quarter. These items totaled $69 million, including several items that I estimated at our Investor Day. The principal difference was that the original estimate was for catastrophe losses, which totaled $14 million pretax.
During the quarter, we had $39 million of new cat losses that were offset by $25 million of favorable development on second and third quarter cats. This compares to our fourth quarter estimate of about $50 million. In addition, we had favorable DAC unlock of $47 million. At Investor Day, we estimated fourth quarter core earnings would be between $0.80 and $0.85 per diluted share. Adjusted for the items that we just discussed, actual results were $0.83.
Returns on alternative investments, which are volatile, were essentially 0 in the quarter versus $67 million pretax in the third quarter. Fund valuations were negatively impacted by third quarter equity market performance. Given the typical one quarter lag, we'd expect alternative returns to rebound in the first quarter of 2012.
On Slide 6, we have broken out fourth quarter core earnings into our ongoing and Runoff divisions. These numbers exclude the Corporate division, which reflects holding company interest income and expenses. Going forward, we'll provide you with this breakout on a quarterly basis to clearly show the earnings performance of our ongoing businesses.
On Slide 7, book value per diluted share rose to $47.25, an increase of 17% over the last 12 months. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share rose by 6% to $44.86. These amounts do not reflect the implementation of the new DAC accounting standard, which is effective January 1 of this year. After adoption, all-in book value will decline about $1.5 billion or $3.09 per share. We will publish restated 2011 segment results that reflect the impact of the new accounting standard in March.
As Liam mentioned, we began our share repurchase program in December. Through early 2012, we have completed $94 million of the $500 million authorization. We will be active in the market very soon and intend to complete the authorization by early second quarter of 2012.
Let's turn to our business results by segment. Slide 8 shows the summary results for Commercial Markets. Core earnings were $40 million compared with $231 million in the prior year. This quarter results reflect adverse reserve development in P&C Commercial as well as challenges in Group Benefits. P&C Commercial reported core earnings of $25 million, reflecting the $109 million pretax of net prior year development and $87 million pretax of current year development.
These increases, which we discussed in early December, reflect higher claim frequency on the 2010 accident year in our Worker's Compensation book and the roll-forward impact on the 2011 accident year. The increase in frequency is an industry-wide trend. The current accident year reserve strengthening was 5.6 points on the fourth quarter combined ratio of 101.5 x cats and x prior year. Early indications of claim activity since this adjustment show our estimates for 2010 and 2011 are holding, but it's still early for these accident years.
As Liam mentioned, we saw accelerating rate increases across all lines in the fourth quarter. Overall, renewal pricing increased 5% with stronger results in our Middle Market business, where we achieved a 10% increase on workers' comp renewals. This grew from 7.5% in October to over 11% in December. We did see a decline in retention, but we are willing to shed some renewal business to improve margins.
Shifting to Group Benefits. Core earnings of $15 million were below our expectations. The loss ratio of 80.5 reflected elevated disability incidents. Our management actions have been focused on improving pricing to offset loss ratio pressure. We continue our highly selective pricing approach, targeting specific rate actions on a case-by-case basis. While we are making progress in putting more rate into the book, the market remains competitive for well-performing accounts.
Consumer Markets core earnings of $83 million are summarized on Slide 9. The combined ratio x cats x prior year was 93.0, 3.8 points better than prior year. This largely reflects 2011 price increases earning into our book of business, particularly in auto. New business written premium rebounded strongly in the second half of 2011. It's now back to acceptable levels after a decline in 2010 and the first half of 2011. These improvements are a direct result of targeted new business initiatives and the expansion of the AARP Agency platform. While new business and retention have increased significantly year-over-year, we have not yet reached the pivot point where new business outweighs non-renewals. Our retention level in auto has improved by 2 points to 83%, still a few points below our target. Improving retention remains a key goal for this segment.
Turning to Slide 10. Wealth Management core earnings x DAC unlock were $155 million, 11% lower than prior year. This decrease was largely due to 11% decline on assets under management, primarily from net outflows in Individual Annuities. As a reminder, results for International Annuity, Institutional Annuity and Private Placement Life Insurance are included in the Runoff division, not Wealth Management.
Individual core earnings -- Individual Annuity core earnings x the DAC unlock were $86 million, down 10% from prior year. Sales improved in the quarter, marking the first sequential sales increase since 2008. We also have began rolling out our new fixed indexed annuity. As we said in December, we are optimistic about growing the annuity business, but our timeframe is not unlimited.
In terms of risk return trade-off, we like or balanced product position. Our VA product is priced for competitive returns, and the product design prudently balances our risk management appetite with customer needs. This innovative design is working from a risk management perspective and offers features that appeal to consumers.
Individual Life core earnings x DAC unlock were $40 million, $4 million lower than prior year, reflecting modestly elevated mortality in the quarter. Fourth quarter Individual Life sales were strong. It's important to note that we did not win this business by being the low-cost provider. Our pricing is responsible, and we can achieve adequate returns on the business we're putting on the books.
With that said, the current interest rate environment is causing pricing pressure. In order to stay ahead of this, we have made periodic pricing adjustments, including the increase we made earlier this week. The catalyst behind the increase in  fourth quarter Life Insurance sales were our innovative product riders and a focus on expanded distribution. Sales grew in every distribution channel, including a 58% increase in sales through P&C agents.
Retirement Plans core earnings x DAC unlock were $9 million, $2 million lower than prior year, reflecting spread compression on the general account products. Assets under management were flat, and deposits were down 2%, primarily reflecting weakness in the tax-exempt market. We are pleased with the progress we're making to grow the 401(k) business. Sales were up modestly in the quarter, and our efforts to expand distribution are beginning to pay off. Sales in the $5 million to $25 million Middle Market space were up 29% and sales in the P&C channel grew 33%.
Mutual Fund core earnings at $20 million were $4 million lower than last year, reflecting a 15% decline in retail assets under management. This quarter was challenging for the mutual fund industry, in particular for equity funds. Right now, about 2/3 of our mutual fund AUM is in equity funds. As Liam mentioned, our expanded partnership with Wellington strengthens our product offering by providing competitive products for various economic environments. As a result, over time, we expect our concentration in equity funds to be reduced and to have a more balanced fund family.
The results for our Runoff division are on Slide 11. Core earnings x DAC unlock were $84 million. We have provided additional details on the Runoff division in the IFS. As Liam mentioned, we recently named a new management team for the Life portion of the division. We look forward to updating you on the progress they are making to more efficiently manage these blocks of business in the quarters ahead.
Slide 12 has the results of the hedging program. The program continues to work as designed. As you would expect, in a rising equity market, we generate realized losses, but these losses are offset by reductions in required reserves. On a GAAP basis, VA generated a net loss of $430 million. On a statutory basis, VA generated a gain of $107 million as the decline in the VA carbon liability was greater than the change in value of the hedges. The difference in results on a GAAP versus statutory basis reflects the inherent differences in the accounting for the liabilities.
The investment portfolio performed well this quarter. As you can see on Slide 13, impairments and changes to the mortgage loan loss reserve were $35 million. Our net unrealized gain position improved to $2.8 billion pretax, largely due to declining interest rates. Our portfolio yield was 4.1% excluding alternatives, down 10 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2010.
Given the Fed's recent announcement that it plans to keep short-term interest rates at historic lows through 2014, we updated our sensitivity analysis of lower rates on our investment portfolio on Slide 14. If interest rates stay flat through 2014 as opposed to following the forward curve, the impact to our outlook for after-tax core earnings is negligible in 2012, given the low level of rates. The impact on the current portfolio rises from $30 million to $40 million in 2013 and up to $100 million in 2014 under this scenario. Importantly, these impacts do not reflect any changes we would make in our investment strategy to offset extended period of low interest rates.
On Slide 15 is our statutory surplus roll forward. Surplus levels at the end of the quarter were essentially unchanged at both the P&C and Life companies. VA-related impacts to surplus were a positive $300 million. Increased reserves related to cash flow testing resulted in a negative non-VA statutory earnings for the Life company of $100 million.
During the quarter, we contributed $100 million to Champlain Life Reinsurance, our Life Insurance captive, to reflect the impact of lower interest rates on Life Insurance-related reserves. This contribution was primarily funded from Life company resources.
On Slide 16, you can see that we ended the year with a strong balance sheet. We have over $17.7 billion of resources in the U.S. insurance operations and Japan and at the holding company. We ended the year with $1.6 billion of holding company resources, down $500 million from September 30. $400 million of this decline relates to the October debt repayment. In addition, we completed $51 million of share repurchases before the end of the year.
For the first quarter of 2012, we expect results to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.90 per diluted share. The improvement reflects a rebound in alternative investment returns, as well as seasonality and catastrophe budgets and assumed weather-related losses. The budget for first quarter catastrophes is about $70 million pretax.
For the full year 2012, as we discussed in December, we see core earnings of $3.30 to $3.60 per diluted share x DAC unlock and prior-year development.
Before I wrap up, we have received a number of calls from investors recently looking for our perspectives on the idea of separating the P&C and Life companies. The company has reviewed this idea in the past, but this management team recently took a fresh look with assistance from advisors. We wanted to share with you some of the meaningful challenges to creating shareholder value via a split that may not be fully understood.
As you can see on Slide 17, these challenges fall into 3 categories: the interplay of ratings and debt allocation, the need for regulatory approval and other costs. Put briefly, due to the Life company's current limited capacity to generate statutory earnings and dividends, at least 2/3 of our current holding company debt would need to be allocated to the P&C group. As a consequence, we would need to take potentially dilutive actions at the P&C company to de-lever its balance sheet. As a condition of approval, our regulators might require capital contributions or keep-well agreements between the standalone companies. In addition, we would have to deal with other challenges to creating shareholder value, including those listed on the slide.
So you can see that there are significant challenges to creating shareholder value from a separation of the companies. In closing, although we have accomplished much over the past 2 years, we know more is required in order to create ROE expansion and deliver more consistent operating performance. As we've said, we are evaluating our strategy and business portfolio for opportunities to deliver greater value for shareholders. We will be objective and pragmatic about the best way to achieve these goals.
As we start 2012, we are confident that our portfolio review, balance sheet strength, business momentum and efficiency plans will position us well to achieve these goals we have set for the organization.
At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Sabra to begin the Q&A session."

First of all, in this environment, this management team is very focused on managing the levers that we can control. I think the progress we've made on making the company more efficient in '11 and will continue to do so in '12 and '13 are appropriate and necessary in view of the current low interest rate environment and the market volatility. The balance sheet is much stronger today, starting with the investment portfolio. The progress that we've made there over the last 2 years, number one. Secondly, the transparency we gave you in October around our balance sheet. Japan, our overall VA book, our ability to withstand stress scenarios. I think our risk management, enterprise risk management, is much stronger and enables us to manage the company better. And we are seeing benefits as a result of our 3 customer-aligned businesses. Just to reiterate, the management team does not believe that the current share price reflects the value of the company.

We're well aware of the questions about our strategy in the U.S. VA book. I think in short, we believe we have the components we need to succeed in the business. Distribution, new products that have been out relatively short period of time and, as Chris noted, some period-over-period momentum, and we're seeing signs of that continue early on in the year. In addition, the macro environment appears to be shifting in a way to it'd be more favorable to the types of products that we're offering. However, and just to reiterate what I said in December, I think I was very clear on this, to your question, we are managing the business very closely, watching the trends. David Levenson, I think, is watching them very closely. Our timeframe, as I said in December and as Chris reiterated, is not unlimited. And we do need and I need to see meaningful progress in profitable sales in the near future. So I think that's very consistent with the tone and the statements that we made in December, and I think an appropriate position. In terms of ratings, I'll just say at high level. First of all, I think the notion that if we were to decide to put U.S. VA into Runoff, that it would create immediate material amounts of capital liberated is not true in our view, number one. And number two, remember that we have other businesses -- the Mutual Fund business, the Life business and the Retirement business -- that are very ratings sensitive, and we would -- if we were able to do that scenario, we would not want to do anything that would destroy their value.

Our capital at White River Re is well in excess of $125-basis- target, and we have approximately $400 million of actual tangible surplus there. In Champlain, we did make a capital contribution to Champlain. $80 million of that was funded by the Life company. So we sent a distribution up to the holding company of $80 million contributed back to Champlain with another $20 million of holding company resources. So Champlain is above our targets and it actually has $265 million of stated surplus, and then you saw the $1.3 billion of surplus in Japan.

That said, I think you're really trying to -- and we've talked about it before, is measured sort of the inflection point of where things start to turn positive from a capital generation side. And I'll just go back to our comments that we do see substantial capital generation in '13 and beyond, obviously, as market levels improve. I don't think there's a precise number I'd give you, but when you're north of 13,070 and approaching those types of levels, I mean, it really does take a lot of pressure off the VA CARVM reserves. As you know, we've talked about somewhat -- those being on a lag. But there's not a precise thing. It's just, I'll call it, continued healing, but there's also, I would say, a lot of continued pressure in the low interest rate environment also.

The ROE and the product we have today is what I would say, on a fully hedged basis, very close to the cost of capital at scale. And from a risk perspective, we're -- we think the product that we sell today is more than acceptable. So 3 things to add to that. First, we hedged the product fully; second, the NAR of the business that we put on the books is less than 1% of our total sales; and third, the personal protection portfolios, which is a core part of the product, had a volatility last year that was about 1/3 of the level of the S&P.

So we recognize that the $258 million that we did in the quarter does not get us to our guidance. I'd say that said, we really only had a competitive product in the marketplace for the last 6 months. So we've been essentially out of the market since 2009 and back in since June. The PDF fund, which again is the secret sauce underlying the product, it's very innovative and, frankly, it needed some proof of concept, which I think took a little bit longer than we expected. But with 6 months behind our belt, I feel very good about where that is right now. As it relates to the fourth quarter specifically, as was mentioned earlier in the remarks, 2008 was the first time that we saw our sequential increase in sales, and when you start looking inter-quarter, our story gets a little bit more interesting where December was the best month we had in the year and was up 45% over October. So let me address your question about 2012 and whether or not I still feel like we can achieve it. The answer is yes. Clearly, as Liam mentioned, the market is rationalizing, competitors are raising fees, they're reducing benefits, they're getting out of the business. We think this is all very good for us. Our biggest distributor in Wealth Management, added the product just recently, it was the end of October. We are in very good discussions right now to add the product to shelves at 2 of the top 20 firms. The only top 2 -- the only 2 of the 20 firms in the industry that don't carry this product today. We changed our national sales manager in September, and we have much greater discipline, focus and accountability. And as importantly, we're attracting some of the top wholesalers from many of our competitors. But with that backdrop, I think the punch line is that we really know what we have to do with respect to showing sales and sales momentum, and the management team is confident and committed to getting there."

Liam, I want to go back to the Slide 17, talking about the potential separating the Life and P&C business. And the -- I know you're doing a strategic review, but there's no slide talking about what the potential will be, just that there's challenges. Goldman Sachs came out with, I think, a very good analysis a few months ago, where they showed this is -- that they estimate the upside to doing a tax respinoff of P&C can be over 70% of what the current stock price is trading at. Now I agree that there's going to be challenges, but isn't your job to really overcome those challenges to achieve the maximum value for shareholders? Now I would say that Hartford needs to do something drastic because the stock is the lowest valuation relative to book value of any major insurance company. Last year, Hartford stock was down 38% while the P&C stocks were up 14% and even declined much more than the Life index, which was down 21%. So what I'd like to see you do is not merely come back and say yes, we're looking at strategic options, but there's challenges to achieving them. But what -- first of all, do you agree that you could create as much as 70% value for your shareholders by spinning off -- separating P&C? And secondly, is [indiscernible] incentive to overcome the challenges that it's going to take to spin this off? And how long is -- how long do we have to wait to hear if there's going to be a positive recommendation to separate these 2 businesses?"

It's very much still a work in progress, but as you commented, in AARP Direct we are converging on our combined ratio pricing target. I actually expect that to happen sometime in 2012. New business has rebounded very nicely, and that will continue to play out as 2012 plays out. The big objective for us right now is to get retention where it needs to be, and until we do that, we expect that to happen in -- throughout '12 and into '13, we'll restore total premium growth to AARP. Still a valuable franchise, extremely important to us strategically, and we're well on our way to getting that back on track."

341546,145779037,217534,"Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2012",2012-02-08,"Earnings Calls","The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Last evening, we announced fourth quarter results that were in line with what we discussed in December, with book value per diluted share up 17% over the last year. Results were",992,"Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Last evening, we announced fourth quarter results that were in line with what we discussed in December, with book value per diluted share up 17% over the last year. Results were improved from the third quarter, but 2011 was a challenging year with the weak macroeconomic environment and unusually bad weather.
We're encouraged by some of the recent economic developments. Domestic business activity, employment data and consumption trends all suggest a return to moderate GDP growth. And the European Central Bank's additional support measures have had a positive impact in the marketplace. But we remain cautious about the operating environment for 2012. Many of the factors -- low interest rates and market volatility -- are likely to continue to have some impact in 2012.
So given this environment, as we said in December, we are aggressively managing the levers within our control to increase profitability and generate shareholder value. Across the organization, as you'll hear, we are prioritizing profit over sales volume, driving greater expense efficiencies and growing where we are generating appropriate return.
In Commercial Markets, we achieved accelerated rate increase across most P&C Commercial lines. As we expected, pricing crossed the inflection point and exceeded loss costs for most of our lines in the fourth quarter. As these written pricing changes earn in over 2012, we expect to see margin expansion throughout the P&C Commercial portfolio, particularly in our Middle Market book.
Doug and his team have accomplished a great deal since his arrival. They're making material improvements across their business like building our property capabilities to move us to a more diversified P&C Commercial book. We now have dedicated property specialists in each of our Middle Market regions. And in addition, we've hired several senior underwriters to strengthen our core property team and have significantly enhanced our property risk tools. This focused effort has already turned several strong prospects into Hartford customers. 
We've also realigned the sales force against customer segments for both Commercial and Consumer Markets. This will increase our responsiveness to customers, brokers and agents, while heightening accountability for results.
In Consumer Markets, Andy and his team have focused the book on a more targeted, preferred customer segment. This strategy is paying off with notable margin improvement in the fourth quarter.
The AARP relationship continues to be a competitive advantage for us. Along with strong new business growth in the AARP Direct business, we are seeing good momentum with the AARP products sold through the agency channel. About 80% of new business is hitting our targeted, mature preferred demographic.
For Wealth Management, as you know, we separated several of the division's businesses into a Runoff segment in December. The financials are broken out for the first time this quarter, so you can better evaluate progress on our ongoing businesses as well as those in Runoff.
Earlier this week, we appointed a new, separate, dedicated leadership team for the group, with Dave Bedard, the former CFO for Wealth Management, heading the team. Dave is a 26-year finance veteran with expert knowledge of these and other complex financial products. Dave will be joined by Aidan Kidney, who was the CEO and President of our Japan business; and Peter Sannizzaro, who was most recently CFO of the Global Annuity business. I'm pleased that Dave, Aidan and Peter are taking on these important new roles.
This team is charged with more efficiently managing these blocks of business, reducing their size, risk, volatility and capital consumption, and we will run this business as its own segment with segregated financials.
In the ongoing Wealth Management businesses, Dave Levenson and his team are focused on increasing returns and managing risk in this low-rate environment. As an example, we've raised rates on Life Insurance several times in the last 18 months. We also believe that our targeted product and distribution initiatives are ensuring that we successfully compete in the marketplace and achieve adequate returns.
For example, we recently announced an agreement where Wellington Management will serve as the sole subadvisor, pending the mutual fund board approval for The Hartford's fixed income and equity mutual funds. Our largest distribution partners are excited about this relationship as it positions The Hartford as a more significant player in the fixed income space and the mutual fund industry overall.
In Life Insurance, we have significantly expanded our distribution efforts, opening up new sales channels. We're maintaining our leadership in wirehouses and banks, but the independent channel now makes up about 48% of our total sales.
As you know, we are also focused on driving greater efficiency at The Hartford and are making good progress toward our aggregate $450 million target by streamlining operations, rationalizing management layers and leveraging technology. This is a 3-year effort. We reduced run rate expenses by $150 million in 2011, and we'll continue to deliver on this objective in '12 and '13.
Fourth quarter results also demonstrated the effectiveness of our risk management capabilities. We discussed our Japan hedging program in detail back in October and the year-end surplus performed in line with what we told you in December. As a result of continued confidence in our capital position, in December, we began repurchasing shares. We have bought back just under $100 million of shares to date and expect to be active in the market again shortly. We intend to complete the full $500 million share buyback by early second quarter 2012.
With the company stabilized and strengthened, our entire team is working to increase shareholder value. We do not believe the current stock price reflects the true value of the company. And so as I said in December at our investor presentation, we are evaluating our strategy and our business portfolio for opportunities to deliver greater value for shareholders. We will be objective and pragmatic about the best ways to achieve this goal.
I'll now turn the call over to Chris."
341546,145779037,217534,"Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2012",2012-02-08,"Earnings Calls","The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 5. As Liam mentioned, fourth quarter results were in line with the outlook we provided in December.

As Liam mentioned, fourth quarter results were in line with the outlook we provided in December. We saw areas of good performance throughout the ongoing businesses that provide positive momentum for 2012. Fourth quarter core earnings were $339 million, including a $47 million DAC unlock benefit.
On Slide 5, you'll see several items that adversely impacted core earnings this quarter. These items totaled $69 million, including several items that I estimated at our Investor Day. The principal difference was that the original estimate was for catastrophe losses, which totaled $14 million pretax.
During the quarter, we had $39 million of new cat losses that were offset by $25 million of favorable development on second and third quarter cats. This compares to our fourth quarter estimate of about $50 million. In addition, we had favorable DAC unlock of $47 million. At Investor Day, we estimated fourth quarter core earnings would be between $0.80 and $0.85 per diluted share. Adjusted for the items that we just discussed, actual results were $0.83.
Returns on alternative investments, which are volatile, were essentially 0 in the quarter versus $67 million pretax in the third quarter. Fund valuations were negatively impacted by third quarter equity market performance. Given the typical one quarter lag, we'd expect alternative returns to rebound in the first quarter of 2012.
On Slide 6, we have broken out fourth quarter core earnings into our ongoing and Runoff divisions. These numbers exclude the Corporate division, which reflects holding company interest income and expenses. Going forward, we'll provide you with this breakout on a quarterly basis to clearly show the earnings performance of our ongoing businesses.
On Slide 7, book value per diluted share rose to $47.25, an increase of 17% over the last 12 months. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share rose by 6% to $44.86. These amounts do not reflect the implementation of the new DAC accounting standard, which is effective January 1 of this year. After adoption, all-in book value will decline about $1.5 billion or $3.09 per share. We will publish restated 2011 segment results that reflect the impact of the new accounting standard in March.
As Liam mentioned, we began our share repurchase program in December. Through early 2012, we have completed $94 million of the $500 million authorization. We will be active in the market very soon and intend to complete the authorization by early second quarter of 2012.
Let's turn to our business results by segment. Slide 8 shows the summary results for Commercial Markets. Core earnings were $40 million compared with $231 million in the prior year. This quarter results reflect adverse reserve development in P&C Commercial as well as challenges in Group Benefits. P&C Commercial reported core earnings of $25 million, reflecting the $109 million pretax of net prior year development and $87 million pretax of current year development.
These increases, which we discussed in early December, reflect higher claim frequency on the 2010 accident year in our Worker's Compensation book and the roll-forward impact on the 2011 accident year. The increase in frequency is an industry-wide trend. The current accident year reserve strengthening was 5.6 points on the fourth quarter combined ratio of 101.5 x cats and x prior year. Early indications of claim activity since this adjustment show our estimates for 2010 and 2011 are holding, but it's still early for these accident years.
As Liam mentioned, we saw accelerating rate increases across all lines in the fourth quarter. Overall, renewal pricing increased 5% with stronger results in our Middle Market business, where we achieved a 10% increase on workers' comp renewals. This grew from 7.5% in October to over 11% in December. We did see a decline in retention, but we are willing to shed some renewal business to improve margins.
Shifting to Group Benefits. Core earnings of $15 million were below our expectations. The loss ratio of 80.5 reflected elevated disability incidents. Our management actions have been focused on improving pricing to offset loss ratio pressure. We continue our highly selective pricing approach, targeting specific rate actions on a case-by-case basis. While we are making progress in putting more rate into the book, the market remains competitive for well-performing accounts.
Consumer Markets core earnings of $83 million are summarized on Slide 9. The combined ratio x cats x prior year was 93.0, 3.8 points better than prior year. This largely reflects 2011 price increases earning into our book of business, particularly in auto. New business written premium rebounded strongly in the second half of 2011. It's now back to acceptable levels after a decline in 2010 and the first half of 2011. These improvements are a direct result of targeted new business initiatives and the expansion of the AARP Agency platform. While new business and retention have increased significantly year-over-year, we have not yet reached the pivot point where new business outweighs non-renewals. Our retention level in auto has improved by 2 points to 83%, still a few points below our target. Improving retention remains a key goal for this segment.
Turning to Slide 10. Wealth Management core earnings x DAC unlock were $155 million, 11% lower than prior year. This decrease was largely due to 11% decline in assets under management, primarily from net outflows in Individual Annuities. As a reminder, results for International Annuity, Institutional Annuity and Private Placement Life Insurance are included in the Runoff division, not Wealth Management.
Individual core earnings -- Individual Annuity core earnings x the DAC unlock were $86 million, down 10% from prior year. Sales improved in the quarter, marking the first sequential sales increase since 2008. We also have began rolling out our new fixed indexed annuity. As we said in December, we are optimistic about growing the annuity business, but our timeframe is not unlimited.
In terms of risk return trade-off, we like our balanced product position. Our VA product is priced for competitive returns, and the product design prudently balances our risk management appetite with customer needs. This innovative design is working from a risk management perspective and offers features that appeal to consumers.
Individual Life core earnings x DAC unlock were $40 million, $4 million lower than prior year, reflecting modestly elevated mortality in the quarter. Fourth quarter Individual Life sales were strong. It's important to note that we did not win this business by being the low-cost provider. Our pricing is responsible, and we can achieve adequate returns on the business we're putting on the books.
With that said, the current interest rate environment is causing pricing pressure. In order to stay ahead of this, we have made periodic pricing adjustments, including the increase we made earlier this week. The catalyst behind the increase in  fourth quarter Life Insurance sales were our innovative product riders and a focus on expanded distribution. Sales grew in every distribution channel, including a 58% increase in sales through P&C agents.
Retirement Plans core earnings x DAC unlock were $9 million, $2 million lower than prior year, reflecting spread compression on the general account products. Assets under management were flat, and deposits were down 2%, primarily reflecting weakness in the tax-exempt market. We are pleased with the progress we're making to grow the 401(k) business. Sales were up modestly in the quarter, and our efforts to expand distribution are beginning to pay off. Sales in the $5 million to $25 million Middle Market space were up 29% and sales in the P&C channel grew 33%.
Mutual Fund core earnings at $20 million were $4 million lower than last year, reflecting a 15% decline in retail assets under management. This quarter was challenging for the mutual fund industry, in particular for equity funds. Right now, about 2/3 of our mutual fund AUM is in equity funds. As Liam mentioned, our expanded partnership with Wellington strengthens our product offering by providing competitive products for various economic environments. As a result, over time, we expect our concentration in equity funds to be reduced and to have a more balanced fund family.
The results for our Runoff division are on Slide 11. Core earnings x DAC unlock were $84 million. We have provided additional details on the Runoff division in the IFS. As Liam mentioned, we recently named a new management team for the Life portion of the division. We look forward to updating you on the progress they are making to more efficiently manage these blocks of business in the quarters ahead.
Slide 12 has the results of the hedging program. The program continues to work as designed. As you would expect, in a rising equity market, we generate realized losses, but these losses are offset by reductions in required reserves. On a GAAP basis, VA generated a net loss of $430 million. On a statutory basis, VA generated a gain of $107 million as the decline in the VA carbon liability was greater than the change in value of the hedges. The difference in results on a GAAP versus statutory basis reflects the inherent differences in the accounting for the liabilities.
The investment portfolio performed well this quarter. As you can see on Slide 13, impairments and changes to the mortgage loan loss reserve were $35 million. Our net unrealized gain position improved to $2.8 billion pretax, largely due to declining interest rates. Our portfolio yield was 4.1% excluding alternatives, down 10 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2010.
Given the Fed's recent announcement that it plans to keep short-term interest rates at historic lows through 2014, we updated our sensitivity analysis of lower rates on our investment portfolio on Slide 14. If interest rates stay flat through 2014, as opposed to following the forward curve, the impact to our outlook for after-tax core earnings is negligible in 2012, given the low level of rates. The impact on the current portfolio rises to $30 million to $40 million in 2013 and up to $100 million in 2014 under this scenario. Importantly, these impacts do not reflect any changes we would make in our investment strategy to offset extended period of low interest rates.
On Slide 15 is our statutory surplus roll forward. Surplus levels at the end of the quarter were essentially unchanged at both the P&C and Life companies. VA-related impacts to surplus were a positive $300 million. Increased reserves related to cash flow testing resulted in a negative non-VA statutory earnings for the Life company of $100 million.
During the quarter, we contributed $100 million to Champlain Life Reinsurance, our Life Insurance captive, to reflect the impact of lower interest rates on Life Insurance-related reserves. This contribution was primarily funded from Life company resources.
On Slide 16, you can see that we ended the year with a strong balance sheet. We have over $17.7 billion of resources in the U.S. insurance operations and Japan and at the holding company. We ended the year with $1.6 billion of holding company resources, down $500 million from September 30. $400 million of this decline relates to the October debt repayment. In addition, we completed $51 million of share repurchases before the end of the year.
For the first quarter of 2012, we expect results to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.90 per diluted share. The improvement reflects a rebound in alternative investment returns, as well as seasonality and catastrophe budgets and assumed weather-related losses. The budget for first quarter catastrophes is about $70 million pretax.
For the full year 2012, as we discussed in December, we see core earnings of $3.30 to $3.60 per diluted share x DAC unlock and prior-year development.
Before I wrap up, we have received a number of calls from investors recently looking for our perspectives on the idea of separating the P&C and Life companies. The company has reviewed this idea in the past, but this management team recently took a fresh look with assistance from advisers. We wanted to share with you some of the meaningful challenges to creating shareholder value via a split that may not be fully understood.
As you can see on Slide 17, these challenges fall into 3 categories: the interplay of ratings and debt allocation, the need for regulatory approval and other costs. Put briefly, due to the Life company's current limited capacity to generate statutory earnings and dividends, at least 2/3 of our current holding company debt would need to be allocated to the P&C group. As a consequence, we would need to take potentially dilutive actions at the P&C company to de-lever its balance sheet. As a condition of approval, our regulators might require capital contributions or keep-well agreements between the standalone companies. In addition, we would have to deal with other challenges to creating shareholder value, including those listed on the slide.
So you can see that there are significant challenges to creating shareholder value from a separation of the companies. In closing, although we have accomplished much over the past 2 years, we know more is required in order to create ROE expansion and deliver more consistent operating performance. As we've said, we are evaluating our strategy and business portfolio for opportunities to deliver greater value for shareholders. We will be objective and pragmatic about the best way to achieve these goals.
As we start 2012, we are confident that our portfolio review, balance sheet strength, business momentum and efficiency plans will position us well to achieve these goals we have set for the organization.
At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Sabra to begin the Q&A session."

I think I commented pretty extensively in the prior question about the process we're going through. I'd add a couple of other things. First of all, in this environment, this management team is very focused on managing the levers that we can control. I think the progress we've made on making the company more efficient in '11 and will continue to do so in '12 and '13 are appropriate and necessary in view of the current low interest rate environment and the market volatility. The balance sheet is much stronger today, starting with the investment portfolio. The progress that we've made there over the last 2 years, number one. Secondly, the transparency we gave you in October around our balance sheet. Japan, our overall VA book, our ability to withstand stress scenarios. I think our risk management, enterprise risk management, is much stronger and enables us to manage the company better. And we are seeing benefits as a result of our 3 customer-aligned businesses. Just to reiterate, the management team does not believe that the current share price reflects the value of the company. I think we've -- to your point Chris, we've heard that from shareholders, and we've heard it from some other observers, and I think that's why we're communicating very clearly that we are -- we will be objective and pragmatic about the types of actions that may best enable our goal -- to achieve our goal of realizing greater value for shareholders."

So I guess if you put that into runoff, you'd have a lot of the Wealth Management business in the Runoff block, so why would there be such an intense focus on preserving the single A rating if so much of the business was in Runoff? And could you look to then potentially sell some of the remaining attractive assets like the Group or Mutual Fund business?"

We're well aware of the questions about our strategy in the U.S. VA book. I think in short, we believe we have the components we need to succeed in the business. Distribution, new products that have been out relatively short period of time and, as Chris noted, some period-over-period momentum, and we're seeing signs of that continue early on in the year. In addition, the macro environment appears to be shifting in a way to it'd be more favorable to the types of products that we're offering. However, and just to reiterate what I said in December, I think I was very clear on this, to your question, we are managing the business very closely, watching the trends. David Levenson, I think, is watching them very closely. Our timeframe, as I said in December and as Chris reiterated, is not unlimited. And we do need and I need to see meaningful progress in profitable sales in the near future. So I think that's very consistent with the tone and the statements that we made in December, and I think an appropriate position. In terms of ratings, I'll just say at high level. First of all, I think the notion that if we were to decide to put U.S. VA into Runoff, that it would create immediate material amounts of capital liberated is not true in our view, number one. And number two, remember that we have other businesses -- the Mutual Fund business, the Life business and the Retirement business -- that are very ratings sensitive, and we would -- if we were able to do that scenario, we would not want to do anything that would destroy their value. Chris, anything you'd add to that?"

But when you put it all together, we wouldn't estimate that our main company is -- RBC is between $415 million and $420 million. Our capital at White River Re is well in excess of $125-basis-point target, and we have approximately $400 million of actual tangible surplus there. In Champlain, we did make a capital contribution to Champlain. $80 million of that was funded by the Life company. So we sent a dividend up to the holding company of $80 million contributed back to Champlain with another $20 million of holding company resources. So Champlain is above our targets and it actually has $265 million of stated surplus, and then you saw the $1.3 billion of surplus in Japan.

So I think the positive impacts on VA carbon reserves in the Life book were offset by the net negatives around the world. That said, I think you're really trying to -- and we've talked about it before, is measured sort of the inflection point of where things start to turn positive from a capital generation side. And I'll just go back to our comments that we do see substantial capital generation in '13 and beyond, obviously, as market levels improve. I don't think there's a precise number I'd give you, but when you're north of 13,070 and approaching those types of levels, I mean, it really does take a lot of pressure off the VA CARVM reserves. As you know, we've talked about somewhat -- those being on a lag. But there's not a precise thing. It's just, I'll call it, continued healing, but there's also, I would say, a lot of continued pressure in the low interest rate environment also.

Our absolute focus right now is really on growing the business with the product portfolio that we have today. As it relates to your question around profitability and risk, I would say we pay very close attention to this, as you heard Liam say in his comments, with a focus on profitability. The ROE and the product we have today is what I would say, on a fully hedged basis, very close to the cost of capital at scale. And from a risk perspective, we're -- we think the product that we sell today is more than acceptable. So 3 things to add to that. First, we hedged the product fully; second, the NAR of the business that we put on the books is less than 1% of our total sales; and third, the personal protection portfolios, which is a core part of the product, had a volatility last year that was about 1/3 of the level of the S&P.

So we've been essentially out of the market since 2009 and back in since June. The PDF fund, which again is the secret sauce underlying the product, it's very innovative and, frankly, it needed some proof of concept, which I think took a little bit longer than we expected. But with 6 months behind our belt, I feel very good about where that is right now. As it relates to the fourth quarter specifically, as was mentioned earlier in the remarks, 2008 was the first time that we saw our sequential increase in sales, and when you start looking inter-quarter, our story gets a little bit more interesting where December was the best month we had in the year and was up 45% over October. So let me address your question about 2012 and whether or not I still feel like we can achieve it. The answer is yes. Clearly, as Liam mentioned, the market is rationalizing, competitors are raising fees, they're reducing benefits, they're getting out of the business. We think this is all good for us. Our biggest distributor in Wealth Management, added the product just recently, it was the end of October. We are in very good discussions right now to add the product to shelves at 2 of the top 20 firms. The only top 2 -- the only 2 of the 20 firms in the industry that don't carry this product today. We changed our national sales manager in September, and we have much greater discipline, focus and accountability. And as importantly, we're attracting some of the top wholesalers from many of our competitors.

Liam, I want to go back to the Slide 17, talking about the potential separating the Life and P&C business. And the -- I know you're doing a strategic review, but there's no slide talking about what the potential would be, just that there's challenges. Goldman Sachs came out with, I think, a very good analysis a few months ago, where they showed this is -- that they estimate the upside to doing a tax-free spin off of P&C can be over 70% of what the current stock price is trading at. Now I agree that there's going to be challenges, but isn't your job to really overcome those challenges to achieve the maximum value for shareholders? Now I would say that Hartford needs to do something drastic because the stock is the lowest valuation relative to book value of any major insurance company. Last year, Hartford stock was down 38% while the P&C stocks were up 14% and even declined much more than the Life index, which was down 21%. So what I'd like to see you do is not merely come back and say yes, we're looking at strategic options, but there's challenges to achieving them. But what -- first of all, do you agree that you could create as much as 70% value for your shareholders by spinning off -- separating P&C? And secondly, is [indiscernible] incentive to overcome the challenges that it's going to take to spin this off? And how long is -- how long do we have to wait to hear if there's going to be a positive recommendation to separate these 2 businesses?"

So since then, we've been working really hard to achieve rate adequacy and restore growth to divisions, especially AARP. It's very much still a work in progress, but as you commented, in AARP Direct we are converging on our combined ratio pricing targets. I actually expect that to happen sometime in 2012.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Last evening, we announced fourth quarter results that were in line with what we discussed in December, with book value per diluted share up 17% over the last year. Results were",992,"Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Last evening, we announced fourth quarter results that were in line with what we discussed in December, with book value per diluted share up 17% over the last year. Results were improved from the third quarter, but 2011 was a challenging year with the weak macroeconomic environment and unusually bad weather.
We're encouraged by some of the recent economic developments. Domestic business activity, employment data and consumption trends all suggest a return to moderate GDP growth. And the European Central Bank's additional support measures have had a positive impact in the marketplace. But we remain cautious about the operating environment for 2012. Many of the factors -- low interest rates and market volatility -- are likely to continue to have some impact in 2012.
So given this environment, as we said in December, we are aggressively managing the levers within our control to increase profitability and generate shareholder value. Across the organization, as you'll hear, we are prioritizing profit over sales volume, driving greater expense efficiencies and growing where we are generating appropriate return.
In Commercial Markets, we achieved accelerated rate increase across most P&C Commercial lines. As we expected, pricing crossed the inflection point and exceeded loss costs for most of our lines in the fourth quarter. As these written pricing changes earn in over 2012, we expect to see margin expansion throughout the P&C Commercial portfolio, particularly in our Middle Market book.
Doug and his team have accomplished a great deal since his arrival. They're making material improvements across their business like building our property capabilities to move us to a more diversified P&C Commercial book. We now have dedicated property specialists in each of our Middle Market regions. And in addition, we've hired several senior underwriters to strengthen our core property team and have significantly enhanced our property risk tools. This focused effort has already turned several strong prospects into Hartford customers. 
We've also realigned the sales force against customer segments for both Commercial and Consumer Markets. This will increase our responsiveness to customers, brokers and agents, while heightening accountability for results.
In Consumer Markets, Andy and his team have focused the book on a more targeted, preferred customer segment. This strategy is paying off with notable margin improvement in the fourth quarter.
The AARP relationship continues to be a competitive advantage for us. Along with strong new business growth in the AARP Direct business, we are seeing good momentum with the AARP products sold through the agency channel. About 80% of new business is hitting our targeted, mature preferred demographic.
For Wealth Management, as you know, we separated several of the division's businesses into a Runoff segment in December. The financials are broken out for the first time this quarter, so you can better evaluate progress on our ongoing businesses as well as those in Runoff.
Earlier this week, we appointed a new, separate, dedicated leadership team for the group, with Dave Bedard, the former CFO for Wealth Management, heading the team. Dave is a 26-year finance veteran with expert knowledge of these and other complex financial products. Dave will be joined by Aidan Kidney, who was the CEO and President of our Japan business; and Peter Sannizzaro, who was most recently CFO of the Global Annuity business. I'm pleased that Dave, Aidan and Peter are taking on these important new roles.
This team is charged with more efficiently managing these blocks of business, reducing their size, risk, volatility and capital consumption, and we will run this business as its own segment with segregated financials.
In the ongoing Wealth Management businesses, Dave Levenson and his team are focused on increasing returns and managing risk in this low-rate environment. As an example, we've raised rates on Life Insurance several times in the last 18 months. We also believe that our targeted product and distribution initiatives are ensuring that we successfully compete in the marketplace and achieve adequate returns.
For example, we recently announced an agreement where Wellington Management will serve as the sole subadvisor, pending the mutual fund board approval for The Hartford's fixed income and equity mutual funds. Our largest distribution partners are excited about this relationship as it positions The Hartford as a more significant player in the fixed income space and the mutual fund industry overall.
In Life Insurance, we have significantly expanded our distribution efforts, opening up new sales channels. We're maintaining our leadership in wirehouses and banks, but the independent channel now makes up about 48% of our total sales.
As you know, we are also focused on driving greater efficiency at The Hartford and are making good progress toward our aggregate $450 million target by streamlining operations, rationalizing management layers and leveraging technology. This is a 3-year effort. We reduced run rate expenses by $150 million in 2011, and we'll continue to deliver on this objective in '12 and '13.
Fourth quarter results also demonstrated the effectiveness of our risk management capabilities. We discussed our Japan hedging program in detail back in October and the year-end surplus performed in line with what we told you in December. As a result of continued confidence in our capital position, in December, we began repurchasing shares. We have bought back just under $100 million of shares to date and expect to be active in the market again shortly. We intend to complete the full $500 million share buyback by early second quarter 2012.
With the company stabilized and strengthened, our entire team is working to increase shareholder value. We do not believe the current stock price reflects the true value of the company. And so as I said in December at our investor presentation, we are evaluating our strategy and our business portfolio for opportunities to deliver greater value for shareholders. We will be objective and pragmatic about the best ways to achieve this goal.
I'll now turn the call over to Chris."
341546,145779037,217957,"Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2012",2012-02-08,"Earnings Calls","The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Liam.

As Liam mentioned, fourth quarter results were in line with the outlook we provided in December. We saw areas of good performance throughout the ongoing businesses that provide positive momentum for 2012. Fourth quarter core earnings were $339 million, including a $47 million DAC unlock benefit.
On Slide 5, you'll see several items that adversely impacted core earnings this quarter. These items totaled $69 million, including several items that I estimated at our Investor Day. The principal difference was that the original estimate was for catastrophe losses, which totaled $14 million pretax.
During the quarter, we had $39 million of new cat losses that were offset by $25 million of favorable development on second and third quarter cats. This compares to our fourth quarter estimate of about $50 million. In addition, we had favorable DAC unlock of $47 million. At Investor Day, we estimated fourth quarter core earnings would be between $0.80 and $0.85 per diluted share. Adjusted for the items that we just discussed, actual results were $0.83.
Returns on alternative investments, which are volatile, were essentially 0 in the quarter versus $67 million pretax in the third quarter. Fund valuations were negatively impacted by third quarter equity market performance. Given the typical one quarter lag, we'd expect alternative returns to rebound in the first quarter of 2012.
On Slide 6, we have broken out fourth quarter core earnings into our ongoing and Runoff divisions. These numbers exclude the Corporate division, which reflects holding company interest income and expenses. Going forward, we'll provide you with this breakout on a quarterly basis to clearly show the earnings performance of our ongoing businesses.
On Slide 7, book value per diluted share rose to $47.25, an increase of 17% over the last 12 months. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share rose by 6% to $44.86. These amounts do not reflect the implementation of the new DAC accounting standard, which is effective January 1 of this year. After adoption, all-in book value will decline about $1.5 billion or $3.09 per share. We will publish restated 2011 segment results that reflect the impact of the new accounting standard in March.
As Liam mentioned, we began our share repurchase program in December. Through early 2012, we have completed $94 million of the $500 million authorization. We will be active in the market very soon and intend to complete the authorization by early second quarter of 2012.
Let's turn to our business results by segment. Slide 8 shows the summary results for Commercial Markets. Core earnings were $40 million compared with $231 million in the prior year. This quarter results reflect adverse reserve development in P&C Commercial as well as challenges in Group Benefits. P&C Commercial reported core earnings of $25 million, reflecting the $109 million pretax of net prior year development and $87 million pretax of current year development.
These increases, which we discussed in early December, reflect higher claim frequency on the 2010 accident year in our Worker's Compensation book and the roll-forward impact on the 2011 accident year. The increase in frequency is an industry-wide trend. The current accident year reserve strengthening was 5.6 points on the fourth quarter combined ratio of 101.5 x cats and x prior year. Early indications of claim activity since this adjustment show our estimates for 2010 and 2011 are holding, but it's still early for these accident years.
As Liam mentioned, we saw accelerating rate increases across all lines in the fourth quarter. Overall, renewal pricing increased 5% with stronger results in our Middle Market business, where we achieved a 10% increase on workers' comp renewals. This grew from 7.5% in October to over 11% in December. We did see a decline in retention, but we are willing to shed some renewal business to improve margins.
Shifting to Group Benefits. Core earnings of $15 million were below our expectations. The loss ratio of 80.5 reflected elevated disability incidents. Our management actions have been focused on improving pricing to offset loss ratio pressure. We continue our highly selective pricing approach, targeting specific rate actions on a case-by-case basis. While we are making progress in putting more rate into the book, the market remains competitive for well-performing accounts.
Consumer Markets core earnings of $83 million are summarized on Slide 9. The combined ratio x cats x prior year was 93.0, 3.8 points better than prior year. This largely reflects 2011 price increases earning into our book of business, particularly in auto. New business written premium rebounded strongly in the second half of 2011. It's now back to acceptable levels after a decline in 2010 and the first half of 2011. These improvements are a direct result of targeted new business initiatives and the expansion of the AARP Agency platform. While new business and retention have increased significantly year-over-year, we have not yet reached the pivot point where new business outweighs non-renewals. Our retention level in auto has improved by 2 points to 83%, still a few points below our target. Improving retention remains a key goal for this segment.
Turning to Slide 10. Wealth Management core earnings x DAC unlock were $155 million, 11% lower than prior year. This decrease was largely due to 11% decline in assets under management, primarily from net outflows in Individual Annuities. As a reminder, results for International Annuity, Institutional Annuity and Private Placement Life Insurance are included in the Runoff division, not Wealth Management.
Individual core earnings -- Individual Annuity core earnings x the DAC unlock were $86 million, down 10% from prior year. Sales improved in the quarter, marking the first sequential sales increase since 2008. We also have began rolling out our new fixed indexed annuity. As we said in December, we are optimistic about growing the annuity business, but our timeframe is not unlimited.
In terms of risk return trade-off, we like our balanced product position. Our VA product is priced for competitive returns, and the product design prudently balances our risk management appetite with customer needs. This innovative design is working from a risk management perspective and offers features that appeal to consumers.
Individual Life core earnings x DAC unlock were $40 million, $4 million lower than prior year, reflecting modestly elevated mortality in the quarter. Fourth quarter Individual Life sales were strong. It's important to note that we did not win this business by being the low-cost provider. Our pricing is responsible, and we can achieve adequate returns on the business we're putting on the books.
With that said, the current interest rate environment is causing pricing pressure. In order to stay ahead of this, we have made periodic pricing adjustments, including the increase we made earlier this week. The catalyst behind the increase in fourth quarter Life Insurance sales were our innovative product riders and a focus on expanded distribution. Sales grew in every distribution channel, including a 58% increase in sales through P&C agents.
Retirement Plans core earnings x DAC unlock were $9 million, $2 million lower than prior year, reflecting spread compression on the general account products. Assets under management were flat, and deposits were down 2%, primarily reflecting weakness in the tax-exempt market. We are pleased with the progress we're making to grow the 401(k) business. Sales were up modestly in the quarter, and our efforts to expand distribution are beginning to pay off. Sales in the $5 million to $25 million Middle Market space were up 29% and sales in the P&C channel grew 33%.
Mutual Fund core earnings at $20 million were $4 million lower than last year, reflecting a 15% decline in retail assets under management. This quarter was challenging for the mutual fund industry, in particular for equity funds. Right now, about 2/3 of our mutual fund AUM is in equity funds. As Liam mentioned, our expanded partnership with Wellington strengthens our product offering by providing competitive products for various economic environments. As a result, over time, we expect our concentration in equity funds to be reduced and to have a more balanced fund family.
The results for our Runoff division are on Slide 11. Core earnings x DAC unlock were $84 million. We have provided additional details on the Runoff division in the IFS. As Liam mentioned, we recently named a new management team for the Life portion of the division. We look forward to updating you on the progress they are making to more efficiently manage these blocks of business in the quarters ahead.
Slide 12 has the results of the hedging program. The program continues to work as designed. As you would expect, in a rising equity market, we generate realized losses, but these losses are offset by reductions in required reserves. On a GAAP basis, VA generated a net loss of $430 million. On a statutory basis, VA generated a gain of $107 million as the decline in the VA carbon liability was greater than the change in value of the hedges. The difference in results on a GAAP versus statutory basis reflects the inherent differences in the accounting for the liabilities.
The investment portfolio performed well this quarter. As you can see on Slide 13, impairments and changes to the mortgage loan loss reserve were $35 million. Our net unrealized gain position improved to $2.8 billion pretax, largely due to declining interest rates. Our portfolio yield was 4.1% excluding alternatives, down 10 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2010.
Given the Fed's recent announcement that it plans to keep short-term interest rates at historic lows through 2014, we updated our sensitivity analysis of lower rates on our investment portfolio on Slide 14. If interest rates stay flat through 2014, as opposed to following the forward curve, the impact to our outlook for after-tax core earnings is negligible in 2012, given the low level of rates. The impact on the current portfolio rises to $30 million to $40 million in 2013 and up to $100 million in 2014 under this scenario. Importantly, these impacts do not reflect any changes we would make in our investment strategy to offset extended period of low interest rates.
On Slide 15 is our statutory surplus roll forward. Surplus levels at the end of the quarter were essentially unchanged at both the P&C and Life companies. VA-related impacts to surplus were a positive $300 million. Increased reserves related to cash flow testing resulted in a negative non-VA statutory earnings for the Life company of $100 million.
During the quarter, we contributed $100 million to Champlain Life Reinsurance, our Life Insurance captive, to reflect the impact of lower interest rates on Life Insurance-related reserves. This contribution was primarily funded from Life company resources.
On Slide 16, you can see that we ended the year with a strong balance sheet. We have over $17.7 billion of resources in the U.S. insurance operations and Japan and at the holding company. We ended the year with $1.6 billion of holding company resources, down $500 million from September 30. $400 million of this decline relates to the October debt repayment. In addition, we completed $51 million of share repurchases before the end of the year.
For the first quarter of 2012, we expect results to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.90 per diluted share. The improvement reflects a rebound in alternative investment returns, as well as seasonality and catastrophe budgets and assumed weather-related losses. The budget for first quarter catastrophes is about $70 million pretax.
For the full year 2012, as we discussed in December, we see core earnings of $3.30 to $3.60 per diluted share x DAC unlock and prior-year development.
Before I wrap up, we have received a number of calls from investors recently looking for our perspectives on the idea of separating the P&C and Life companies. The company has reviewed this idea in the past, but this management team recently took a fresh look with assistance from advisers. We wanted to share with you some of the meaningful challenges to creating shareholder value via a split that may not be fully understood.
As you can see on Slide 17, these challenges fall into 3 categories: the interplay of ratings and debt allocation, the need for regulatory approval and other costs. Put briefly, due to the Life company's current limited capacity to generate statutory earnings and dividends, at least 2/3 of our current holding company debt would need to be allocated to the P&C group. As a consequence, we would need to take potentially dilutive actions at the P&C company to de-lever its balance sheet. As a condition of approval, our regulators might require capital contributions or keep-well agreements between the standalone companies. In addition, we would have to deal with other challenges to creating shareholder value, including those listed on the slide.
So you can see that there are significant challenges to creating shareholder value from a separation of the companies. In closing, although we have accomplished much over the past 2 years, we know more is required in order to create ROE expansion and deliver more consistent operating performance. As we've said, we are evaluating our strategy and business portfolio for opportunities to deliver greater value for shareholders. We will be objective and pragmatic about the best way to achieve these goals.
As we start 2012, we are confident that our portfolio review, balance sheet strength, business momentum and efficiency plans will position us well to achieve these goals we have set for the organization.
At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Sabra to begin the Q&A session."

And then some of them, in the middle to bottom left, that have below optimal returns today, and we're really working hard to maximize the profitability. Since we met with you in December, I would say this team is working on that very thoroughly, very rigorously, and we have a sense of urgency about doing that.

I think the progress we've made on making the company more efficient in '11 and will continue to do so in '12 and '13 are appropriate and necessary in view of the current low interest rate environment and the market volatility.

Distribution, new products that have been out relatively short period of time and, as Chris noted, some period-over-period momentum, and we're seeing signs of that continue early on in the year. In addition, the macro environment appears to be shifting in a way to it'd be more favorable to the types of products that we're offering. However, and just to reiterate what I said in December, I think I was very clear on this, to your question, we are managing the business very closely, watching the trends. David Levenson, I think, is watching them very closely. Our timeframe, as I said in December and as Chris reiterated, is not unlimited. And we do need and I need to see meaningful progress in profitable sales in the near future. So I think that's very consistent with the tone and the statements that we made in December, and I think an appropriate position. In terms of ratings, I'll just say at high level. First of all, I think the notion that if we were to decide to put U.S. VA into Runoff, that it would create immediate material amounts of capital liberated is not true in our view, number one. And number two, remember that we have other businesses -- the Mutual Fund business, the Life business and the Retirement business -- that are very ratings sensitive, and we would -- if we were able to do that scenario, we would not want to do anything that would destroy their value.

I'd say thanks for noticing the decent recovery in VA. I would also just point out that as we closed out year end, particularly in the life insurance business, so we updated our cash flow testing analysis, and that created a little bit of a headwind for us. But when you put it all together, we wouldn't estimate that our main company is -- RBC is between $415 million and $420 million. Our capital at White River Re is well in excess of $125-basis-point target, and we have approximately $400 million of actual tangible surplus there. In Champlain, we did make a capital contribution to Champlain. $80 million of that was funded by the Life company. So we sent a dividend up to the holding company of $80 million contributed back to Champlain with another $20 million of holding company resources. So Champlain is above our targets and it actually has $265 million of stated surplus, and then you saw the $1.3 billion of surplus in Japan. If you put it all together, we actually feel pretty good about our statutory resources in the various entities."

I mean, if you look at interest rates, if you look at Europe, if you look at Japan, the Nikkei was substantially down. So I think the positive impacts on VA carbon reserves in the Life book were offset by the net negatives around the world. That said, I think you're really trying to -- and we've talked about it before, is measured sort of the inflection point of where things start to turn positive from a capital generation side. And I'll just go back to our comments that we do see substantial capital generation in '13 and beyond, obviously, as market levels improve. I don't think there's a precise number I'd give you, but when you're north of 13,070 and approaching those types of levels, I mean, it really does take a lot of pressure off the VA CARVM reserves. As you know, we've talked about somewhat -- those being on a lag. But there's not a precise thing. It's just, I'll call it, continued healing, but there's also, I would say, a lot of continued pressure in the low interest rate environment also. So you could have a medium impact of just looking at one equity market index, and you really got to consider all our indices that go into liability calculation."

So what you saw was clearly a filing for the Annuity business, but as we're in a quiet period with the SEC, I really don't want to comment too much as it relates to the details. Our absolute focus right now is really on growing the business with the product portfolio that we have today. As it relates to your question around profitability and risk, I would say we pay very close attention to this, as you heard Liam say in his comments, with a focus on profitability. The ROE and the product we have today is what I would say, on a fully hedged basis, very close to the cost of capital at scale. And from a risk perspective, we're -- we think the product that we sell today is more than acceptable. So 3 things to add to that. First, we hedged the product fully; second, the NAR of the business that we put on the books is less than 1% of our total sales; and third, the personal protection portfolios, which is a core part of the product, had a volatility last year that was about 1/3 of the level of the S&P. So the issue for us is really a scale issue."

So we've been essentially out of the market since 2009 and back in since June. The PDF fund, which again is the secret sauce underlying the product, it's very innovative and, frankly, it needed some proof of concept, which I think took a little bit longer than we expected. But with 6 months behind our belt, I feel very good about where that is right now. As it relates to the fourth quarter specifically, as was mentioned earlier in the remarks, 2008 was the first time that we saw our sequential increase in sales, and when you start looking inter-quarter, our story gets a little bit more interesting where December was the best month we had in the year and was up 45% over October. So let me address your question about 2012 and whether or not I still feel like we can achieve it. The answer is yes. Clearly, as Liam mentioned, the market is rationalizing, competitors are raising fees, they're reducing benefits, they're getting out of the business. We think this is all good for us. Our biggest distributor in Wealth Management, added the product just recently, it was the end of October. We are in very good discussions right now to add the product to shelves at 2 of the top 20 firms. The only top 2 -- the only 2 of the 20 firms in the industry that don't carry this product today. We changed our national sales manager in September, and we have much greater discipline, focus and accountability. And as importantly, we're attracting some of the top wholesalers from many of our competitors. But with that backdrop, I think the punchline is that we really know what we have to do with respect to showing sales and sales momentum, and the management team is confident and committed to getting there."

And the -- I know you're doing a strategic review, but there's no slide talking about what the potential would be, just that there's challenges. Goldman Sachs came out with, I think, a very good analysis a few months ago, where they showed this is -- that they estimate the upside to doing a tax-free spinoff of P&C can be over 70% of what the current stock price is trading at. Now I agree that there's going to be challenges, but isn't your job to really overcome those challenges to achieve the maximum value for shareholders? Now I would say that Hartford needs to do something drastic because the stock is the lowest valuation relative to book value of any major insurance company. Last year, Hartford stock was down 38% while the P&C stocks were up 14% and even declined much more than the Life index, which was down 21%. So what I'd like to see you do is not merely come back and say yes, we're looking at strategic options, but there's challenges to achieving them. But what -- first of all, do you agree that you could create as much as 70% value for your shareholders by spinning off -- separating P&C? And secondly, is [indiscernible] incentive to overcome the challenges that it's going to take to spin this off?

The big objective for us right now is to get retention where it needs to be, and until we do that, we expect that to happen in -- throughout '12 and into '13, we'll restore total premium growth to AARP.

Yesterday, we announced strong first quarter results with core earnings up 11% to $1.25 per diluted share. Our P&C combined ratio was 95.7%, a very good result. Strong pricing momentum continued in the P&C Commercial segment, and we had significantly improved new business growth in some markets. 
We also achieved several significant accomplishments. We concluded the strategic evaluation of the businesses and announced our plan to focus on the Property & Casualty, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds businesses. This is The Hartford's best path forward to deliver greater value for shareholders. So in order to increase transparency on our go-forward businesses, we expanded P&C disclosures this quarter, providing more details on Small Commercial, Middle Market and Consumer Markets. Going forward, our presentations will focus on greater detail on the performance about go-forward businesses and the progress in reducing the size and amount of risk and Runoff division.  We are moving quickly to execute the plan we outlined in March including selling businesses, placing the annuity block into runoff and exploring options for the Runoff division. Let me update you briefly on each of these. 
The sales processes for Individual Life, Retirement Plans and Woodbury Financial are going well. The offering memoranda for each are in the marketplace. There is great interest in each property. We expect to have a competitive auction process, and we expect definitive agreements later this year. I am proud of the hard work and dedication of the employees in these businesses. They are focused on delivering successful and valuable businesses to the ultimate buyers. The proceeds from these sales will give us additional financial flexibility that, over time, we expect to use for capital management actions and some debt reduction. We will also consider options for reducing risk in the Runoff businesses or reinvesting in our go-forward businesses. 
In addition, last week, we announced an agreement to sell the Individual Annuity new business capabilities. This sale does not change our decision to put the in-force block into Runoff, nor does it have a material financial impact on The Hartford. However, it does provide an opportunity for us to place our innovative products, strong distribution capabilities and talented employees with an organization committed to the annuity space. We are also working harder on initiatives to further reduce the size and risk of the Life Runoff segment, which will shrink over time it through policy overlapses. While our ultimate goal is to isolate or separate the annuity block from our go-forward businesses, the management team is currently concentrating on transactional and operational opportunities for individual books of business. 
With respect to transactions, we are exploring a wide range of potential opportunities including sales, reinsurance and other structural concepts. A variety of parties have expressed initial interests in parts of the block. Of course, any transactions will need to balance short-term economics with the long-term objective of reducing liabilities, which would allow us to redeploy some of the capital currently allocated to the Runoff block. It's still early, but we do expect some of these potential opportunities to materialize over time, particularly as the capital markets continue to stabilize. 
On the operational side, we are pursuing options such as outsourcing or different fund options that will reduce risks or expenses. And of course, we anticipate achieving expense reductions of $100 million before tax in 2013 by placing Individual Annuity segment into Runoff. 
In April, we also refinanced the Allianz debt and repurchased their warrants. The refinancing strengthens our balance sheet by reducing long-term interest costs and improving financial flexibility by extending the debt maturity schedule. The warrant repurchase eliminates a material source of future dilution. Allianz remains a major shareholder of The Hartford, and we appreciate their support. 
We are already beginning to execute on our strategy. By focusing on the Property & Casualty Group Benefits and Mutual Funds businesses, we will over time deliver sustained superior returns and greater shareholder value. In order to achieve these objectives, we are focused on 3 key goals: first, improving margins and ROEs in our go-forward businesses; second, strengthening overall capital generation; and third, reducing the volatility of our earnings and capital. So let me go through each of these in a little more detail. 
Our go-forward businesses have strong ROEs although there is room for improvement. Combined, we expect them to achieve a 12% to 13% ROE for 2012, and we are hard at work to improve this in 2013 and beyond. To achieve this, we're concentrating on improving margins in Middle Market and Group Benefits and growing the top line in Small Commercial and Mutual Funds. 
In the P&C Commercial segment, our Small Commercial business is a long-standing market leader with good opportunities for continued profitable growth, particularly as the U.S. economy and small business formation recover. Written premiums were up 8% this quarter with a 91.8% combined ratio. We continue to be a preferred company for small business customers driven by our long-term record of innovation, ranging from product to technology to service capabilities. 
In Middle Market, Doug Elliot and his team are improving product diversification and pricing, particularly in workers compensation. I'm especially pleased with the pricing and margin improvements we've achieved over the past 6 months, although that has meant giving up some top line growth. Middle Market's combined ratio x cat in prior year was 99.2, down from last year but still above what we need to achieve of acceptable returns. In the first quarter, retention remained strong despite price increases of approximately 10% for the total Middle Market book. 
In Group Benefits, we achieved good rate increases on the first quarter renewals, but earnings are well below the segment's potential. The incidence in termination trends we are seeing are consistent with our competitors and largely due to the high unemployment rate, but we need to do better. With new Group Benefits management in place, we have initiatives underway in sales, pricing, underwriting and claims. It will take time before the financial benefit of this work falls to the bottom line particularly on pricing, given the 3-year contract terms in this business. Nevertheless, we like the mortality and morbidity underwriting margins of this business, as well as its long-term growth and return prospects. We have a strong franchise with a top-tier market position and excellent sales and distribution capabilities. With the success of our initiatives and some lift from an improving economy and unemployment trends, we believe that Group Benefits will once again achieve sustained superior returns.
The principal goal for Consumer Markets has been to improve margins, and Andy Napoli and his team have made great progress. The current year combined ratio x cat is improving year-over-year for 4 of the last 5 quarters, and we are increasing rates in homeowners to reflect high cat and non-cat weather experience. With better margins, Consumer Markets is now striving for top line growth through both increasing retention and new business growth. We're doing well in both of these metrics. Retention has improved as a result of customer outreach and pricing initiatives, while new business levels have improved strongly. New business growth was favorable for the third quarter in a row and has now returned to acceptable levels. This success was due to improved response and conversion rates, as well as to our award-winning customer service. This week, J.D. Power announced that The Hartford was ranked the highest in customer satisfaction with the auto insurance shopping experience, an important accomplishment for our Consumer Markets team and for our customers. 
In Mutual Funds, we are confident that going forward, we are well positioned to generate good growth in this high return business. We are moving quickly to leverage our expanded relationship with Wellington. We want to transition all of the fixed income investment management to Wellington by the end of June, and we expect that the second half of the year will produce significant improvement in net flows. 
Improving margins and ROEs also requires us to remain focused on continued expense efficiency across the entire organization. After reducing expenses by $150 million in 2011, we took out another $30 million in the first quarter. We are continuing to execute on the efficiency objectives we established last year. In addition, we recently established a dedicated business transformation process to ensure that we remove all costs associated with the 3 businesses being sold and that corporate overhead and other shared service expenses are rightsized for the go-forward Hartford businesses. 
Our second goal for creating sustained superior performance is improving capital generation. Our go-forward businesses have historically been strong capital generators, but Runoff businesses and Individual Life and Retirement Plans have not. As a result, our Life statutory capital generation has been constrained over the past several years. Statutory capital requirements in the Life company should decline over time, with the sale of the 3 Life businesses and the reduction of the Runoff book through lapses or management accident. The statutory brings power to the P&C Benefit and Mutual Funds benefits will grow in the future.  Combined, we expect our total capital generation going forward to be stronger than what it has been the last few years. 
Finally, a third goal is to significantly reduce the sensitivity of our capital and earnings to financial markets risks. Our go-forward businesses are less sensitive to changes in the capital markets. Of course, we are focused on reducing the size of the variable annuity block, which is the primary source of our current market volatility. Some of this will occur naturally over time through policy lapses and withdrawals. But in addition, we will be prepared to take advantage of potential opportunities to isolate or separate the Runoff block that are both feasible from a regulatory perspective and create shareholder value. Through these efforts, we will ultimately free up capital from our divestitures and Runoff businesses, and we will be able to redeploy in our go-forward businesses and return to shareholders. And over time, The Hartford's financial profile will evolve into more of a property and casualty company with strong returns and capital generation and limited sensitivity to capital market volatility.
This is a strong quarter for The Hartford. We had good financial results, favorable momentum in many of our go-forward businesses and have successful debt refinancing and warrant repurchase. The sales processes are going well and with our sharper strategic focus, I am confident that we are on the right path to generate superior returns and create greater shareholder value going forward. I and the rest of the team are very optimistic and excited about our future. I'll now turn the call over to Chris."
341546,183392892,296058,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 5. First quarter earnings were $612 million or $1.25 per diluted share, representing an 11% improvement over prior year. Excluding the $192 million DAC unlock, core earnings were $420 million or",2160,"Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 5. First quarter earnings were $612 million or $1.25 per diluted share, representing an 11% improvement over prior year. Excluding the $192 million DAC unlock, core earnings were $420 million or $0.86 per diluted share. That's a 7% increase compared to prior year. These results were largely in line with the estimate we provided on March 21 except for catastrophes. Cats were running about $20 million favorable to budget through mid-March. But with the late March storm activity, total cats ended the quarter at $46 million after tax, in line with our budget. Prior year development was slightly favorable at $19 million after tax with releases in personal lines offset by some modest development in P&C Commercial. 
The investment portfolio yield was stable this quarter at 4.2% excluding partnerships. We are modestly increasing allocations at higher yield assets and purchasing longer duration bonds. Returns on alternatives and limited partnerships were 8%, and we continue to expect an annualized return of 9% for 2012. Impairments and changes to the mortgage loan loss reserve remained low at $28 million pretax in the quarter. 
Slide 6 shows book value per diluted common share on a restated basis for the new DAC accounting standard. At the end of the first quarter, book value per diluted share was $43.25, an increase of 12% over the last year. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share rose by 1% to $40.55. 
Let's turn to our business results by segment.  Slide 7 shows the summary results for P&C Commercial. Core earnings were $162 million, a decline of 8% from prior year. Results included $13 million after tax of prior year net reserve strengthening across multiple lines. Importantly, there were no meaningful reserve adjustments related to our workers compensation loss experience. The combined ratio x cat x prior year was 96.4. We expect this to improve as written price increases earn in over the remainder of 2012. 
We continue to see strong price momentum in P&C Commercial. In the first quarter, we achieved renewal price increases of 7%, the highest levels since the fourth quarter of 2003. We're especially pleased with renewal price trends in Middle Market workers compensation, where first quarter price increases were up 14%. Policy account retention remained strong at 83% for standard commercial. This metric is clearly influenced by the large number of Small Commercial policies. If you look at retention on a premium weighted basis, over the past year, Small Commercial retention has been flat while Middle Market retention has declined. This retention decline has been more than offset by improved pricing. We are very pleased with this trade-off, and this will lead to continued margin expansion in ROE improvement. 
Shifting to Group Benefits, core earnings of $5 million remained well below our expectations. The loss ratio of 83% reflected elevated disability incidence and the lack of improvement in termination trends. We're addressing these disappointing results in 2 ways. First, we continue to take rate actions on accounts that are not meeting profitability targets. As Liam mentioned, it will take some time to get the profitability of the book to targeted levels, given the multiyear nature of the rate guarantees. Given our rate actions and a very competitive marketplace, persistency declined in the first quarter on first quarter renewals to 66% from 72% in the prior year. Ongoing sales are down 7% primarily driven by a 21% decline in group disability sales. Group life sales increased 5% from the prior year. 
Second, we are reviewing all operational processes to identify ways to improve profitability. We recently appointed a new leader for this segment, Mike. Mike's property and casualty background brings a fresh perspective for potential improvement opportunities in many operational areas like underwriting, pricing and claims management.
Turning to Slide 9, Consumer Markets reported first quarter core earnings of $102 million, down $9 million from prior year. Andy Napoli and his team are successfully executing on the strategy for this business. The combined ratio and retention improved and new business production was strong. First quarter combined ratio excluding cats and prior year development was 88.8%, a slight improvement from last year's 89.0%. We continue to manage our rate increases appropriately, with a 6% renewal written price increase in homeowners and 4% in auto. Like the rest of the personal lines industry, our homeowners book requires additional rate and underwriting actions to respond to recent weather trends. Overall retention was up 2 points to 84% in auto and 85% in homeowners. While we are pleased with the improvement, we still need another point or 2 in order to reach our targeted levels. New business written premium was up 30% in auto and 32% in home. After declining in the first half of 2011, new business premiums are now back to historic levels. Most of the new business growth is coming from our more profitable channels. For example, written premiums in AARP Agency almost doubled to $27 million from the prior year. We provided additional granularity in our financial supplements on written and earned and premiums by channel so you can track our progress. 
We're encouraged by these positive results. With improving margins, Consumer Markets is now poised to profitably grow while also improving their ROEs. 
Wealth Management results are summarized on slide 10. First quarter core earnings x DAC unlock were $154 million, 15% lower than prior year. This decrease was largely due to a 7% decline in assets under management, primarily from net outflows in Individual Annuities. Individual Annuity core earnings x DAC unlock were $96 million, down 11% from prior year. This segment will be reported in the Runoff division next quarter. 
The first quarter annualized lapse rate for the U.S. in-force VA block was about 14%, in line with our expectations. Since our announcement to exit Individual Annuity businesses, lapses have increased approximately 20% in the U.S. and 4% in Japan. It's too soon to judge whether lapses will remain at these levels but if they do, it will accelerate the runoff of the VA book. 
Core earnings in Individual Life x DAC unlock were $34 million, a decline of $4 million from prior year due to lower alternative investment returns, as well as slightly higher expenses. Individual Life sales were up 13% over prior year and increased across all key distribution channels. 
In individual Retirement Plans, core earnings were $4 million, down $5 million from the prior year. Spread compression on the general account products continues to weigh on results. Assets under management had a record $57.2 billion aided by rising equity markets and positive net flows. 
As a result of our planned sales, we have evaluated the goodwill balances for Individual Life and Retirement Plans in the first quarter. No impairment is necessary at this time. However, we will continue to monitor its recoverability. 
Moving to Mutual Funds, core earnings were $20 million, down $7 million from prior year due to lower assets under management. First quarter fund performance improved, particularly in our largest fund, Capital Appreciation Fund. Overall, more than 80% of the funds outperformed our benchmarks. This strong quarterly performance contributed to an increase in non-proprietary fund deposits of 18% on a sequential basis. 
The results of our Runoff division are on Slide 11. Core earnings x DAC unlock were $105 million, basically in line with the prior year. As Liam discussed, we have a number of initiatives underway to shrink the size and risk of this book. This will allow us to redeploy the capital allocated to this business over time. As you know, rising equity markets, higher interest rates and a weakening yen are all positives for our in-force VA book. economic value of the VA book is greatly improved as a result of these market conditions. During the quarter, the net amount at risk related to our VA book declined substantially. For example, the NAR related to the U.S. and Japan GMDB business improved $5.3 billion during the quarter. This improvement isn't always evident in our GAAP and statutory accounting results, given the mismatch between the carrying value of the hedge assets and the VA reserves. 
As you can see on Slide 12, that on a GAAP basis, the net change in VA reserves and hedge assets generated a loss of approximately $1.1 billion, which reflects the asymmetrical accounting for our U.S. GMDB and Japan guarantees. On a statutory basis, the decline in the value of the hedge assets exceeded the change in the value of the U.S. VA CARVM reserves by $183 million.
It's important to note that our hedge program continues to work as designed. It's primarily focus is economic risk, not GAAP accounting results. As the markets change, we will adjust our targets in order to maintain appropriate hedging levels. On Slide 13 is our statutory surplus roll forward. statutory surplus increased approximately $600 million in the first quarter before dividends. Consistent with our practice, a $200 million dividend was declared from the P&C to the holding company in order to cover interest, dividends and other expenses. The P&C operations generated more than $300 million of statutory operating income and almost $200 million of other positive surplus impacts including investment related gain. Life statutory income, excluding VA, turned positive this quarter and was approximately $100 million. This was largely offset by the VA hedge related impacts I mentioned earlier.  In total, the Life operations ended the quarter with a modest increase in statutory surplus. 
As you can see on Slide 14, we ended the quarter with $17.9 billion of capital resources. Holding company resources declined almost $100 million in the quarter, reflecting dividends, interests and share repurchase activity. We expect holding company resources to decline modestly in the second quarter due to this element of the warrant repurchase.
Turning to Slide 15. We were very pleased to complete the Allianz transactions, which were a major step in restructuring the balance sheet and enhancing our financial flexibility. On April 17, we repaid $1.75 billion par value of Allianz junior subordinated debt with the proceeds from the issuance of $1.55 billion of senior notes and $600 million of new junior subordinated debt. This new debt has a blended interest rate of approximately 6% versus the 10% coupon on the Allianz debt. This reduces annual interest paid by $45 million on a pretax basis. As a result, our statutory dividend coverage ratio is improved by almost 0.5 point to 4x. 
In the second quarter, we will take an after-tax charge to net income of approximately $600 million to reflect the premium paid to retire the debt and to write off the related unamortized discount and debt costs. We also purchased all the outstanding Allianz warrants for $300 million. This transaction reduced first quarter book value by $0.61 per diluted share. 
In addition in early in the first quarter, we purchased 2.6 million shares of common stock. To date, we have completed $394 million of the $500 million equity repurchase authorization. We intend to complete the remaining $106 million on a timely basis, taking into consideration market conditions and trading restrictions.
Turning to Slide 16. I wanted to conclude with our outlook for the second quarter. We expect second quarter run rate core earnings to be in a similar range to the first quarter, absent higher loss costs seasonality. In the second quarter, we expect higher cats with a budget of $84 million after tax, which is $0.08 per diluted share, higher than the first quarter, which brings our total estimate to $0.70 to $0.75 per diluted share. This estimate does not include DAC unlock, prior year reserve development, restructuring charges related to the Wealth Management division. These restructuring charges, which include retention awards and other expenses, may be up to $20 million or about $0.04 per share. 
Our businesses this quarter performed largely in line with our expectations, with the exception of Group Benefits. We currently expect full year earnings for Group Benefits to be essentially flat with 2011. We expect pricing momentum in the P&C businesses will expand margins in the second half of 2012. Our earnings outlook for Individual Life and Retirement Plans businesses hasn't changed, although we expect sales to be down as a result of our recent announcements. 
Looking forward, the ongoing businesses are executing under 2012 initiatives to grow and increase margin. We look forward to sharing progress with you, and we will provide more information about the P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds operations in the quarters to come. In addition, we'll keep you updated on the other operational and strategic actions we make take within our Runoff division. The strength and momentum in our ongoing businesses, combined with the actions we are taking to be a more focused company, will improve the earnings and ROE profile of The Hartford over time. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Sabra to begin the Q&A session."

We need to execute on them and we understand that very clearly that over time, those activities will result in capital that we'll be able to deploy in, as Chris said, appropriately and consultation with our normal constituents. And I think we've demonstrated our ability to effectively do in the steps we've taken in the past couple of years. I think this is a company that will definitely do that, and I think we've made the decisions to position us to do that."

Yesterday, we announced strong first quarter results, with core earnings up 11% to $1.25 per diluted share. Our P&C combined ratio was 95.7%, a very good result. Strong pricing momentum continued in the P&C Commercial segment, and we had significantly improved new business growth in Consumer Markets. 
We also achieved several significant accomplishments. We concluded the strategic evaluation of the businesses and announced our plan to focus on the Property & Casualty, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds businesses. This is The Hartford's best path forward to deliver greater value for shareholders. So in order to increase transparency on our go-forward businesses, we expanded P&C disclosures this quarter, providing more details on Small Commercial, Middle Market and Consumer Markets. Going forward, our presentations will focus on greater detail on the performance about our go-forward businesses and the progress in reducing the size and amount of risk in the Runoff division.  We are moving quickly to execute the plan we outlined in March, including selling businesses, placing the annuity block into Runoff and exploring options for the Runoff division. Let me update you briefly on each of these. 
The sales processes for Individual Life, Retirement Plans and Woodbury Financial are going well. The offering memoranda for each are in the marketplace. There is great interest in each property. We expect to have a competitive auction process, and we expect definitive agreements later this year. I am proud of the hard work and dedication of the employees in these businesses. They are focused on delivering successful and valuable businesses to the ultimate buyers. The proceeds from these sales will give us additional financial flexibility that, over time, we expect to use for capital management actions and some debt reduction. We will also consider options for reducing risk in the Runoff businesses or reinvesting in our go-forward businesses. 
In addition, last week, we announced an agreement to sell the Individual Annuity new business capabilities. This sale does not change our decision to put the in-force block into Runoff, nor does it have a material financial impact on The Hartford. However, it does provide an opportunity for us to place our innovative products, strong distribution capabilities and talented employees with an organization committed to the annuity space. We are also working hard on initiatives to further reduce the size and risk of the Life runoff segment, which will shrink over time through policyholder lapses. While our ultimate goal is to isolate or separate the annuity block from our go-forward businesses, the management team is currently concentrating on transactional and operational opportunities for individual books of business. 
With respect to transactions, we are exploring a wide range of potential opportunities, including sales, reinsurance and other structural concepts. A variety of parties have expressed initial interest in parts of the block. Of course, any transactions will need to balance short-term economics with the long-term objective of reducing liabilities, which would allow us to redeploy some of the capital currently allocated to the Runoff block. It's still early, but we do expect some of these potential opportunities to materialize over time, particularly as the capital markets continue to stabilize. 
On the operational side, we are pursuing options such as outsourcing or different fund options that will reduce risk or expenses. And of course, we anticipate achieving expense reductions of $100 million before tax in 2013 by placing Individual Annuity segment into Runoff. 
In April, we also refinanced the Allianz debt and repurchased their warrants. The refinancing strengthens our balance sheet by reducing long-term interest costs and improving financial flexibility by extending the debt maturity schedule. The warrant repurchase eliminates a material source of future dilution. Allianz remains a major shareholder of The Hartford, and we appreciate their support. 
We are already beginning to execute on our strategy. By focusing on the Property & Casualty, Group Benefits and Mutual Fund businesses, we will, over time, deliver sustained superior returns and greater shareholder value. In order to achieve these objectives, we are focused on 3 key goals: first, improving margins and ROEs in our go-forward businesses; second, strengthening overall capital generation; and third, reducing the volatility of our earnings and capital. So let me go through each of these in a little more detail. 
Our go-forward businesses have strong ROEs, although there is room for improvement. Combined, we expect them to achieve a 12% to 13% ROE for 2012, and we are hard at work to improve this in 2013 and beyond. To achieve this, we're concentrating on improving margins in Middle Market and Group Benefits and growing the top line in Small Commercial and Mutual Funds. 
In the P&C Commercial segment, our Small Commercial business is a long-standing market leader, with good opportunities for continued profitable growth, particularly as the U.S. economy and small business formation recover. Written premiums were up 8% this quarter with a 91.8% combined ratio. We continue to be a preferred company for small business customers, driven by our long-term record of innovation, ranging from product to technology to service capabilities. 
In Middle Market, Doug Elliot and his team are improving product diversification and pricing, particularly in workers' compensation. I'm especially pleased with the pricing and margin improvements we've achieved over the past 6 months, although that has meant giving up some top line growth. Middle Market's combined ratio, x cats, in prior year was 99.2%, down from last year but still above what we need to achieve acceptable returns. In the first quarter, retention remained strong despite price increases of approximately 10% for the total Middle Market book. 
In Group Benefits, we achieved good rate increases on the first quarter renewals, but earnings are well below the segment's potential. The incidence in termination trends we are seeing are consistent with our competitors and largely due to the high unemployment rate, but we need to do better. With the new Group Benefits management in place, we have initiatives underway in sales, pricing, underwriting and claims. It will take time before the financial benefit of this work falls to the bottom line, particularly on pricing, given the 3-year contract terms in this business. Nevertheless, we like the mortality and morbidity underwriting margins of this business, as well as its long-term growth and return prospects. We have a strong franchise with a top-tier market position and excellent sales and distribution capabilities. With the success of our initiatives and some lift from an improving economy and unemployment trends, we believe that Group Benefits will once again achieve sustained superior returns.
The principal goal for Consumer Markets has been to improve margins, and Andy Napoli and his team have made great progress. The current year combined ratio, x cats, is improving year-over-year for 4 of the last 5 quarters, and we are increasing rates in homeowners to reflect high-cat and non-cat weather experience. With better margins, Consumer Markets is now striving for top line growth through both increasing retention and new business growth. We're doing well in both of these metrics. Retention has improved as a result of customer outreach and pricing initiatives, while new business levels have improved strongly. New business growth was favorable for the third quarter in a row and has now returned to acceptable levels. This success was due to improved response and conversion rates, as well as to our award-winning customer service. This week, J.D. Power and Associates announced that The Hartford was ranked highest in customer satisfaction with the auto insurance shopping experience, an important accomplishment for our Consumer Markets team and for our customers. 
In Mutual Funds, we are confident that going forward, we are well positioned to generate good growth in this high-return business. We are moving quickly to leverage our expanded relationship with Wellington. We want to transition all of the fixed income investment management to Wellington by the end of June, and we expect that the second half of the year will produce significant improvement in net flows. 
Improving margins and ROEs also requires us to remain focused on continued expense efficiency across the entire organization. After reducing expenses by $150 million in 2011, we took out another $30 million in the first quarter. We are continuing to execute on the efficiency objectives we established last year. In addition, we recently established a dedicated business transformation process to ensure that we remove all costs associated with the 3 businesses being sold and that corporate overhead and other shared service expenses are rightsized for the go-forward Hartford businesses. 
Our second goal for creating sustained superior performance is improving capital generation. Our go-forward businesses have historically been strong capital generators, but the Runoff businesses and Individual Life and Retirement Plans have not. As a result, our Life statutory capital generation has been constrained over the past several years. Statutory capital requirements in the Life company should decline over time, with the sale of the 3 Life businesses and the reduction of the Runoff book through lapses or management actions. The statutory earnings power of the P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds businesses will grow in the future.  Combined, we expect our total capital generation  going forward to be stronger than what it has been in the last few years. 
Finally, a third goal is to significantly reduce the sensitivity of our capital and earnings to financial markets risks. Our go-forward businesses are less sensitive to changes in the capital markets. Of course, we're focused on reducing the size of the variable annuity block, which is the primary source of our current market volatility. Some of this will occur naturally over time through policyholder lapses and withdrawals. But in addition, we will be prepared to take advantage of potential opportunities to isolate or separate the Runoff block that are both feasible from a regulatory perspective and create shareholder value. Through these efforts, we will ultimately free up capital from our divestitures and Runoff businesses, and we will be able to redeploy in our go-forward businesses and return to shareholders. And over time, The Hartford's financial profile will evolve into more of a property and casualty company, with strong returns and capital generation and limited sensitivity to capital market volatility.
This was a strong quarter for The Hartford. We had good financial results, favorable momentum in many of our go-forward businesses and have successful debt refinancing and warrant repurchase. The sales processes are going well, and with our sharper strategic focus, I am confident that we are on the right path to generate sustained superior returns and create greater shareholder value going forward. I and the rest of the team are very optimistic and excited about our future. 
I'll now turn the call over to Chris."

Good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 5. First quarter core earnings were $612 million or $1.25 per diluted share, representing an 11% improvement over prior year.

First quarter core earnings were $612 million or $1.25 per diluted share, representing an 11% improvement over prior year. Excluding the $192 million DAC unlock, core earnings were $420 million or $0.86 per diluted share, so it's a 7% increase compared to prior year. These results were largely in line with the estimate we provided on March 21, except for catastrophes. Cats were running about $20 million favorable to budget through mid-March. But with the late March storm activity, total cats ended the quarter at $46 million after tax, in line with our budget. Prior-year development was slightly favorable at $19 million after tax, with releases in personal lines offset by some modest development in P&C Commercial. 
The investment portfolio yield was stable this quarter at 4.2%, excluding partnerships. We are modestly increasing allocations to higher-yield assets and purchasing longer-duration bonds. Returns on alternatives and limited partnerships were 8%, and we continue to expect an annualized return of 9% for 2012. Impairments and changes to the mortgage loan loss reserve remained low at $28 million pretax in the quarter. 
Slide 6 shows book value per diluted common share on a restated basis for the new DAC accounting standard. At the end of the first quarter, book value per diluted share was $43.25, an increase of 12% over last year. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share rose by 1% to $40.55. 
Let's turn to our business results by segment.  Slide 7 shows the summary results for P&C Commercial. Core earnings were $162 million, a decline of 8% from prior year. Results included $13 million, after tax, of prior-year net reserve strengthening across multiple lines. Importantly, there were no meaningful reserve adjustments related to our workers' compensation loss experience. The combined ratio, x cat, x prior year, was 96.4%. We expect this to improve as written price increases earn in over the remainder of 2012. 
We continue to see strong price momentum in P&C Commercial. In the first quarter, we achieved renewal price increases of 7%, the highest level since the fourth quarter of 2003. We're especially pleased with renewal price trends in Middle Market workers' compensation, where first quarter price increases were up 14%. Policy count retention remained strong at 83% for standard commercial. This metric is clearly influenced by the large number of Small Commercial policies. If you look at retention on a premium weighted basis, over the past year, Small Commercial retention has been flat, while Middle Market retention has declined. This retention decline has been more than offset by improved pricing. We are very pleased with this trade-off as this will lead to continued margin expansion and ROE improvement. 
Shifting to Group Benefits, core earnings of $5 million remain well below our expectations. The loss ratio of 83% reflected elevated disability incidence and the lack of improvement in termination trends. We're addressing these disappointing results in 2 ways. First, we continue to take rate actions on accounts that are not meeting profitability targets. As Liam mentioned, it will take some time to get the profitability of the book to targeted levels, given the multiyear nature of the rate guarantees. Given our rate actions and the very competitive marketplace, persistency declined in the first quarter -- on first quarter renewals to 66% from 72% in the prior year. Ongoing sales are down 7%, primarily driven by a 21% decline in group disability sales. Group life sales increased 5% from the prior year. 
Second, we are reviewing all operational processes to identify ways to improve profitability. We recently appointed a new leader for this segment, Mike Concannon. Mike's property and casualty background brings a fresh perspective for potential improvement opportunities in many operational areas, like underwriting, pricing and claims management.
Turning to Slide 9, Consumer Markets reported first quarter core earnings of $102 million, down $9 million from prior year. Andy Napoli and his team are successfully executing on the strategy for this business. The combined ratio and retention improved, and new business production was strong. First quarter combined ratio, excluding cats and prior-year development, was 88.8%, a slight improvement from last year's 89.0%. We continue to manage our rate increases appropriately, with a 6% renewal written price increase in homeowners and 4% in auto. Like the rest of the personal lines industry, our homeowners book requires additional rate and underwriting actions to respond to recent weather trends. Overall retention was up 2 points to 84% in auto and 85% in homeowners. While we are pleased with the improvement, we still need another point or 2 in order to reach our targeted levels. New business written premium was up 30% in auto and 32% in home. After declining in the first half of 2011, new business premiums are now back to historic levels. Most of the new business growth is coming from our more profitable channels. For example, written premiums in AARP Agency almost doubled to $27 million from the prior year. We provided additional granularity in our financial supplement on written and earned and premiums by channel, so you can track our progress. 
We're encouraged by these positive results. With improving margins, Consumer Markets is now poised to profitably grow while also improving their ROEs. 
Wealth Management results are summarized in Slide 10. First quarter core earnings, x DAC unlock, were $154 million, 15% lower than prior year. This decrease was largely due to a 7% decline in assets under management primarily from net outflows in Individual Annuities. Individual Annuity core earnings, x DAC unlock, were $96 million, down 11% from prior year. This segment will be reported in the Runoff division next quarter. 
The first quarter annualized lapse rate for the U.S. in-force VA block was about 14%, in line with our expectations. Since our announcement to exit the Individual Annuity businesses, lapses have increased approximately 20% in the U.S. and 4% in Japan. It's too soon to judge whether lapses will remain at these levels, but if they do, it will accelerate the runoff of the VA book. 
Core earnings in Individual Life, x DAC unlock, were $34 million, a decline of $4 million from prior year due to lower alternative investment returns, as well as slightly higher expenses. Individual Life sales were up 13% over prior year and increased across all key distribution channels. 
In the individual Retirement Plans, core earnings were $4 million, down $5 million from the prior year. Spread compression on the general account products continues to weigh on results. Assets under management had a record $57.2 billion, aided by rising equity markets and positive net flows. 
As a result of our planned sales, we have evaluated the goodwill balances for Individual Life and Retirement Plans in the first quarter. No impairment is necessary at this time. However, we will continue to monitor its recoverability. 
Moving to Mutual Funds, core earnings were $20 million, down $7 million from prior year due to lower assets under management. First quarter fund performance improved, particularly in our largest fund, Capital Appreciation Fund. Overall, more than 80% of the funds outperformed our benchmarks. This strong quarterly performance contributed to an increase in non-proprietary fund deposits of 18% on a sequential basis. 
The results of our Runoff division are on Slide 11. Core earnings, x DAC unlock, were $105 million, basically in line with prior year. As Liam discussed, we have a number of initiatives underway to shrink the size and risk of this book. This will allow us to redeploy the capital allocated to this business over time. As you know, rising equity markets, higher interest rates and a weakening yen are all positives for our in-force VA book. The economic value of the VA book is greatly improved as a result of these market conditions. During the quarter, the net amount at risk related to our VA book declined substantially. For example, the NAR related to the U.S. and Japan GMDB business improved $5.3 billion during the quarter. This improvement isn't always evident in our GAAP and statutory accounting results, given the mismatch between the carrying value of the hedge assets and the VA reserves. 
As you can see on Slide 12, that on a GAAP basis, the net change in VA reserves and hedge assets generated a loss of approximately $1.1 billion, which reflects the asymmetrical accounting for our U.S. GMDB and Japan guarantees. On a statutory basis, the decline in the value of the hedge assets exceeded the change in the value of the U.S. VACARVM reserves by $183 million.
It's important to note that our hedge program continues to work as designed. Its primary focus is economic risk, not GAAP accounting results. As the markets change, we will adjust our targets in order to maintain appropriate hedging levels. 
On Slide 13 is our statutory surplus roll-forward. U.S. statutory surplus increased approximately $600 million in the first quarter before dividends. Consistent with our practice, a $200 million dividend was declared from the P&C to the holding company in order to cover interest, dividends and other expenses. The P&C operations generated more than $300 million of statutory operating income and almost $200 million of other positive surplus impacts, including investment-related gains. Life statutory operating income, excluding VA, turned positive this quarter and was approximately $100 million. This was largely offset by the VA hedge-related impacts I mentioned earlier.  In total, the Life operations ended the quarter with a modest increase in statutory surplus. 
As you can see on Slide 14, we ended the quarter with $17.9 billion of capital resources. Holding company resources declined almost $100 million in the quarter, reflecting dividends, interests and share repurchase activity. We expect holding company resources to decline modestly in the second quarter due to this element of the warrant repurchase.
Turning to Slide 15, we were very pleased to complete the Allianz transactions, which were a major step in restructuring the balance sheet and enhancing our financial flexibility. On April 17, we repaid $1.75 billion par value of Allianz junior subordinated debt with the proceeds from the issuance of $1.55 billion of senior notes and $600 million of new junior subordinated debt. This new debt has a blended interest rate of approximately 6% versus the 10% coupon on the Allianz debt. This reduces annual interest paid by $45 million on a pretax basis. As a result, our statutory dividend coverage ratio is improved by almost 0.5 point to 4x. 
In the second quarter, we will take an after-tax charge to net income of approximately $600 million to reflect the premium paid to retire the debt and to write off the related unamortized discount and debt costs. We also purchased all the outstanding Allianz warrants for $300 million. This transaction reduced first quarter book value by $0.61 per diluted share. 
In addition, early in the first quarter, we purchased 2.6 million shares of common stock. To date, we have completed $394 million of the $500 million equity repurchase authorization. We intend to complete the remaining $106 million on a timely basis, taking into consideration market conditions and trading restrictions.
Turning to Slide 16, I wanted to conclude with our outlook for the second quarter. We expect second quarter run rate core earnings to be in a similar range to the first quarter, absent higher loss cost seasonality. In the second quarter, we expect higher cats with a budget of $84 million after tax, which is $0.08 per diluted share, higher than the first quarter, which brings our total estimate to $0.70 to $0.75 per diluted share. This estimate does not include DAC unlocks, prior-year reserve development, restructuring charges related to the Wealth Management division. These restructuring charges, which include retention awards and other expenses, may be up to $20 million or about $0.04 per share. 
Our businesses this quarter performed largely in line with our expectations, with the exception of Group Benefits. We currently expect full year earnings for Group Benefits to be essentially flat with 2011. We expect pricing momentum in the P&C businesses will expand margins in the second half of 2012. Our earnings outlook for Individual Life and Retirement Plans businesses hasn't changed, although we expect sales to be down as a result of our recent announcements. 
Looking forward, the ongoing businesses are executing under 2012 initiatives to grow and increase margins. We look forward to sharing progress with you, and we will provide more information about the P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Fund operations in the quarters to come. In addition, we'll keep you updated on the other operational and strategic actions we may take within our Runoff division. The strength and momentum in our ongoing businesses, combined with the actions we are taking to be a more focused company, will improve the earnings and the ROE profile of The Hartford over time. 
At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Sabra to begin the Q&A session."

And then any actions that were effective in our runoff business -- this is a company that, over the next couple of years, should liberate capital. We're more confident in the strength of our balance sheet, and to be more specific than that, now would be premature obviously. There's timing, market levels, et cetera, but I think we position the company as we execute effectively, and we're focused on -- laser-focused on execution, on the things that we've described.

Yesterday, we announced strong first quarter results, with core earnings up 11% to $1.25 per diluted share. Our P&C combined ratio was 95.7%, a very good result. Strong pricing momentum continued in the P&C Commercial segment, and we had significantly improved new business growth in Consumer Markets. 
We also achieved several significant accomplishments. We concluded the strategic evaluation of the businesses and announced our plan to focus on the Property & Casualty, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds businesses. This is The Hartford's best path forward to deliver greater value for shareholders. So in order to increase transparency on our go-forward businesses, we expanded P&C disclosures this quarter, providing more details on Small Commercial, Middle Market and Consumer Markets. Going forward, our presentations will focus on greater detail on the performance about our go-forward businesses and the progress in reducing the size and amount of risk in the Runoff division.  We are moving quickly to execute the plan we outlined in March, including selling businesses, placing the annuity block into Runoff and exploring options for the Runoff division. Let me update you briefly on each of these. 
The sales processes for Individual Life, Retirement Plans and Woodbury Financial are going well. The offering memoranda for each are in the marketplace. There is great interest in each property. We expect to have a competitive auction process, and we expect definitive agreements later this year. I am proud of the hard work and dedication of the employees in these businesses. They are focused on delivering successful and valuable businesses to the ultimate buyers. The proceeds from these sales will give us additional financial flexibility that, over time, we expect to use for capital management actions and some debt reduction. We will also consider options for reducing risk in the Runoff businesses or reinvesting in our go-forward businesses. 
In addition, last week, we announced an agreement to sell the Individual Annuity new business capabilities. This sale does not change our decision to put the in-force block into Runoff, nor does it have a material financial impact on The Hartford. However, it does provide an opportunity for us to place our innovative products, strong distribution capabilities and talented employees with an organization committed to the annuity space. We are also working hard on initiatives to further reduce the size and risk of the Life runoff segment, which will shrink over time through policyholder lapses. While our ultimate goal is to isolate or separate the annuity block from our go-forward businesses, the management team is currently concentrating on transactional and operational opportunities for individual books of business. 
With respect to transactions, we are exploring a wide range of potential opportunities, including sales, reinsurance and other structural concepts. A variety of parties have expressed initial interest in parts of the block. Of course, any transactions will need to balance short-term economics with the long-term objective of reducing liabilities, which would allow us to redeploy some of the capital currently allocated to the Runoff block. It's still early, but we do expect some of these potential opportunities to materialize over time, particularly as the capital markets continue to stabilize. 
On the operational side, we are pursuing options such as outsourcing or different fund options that will reduce risk or expenses. And of course, we anticipate achieving expense reductions of $100 million before tax in 2013 by placing Individual Annuity segment into Runoff. 
In April, we also refinanced the Allianz debt and repurchased their warrants. The refinancing strengthens our balance sheet by reducing long-term interest costs and improving financial flexibility by extending the debt maturity schedule. The warrant repurchase eliminates a material source of future dilution. Allianz remains a major shareholder of The Hartford, and we appreciate their support. 
We are already beginning to execute on our strategy. By focusing on the Property & Casualty, Group Benefits and Mutual Fund businesses, we will, over time, deliver sustained superior returns and greater shareholder value. In order to achieve these objectives, we are focused on 3 key goals: first, improving margins and ROEs in our go-forward businesses; second, strengthening overall capital generation; and third, reducing the volatility of our earnings and capital. So let me go through each of these in a little more detail. 
Our go-forward businesses have strong ROEs, although there is room for improvement. Combined, we expect them to achieve a 12% to 13% ROE for 2012, and we are hard at work to improve this in 2013 and beyond. To achieve this, we're concentrating on improving margins in Middle Market and Group Benefits and growing the top line in Small Commercial and Mutual Funds. 
In the P&C Commercial segment, our Small Commercial business is a long-standing market leader, with good opportunities for continued profitable growth, particularly as the U.S. economy and small business formation recover. Written premiums were up 8% this quarter with a 91.8% combined ratio. We continue to be a preferred company for small business customers, driven by our long-term record of innovation, ranging from product to technology to service capabilities. 
In Middle Market, Doug Elliot and his team are improving product diversification and pricing, particularly in workers' compensation. I'm especially pleased with the pricing and margin improvements we've achieved over the past 6 months, although that has meant giving up some top line growth. Middle Market's combined ratio, x cats, in prior year was 99.2%, down from last year but still above what we need to achieve acceptable returns. In the first quarter, retention remained strong despite price increases of approximately 10% for the total Middle Market book. 
In Group Benefits, we achieved good rate increases on the first quarter renewals, but earnings are well below the segment's potential. The incidence in termination trends we are seeing are consistent with our competitors and largely due to the high unemployment rate, but we need to do better. With the new Group Benefits management in place, we have initiatives underway in sales, pricing, underwriting and claims. It will take time before the financial benefit of this work falls to the bottom line, particularly on pricing, given the 3-year contract terms in this business. Nevertheless, we like the mortality and morbidity underwriting margins of this business, as well as its long-term growth and return prospects. We have a strong franchise with a top-tier market position and excellent sales and distribution capabilities. With the success of our initiatives and some lift from an improving economy and unemployment trends, we believe that Group Benefits will once again achieve sustained superior returns.
The principal goal for Consumer Markets has been to improve margins, and Andy Napoli and his team have made great progress. The current year combined ratio, x cats, is improving year-over-year for 4 of the last 5 quarters, and we are increasing rates in homeowners to reflect high-cat and non-cat weather experience. With better margins, Consumer Markets is now striving for top line growth through both increasing retention and new business growth. We're doing well in both of these metrics. Retention has improved as a result of customer outreach and pricing initiatives, while new business levels have improved strongly. New business growth was favorable for the third quarter in a row and has now returned to acceptable levels. This success was due to improved response and conversion rates, as well as to our award-winning customer service. This week, J.D. Power and Associates announced that The Hartford was ranked highest in customer satisfaction with the auto insurance shopping experience, an important accomplishment for our Consumer Markets team and for our customers. 
In Mutual Funds, we are confident that going forward, we are well positioned to generate good growth in this high-return business. We are moving quickly to leverage our expanded relationship with Wellington. We want to transition all of the fixed income investment management to Wellington by the end of June, and we expect that the second half of the year will produce significant improvement in net flows. 
Improving margins and ROEs also requires us to remain focused on continued expense efficiency across the entire organization. After reducing expenses by $150 million in 2011, we took out another $30 million in the first quarter. We are continuing to execute on the efficiency objectives we established last year. In addition, we recently established a dedicated business transformation process to ensure that we remove all costs associated with the 3 businesses being sold and that corporate overhead and other shared service expenses are rightsized for the go-forward Hartford businesses. 
Our second goal for creating sustained superior performance is improving capital generation. Our go-forward businesses have historically been strong capital generators, but the Runoff businesses and Individual Life and Retirement Plans have not. As a result, our Life statutory capital generation has been constrained over the past several years. Statutory capital requirements in the Life company should decline over time, with the sale of the 3 Life businesses and the reduction of the Runoff book through lapses or management actions. The statutory earnings power of the P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds businesses will grow in the future.  Combined, we expect our total capital generation going forward to be stronger than what it has been in the last few years. 
Finally, a third goal is to significantly reduce the sensitivity of our capital and earnings to financial markets risks. Our go-forward businesses are less sensitive to changes in the capital markets. Of course, we're focused on reducing the size of the variable annuity block, which is the primary source of our current market volatility. Some of this will occur naturally over time through policyholder lapses and withdrawals. But in addition, we will be prepared to take advantage of potential opportunities to isolate or separate the Runoff block that are both feasible from a regulatory perspective and create shareholder value. Through these efforts, we will ultimately free up capital from our divestitures and Runoff businesses, and we will be able to redeploy in our go-forward businesses and return to shareholders. And over time, The Hartford's financial profile will evolve into more of a property and casualty company, with strong returns and capital generation and limited sensitivity to capital market volatility.
This was a strong quarter for The Hartford. We had good financial results, favorable momentum in many of our go-forward businesses and have successful debt refinancing and warrant repurchase. The sales processes are going well, and with our sharper strategic focus, I am confident that we are on the right path to generate sustained superior returns and create greater shareholder value going forward. I and the rest of the team are very optimistic and excited about our future. 
I'll now turn the call over to Chris."

Good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 5. First quarter core earnings were $612 million or $1.25 per diluted share, representing an 11% improvement over prior year. Excluding the $192 million DAC unlock, core earnings were $420 milli",2157,"Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 5. First quarter core earnings were $612 million or $1.25 per diluted share, representing an 11% improvement over prior year. Excluding the $192 million DAC unlock, core earnings were $420 million or $0.86 per diluted share, so it's a 7% increase compared to prior year. These results were largely in line with the estimate we provided on March 21, except for catastrophes. Cats were running about $20 million favorable to budget through mid-March. But with the late March storm activity, total cats ended the quarter at $46 million after tax, in line with our budget. Prior-year development was slightly favorable at $19 million after tax, with releases in personal lines offset by some modest development in P&C Commercial. 
The investment portfolio yield was stable this quarter at 4.2%, excluding partnerships. We are modestly increasing allocations to higher-yield assets and purchasing longer-duration bonds. Returns on alternatives and limited partnerships were 8%, and we continue to expect an annualized return of 9% for 2012. Impairments and changes to the mortgage loan loss reserve remained low at $28 million pretax in the quarter. 
Slide 6 shows book value per diluted common share on a restated basis for the new DAC accounting standard. At the end of the first quarter, book value per diluted share was $43.25, an increase of 12% over last year. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share rose by 1% to $40.55. 
Let's turn to our business results by segment.  Slide 7 shows the summary results for P&C Commercial. Core earnings were $162 million, a decline of 8% from prior year. Results included $13 million, after tax, of prior-year net reserve strengthening across multiple lines. Importantly, there were no meaningful reserve adjustments related to our workers' compensation loss experience. The combined ratio, x cat, x prior year, was 96.4%. We expect this to improve as written price increases earn in over the remainder of 2012. 
We continue to see strong price momentum in P&C Commercial. In the first quarter, we achieved renewal price increases of 7%, the highest level since the fourth quarter of 2003. We're especially pleased with renewal price trends in Middle Market workers' compensation, where first quarter price increases were up 14%. Policy count retention remained strong at 83% for standard commercial. This metric is clearly influenced by the large number of Small Commercial policies. If you look at retention on a premium weighted basis, over the past year, Small Commercial retention has been flat, while Middle Market retention has declined. This retention decline has been more than offset by improved pricing. We are very pleased with this trade-off as this will lead to continued margin expansion and ROE improvement. 
Shifting to Group Benefits, core earnings of $5 million remain well below our expectations. The loss ratio of 83% reflected elevated disability incidence and the lack of improvement in termination trends. We're addressing these disappointing results in 2 ways. First, we continue to take rate actions on accounts that are not meeting profitability targets. As Liam mentioned, it will take some time to get the profitability of the book to targeted levels, given the multiyear nature of the rate guarantees. Given our rate actions and the very competitive marketplace, persistency declined in the first quarter -- on first quarter renewals to 66% from 72% in the prior year. Ongoing sales are down 7%, primarily driven by a 21% decline in group disability sales. Group life sales increased 5% from the prior year. 
Second, we are reviewing all operational processes to identify ways to improve profitability. We recently appointed a new leader for this segment, Mike Concannon. Mike's property and casualty background brings a fresh perspective for potential improvement opportunities in many operational areas, like underwriting, pricing and claims management.
Turning to Slide 9, Consumer Markets reported first quarter core earnings of $102 million, down $9 million from prior year. Andy Napoli and his team are successfully executing on the strategy for this business. The combined ratio and retention improved, and new business production was strong. First quarter combined ratio, excluding cats and prior-year development, was 88.8%, a slight improvement from last year's 89.0%. We continue to manage our rate increases appropriately, with a 6% renewal written price increase in homeowners and 4% in auto. Like the rest of the personal lines industry, our homeowners book requires additional rate and underwriting actions to respond to recent weather trends. Overall retention was up 2 points to 84% in auto and 85% in homeowners. While we are pleased with the improvement, we still need another point or 2 in order to reach our targeted levels. New business written premium was up 30% in auto and 32% in home. After declining in the first half of 2011, new business premiums are now back to historic levels. Most of the new business growth is coming from our more profitable channels. For example, written premiums in AARP Agency almost doubled to $27 million from the prior year. We provided additional granularity in our financial supplement on written and earned and premiums by channel, so you can track our progress. 
We're encouraged by these positive results. With improving margins, Consumer Markets is now poised to profitably grow while also improving their ROEs. 
Wealth Management results are summarized in Slide 10. First quarter core earnings, x DAC unlock, were $154 million, 15% lower than prior year. This decrease was largely due to a 7% decline in assets under management primarily from net outflows in Individual Annuities. Individual Annuity core earnings, x DAC unlock, were $96 million, down 11% from prior year. This segment will be reported in the Runoff division next quarter. 
The first quarter annualized lapse rate for the U.S. in-force VA block was about 14%, in line with our expectations. Since our announcement to exit the Individual Annuity businesses, lapses have increased approximately 20% in the U.S. and 4% in Japan. It's too soon to judge whether lapses will remain at these levels, but if they do, it will accelerate the runoff of the VA book. 
Core earnings in Individual Life, x DAC unlock, were $34 million, a decline of $4 million from prior year due to lower alternative investment returns, as well as slightly higher expenses. Individual Life sales were up 13% over prior year and increased across all key distribution channels. 
In the individual Retirement Plans, core earnings were $4 million, down $5 million from the prior year. Spread compression on the general account products continues to weigh on results. Assets under management had a record $57.2 billion, aided by rising equity markets and positive net flows. 
As a result of our planned sales, we have evaluated the goodwill balances for Individual Life and Retirement Plans in the first quarter. No impairment is necessary at this time. However, we will continue to monitor its recoverability. 
Moving to Mutual Funds, core earnings were $20 million, down $7 million from prior year due to lower assets under management. First quarter fund performance improved, particularly in our largest fund, Capital Appreciation Fund. Overall, more than 80% of the funds outperformed their benchmarks. This strong quarterly performance contributed to an increase in non-proprietary fund deposits of 18% on a sequential basis. 
The results of our Runoff division are on Slide 11. Core earnings, x DAC unlock, were $105 million, basically in line with prior year. As Liam discussed, we have a number of initiatives underway to shrink the size and risk of this book. This will allow us to redeploy the capital allocated to this business over time. As you know, rising equity markets, higher interest rates and a weakening yen are all positives for our in-force VA book. The economic value of the VA book is greatly improved as a result of these market conditions. During the quarter, the net amount at risk related to our VA book declined substantially. For example, the NAR related to the U.S. and Japan GMDB business improved $5.3 billion during the quarter. This improvement isn't always evident in our GAAP and statutory accounting results, given the mismatch between the carrying value of the hedge assets and the VA reserves. 
As you can see on Slide 12, that on a GAAP basis, the net change in VA reserves and hedge assets generated a loss of approximately $1.1 billion, which reflects the asymmetrical accounting for our U.S. GMDB and Japan guarantees. On a statutory basis, the decline in the value of the hedge assets exceeded the change in the value of the U.S. VACARVM reserves by $183 million.
It's important to note that our hedge program continues to work as designed. Its primary focus is economic risk, not GAAP accounting results. As the markets change, we will adjust our targets in order to maintain appropriate hedging levels. 
On Slide 13 is our statutory surplus roll-forward. U.S. statutory surplus increased approximately $600 million in the first quarter before dividends. Consistent with our practice, a $200 million dividend was declared from the P&C to the holding company in order to cover interest, dividends and other expenses. The P&C operations generated more than $300 million of statutory operating income and almost $200 million of other positive surplus impacts, including investment-related gains. Life statutory operating income, excluding VA, turned positive this quarter and was approximately $100 million. This was largely offset by the VA hedge-related impacts I mentioned earlier.  In total, the Life operations ended the quarter with a modest increase in statutory surplus. 
As you can see on Slide 14, we ended the quarter with $17.9 billion of capital resources. Holding company resources declined almost $100 million in the quarter, reflecting dividends, interests and share repurchase activity. We expect holding company resources to decline modestly in the second quarter due to this element of the warrant repurchase.
Turning to Slide 15, we were very pleased to complete the Allianz transactions, which were a major step in restructuring the balance sheet and enhancing our financial flexibility. On April 17, we repaid $1.75 billion par value of Allianz junior subordinated debt with the proceeds from the issuance of $1.55 billion of senior notes and $600 million of new junior subordinated debt. This new debt has a blended interest rate of approximately 6% versus the 10% coupon on the Allianz debt. This reduces annual interest paid by $45 million on a pretax basis. As a result, our statutory dividend coverage ratio is improved by almost 0.5 point to 4x. 
In the second quarter, we will take an after-tax charge to net income of approximately $600 million to reflect the premium paid to retire the debt and to write off the related unamortized discount and debt costs. We also purchased all the outstanding Allianz warrants for $300 million. This transaction reduced first quarter book value by $0.61 per diluted share. 
In addition, early in the first quarter, we purchased 2.6 million shares of common stock. To date, we have completed $394 million of the $500 million equity repurchase authorization. We intend to complete the remaining $106 million on a timely basis, taking into consideration market conditions and trading restrictions.
Turning to Slide 16, I wanted to conclude with our outlook for the second quarter. We expect second quarter run rate core earnings to be in a similar range to the first quarter, absent higher loss cost seasonality. In the second quarter, we expect higher cats with a budget of $84 million after tax, which is $0.08 per diluted share, higher than the first quarter, which brings our total estimate to $0.70 to $0.75 per diluted share. This estimate does not include DAC unlocks, prior-year reserve development, restructuring charges related to the Wealth Management division. These restructuring charges, which include retention awards and other expenses, may be up to $20 million or about $0.04 per share. 
Our businesses this quarter performed largely in line with our expectations, with the exception of Group Benefits. We currently expect full year earnings for Group Benefits to be essentially flat with 2011. We expect pricing momentum in the P&C businesses will expand margins in the second half of 2012. Our earnings outlook for Individual Life and Retirement Plans businesses hasn't changed, although we expect sales to be down as a result of our recent announcements. 
Looking forward, the ongoing businesses are executing under 2012 initiatives to grow and increase margins. We look forward to sharing progress with you, and we will provide more information about the P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Fund operations in the quarters to come. In addition, we'll keep you updated on the other operational and strategic actions we may take within our Runoff division. The strength and momentum in our ongoing businesses, combined with the actions we are taking to be a more focused company, will improve the earnings and the ROE profile of The Hartford over time. 
At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Sabra to begin the Q&A session."

In the short-term area, it looks like we've got some improvement on our incident trends, so that's a positive. Clearly, as we've talked in the past, our terminations are down and running lower than our historical run rate. We are working all the levers available to us.

Before I get started, I want to welcome Brian Johnson, our recently appointed Chief Investment Officer. Prior to his appointment in May, Brian was head of Strategy and Finance for our Investment Management subsidiary. 
This was a productive quarter at The Hartford. We generated good underlying financial results marked by improved performance in our go-forward businesses. We successfully refinanced the Allianz debt and completed the $500 million equity repurchase program. We also made progress in executing our new strategy, particularly in the sales processes for the Life businesses, which are proceeding as expected.
Let me start with an overview of our quarterly financial results. Core earnings were $119 million or $0.23 per diluted share, including high catastrophe losses, although less than last year's; restructuring expenses, and an unfavorable DAC unlock.
Adjusting for these items, core earnings were $0.85 per diluted share, ahead of our May outlook. Importantly, earnings were marked by favorable momentum in our go-forward businesses. Core earnings in P&C Commercial increased 67% from the prior year, reflecting lower catastrophe losses and the favorable impact of pricing and underwriting actions launched last year, particularly in workers compensation.
We saw adverse loss trends in the comp line early and immediately began taking action. Workers compensation trends are generally performing as we expected, with only a slight adjustment this quarter.
Our actions are now yielding results, and we're optimistic that we've turned the corner. We're getting price increases in all lines with a 7% renewal price increase in standard commercial. In Middle Market, our renewal pricing was up 16% in workers compensation, and we expect to continue to improve margins and product mix.
Retention remains strong for the accounts we want to keep, although down a bit in total as we shared more of our unprofitable accounts.
In Group Benefits, core earnings were up from first quarter. We had favorable Life and AD&D results as well as a seasonal improvement and long-term disability trends. The Hartford was among the first to recognize adverse trends in incidence and terminations which we addressed by taking pricing actions beginning in early 2011 and continuing through today. It will take more time and work to get this business back to historical profitability, but I'm encouraged with our progress.
In Consumer Markets, the quarter's financial results were adversely affected by heavy cat activity. We remain focused on profitable growth and improving both margins and ROEs. Retention continues to improve in both homeowners and auto, even as we continue to take rates in each. New business trends are also good, up 17% over the prior year.
We remain excited about the prospects for our Mutual Funds business and our expanded relationship with Wellington. During the quarter, we completed the transition of fixed income funds to Wellington and our marketing initiatives will expand in the second half. We're confident that our Mutual Fund assets will grow, given Wellington's leading capabilities in managing both equities and fixed income. This is particularly important given the continued flows out of equity and in the fixed income funds industrywide.
We're on track for our targeted expense reductions, and as Chris will present in more detail, have increased our 2013 goals. In addition, in order to remain efficient in our go-forward businesses, we will eliminate all expenses for the Life businesses that are being sold.
Now let me review this quarter's progress and our strategy announced in March to focus on P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds. As you recall, these businesses satisfied all 3 of our requirements. First, that they have competitive market positions on which we could invest for future profitable growth. Next, that they generate, not consume capital. And finally, that they will lead to lower market sensitivity for the company.
We also announced that we shut down our U.S. DA business included in the runoff and that we would sell the Individual Life, Retirement Plans and Woodbury Financial services, our retail broker-dealer. Since that announcement we've made solid progress in achieving our sharper focus strategy. First, the sales processes are proceeding as planned. On Tuesday, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell Woodbury Financial Services for proceeds totaling $115 million, subject to closing adjustments. The sales processes for the remaining Life businesses continue, and we look forward to updating you when definitive sales agreements have been reached.
Second, we have effectively shut down our U.S. Variable Annuities business. We signed a definitive agreement to sell the new VA business infrastructure which we expect to close by year end. The sale provides a smooth transition to more than 100 of our teammates in the U.S. Individual Annuity organization. We expect to reduce expenses by $100 million before tax in 2013 as a result.
Third, on the legacy annuity block, we announced the appointment of Beth Bombara as President of the Life business. Beth has a deep knowledge of The Hartford and the annuity business and has a track record of significant accomplishments. She and her team will accelerate the good work already underway to reduce the size and risk of our legacy annuity liabilities, as well as initiatives that could isolate or separate them from the ongoing businesses. And over time, free up capital.
Given current economic conditions, this process will take time, but we will be prepared to take advantage of opportunities to reduce or sell blocks of business. We will balance economics and any possible consumption of statutory surplus against the potentially positive impact on shareholder value of reducing the block.
We are confident that we will achieve our goals. In the meantime, the VA hedging programs provide protection to policy holders and shareholders from adverse economic environments.
I know that there's a lot of interest in our plans for the use of the proceeds from the sales of the Life businesses. As we discussed in March, we will maintain capital sufficient for adverse economic environments and support of our go-forward businesses and their current ratings. We will work with all of our constituencies, including regulators and rating agencies, to develop a final plan that supports both our business and capital management goals.
Now while our plans are not final, we expect to repay a minimum of $320 million of debt maturing in July 2013 in order to maintain leverage and interest coverage ratios at levels that support current ratings, and also to pursue accretive actions for shareholders, which currently would be common stock repurchases or future potential transactions that would reduce the size and risk of the annuity book. We will update you in early 2013 as our plans and the business sales are finalized.
So to conclude, the second quarter was successful at The Hartford on many fronts. We had good core earnings and continued momentum in our go-forward businesses. We completed the $500 million stock buyback, repurchased the Allianz debt and made more progress on our expense initiatives. We announced an agreement to sell Woodbury Financial Services on Tuesday, and the sales process as of the Individual Life in Retirement Plans businesses are proceeding as planned. We are diligently exploring opportunities to reduce the size and risk of our annuity exposures, isolate or separate them from the ongoing businesses, and over time, free up associated capital.
We know we have a lot more work to do, but we are confident that we're on the right path and I look forward to sharing our progress with you next quarter and beyond.
I'll now turn the microphone over to Chris who will cover our financial results in more detail.

341546,208386315,337639,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2012",2012-08-02,"Earnings Calls","The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. My comments this morning will cover 3 areas: A review of second quarter results, an update of our expense targets, and our third quarter current outlook.Second quarter core earnings were $119 million or $0.23 per",2030,"Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. My comments this morning will cover 3 areas: A review of second quarter results, an update of our expense targets, and our third quarter current outlook.
Second quarter core earnings were $119 million or $0.23 per diluted share, representing a significant improvement over prior year. These results include 4 items I want to highlight. First, catastrophe losses were $189 million after tax, which is $105 million higher than our original outlook. Second, we had unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of $32 million. Both of these items are in line with our July 16 announcement. Third, our results included unfavorable unlock of $127 million, marginally related to our quarterly adjusted for market performance on our runoff annuity block. Finally, we also incurred $31 million of restructuring charges primarily for severance and retention associated with the sales of Individual Life, Retirement Plans and Woodbury Financial services, as well as the shutdown of U.S. VA business.
Core earnings this quarter excluding these 4 items were $414 million or $0.85 per diluted share based on a 485 million share count. This is higher than May's outlook of us $0.70 the $0.75 per share primarily driven by better than anticipated group benefit results. In this low interest rate environment, we remain focused on pricing actions as well as strategies to maintain investment yields. The investment portfolio yield was stable this quarter at 4.3%, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, which had a 10% annualized return in the quarter.
Consistent with last quarter, we modestly extended the duration of the portfolio and slightly increased our holdings in higher-yielding asset classes. Impairments and changes to the mortgage loan loss reserve growth this quarter to $60 million after tax and DAC, largely due to losses after some recently downgraded financial institution preferred equity securities. Overall, fundamental credit performance remains strong with no material changes in default experience or expectation.
Turning to Slide 6, second quarter 2012 book value per diluted share was $45.59, an increase of 14% over last year. Book value benefited from declining interest rates which increased the unrealized gains in our fixed investments. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share rose by 2% to $40.91. Book value growth over the last year was muted by higher catastrophes, as well as this quarter's $587 million charge for repaying the Allianz debt. This was a major step in restructuring the balance sheet and enhancing our financial flexibility.
We also repurchased $106 million of common stock this quarter to complete our $500 million share repurchase plan. This is also reflected in our book value.
Turning to segment results, Slide 7 shows the summary results for P&C Commercial. Core earnings were $160 million, a 67% increase from the prior year due to better catastrophe results. Results also include a $12 million after tax of net unfavorable prior year loss reserve development across multiple lines. This included about $28 million after tax of adverse development on our workers compensation book, marginally for accident year 2011. The combined ratio x cat x prior year was 94.5, up slightly over prior year's 93.1, which did not include the change in our 2011 accident year loss picks we made in the third and fourth quarter last year. We continued to expect the P&C Commercial combined ratio x cat x prior year to improve based on achieve pricing and outlook for future rate increases.
As Liam mentioned, we continued to see strong price increases in P&C Commercial. We achieved renewal rate pricing increases of 7% in standard commercial equal to the first quarter. Workers compensation is a key driver with a 16% rate increase in Middle Market. Consistent with first quarter, all other commercial lines had rate increases as well with  6% in Small Commercial, 8% in Middle Market property, 6% in Middle Market General Liability.
Our pricing actions have impacted retention slightly. Middle Market retention was lower at 73% in the quarter, which is a top line trade-off we are making to improve margins. Small Commercial retention remains strong at 82%, slightly down from last year and last quarter. We will continue to be disciplined in our pricing initiatives, which are focused on achieving better margins and underperforming accounts, while maintaining margins and retention on our best performing accounts.
Shifting to Group Benefits. Core earnings of $34 million were a significant improvement well above first quarter levels, and up $4 million from last year's quarter. The loss ratio was 78.6, an improvement over the first quarter, which tends to be seasonally high, but still up from the 78% in prior year. As a result of our rate actions and a very competitive marketplace, premiums declined 6%. This reflects the impact of pricing action on both new business and renewal trends occurring over the last 18 months.
We had favorable Life and AD&D experience, so I wouldn't annualize this quarter for the second half of the year. We still expect Group Benefit results this year to be flat with $86 million earned in 2011. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by our results in this line, and we are confident that initiatives over the past 18 months will get us to where we need to be.
Turning to Slide 9, Consumer Markets had core losses of $48 million due to catastrophe losses above budget, although below last year's level. Andy Napoli and his team are managing the book for profitable growth by balancing new business levels, and like the entire organization, expense efficiency. Retention has improved over the past several quarters and was up 2 points in both lines compared to a year ago.
Net written premiums declined 2% partially due to lower than historic retention which was partially offset by strong new business productions. Auto new business was up 13% for the quarter and 21% year-to-date. AARP Agency is a strong growth source. First half 2012 written premiums in AARP Agency almost doubled to $59 million from the prior year period. The second quarter combined ratio x cat and prior year development was 91.3, essentially flat with last year's 91.2.
Homeowners, in particular, remains negatively impacted by elevated weather events. We remain focused on improving profitability with renewal, written price increases in the quarter of 6% in homeowners and 4% and auto. Auto physical damage loss severity remains a challenge and we are watching frequency carefully. Auto liability frequency ticked up a little bit in the first quarter, but that trend did not continue in the second quarter. We are monitoring auto loss cost trends closely and we'll adjust our pricing is necessary. But in general, we are comfortable with our current balance of pricing, retention and new business.
Homeowners on the other hand needs more rate industrywide principally because of cats and non-cat weather.
We are encouraged by our results and Consumer Markets as we continue to focus on opportunities for profitable growth and improving margins and ROEs. 
Mutual fund results are summarized on Slide 10. All fixed income fund have now transitioned to Wellington, and expanded marketing initiatives are planned for the second half of the year. However, near-term earnings have been impacted by continued negative flows from equity funds and industrywide trends.
Mutual fund core earnings this quarter were $18 million, down $9 million from prior year due to a 14% decline in assets under management compared to a year ago. Core earnings also included expenses for moving the business to Pennsylvania and expanding distribution teams.
The results of our combined Life in P&C run off division are on Slide 11. Core earnings x DAC and lock were $148 million. This includes $162 million from Life and a loss of $14 million in P&C, which includes the asbestos environmental charge. Excluding the ANE charge and DAC unlock, core earnings were in line with our expectation.
Another is interest in our annuity experience since our March 21 announcement. Activity for the U.S. block averaged an annualized rate of 17.5% for the quarter. The rate increased to 20% in April immediately following the announcement but has since trended down to last year's level of 14% in July. 
Some of the decline is probably due to the decline market levels as we normally see lower surrenders in down markets. The surrender rates include both full and partial surrenders, which are now disclosed separately in the IFRS. Full surrenders for the second quarter were 13% annualized, up from 10% in the first quarter. Partial withdrawals were flat at 4.8%. While either type of activity helps reduce the size of the annuity liabilities, full surrenders eliminate the risk of those contracts. It's worth noting that the 2Q in the money surrenders have been running about 35% of the total, roughly consistent with the overall in Meninas of the U.S. VA GMWB block.
Slide 12 provides a summary of VA hedging results for the quarter. Our VA hedging programs primarily focus on economics. As you know, there are differences between GAAP, stat and economic results.
During the quarter, the net statutory impact of our VA liabilities and hedges was a negative $228 million before tax which excludes fees and other impacts at surplus. We ended the quarter with nearly $4 billion of VA statutory reserves in our U.S. and Japan subsidiaries.
Slide 13 is our surplus roll going forward. Total U.S. statutory surplus increased approximately $200 million in the second quarter. This is after $200 million of dividends from the P&C operations to the holding company. P&C had statutory operating earnings of about $100 million. VA statutory impacts were $100 million positive. Other items, primarily deferred taxes, were almost $200 million favorable.
In total, U.S. statutory Life surplus increased to $7.7 billion from $7.5 billion while P&C surplus was essentially flat at $7.7 billion.
As you can see on Slide 14, capital resources remains strong at $18 million after -- excuse me, $18 billion, after completing the share repurchase program and the Allianz refinancing. Holding company cash and short-term investments totaled $1.3 billion, down slightly from March due principally to the settlement of the warrant repurchase and the $106 million of share repurchases in the quarter.
Slide 15 sets forth our updated expense target reductions. In December of last year, we laid out of $450 million expense reduction target for year end 2013. We have increased that by a net $30 million to $480 million. This includes a $70 million reduction reflecting the portion of the original target that was attributable to the Life businesses being sold. It also reflects $100 million of expense reductions arising from the shutdown of U.S. VA business.
Additionally, in the quarter we incurred about $31 million of after tax restructuring and other expenses associated with the sales process, including retention expenses and advisory fee. We expect to incur approximately $40 million after tax and additional restructuring charges related to these activities in the second half of 2012.
Before taking questions, I want to briefly provide you with our outlook for the third quarter. We expect third quarter core earnings to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.80 per diluted share, including catastrophe losses of approximately $75 million after tax. Our third quarter estimate does not include the following items: First, it does not include prior year P&C loss reserve development; second, the outlook does not reflect any DAC unlock including those related to our annual third quarter assumption study; finally, it does not include any expenses or charges relating to the sales processes for the Life businesses and it excludes $25 million of restructuring and other expenses we expect to occur in the quarter.
To conclude, I'm pleased with our business results this quarter and for the year-to-date. With the exception of catastrophes, our businesses this quarter performed largely in line with our expectations with a slight positive from benefits. Our investment results remain strong despite the challenging low interest rate environment.
Looking forward, we will continue to maintain our pricing discipline in the P&C businesses, and we expect our initiatives in Group Benefits and Mutual Funds to hop improved profitability in 2013 and beyond.
At this point, I'd like to turn the call back over to Sabra to begin the Q&A session."

So if I heard you correctly, especially with the comments Chris just made, if we used the hypothetical fast forward it to year end, assuming the 2 other property sales transactions are consummated, so you have those proceeds or at least the anticipation of those proceeds, there's nothing in the environment today again I'm kind of pro forming this, that would suggest there would be third-party transaction market solution for restructuring the VA book, based on what you're seeing today. Thus, is it fair to conclude, if I'm right, on that buybacks would be the preferred use of proceeds assuming nothing changes in the environment today. Is that a fair way to think about it?"

So there isn't going to be just one thing. I think I've always said Tom and particularly I know you know if you really look at the fundamentals of the U.S. and Japan, they're different. The U.S. block from a relative risk perspective or relative size in its component of fixed and variable, actually it's a balanced portfolio liabilities. Japan, on the other hand, I think from share value perspective, is the greatest opportunity we have and to manage that in the most accretive way long term.

Before I get started, I want to welcome Brion Johnson, our recently appointed Chief Investment Officer. Prior to his appointment in May, Brion was Head of Strategy and Finance for our Investment Management subsidiary. 
This was a productive quarter at The Hartford. We generated good underlying financial results, marked by improved performance in our go-forward businesses. We successfully refinanced the Allianz debt and completed the $500 million equity repurchase program. We also made progress in executing our new strategy, particularly in the sales processes for the Life businesses, which are proceeding as expected.
Let me start with an overview of our quarterly financial results. Core earnings were $119 million or $0.23 per diluted share, including high catastrophe losses, although less than last year's; restructuring expenses; and an unfavorable DAC unlock. Adjusting for these items, core earnings were $0.85 per diluted share, ahead of our May outlook. 
Importantly, earnings were marked by favorable momentum in our go-forward businesses. Core earnings in P&C Commercial increased 67% from the prior year, reflecting lower catastrophe losses and the favorable impact of the pricing and underwriting actions launched last year, particularly in workers' compensation.
We saw adverse loss trends in the comp line early and immediately began taking action. Workers' compensation trends are generally performing as we expected, with only a slight adjustment this quarter.
Our actions are now yielding results, and we're optimistic that we've turned the corner. We're getting price increases in all lines with a 7% renewal price increase in standard commercial. In Middle Market, our renewal pricing was up 16% in workers' compensation, and we expect to continue to improve margins and product mix.
Retention remains strong for the accounts we want to keep, although down a bit in total as we shed more of our unprofitable accounts.
In Group Benefits, core earnings were up from first quarter. We had favorable Life and AD&D results, as well as a seasonal improvement in long-term disability trends. The Hartford was among the first to recognize adverse trends in incidence and terminations, which we addressed by taking pricing actions beginning in early 2011 and continuing through today. It will take more time and work to get this business back to historical profitability, but I'm encouraged with our progress.
In Consumer Markets, the quarter's financial results were adversely affected by heavy cat activity. We remain focused on profitable growth and improving both margins and ROEs. Retention continues to improve in both homeowners and auto, even as we continue to take rate in each. New business trends are also good, up 17% over the prior year.
We remain excited about the prospects for our Mutual Funds business and our expanded relationship with Wellington. During the quarter, we completed the transition of fixed income funds to Wellington, and our marketing initiatives will expand in the second half. We're confident that our Mutual Fund assets will grow, given Wellington's leading capabilities in managing both equities and fixed income. This is particularly important, given the continued flows out of equity and in the fixed income funds industry-wide.
We're on track for our targeted expense reductions, and as Chris will present in more detail, have increased our 2013 goals. In addition, in order to remain efficient in our go-forward businesses, we will eliminate all expenses for the Life businesses that are being sold.
Now let me review this quarter's progress and our strategy announced in March to focus on P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds. As you recall, these businesses satisfied all 3 of our requirements: first, that they have competitive market positions on which we could invest for future profitable growth; next, that they generate, not consume capital; and finally, that they will lead to lower market sensitivity for the company.
We also announced that we shut down our U.S. VA business and put it into runoff, and that we would sell the Individual Life, Retirement Plans and Woodbury Financial Services, our retail broker-dealer. Since that announcement, we've made solid progress in achieving our sharper focus strategy. 
First, the sales processes are proceeding as planned. On Tuesday, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell Woodbury Financial Services for proceeds totaling $115 million, subject to closing adjustments. The sales processes for the remaining Life businesses continue, and we look forward to updating you when definitive sales agreements have been reached.
Second, we have effectively shut down our U.S. variable annuities business. We signed a definitive agreement to sell the new VA business infrastructure, which we expect to close by year-end. The sale provides a smooth transition to more than 100 of our teammates in the U.S. Individual Annuity organization. We expect to reduce expenses by $100 million before tax in 2013 as a result.
Third, on the legacy annuity block, we announced the appointment of Beth Bombara as President of the Life runoff business. Beth has a deep knowledge of The Hartford and the annuity business and has a track record of significant accomplishments. She and her team will accelerate the good work already underway to reduce the size and risk of our legacy annuity liabilities, as well as initiatives that could isolate or separate them from the ongoing businesses and, over time, free up capital.
Given current economic conditions, this process will take time, but we will be prepared to take advantage of opportunities to reduce or sell blocks of business. We will balance economics and any possible consumption of statutory surplus against the potentially positive impact on shareholder value of reducing the block.
We are confident that we will achieve our goals. In the meantime, the VA hedging programs provide protection to policyholders and shareholders from adverse economic environments.
I know that there's a lot of interest in our plans for the use of the proceeds from the sales of the Life businesses. As we discussed in March, we will maintain capital sufficient for adverse economic environments and supportive of our go-forward businesses and their current ratings. We will work with all of our constituencies, including regulators and rating agencies, to develop a final plan that supports both our business and capital management goals.
Now, while our plans are not final, we expect to repay a minimum of $320 million of debt maturing in July 2013 in order to maintain leverage and interest coverage ratios at levels that support current ratings and also to pursue accretive actions for shareholders, which currently would be common stock repurchases or future potential transactions that would reduce the size and risk of the annuity book. We will update you in early 2013 as our plans and the business sales are finalized.
So to conclude, the second quarter was successful at The Hartford on many fronts. We had good core earnings and continued momentum in our go-forward businesses. We completed the $500 million stock buyback, repurchased the Allianz debt and made more progress on our expense initiatives. We announced an agreement to sell Woodbury Financial Services on Tuesday, and the sales processes of the Individual Life and Retirement Plans businesses are proceeding as planned. We are diligently exploring opportunities to reduce the size and risk of our annuity exposures, isolate or separate them from the ongoing businesses and, over time, free up associated capital.
We know we have a lot more work to do, but we are confident that we're on the right path. And I look forward to sharing our progress with you next quarter and beyond.
I'll now turn the microphone over to Chris, who will cover our financial results in more detail. Chris?"

Good morning, everyone. My comments this morning will cover 3 areas: a review of second quarter results; an update of our expense targets; and our third quarter current outlook.Second quarter core earnings were $119 million or $0.23 per",2035,"Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. My comments this morning will cover 3 areas: a review of second quarter results; an update of our expense targets; and our third quarter current outlook.
Second quarter core earnings were $119 million or $0.23 per diluted share, representing a significant improvement over prior year. These results include 4 items I want to highlight. First, catastrophe losses were $189 million after tax, which is $105 million higher than our original outlook. Second, we had unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of $32 million. Both of these items are in line with our July 16 announcement. Third, our results included unfavorable DAC unlock of $127 million, largely related to our quarterly adjustment for market performance on our runoff annuity block. Finally, we also incurred $31 million of restructuring charges, primarily for severance and retention associated with the sales of Individual Life, Retirement Plans and Woodbury Financial services, as well as the shutdown of U.S. VA new business.
Core earnings this quarter, excluding these 4 items, were $414 million or $0.85 per diluted share based on a 485 million share count. This is higher than May's outlook of $0.70 to $0.75 per share, primarily driven by better-than-anticipated group benefit results. In this low interest rate environment, we remain focused on pricing actions, as well as strategies to maintain investment yields. The investment portfolio yield was stable this quarter at 4.3%, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, which had a 10% annualized return in the quarter.
Consistent with last quarter, we modestly extended the duration of the portfolio and slightly increased our holdings in higher-yielding asset classes. Impairments and changes to the mortgage loan loss reserve rose this quarter to $60 million after tax and DAC, largely due to losses on some recently downgraded financial institution preferred equity securities. Overall, fundamental credit performance remained strong, with no material changes in default experience or expectations.
Turning to Slide 6. Second quarter book -- 2012 book value per diluted share was $45.59, an increase of 14% over last year. Book value benefited from declining interest rates, which increased the unrealized gains in our fixed investments. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share rose by 2% to $40.91. Book value growth over the last year was muted by higher catastrophes, as well as this quarter's $587 million charge for repaying the Allianz debt. This was a major step in restructuring the balance sheet and enhancing our financial flexibility. We also repurchased $106 million of common stock this quarter to complete our $500 million share repurchase plan. This is also reflected in our book value.
Turning to segment results. Slide 7 shows the summary results for P&C Commercial. Core earnings were $160 million, a 67% increase from the prior year due to better catastrophe results. Results also include a $12 million after tax of net unfavorable prior year loss reserve development across multiple lines. This included about $28 million after tax of adverse development on our workers' compensation book, largely for accident year 2011. The combined ratio, x cat, x prior year, was 94.5%, up slightly over prior year's 93.1%, which did not include the change in our 2011 accident year loss picks we made in the third and fourth quarter last year. We continue to expect the P&C Commercial combined ratio, x cats, x prior year, to improve based on achieved pricing and outlook for future rate increases.
As Liam mentioned, we continue to see strong price increases in P&C Commercial. We achieved renewal rate price increases of 7% in standard commercial equal to the first quarter. Workers' compensation is a key driver, with a 16% rate increase in Middle Market. Consistent with first quarter, all other commercial lines had rate increases as well, with 6% in Small Commercial, 8% in Middle Market property, 6% in Middle Market general liability.
Our pricing actions have impacted retention slightly. Middle Market retention was lower at 73% in the quarter, which is a top line trade-off we are making to improve margins. Small Commercial retention remained strong at 82%, slightly down from last year and last quarter. We will continue to be disciplined in our pricing initiatives, which are focused on achieving better margins on underperforming accounts, while maintaining margins and retention on our best performing accounts.
Shifting to Group Benefits. Core earnings of $34 million were a significant improvement well above first quarter levels and up $4 million from last year's quarter. The loss ratio was 78.6%, an improvement over the first quarter, which tends to be seasonally high but still up from the 78% in prior year. As a result of our rate actions and the very competitive marketplace, premiums declined 6%. This reflects the impact of pricing action on both new business and renewal trends occurring over the last 18 months.
We had favorable Life and AD&D experience, so I wouldn't annualize this quarter for the second half of the year. We still expect Group Benefit results this year to be flat, with the $86 million earned in 2011. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by our results in this line, and we are confident that our initiatives over the past 18 months will get us to where we need to be.
Turning to Slide 9. Consumer Markets had core losses of $48 million due to catastrophe losses above budget, although below last year's level. Andy Napoli and his team are managing the book for profitable growth by balancing pricing, retention, new business levels, and like the entire organization, expense efficiency. Retention has improved over the past several quarters and was up 2 points in both lines compared to a year ago.
Net written premiums declined 2%, partially due to lower than historic retention, which was partially offset by strong new business production. Auto new business was up 13% for the quarter and 21% year-to-date. AARP Agency is a strong growth source. First half 2012 written premiums in AARP Agency almost doubled to $59 million from the prior year period. The second quarter combined ratio, x cat, and prior year development was 91.3%, essentially flat with last year's 91.2%.
Homeowners, in particular, remains negatively impacted by elevated weather events. We remain focused on improving profitability with renewal, written price increases in the quarter of 6% in homeowners and 4% in auto. Auto physical damage loss severity remains a challenge, and we are watching frequency carefully. Auto liability frequency ticked up a little bit in the first quarter, but that trend did not continue in the second quarter. We are monitoring auto loss cost trends closely, and we'll adjust our pricing as necessary. But in general, we are comfortable with our current balance of pricing, retention and new business. Homeowners, on the other hand, needs more rate industry-wide, principally because of cats and non-cat weather.
We are encouraged by our results in Consumer Markets as we continue to focus on opportunities for profitable growth and improving margins and ROEs. 
Mutual fund results are summarized on Slide 10. All fixed income funds have now transitioned to Wellington, and expanded marketing initiatives are planned for the second half of the year. However, near-term earnings have been impacted by continued negative flows from equity funds and industry-wide trend.
Mutual fund core earnings this quarter were $18 million, down $9 million from prior year due to a 14% decline in assets under management compared to a year ago. Core earnings also included expenses for moving the business to Pennsylvania and expanding distribution teams.
The results of our combined Life and P&C runoff division are on Slide 11. Core earnings, x DAC unlock, were $148 million. This includes $162 million from Life and a loss of $14 million in P&C, which includes the asbestos environmental charge. Excluding the A&E charge and DAC unlock, core earnings were in line with our expectations.
I know there is interest in our annuity surrender experience since our March 21 announcement. Surrender activity for the U.S. block averaged an annualized rate of 17.5% for the quarter. The surrender rate increased to 20% in April immediately following the announcement but has since trended down to last year's level of 14% in July. Some of the decline is probably due to the decline in market levels as we normally see lower surrenders in down markets. These surrender rates include both full and partial surrenders, which are now disclosed separately in the IFS. 
Full surrenders for the second quarter were 13% annualized, up from 10% in the first quarter. Partial withdrawals were flat at 4.8%. While either type of activity helps reduce the size of the annuity liabilities, full surrenders completely eliminate the risk of those contracts. It's worth noting that this 2Q in-the-moneyness surrenders have been running about 35% of the total, roughly consistent with the overall in-the-moneyness of the U.S. VA GMWB block.
Slide 12 provides a summary of VA hedging results for the quarter. Our VA hedging programs primarily focus on economics. As you know, there are differences between GAAP, stat and economic results. During the quarter, the net statutory impact of our VA liabilities and hedges was a negative $228 million before tax, which excludes fees and other impacts to surplus. We ended the quarter with nearly $4 billion of VA statutory reserves in our U.S. and Japan subsidiaries.
Slide 13 is our surplus roll-forward. Total U.S. statutory surplus increased approximately $200 million in the second quarter. This is after $200 million of dividends from the P&C operations to the holding company. P&C had statutory operating earnings of about $100 million. VA statutory impacts were $100 million positive. Other items, primarily deferred taxes, were almost $200 million favorable.
In total, U.S. statutory Life surplus increased to $7.7 billion from $7.5 billion, while P&C surplus was essentially flat at $7.7 billion.
As you can see on Slide 14, capital resources remained strong at $18 million after -- excuse me, $18 billion after completing the share repurchase program and the Allianz refinancing. Holding company cash and short-term investments totaled $1.3 billion, down slightly from March due principally to the settlement of the warrant repurchase and the $106 million of share repurchases in the quarter.
Slide 15 set forth our updated expense target reductions. In December of last year, we laid out a $450 million expense reduction target for year-end 2013. We have increased that by a net $30 million to $480 million. This includes a $70 million reduction reflecting the portion of the original target that was attributable to the Life businesses being sold. It also reflects $100 million of expense reductions arising from the shutdown of U.S. VA business.
Additionally, in the quarter, we incurred about $31 million of after tax restructuring and other expenses associated with the sales process, including retention expenses and advisory fees. We expect to incur approximately $40 million after tax and additional restructuring charges related to these activities in the second half of 2012.
Before taking questions, I want to briefly provide you with our outlook for the third quarter. We expect third quarter core earnings to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.80 per diluted share, including catastrophe losses of approximately $75 million after tax. Our third quarter estimate does not include the following items: first, it does not include prior year P&C loss reserve development; second, the outlook does not reflect any DAC unlocks, including those related to our annual third quarter assumption study; finally, it does not include any expenses or charges relating to the sales processes for the Life businesses, and it excludes $25 million of restructuring and other expenses we expect to occur in the quarter.
To conclude, I am pleased with our business results this quarter and for the year-to-date. With the exception of catastrophes, our businesses this quarter performed largely in line with our expectations, with a slight positive from Group Benefits. Our investment results remained strong despite the challenging low interest rate environment.
Looking forward, we will continue to maintain our pricing discipline in the P&C businesses, and we expect our initiatives in Group Benefits and Mutual Funds to help improve profitability 2013 and beyond.
At this point, I'd like to turn the call back over to Sabra to begin the Q&A session."

That's probably at a level that relative to total premium, we're comfortable with a new business production at this point at about 12% to 13%. So then you shift the conversation to retention, we've had 2 points improvement in retention on a year-over-year basis. We've got a little bit more ground to make up there. I see growth to the division being flat in 2013. And as I think about the factors that could influence that, we're experiencing a rate need relative to -- or because of the increase in physical damage severity that I think is pervasive across the industry, and we'll have to sort of dynamically manage how we price that into our business going forward.

Before I get started, I want to welcome Brion Johnson, our recently appointed Chief Investment Officer. Prior to his appointment in May, Brion was Head of Strategy and Finance for our Investment Management subsidiary. 
This was a productive quarter at The Hartford. We generated good underlying financial results, marked by improved performance in our go-forward businesses. We successfully refinanced the Allianz debt and completed the $500 million equity repurchase program. We also made progress in executing our new strategy, particularly in the sales processes for the Life businesses, which are proceeding as expected.
Let me start with an overview of our quarterly financial results. Core earnings were $119 million or $0.23 per diluted share, including high catastrophe losses, although less than last year's; restructuring expenses; and an unfavorable DAC unlock. Adjusting for these items, core earnings were $0.85 per diluted share, ahead of our May outlook. 
Importantly, earnings were marked by favorable momentum in our go-forward businesses. Core earnings in P&C Commercial increased 67% from the prior year, reflecting lower catastrophe losses and the favorable impact of the pricing and underwriting actions launched last year, particularly in workers' compensation.
We saw adverse loss trends in the comp line early and immediately began taking action. Workers' compensation trends are generally performing as we expected, with only a slight adjustment this quarter.
Our actions are now yielding results, and we're optimistic that we've turned the corner. We're getting price increases in all lines with a 7% renewal price increase in standard commercial. In Middle Market, our renewal pricing was up 16% in workers' compensation, and we expect to continue to improve margins and product mix.
Retention remains strong for the accounts we want to keep, although down a bit in total as we shed more of our unprofitable accounts.
In Group Benefits, core earnings were up from first quarter. We had favorable Life and AD&D results, as well as a seasonal improvement in long-term disability trends. The Hartford was among the first to recognize adverse trends in incidence and terminations, which we addressed by taking pricing actions beginning in early 2011 and continuing through today. It will take more time and work to get this business back to historical profitability, but I'm encouraged with our progress.
In Consumer Markets, the quarter's financial results were adversely affected by heavy cat activity. We remain focused on profitable growth and improving both margins and ROEs. Retention continues to improve in both homeowners and auto, even as we continue to take rate in each. New business trends are also good, up 17% over the prior year.
We remain excited about the prospects for our Mutual Funds business and our expanded relationship with Wellington. During the quarter, we completed the transition of fixed income funds to Wellington, and our marketing initiatives will expand in the second half. We're confident that our Mutual Fund assets will grow, given Wellington's leading capabilities in managing both equities and fixed income. This is particularly important, given the continued flows out of equity and into fixed income funds industry-wide.
We're on track for our targeted expense reductions, and as Chris will present in more detail, have increased our 2013 goals. In addition, in order to remain efficient in our go-forward businesses, we will eliminate all expenses for the Life businesses that are being sold.
Now let me review this quarter's progress and our strategy announced in March, to focus on P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds. As you recall, these businesses satisfied all 3 of our requirements: first, that they have competitive market positions on which we could invest for future profitable growth; next, that they generate, not consume capital; and finally, that they will lead to lower market sensitivity for the company.
We also announced that we shut down our U.S. VA business and put it into runoff, and that we would sell the Individual Life, Retirement Plans and Woodbury Financial Services, our retail broker-dealer. Since that announcement, we've made solid progress in achieving our sharper focus strategy. 
First, the sales processes are proceeding as planned. On Tuesday, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell Woodbury Financial Services for proceeds totaling $115 million, subject to closing adjustments. The sales processes for the remaining Life businesses continue, and we look forward to updating you when definitive sales agreements have been reached.
Second, we have effectively shut down our U.S. variable annuities business. We signed a definitive agreement to sell the new VA business infrastructure, which we expect to close by year-end. The sale provides a smooth transition to more than 100 of our teammates in the U.S. Individual Annuity organization. We expect to reduce expenses by $100 million before tax in 2013 as a result.
Third, on the legacy annuity block, we announced the appointment of Beth Bombara as President of the Life runoff business. Beth has a deep knowledge of The Hartford and the annuity business and has a track record of significant accomplishments. She and her team will accelerate the good work already underway to reduce the size and risk of our legacy annuity liabilities, as well as initiatives that could isolate or separate them from the ongoing businesses and, over time, free up capital.
Given current economic conditions, this process will take time, but we will be prepared to take advantage of opportunities to reduce or sell blocks of business. We will balance economics and any possible consumption of statutory surplus against the potentially positive impact on shareholder value of reducing the block.
We are confident that we will achieve our goals. In the meantime, the VA hedging programs provide protection to policyholders and shareholders from adverse economic environments.
I know that there's a lot of interest in our plans for the use of the proceeds from the sales of the Life businesses. As we discussed in March, we will maintain capital sufficient for adverse economic environments and supportive of our go-forward businesses and their current ratings. We will work with all of our constituencies, including regulators and rating agencies, to develop a final plan that supports both our business and capital management goals.
Now, while our plans are not final, we expect to repay a minimum of $320 million of debt maturing in July 2013, in order to maintain leverage and interest coverage ratios at levels that support current ratings and also to pursue accretive actions for shareholders, which currently would be common stock repurchases or future potential transactions that would reduce the size and risk of the annuity book. We will update you in early 2013 as our plans and the business sales are finalized.
So to conclude, the second quarter was successful at The Hartford on many fronts. We had good core earnings and continued momentum in our go-forward businesses. We completed the $500 million stock buyback, repurchased the Allianz debt and made more progress on our expense initiatives. We announced an agreement to sell Woodbury Financial Services on Tuesday, and the sales processes of the Individual Life and Retirement Plans businesses are proceeding as planned. We are diligently exploring opportunities to reduce the size and risk of our annuity exposures, isolate or separate them from the ongoing businesses and, over time, free up associated capital.
We know we have a lot more work to do, but we are confident that we're on the right path. And I look forward to sharing our progress with you next quarter and beyond.
I'll now turn the microphone over to Chris, who will cover our financial results in more detail. Chris?"
341546,208386315,338205,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2012",2012-08-02,"Earnings Calls","The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. My comments this morning will cover 3 areas: a review of second quarter results; an update of our expense targets; and our third quarter current outlook.Second quarter core earnings were $119 million or $0.23 per",2036,"Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. My comments this morning will cover 3 areas: a review of second quarter results; an update of our expense targets; and our third quarter current outlook.
Second quarter core earnings were $119 million or $0.23 per diluted share, representing a significant improvement over prior year. These results include 4 items I want to highlight. First, catastrophe losses were $189 million after tax, which is $105 million higher than our original outlook. Second, we had unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of $32 million. Both of these items are in line with our July 16 announcement. Third, our results included unfavorable DAC unlock of $127 million, largely related to our quarterly adjustment for market performance on our runoff annuity block. Finally, we also incurred $31 million of restructuring charges, primarily for severance and retention associated with the sales of Individual Life, Retirement Plans and Woodbury Financial services, as well as the shutdown of U.S. VA new business.
Core earnings this quarter, excluding these 4 items, were $414 million or $0.85 per diluted share based on a 485 million share count. This is higher than May's outlook of $0.70 to $0.75 per share, primarily driven by better-than-anticipated group benefit results. In this low interest rate environment, we remain focused on pricing actions, as well as strategies to maintain investment yields. The investment portfolio yield was stable this quarter at 4.3%, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, which had a 10% annualized return in the quarter.
Consistent with last quarter, we modestly extended the duration of the portfolio and slightly increased our holdings in higher-yielding asset classes. Impairments and changes to the mortgage loan loss reserve rose this quarter to $60 million after tax and DAC, largely due to losses on some recently downgraded financial institution preferred equity securities. Overall, fundamental credit performance remained strong, with no material changes in default experience or expectations.
Turning to Slide 6. Second quarter book -- 2012 book value per diluted share was $45.59, an increase of 14% over last year. Book value benefited from declining interest rates, which increased the unrealized gains in our fixed investments. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share rose by 2% to $40.91. Book value growth over the last year was muted by higher catastrophes, as well as this quarter's $587 million charge for repaying the Allianz debt. This was a major step in restructuring the balance sheet and enhancing our financial flexibility. We also repurchased $106 million of common stock this quarter to complete our $500 million share repurchase plan. This is also reflected in our book value.
Turning to segment results. Slide 7 shows the summary results for P&C Commercial. Core earnings were $160 million, a 67% increase from the prior year due to better catastrophe results. Results also include a $12 million after tax of net unfavorable prior year loss reserve development across multiple lines. This included about $28 million after tax of adverse development on our workers' compensation book, largely for accident year 2011. The combined ratio, x cat, x prior year, was 94.5%, up slightly over prior year's 93.1%, which did not include the change in our 2011 accident year loss picks we made in the third and fourth quarter last year. We continue to expect the P&C Commercial combined ratio, x cats, x prior year, to improve based on achieved pricing and outlook for future rate increases.
As Liam mentioned, we continue to see strong price increases in P&C Commercial. We achieved renewal rate price increases of 7% in standard commercial equal to the first quarter. Workers' compensation is a key driver, with a 16% rate increase in Middle Market. Consistent with first quarter, all other commercial lines had rate increases as well, with 6% in Small Commercial, 8% in Middle Market property, 6% in Middle Market general liability.
Our pricing actions have impacted retention slightly. Middle Market retention was lower at 73% in the quarter, which is a top line trade-off we are making to improve margins. Small Commercial retention remained strong at 82%, slightly down from last year and last quarter. We will continue to be disciplined in our pricing initiatives, which are focused on achieving better margins on underperforming accounts, while maintaining margins and retention on our best performing accounts.
Shifting to Group Benefits. Core earnings of $34 million were a significant improvement, well above first quarter levels and up $4 million from last year's quarter. The loss ratio was 78.6%, an improvement over the first quarter, which tends to be seasonally high but still up from the 78% in prior year. As a result of our rate actions and the very competitive marketplace, premiums declined 6%. This reflects the impact of pricing action on both new business and renewal trends occurring over the last 18 months.
We had favorable Life and AD&D experience, so I wouldn't annualize this quarter for the second half of the year. We still expect Group Benefit results this year to be flat, with the $86 million earned in 2011. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by our results in this line, and we are confident that our initiatives over the past 18 months will get us to where we need to be.
Turning to Slide 9. Consumer Markets had core losses of $48 million due to catastrophe losses above budget, although below last year's level. Andy Napoli and his team are managing the book for profitable growth by balancing pricing, retention, new business levels, and like the entire organization, expense efficiency. Retention has improved over the past several quarters and was up 2 points in both lines compared to a year ago.
Net written premiums declined 2%, partially due to lower than historic retention, which was partially offset by strong new business production. Auto new business was up 13% for the quarter and 21% year-to-date. AARP Agency is a strong growth source. First half 2012 written premiums in AARP Agency almost doubled to $59 million from the prior year period. The second quarter combined ratio, x cat, and prior year development was 91.3%, essentially flat with last year's 91.2%.
Homeowners, in particular, remains negatively impacted by elevated weather events. We remain focused on improving profitability with renewal, written price increases in the quarter of 6% in homeowners and 4% in auto. Auto physical damage loss severity remains a challenge, and we are watching frequency carefully. Auto liability frequency ticked up a little bit in the first quarter, but that trend did not continue in the second quarter. We are monitoring auto loss cost trends closely, and we'll adjust our pricing as necessary. But in general, we are comfortable with our current balance of pricing, retention and new business. Homeowners, on the other hand, needs more rate industry-wide, principally because of cats and non-cat weather.
We are encouraged by our results in Consumer Markets as we continue to focus on opportunities for profitable growth and improving margins and ROEs. 
Mutual fund results are summarized on Slide 10. All fixed income funds have now transitioned to Wellington, and expanded marketing initiatives are planned for the second half of the year. However, near-term earnings have been impacted by continued negative flows from equity funds, an industry-wide trend.
Mutual fund core earnings this quarter were $18 million, down $9 million from prior year due to a 14% decline in assets under management compared to a year ago. Core earnings also included expenses for moving the business to Pennsylvania and expanding distribution teams.
The results of our combined Life and P&C runoff division are on Slide 11. Core earnings, x DAC unlock, were $148 million. This includes $162 million from Life and a loss of $14 million in P&C, which includes the asbestos environmental charge. Excluding the A&E charge and DAC unlock, core earnings were in line with our expectations.
I know there is interest in our annuity surrender experience since our March 21 announcement. Surrender activity for the U.S. block averaged an annualized rate of 17.5% for the quarter. The surrender rate increased to 20% in April immediately following the announcement but has since trended down to last year's level of 14% in July. Some of the decline is probably due to the decline in market levels, as we normally see lower surrenders in down markets. These surrender rates include both full and partial surrenders, which are now disclosed separately in the IFS. 
Full surrenders for the second quarter were 13% annualized, up from 10% in the first quarter. Partial withdrawals were flat at 4.8%. While either type of activity helps reduce the size of the annuity liabilities, full surrenders completely eliminate the risk of those contracts. It's worth noting that this 2Q in-the-moneyness surrenders have been running about 35% of the total, roughly consistent with the overall in-the-moneyness of the U.S. VA GMWB block.
Slide 12 provides a summary of VA hedging results for the quarter. Our VA hedging programs primarily focus on economics. As you know, there are differences between GAAP, stat and economic results. During the quarter, the net statutory impact of our VA liabilities and hedges was a negative $228 million before tax, which excludes fees and other impacts to surplus. We ended the quarter with nearly $4 billion of VA statutory reserves in our U.S. and Japan subsidiaries.
Slide 13 is our surplus roll-forward. Total U.S. statutory surplus increased approximately $200 million in the second quarter. This is after $200 million of dividends from the P&C operations to the holding company. P&C had statutory operating earnings of about $100 million. VA statutory impacts were $100 million positive. Other items, primarily deferred taxes, were almost $200 million favorable.
In total, U.S. statutory Life surplus increased to $7.7 billion from $7.5 billion, while P&C surplus was essentially flat at $7.7 billion.
As you can see on Slide 14, capital resources remained strong at $18 million after -- excuse me, $18 billion after completing the share repurchase program and the Allianz refinancing. Holding company cash and short-term investments totaled $1.3 billion, down slightly from March, due principally to the settlement of the warrant repurchase and the $106 million of share repurchases in the quarter.
Slide 15 set forth our updated expense target reductions. In December of last year, we laid out a $450 million expense reduction target for year-end 2013. We have increased that by a net $30 million to $480 million. This includes a $70 million reduction reflecting the portion of the original target that was attributable to the Life businesses being sold. It also reflects $100 million of expense reductions arising from the shutdown of U.S. VA business.
Additionally, in the quarter, we incurred about $31 million of after tax restructuring and other expenses associated with the sales process, including retention expenses and advisory fees. We expect to incur approximately $40 million after tax in additional restructuring charges related to these activities in the second half of 2012.
Before taking questions, I want to briefly provide you with our outlook for the third quarter. We expect third quarter core earnings to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.80 per diluted share, including catastrophe losses of approximately $75 million after tax. Our third quarter estimate does not include the following items: first, it does not include prior year P&C loss reserve development; second, the outlook does not reflect any DAC unlocks, including those related to our annual third quarter assumption study; finally, it does not include any expenses or charges relating to the sales processes for the Life businesses, and it excludes $25 million of restructuring and other expenses we expect to occur in the quarter.
To conclude, I am pleased with our business results this quarter and for the year-to-date. With the exception of catastrophes, our businesses this quarter performed largely in line with our expectations, with a slight positive from Group Benefits. Our investment results remained strong despite the challenging low interest rate environment.
Looking forward, we will continue to maintain our pricing discipline in the P&C businesses, and we expect our initiatives in Group Benefits and Mutual Funds to help improve profitability in 2013 and beyond.
At this point, I'd like to turn the call back over to Sabra to begin the Q&A session."

Before I begin, on behalf of all of us at The Hartford, our thoughts and prayers off those have been affected by Storm Sandy. On a personal note, we at The Hartford hope that each of you and your family are faring well during these very challenging times, because clearly, this was a devastating storm with a large footprint and tropical force winds that impacted a highly populated area.
At The Hartford, our catastrophe team has been on the ground working 24/7 to help our policy holders, and I want to express my deep appreciation to claims teammates and other in the field. In addition, we are also very thankful to the emergency personnel's and volunteers who are providing basic needs and critical services.
I know you are all interested in loss estimates but it's much too early for us provide data with any level of certainty. We are still waiting for clearance from local authorities to access some areas. Yesterday, for example, was the first day we were able to get adjustors into Long Island.
Now clearly, this is a significant event for those who suffered losses. But Storm Sandy is well within the planning scenarios we used to manage catastrophe risks at The Hartford. This is a major storm but it is a manageable exposure for The Hartford. As we have more certainty around The Hartford's losses, we will provide you with details.
Now let's cover third quarter results and activities. 
I am pleased with The Hartford's third quarter achievements. First, we announced the sale of the 3 Wealth Management businesses we committed to sell last March, ahead of our year end target. The businesses are going to strong, strategic buyers. And the sales are expected to generate about $2.2 billion of statutory capital benefit for The Hartford. Second, The Hartford generated strong overall financial results in the third quarter, with core earnings of $378 million, significantly better than the $50 million last year. Net income was also up strongly, rising from $60 million to $401 million.
Third, the The Hartford's go forward business has demonstrated increasing earnings momentum, benefiting from strong pricing trends, along with improved retention in Property & Casualty commercial and new business growth in Consumer Markets. Each also showed improved net flows.
Core earnings from the 3 go forward segments totaled $294 million this quarter compared with $121 million last year. Now while much of that improvement was due to last year's high catastrophe losses, combined ratios and excluding caps and prior development improved in both Property & Casualty commercial and consumer markets as did the loss ratio in group benefits.
In Property & Casualty commercial, we continued to generate sustained written price increases, with an 8% increase in standard commercial lines this quarter, up from 7% for the first half of 2012. Our focus on pricing discipline will continue in the fourth quarter and into 2013.
Doug and his team are doing an excellent job balancing margin expansion with attention in pricing. Our primary goal particularly in Middle Market is to drive to acceptable levels of profitability. So there will continue to be a dampening effect on the top line as less profitable accounts moved to other carriers.
We are pursuing similar tactics in Group Benefits. The Hartford was among the first to recognize and respond to the adverse incidents and termination trends. However, given the 3-year contract terms in this line, it takes longer for the results of pricing actions to fall to the bottom line.
In the third quarter, core earnings trends benefited slightly from an improvement in termination rates although they do remain lower than historical levels. Improving terminations, combined with our pricing initiatives, should slowly expand margins.
In Consumer Markets, Andy and his team are focused on maintaining margins in auto, expanding margins in homeowners, continuing new business growth and improving retention. We recently enhanced the pricing segmentation in our Open Road Advantage auto product, which has helped lift conversion rates. New business production is up and we feel good about the mix of business.
Homeowners continues to need great and we have been diligent in pursuing it. Efforts to improve retention are yielding positive results with continuing quarterly improvements in auto and home.
The Mutual Funds business also made good progress during the quarter as its balanced and fixed-income funds posted more favorable net flows. Overall flows remain negative due to continuing industrywide withdrawals from domestic equity funds. However, the company's third quarter flows were the best we've seen since the first quarter of 2011.
Several funds generated particularly strong performance in the quarter. For instance, the balance income fund had top quartile liftoff performance both for the quarter and year-to-date, and was one of our top funds in gross sales at $385 million for the quarter.
In addition, our world bond fund was recently recognized as a newcomer of the year by the Wall Street Journal.
In the run-up division, third quarter financial results were in line with our expectations, with core earnings at stock and lock declining 6% from the prior year, reflecting lower earnings from U.S. annuity.
Beth Bombara and her team had been examining a range of options to address the legacy annuity blocks. One area of focus is on contract holder initiatives such as the enhanced surrender value options offer that we filed earlier this week with the SEC.
This option will be offered to contract holders who represent about 15% of our U.S. GMWB book in terms of account value, but more importantly, nearly 45% of the U.S. GMWB net amount at risk. Similar to programs introduced by several other companies, it offers the contract holder the option to surrender the policy at a premium to the current account value.
We continue to aggressively examine other options to accelerate the runoff of the U.S. and international annuities, and look forward to aiding you on our progress.
With any actions we take, we will continue to honor our obligations to contract holders.
Finally, I am pleased that we reached definitive sales agreements for Individual Life, Retirement Plans and Woodbury Financial Services this quarter, ahead of our year-end target. We are selling these businesses at good values, that will generate an estimated net statutory capital benefit of approximately $2.2 billion.
Furthermore, they are being sold to market-leading strategic buyers who saw a value in our innovative products, strong distribution and employee expertise.
We expect to close the Woodbury transaction by year-end and Individual Life in the first quarter of 2013. We are working to close Retirement Plans by year-end, but it may slip a little into the new year as we work through the necessary regulatory approvals.
Chris will discuss the company's expense initiatives. 
The bottom line, however, is that we will reduce about $850 million in expense. The vast majority of which relates to the elimination of all expenses of the divested businesses. Moreover, approximately 90% of the expenses will be eliminated by the end of 2013.
With the sales announced, I know investors are interested in our capital management plans. We are developing holistic capital management plans, which we will discuss with regulators and rating agencies, and which we will share with you in early 2013 after the transactions are closed.
Our goal in managing capital is to pursue accretive actions for shareholders, while both maintaining a balance sheet sufficient for adverse economic environments and the current ratings of our go forward businesses, and preserving financial flexibility to be opportunistic in taking future actions to address the company's legacy annuity liabilities. 
Therefore, we expect that our capital management plans will include:, debt repayments to reduce leverage and improve our interest coverage ratios over time; share repurchases, which at current prices are very accretive; and retaining some capital to take future actions for permanent solutions to reduce the size and risk of the legacy annuity liabilities, which should create significant shareholder value.
To conclude, The Hartford had a successful third quarter. We reached agreements in all 3 of the planned sales ahead of schedule at attractive prices, and with strong buyers who value the skills and expertise of our teammates.
We have a strong core earnings. We demonstrated pricing and margin momentum in our go forward businesses. And our Life runoff team is considering actions to accelerate the runoff of the legacy annuity block, including the recent filing of the enhanced surrender value program offer.
The Hartford is becoming a more focused company that has the potential to create greater shareholder value, while providing policyholders with the protection and service that they depend on. I am confident that we are on the right path, and I look forward to communicating our continued progress.
I'll now turn the call over to Chris who will cover the our financial results in more detail. Chris?"

This morning, I'm going to focus on 3 topics. First, I'll cover key aspects of this quarter's financial results. Second, I will provide an update on our expense initiatives, including the efforts to remove all the direct and indirect expenses on the businesses we are selling. And third, I'll provide an outlook for fourth quarter and full year 2012 results.
I'll begin on Slide 5.
Third quarter 2012 core earnings were $378 million or $0.78 per diluted share. These results were in line with our outlook of $0.75 to $0.80. On a run rate basis, core earnings were $0.77 per share, which excludes the items summarized on Slide 5, which totaled $0.01 per share. These items included a modest charge for reestimating current accident year prior quarter loss reserves for workers compensation and commercial auto of approximately $0.05 per share. Restructuring expenses totaled $34 million after tax or about $0.07 per share, slightly above our August estimate.
Turning to Slide 6.
The Hartford's book value per diluted share rose 10% over the past year to $48.13, including a $2 billion increase in net after-tax unrealized gains on fixed maturity investments as a result of continued low interest rates and tighter credit spreads over the last year. It also includes the approximately $900 million or $1.83 per share reduction in shareholder's equity due to the Allianz debt refinancing and warrant share repurchase in the first half of 2012.
Book value excluding AOCI was $41.35 per diluted share, flat with prior year, as net income over the past year was largely offset by the impact of the Allianz transactions.
For the last 12 months, our core earnings ROE was 7.2%, up from 6% for the 12 months ended September 30, 2011.
Slide 7 has a high level summary of P&C commercial results.
Core earnings were $160 million, up 84% from prior year. Catastrophe losses came in at $7 million after tax compared with $60 million last year. In addition, the increase in core earnings reflects improved margins in Middle Market.
The third quarter 2012 combined ratio x DAC x prior year was 97.5, down from 99.4 the prior year. Favorable expenses and better experience in property lines were partially offset by a deterioration in commercial auto liability results.
Third quarter 2012 included $39 million of current accident year prior quarter loss reestimation or 2.5 points on the loss ratio. This compares to $47 million or 3 points on the loss ratio last year.
This year's changes were due to higher severity in commercial auto, particularly in small commercial and a slight adjustment for lost time workers compensation claims.
Even with this change, the 2012 Worker's Comp accident year loss ratio is approximately 4 points better than 2011 accident year. This reflects the pricing and underwriting actions we have taken over the last 12 to 18 months. Our pricing and underwriting discipline in P&C Commercial has resulted in pricing increases across the portfolio and we remain committed to driving actions necessary to improve margins in the fourth quarter and beyond.
Middle Market workers compensation is a key contributor to our achieved pricing increases, with rate increases averaging 15% this quarter, consistent with the rate achieved in the second quarter.
In Middle Market property, rates increased 10% compared with 8% in the first half.
Our team is proactively managing renewal rate increases, account retention and new business growth to optimize overall profitability. While aggregate rate increases may level off, our focus on margin improvement will continue.
Group Benefits results are summarized on Slide 8. 
Although below historic levels, we are pleased with the trends we're seeing in the segment. Core earnings were $23 million, up 15% due to improved loss trends. The loss ratio was 79.3, an improvement over prior year's 80.1, and reflected better LTD results, offset by less favorable mortality in group Life this quarter.
As a result of our sustained pricing actions over the past 2 years, Group Benefits premiums declined 7% year-over-year. We expect this trend will continue into 2013 due to the impact of our renewal pricing strategies on persistency. Year-to-date, persistencies averaged 62%.
Turning to Consumer Markets on Slide 9.
Core earnings were $93 million, a turnaround from core losses of $10 million in the third quarter of 2011, which had a significant level of catastrophes. This quarter had no net catastrophe losses as the $16 million of after-tax losses from the third quarter events, including hurricane Eisenach, were offset by favorable development on catastrophes from the first half of 2012.
We continued to be pleased with the progress DiNapoli and his team are making, balancing profitability and growth. Consumer Markets underwriting margins, excluding catastrophes, have expanded as we take rate increases. The third quarter combined ratio excluding and prior-year development was 93.3, down more than 2 points from 95.5 last year, arguably because of improved homeowners results.
Auto results were comparable to the prior year.
We remain focused on achieving rate increases consistent with the loss cost trends. Lost cause continued to be slightly higher in auto due to physical damage severity, although it moderated from the first half of 2012. The increase in physical damage severity was largely offset by favorable trends on auto liability frequency this quarter.
We achieved written rate increases of 6% in homeowners and 4% in auto this quarter.
On the growth side, new business premiums are up 9% this quarter and 18% year-to-date. AARP Agency is a strong growth source. In the first 9 months of 2012, written premiums in AARP Agency were $96 million, almost double that of the prior-year period.
Retention has also improved, up 2 points in auto and 3 points in homeowners compared to a year ago.
Mutual Fund results are summarized on Slide 10.
Core earnings were $18 million, down from the prior year but flat with the second quarter of 2012. The principal reason for the decline was lower fees, reflecting lower average assets under management and higher distribution in marketing expenses as we execute our strategy with Wellington.
Net flow performance has significantly improved from the past several quarters as a result of stronger deposits into our fixed income and balanced fund choices. We are optimistic about the prospects for this business as we work with Wellington to expand marketing for The Hartford funds.
The results of our combined Life and P&C runoff division are on Slide 11.
Core earnings X DAC unlock were $168 million, compared to $147 million from Life Other Operations and $21 million from P&C. The DAC unlock included in core earnings for the quarter totaled a charge of $11 million compared with the $126 million charge in the third quarter of 2011. For the quarter, surrenders averaged 14.7% on the U.S. variable annuity book and 3.6% for Japan VA, slightly higher than historical levels, but lower than the 17.5% and about the 4.5%, respectively, we saw in the second quarter.
We recently filed for approval with the SEC in enhanced surrender value option, which Liam discussed. This represents our first of initiatives to provide contract holders with additional choices for their contract that also meet our objectives of reducing risks with reasonable economics.
Turning to the impact of the VA book in capital resources. Slide 12 provides a summary of VA hedging results for the quarter.
During the quarter, the net statutory impact of our VA liabilities and hedges was a negative $4 million before tax, excluding fees earned in the quarter and other impacts to surplus. It has been about a year since we've completed the build out of our Japan hedging program. The goal of all our hedging programs is to manage our economic exposure, which is our continued focus, in which is performing as we expect in these market conditions.
We have retained some market risks. Although throughout 2012, we have increased interest rate protection. You can find our updated sensitivities in our 10-Q.
Slide 13 is a new slide that combines our statutory surplus roll forward with our total capital resources.
Total U.S. statutory surplus before dividend as a holding company increased by approximately $100 million from June 30, reflecting $215 million of increased P&C surplus and that was offset by a slight decrease in U.S. Life surplus.
After $200 million of dividends from the P&C company to the holding company, surplus was essentially flat.
Year-to-date, life statutory surplus is up about $150 million. We performed our annual cash flow testing at the end of the year, which will impact full year results, given sustained low interest rates and tighter credit spreads. Consistent with our prior outlook, we continue to expect U.S. Life statutory surplus to be flat or slightly down for the full year.
Our capital resources, which include U.S. statutory surplus, as well as the $1.3 billion in Japan capital, were equal to the $18 billion we had at the end of June 30. Holding Company cash and short-term investments totaled $1.4 billion.
Looking forward, the 3 sales transactions are expected to increase our statutory surplus by approximately $1.4 billion, for a total net statutory capital benefit of about $2.2 billion based on current estimates.
As Liam mentioned, we are working on our capital plans and we look forward to sharing them with you in early 2013.
Turning to the second item on my agenda, Slide 14 sets forth our updated expense initiatives.
As Liam mentioned, we expect to reduce expenses by approximately $850 million before tax, most of which will be completed in 2013.
Slide 14 breaks out the components of the expense reductions. 
In addition to our prior efficiency commitments, we will reduce expenses by another $100 million related to putting U.S. VA into runoff and $615 million related to the 3 businesses being sold.
We have detailed plans for execution and have begun reducing expense levels in 2012, which will continue into 2013.
As a result of these initiatives, we expect to incur restructuring charge of approximately $45 million to $50 million after tax in the fourth quarter. This charge will accrue for all planned 2013 severance costs or approximately 500 positions affected over the course of 2013, as well as other fourth quarter items such as retention payments.
At year-end, we will have expensed about 85% of ultimate restructuring costs we anticipate.
In 2013, we currently expect to have approximately $30 million after tax of additional restructuring and other expenses.
Bottom line, we have significant expense reduction goals and have a high degree of confidence in our ability to achieve them.
Finally, the last item before we take some questions is to look at our year-to-date results and our fourth quarter outlook. 
As summarized on Slide 15, our core earnings excluding DAC unlock, prior-year developments, cats above budget and restructuring charges for the first 9 months of the year totaled $1.2 billion or $2.40 per diluted share.
Our current fourth quarter outlook projects core earnings of approximately $375 million to $400 million or $0.77 to $0.82 per diluted share based on an estimated diluted share count of approximately 486 million shares.
This outlook does not include any estimate of DAC unlock or prior-year loss development, and it's also before previously mentioned restructuring charge, which approximates $0.10 per diluted share.
This outlook includes a budgeted cap load of approximately $68 million before tax. This cap load does not include an estimate of expected losses from Sandy. Our plan is to update you on the impact of this major storm event when we have good estimates.
Combined with year-to-date results, our current 2012 outlook, excluding the DAC unlock, prior-year development and other items listed on Slide 15, totals approximately $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion for the year, slightly less than our December '11 outlook of $1.6 million to $1.7 billion.
We are pleased with this result, given the challenging microeconomic environment, as well as the significant strategic actions we take this year, which were not anticipated in our December outlook.
We are currently working on the 2013 plan, which we expect to share with you in February on our fourth quarter 2012 earnings call.
To conclude, I am pleased with both our business results and our strategic accomplishments this quarter and this year. Despite the weak economy and low interest rates, our business has performed largely in line with our expectation. Our capital resources remains strong and stable, and our hedging programs continues to protect us against adverse economic and market conditions.
At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Sabra to begin our Q&A session."

But as we've said before generally, at the 14 50 S&P level, we start to feel very good about the performance of the VA block going forward. You could see it, and can call it than that amount of risk coming down this quarter. So we're at that inflection point where if markets can continue to improve, and it won't happen overnight, Mark, where we generate a lot of statutory surplus off the VA block, but over time, with steady market performance, it is very positive for us. I would have to point out that offsetting that is really the continued low-interest rate environment. So as much as equity markets are a positive around the world, low-interest rates in the U.S., Europe and in Japan are still a significant headwind for our statutory surplus creation on the life side."

So as far as targeting certain policyholders, against, it's open to all. When we think about the benefit that we might see, currently, this book we see about a 5% loss rate. When I look at what might be reasonable expectations as to what we might see for sort of an increase in the take rate, I think to the extent that that doubles or triples, I think that's a reasonable expectations, because we would never think that this choice will be right for all policyholders that have this benefit.

Number one, on the prior accident year, when we look at $18 million against the base of $6 billion, I look at that, Brian, really as tuning. We did do some minor strengthening to the accident years '11, '10, and '09, and we had some releases 5, 4 and 3. But $18 million and $6 billion really given what we have gone through the last 5 quarters, I feel very good about our position and we will continue to monitor aggressively and there might not be a little bumps on the road but we were in a completely different spot than we were 5 quarters ago. When I think about the current year, a little bit -- 2 stories. One is 2/3 of our comp actions in the year were in Small Commercial and you step back and think about Small Commercial, I returned a combined ratios are smaller, are really, really outstanding and I think they will stack up with pretty much anybody in the industry. We saw a little bit of medical severity in the quarter, and a little bit of larger cases. So nothing major, but enough so that we made some minor modifications to our current accident year pick and comp in small, it's the first time we had do that in several years but we are watching and see very careful again albeit you see the combined ratio and saw very solid returns and in line with outstanding rate adequacy across Small Commercial. Different story in middle. We've talked aggressively about the rate actions we were taking in our Middle Market booked the last 5, 6 quarters, we feel good about those rate actions, they do not stop into the third quarter '12, we continued to march on, and as Liam mentioned we are marching on into quarter 4. So we are out beyond their tents in both the frequency and severity standpoint so we in now improving margins. The prior actions had a little bit of middle to them, but as I look at the current accident year, there isn't anything that concerns me that and I feel good about the actions are taking in the marketplace and reflected in the balance sheet. So maybe some bumps along the way in a few bumps in the quarter but really very, very steady progress and our behavior in the marketplace both from a new business perspective and a rate retention I think it's a completely different spot than where were third quarter 2011."

Before I begin, on behalf of all of us at The Hartford, our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by Storm Sandy. On a personal note, we at The Hartford hope that each of you and your family are faring well during these very challenging times because, clearly, this was a devastating storm with a large footprint and tropical force winds that impacted a highly populated area. At The Hartford, our catastrophe team has been on the ground working 24/7 to help our policy holders, and I want to express my deep appreciation to our claims teammates and others in the field. In addition, we are also very thankful for the emergency personnel and volunteers who are providing basic needs and critical services.
I know you are all interested in loss estimates, but it's much too early for us to provide data with any level of certainty. We're still waiting for clearance from local authorities to access some areas. Yesterday, for example, was the first day we were able to get adjusters into Long Island. Now clearly, this is a significant event for those who suffered losses. But Storm Sandy is well within the planning scenarios we used to manage catastrophe risk at The Hartford. This is a major storm, but it is a manageable exposure for The Hartford. As we have more certainty around The Hartford's losses, we will provide you with details.
Now let's cover third quarter results and activities. I am pleased with The Hartford's third quarter achievements. First, we announced the sale of the 3 Wealth Management businesses we committed to sell last March, ahead of our year-end target. The businesses are going to strong, strategic buyers. And the sales are expected to generate about $2.2 billion of statutory capital benefit for The Hartford. Second, The Hartford generated strong overall financial results in the third quarter, with core earnings of $378 million, significantly better than the $50 million last year. Net income was also up strongly, rising from $60 million to $401 million. Third, The Hartford's go-forward businesses demonstrated increasing earnings momentum, benefiting from strong pricing trends, along with improved retention in Property & Casualty Commercial and new business growth in Consumer Markets. Mutual Funds also showed improved net flows. Core earnings from the 3 go-forward segments totaled $294 million this quarter compared with $121 million last year. 
Now while much of that improvement was due to last year's high catastrophe losses, combined ratios, and excluding caps in prior development, improved in both Property & Casualty Commercial and Consumer Markets, as did the loss ratio in Group Benefits.
In Property & Casualty Commercial, we continued to generate sustained written price increases, with an 8% increase in standard commercial lines this quarter, up from 7% for the first half of 2012. Our focus on pricing discipline will continue in the fourth quarter and into 2013. Doug and his team are doing an excellent job balancing margin expansion with retention and pricing. Our primary goal, particularly in Middle Market, is to drive to acceptable levels of profitability. So there will continue to be a dampening effect on the top line as less profitable accounts move to other carriers.
We are pursuing similar tactics in Group Benefits. The Hartford was among the first to recognize and respond to the adverse incidents and termination trends. However, given the 3-year contract terms in this line, it takes longer for the results of pricing actions to fall to the bottom line. In the third quarter, core earnings trends benefited slightly from an improvement in termination rates, although they do remain lower than historical levels. Improving terminations, combined with our pricing initiatives, should slowly expand margins.
In Consumer Markets, Andy and his team are focused on maintaining margins in auto, expanding margins in homeowners, continuing new business growth and improving retention. We recently enhanced the pricing segmentation in our Open Road Advantage auto product, which has helped lift conversion rates. New business production is up, and we feel good about the mix of business. Homeowners continues to knead rate, and we have been diligent in pursuing it. Efforts to improve retention are yielding positive results, with continuing quarterly improvements in auto and home.
The Mutual Funds business also made good progress during the quarter, as its balanced and fixed-income funds posted more favorable net flows. Overall flows remain negative due to continuing industry-wide withdrawals from domestic equity funds. However, the company's third quarter flows were the best we've seen since the first quarter of 2011. Several funds generated particularly strong performance in the quarter. For instance, the balanced income fund had top quartile Lipper performance, both for the quarter and year-to-date, and was one of our top funds in gross sales at $385 million for the quarter. In addition, our world bond fund was recently recognized as a newcomer of the year by the Wall Street Journal.
In our Runoff division, third quarter financial results were in line with our expectations, with core earnings x DAC unlock declining 6% from the prior year, reflecting lower earnings from U.S. annuity. Beth Bombara and her team have been examining a range of options to address the legacy annuity blocks. One area of focus is on contract holder initiatives, such as the enhanced surrender value option offer that we filed earlier this week with the SEC. This option will be offered to contract holders who represent about 15% of our U.S. GMWB book in terms of account value but more importantly, nearly 45% of the U.S. GMWB net amount at risk. Similar to programs introduced by several other companies, it offers the contract holder the option to surrender the policy at a premium to the current account value. We continue to aggressively examine other options to accelerate the runoff of the U.S. and international annuities and look forward to updating you on our progress. With any actions we take, we will continue to honor our obligations to contract holders.
Finally, I'm pleased that we reached definitive sales agreements for Individual Life, Retirement Plans and Woodbury Financial Services this quarter, ahead of our year-end target. We're selling these businesses at good values that will generate an estimated net statutory capital benefit of approximately $2.2 billion. Furthermore, they are being sold to market-leading strategic buyers who saw value in our innovative products, strong distribution and employee expertise. We expect to close the Woodbury transaction by year-end and Individual Life in the first quarter of 2013. We're working to close Retirement Plans by year-end, but it may slip a little into the new year as we work through the necessary regulatory approvals. 
Chris will discuss the company's expense initiatives. The bottom line, however, is that we will reduce about $850 million in expense. The vast majority of which relates to the elimination of all expenses of the divested businesses. Moreover, approximately 90% of the expenses will be eliminated by the end of 2013.
With the sales announced, I know investors are interested in our capital management plans. We are developing holistic capital management plans, which we will discuss with regulators and rating agencies and which we will share with you in early 2013, after the transactions are closed. Our goal in managing capital is to pursue accretive actions for shareholders while both maintaining a balance sheet sufficient for adverse economic environments and the current ratings of our go-forward businesses and preserving financial flexibility to be opportunistic in taking future actions to address the company's legacy annuity liabilities. Therefore, we expect that our capital management plans will include: debt repayment to reduce leverage and improve our interest coverage ratios over time; share repurchases, which at current prices are very accretive; and retaining some capital to take future actions for permanent solutions to reduce the size and risk of the legacy annuity liabilities, which should create significant shareholder value.
To conclude, The Hartford had a successful third quarter. We reached agreements in all 3 of the planned sales ahead of schedule at attractive prices and with strong buyers who value the skills and expertise of our teammates. We have strong core earnings. We demonstrated pricing and margin momentum in our go-forward businesses. And our Life Runoff team is considering options to accelerate the runoff of the legacy annuity blocks, including the recent filing of the enhanced surrender value program offer.
The Hartford is becoming a more focused company that has the potential to create greater shareholder value while providing policyholders with the protection and service that they depend on. I am confident that we are on the right path, and I look forward to communicating our continued progress.
I'll now turn the call over to Chris, who'll cover our financial results in more detail. Chris?"

Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'm going to focus on 3 topics: first, I'll cover key aspects of this quarter's financial results; second, I will provide an update on our expense initiatives, including the efforts to remove all the direct and indirect expenses on the businesses we are selling; and third, I'll provide an outlook for fourth quarter and full year 2012 results.
I'll begin on Slide 5. Third quarter 2012 core earnings were $378 million or $0.78 per diluted share. These results were in line with our outlook of $0.75 to $0.80. On a run rate basis, core earnings were $0.77 per share, which excludes the items summarized on Slide 5, which totaled $0.01 per share. These items included a modest charge for reestimating current accident year prior quarter loss reserves for workers' compensation in commercial auto of approximately $0.05 per share. Restructuring expenses totaled $34 million after-tax or about $0.07 per share, slightly above our August estimate.
Turning to Slide 6. The Hartford's book value per diluted share rose 10% over the past year to $48.13, including a $2 billion increase in net after-tax unrealized gains on fixed maturity investments as a result of continued low interest rates and tighter credit spreads over the last year. It also includes the approximately $900 million or $1.83 per share reduction in shareholders' equity due to the Allianz debt refinancing and warrant share repurchase in the first half of 2012. Book value, excluding AOCI, was $41.35 per diluted share, flat with prior year, as net income over the past year was largely offset by the impact of the Allianz transactions. For the last 12 months, our core earnings ROE was 7.2%, up from 6% for the 12 months ended September 30, 2011.
Slide 7 has a high-level summary of P&C Commercial results. Core earnings were $160 million, up 84% from prior year. Catastrophe losses came in at $7 million after-tax compared with $60 million last year. In addition, the increase in core earnings reflects improved margins in Middle Market. The third quarter 2012 combined ratio, x cat, x prior year, was 97.5&, down from 99.4% in prior year. Favorable expenses and better experience in property lines were partially offset by a deterioration in commercial auto liability results.
Third quarter 2012 included $39 million of current accident year prior quarter loss reestimation or 2.5 points on the loss ratio. This compares to $47 million or 3 points on the loss ratio last year. This year's changes were due to higher severity in commercial auto, particularly in small commercial, and a slight adjustment for lost time workers' compensation claims. Even with this change, the 2012 workers' comp accident year loss ratio is approximately 4 points better than 2011 accident year. This reflects the pricing and underwriting actions we have taken over the last 12 to 18 months. Our pricing and underwriting discipline in P&C Commercial has resulted in pricing increases across the portfolio, and we remain committed to driving actions necessary to improve margins in the fourth quarter and beyond.
Middle Market workers' compensation is a key contributor to our achieved pricing increases, with rate increases averaging 15% this quarter, consistent with the rate achieved in the second quarter. In Middle Market property, rates increased 10% compared with 8% in the first half. Our team is proactively managing renewal rate increases, account retention and new business growth to optimize overall profitability. While aggregate rate increases may have leveled off, our focus on margin improvement will continue.
Group Benefits results are summarized on Slide 8. 
Although below historic levels, we're pleased with the trends we're seeing in the segment. Core earnings were $23 million, up 15% due to improved loss trends. The loss ratio was 79.3%, an improvement over prior year's 80.1% and reflected better LTD results, offset by less favorable mortality in Group Life this quarter. As a result of our sustained pricing actions over the past 2 years, Group Benefits premiums declined 7% year-over-year. We expect this trend will continue into 2013 due to the impact of our renewal pricing strategies on persistency. Year-to-date, persistencies averaged 62%.
Turning to Consumer Markets on Slide 9. Core earnings were $93 million, a turnaround from core losses of $10 million in the third quarter of 2011, which had a significant level of catastrophes. This quarter had no net catastrophe losses as the $16 million of after-tax losses from the third quarter events, including Hurricane Isaac, were offset by favorable development on catastrophes from the first half of 2012. We continue to be pleased with the progress that Andy Napoli and his team are making, balancing profitability and growth. Consumer Markets underwriting margins, excluding catastrophes, have expanded as we take rate increases. 
The third quarter combined ratio, excluding cats and prior year development, was 93.3%, down more than 2 points from 95.5% last year, are duly because of improved homeowner results. Auto results were comparable to the prior year. We remain focused on achieving rate increases consistent with the loss cost trends. Loss costs continue to be slightly higher in auto due to physical damage severity, although it moderated from the first half of 2012. The increase in physical damage severity was largely offset by favorable trends on auto liability frequency this quarter. We achieved written rate increases of 6% in homeowners and 4% in auto this quarter.
On the growth side, new business premiums are up 9% this quarter and 18% year-to-date. AARP Agency is a strong growth source. In the first 9 months of 2012, written premiums in AARP Agency were $96 million, almost double that of the prior year period. Retention has also improved, up 2 points in auto and 3 points in homeowners compared to a year ago.
Mutual Fund results are summarized on Slide 10. Core earnings were $18 million, down from the prior year but flat with the second quarter of 2012. The principal reason for the decline was lower fees, reflecting lower average assets under management and higher distribution in marketing expenses as we execute our strategy with Wellington. Net flow performance has significantly improved from the past several quarters as a result of stronger deposits into our fixed income and balanced fund choices. We are optimistic about the prospects for this business as we work with Wellington to expand marketing for The Hartford funds.
The results of our combined Life and P&C Runoff division are on Slide 11. Core earnings x DAC unlock were $168 million, comprised of $147 million from Life Other Operations and $21 million from P&C. The DAC unlock included in core earnings for the quarter totaled a charge of $11 million compared with the $126 million charge in the third quarter of 2011. For the quarter, surrenders averaged 14.7% on the U.S. variable annuity book and 3.6% for Japan VA, slightly higher than historical levels but lower than the 17.5% and the 4.5%, respectively, we saw in the second quarter.
We recently filed for approval with the SEC in an enhanced surrender value option, which Liam discussed. This represents our first of initiatives to provide contract holders with additional choices for their contract that also meet our objectives of reducing risk with reasonable economics.
Turning to the impact of the VA book in capital resources. Slide 12 provides a summary of VA hedging results for the quarter. During the quarter, the net statutory impact of our VA liabilities and hedges was a negative $4 million before-tax, excluding fees earned in the quarter and other impacts to surplus. It's been about a year since we've completed the buildout of our Japan hedging program. The goal of all our hedging programs is to manage our economic exposure, which is our continued focus and which is performing as we expect in these market conditions. We have retained some market risk, although throughout 2012, we have increased interest rate protection. You can find our updated sensitivities in our 10-Q.
Slide 13 is a new slide that combines our statutory surplus roll-forward with our total capital resources. Total U.S. statutory surplus before dividends as a holding company increased by approximately $100 million from June 30, reflecting $215 million of increased P&C surplus that was offset by a slight decrease in U.S. Life surplus. After $200 million of dividends to -- from the P&C company to the holding company, surplus was essentially flat. Year-to-date, Life statutory surplus is up about $150 million. We performed our annual cash flow testing at the end of the year, which will impact full year results given sustained low interest rates and tighter credit spreads. Consistent with our prior outlook, we continue to expect U.S. Life statutory surplus to be flat or slightly down for the full year.
Our capital resources, which include U.S. statutory surplus, as well as the $1.3 billion in Japan capital, were equal to the $18 billion we had at the end of June 30. Holding company cash and short-term investments totaled $1.4 billion.
Looking forward, the 3 sales transactions are expected to increase our statutory surplus by approximately $1.4 billion, for a total net statutory capital benefit of about $2.2 billion based on current estimates. As Liam mentioned, we are working on our capital plans, and we look forward to sharing them with you in early 2013.
Turning to the second item on my agenda. Slide 14 sets forth our updated expense initiatives. As Liam mentioned, we expect to reduce expenses by approximately $850 million before-tax, most of which will be completed in 2013. Slide 14 breaks out the components of the expense reductions. In addition to our prior efficiency commitments, we will reduce expenses by another $100 million related to putting U.S. VA into runoff and $615 million related to the 3 businesses being sold. We have detailed plans for execution and have begun reducing expense levels in 2012, which will continue into 2013.
As a result of these initiatives, we expect to incur a restructuring charge of approximately $45 million to $50 million after-tax in the fourth quarter. This charge will accrue for all planned 2013 severance costs for approximately 500 positions affected over the course of 2013, as well as other fourth quarter items, such as retention payments. At year-end, we will have expensed about 85% of ultimate restructuring costs we anticipate. In 2013, we currently expect to have approximately $30 million after-tax of additional restructuring and other expenses. Bottom line, we have significant expense-reduction goals and have a high degree of confidence in our ability to achieve them.
Finally, our last item before we take some questions is to look at our year-to-date results and our fourth quarter outlook. As summarized on Slide 15, our core earnings, excluding DAC unlock, prior year developments, cats above budget and restructuring charges for the first 9 months of the year, totaled $1.2 billion or $2.40 per diluted share. 
Our current fourth quarter outlook projects core earnings of approximately $375 million to $400 million or $0.77 to $0.82 per diluted share based on an estimated diluted share count of approximately 486 million shares. This outlook does not include any estimate of DAC unlock or prior year loss development and is also before previously mentioned restructuring charge, which approximates $0.10 per diluted share. 
This outlook includes a budgeted cat load of approximately $68 million before-tax. This cat load does not include an estimate of expected losses from Sandy. Our plan is to update you on the impact of this major storm event when we have good estimates.
Combined with year-to-date results, our current 2012 outlook, excluding the DAC unlock, prior year development and other items listed on Slide 15, totals approximately $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion for the year, slightly less than our December '11 outlook of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. We are pleased with this result given the challenging microeconomic environment, as well as the significant strategic actions we took this year, which were not anticipated in our December outlook.
We are currently working on our 2013 plan, which we expect to share with you in February on our fourth quarter 2012 earnings call.
To conclude, I am pleased with both our business results and our strategic accomplishments this quarter and this year. Despite the weak economy and low interest rates, our business has performed largely in line with our expectations. Our capital resources remain strong and stable, and our hedging programs continue to protect us against adverse economic and market conditions.
At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Sabra to begin our Q&A session."

But as we've said before, generally, at the 1450 S&P level, we start to feel very good about the performance of the VA block going forward. You could see it in I'm going to call it in that amount of risk coming down this quarter. So we're at that inflection point where if markets continue to improve, and it won't happen overnight, Mark, where we generate a lot of statutory surplus off the VA block, but over time, with steady market performance, it is very positive for us. I would have to point out that offsetting that is really the continued low interest rate environment. So as much as equity markets are a positive around the world, low interest rates in the U.S., in Europe and in Japan are still a significant headwind for our statutory surplus creation on the Life side."

Number one, on the prior accident year, we look at $18 million against the base of $6 billion. I look at that, Brian, really as tuning. We did do some minor strengthening to the accident years '11, '10 and '09, and we had some releases 5, 4 and 3. But $18 million and $6 billion, really, given what we've gone through the last 5 quarters, I feel very good about our position, and we will continue to monitor aggressively and not -- there might not be little bumps on the road, but we are in a completely different spot than we were 5 quarters ago. When I think about the current year, a little bit -- 2 stories. One is 2/3 of our comp actions in the year were in Small Commercial. When you step back and think about Small Commercial, our returns and combined ratios in Small  are really, really outstanding, and I think they'll stack up with pretty much anybody in the industry. We saw a little bit of medical severity in the quarter and a little bit of larger cases. So nothing major, but enough so that we made some minor modifications to our current accident year pick in comp in Small. It's the first time we've had to do that in several years, but we're watching and staying very careful again, albeit you see the combined ratio and saw very solid returns and in line with outstanding rate adequacy across Small Commercial. A different story in Middle. We've talked aggressively about the rate actions we were taking in our Middle Market book the last 5, 6 quarters. We feel good about those rate actions. They do not stop in third quarter '12. We continue to march on. And as Liam mentioned, we're marching on into quarter 4. So we're out beyond our trends both on a frequency and severity standpoint and we now are improving margins. The prior actions had a little bit of Middle to them, but as I look at the current accident year, there isn't anything that concerns me. And I feel good about the actions we're taking in the marketplace and reflected in the balance sheet. So maybe some bumps along the way and a few bumps in the quarter but really very, very steady progress. And our behavior in the marketplace, both from a new business perspective and a rate retention, I think is a completely different spot than where we were third quarter 2011."

And then the enhancement that they get above that account value is if they get a payment of 20% of what the benefit basis -- or think about that as a guarantee amount, subject to a cap of overall 90%. So it does provide an enhancement. Again, as we look at this book, a significant portion of it is in the money so that most -- there are several policyholders that if they elect to this benefit, they would receive an amount greater than their current account value."

Before I begin, on behalf of all of us at The Hartford, our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by Storm Sandy. And on a personal note, we at The Hartford hope that each of you and your family are faring well during these very challenging times because, clearly, this was a devastating storm with a large footprint and tropical force winds that impacted a highly populated area. At The Hartford, our catastrophe team has been on the ground working 24/7 to help our policy holders, and I want to express my deep appreciation to our claims teammates and others in the field. In addition, we are also very thankful for the emergency personnel and volunteers who are providing basic needs and critical services.
I know you all are interested in loss estimates, but it's much too early for us to provide data with any level of certainty. We're still waiting for clearance from local authorities to access some areas. Yesterday, for example, was the first day we were able to get adjusters into Long Island. Now clearly, this is a significant event for those who suffered losses. But Storm Sandy is well within the planning scenarios we use to manage catastrophe risk at The Hartford. This is a major storm, but it is a manageable exposure for The Hartford. As we have more certainty around The Hartford's losses, we will provide you with details.
Now let's cover third quarter results and activities. I am pleased with The Hartford's third quarter achievements. First, we announced the sale of the 3 Wealth Management businesses we committed to sell last March, ahead of our year-end target. The businesses are going to strong, strategic buyers. And the sales are expected to generate about $2.2 billion of statutory capital benefit for The Hartford. Second, The Hartford generated strong overall financial results in the third quarter, with core earnings of $378 million, significantly better than the $50 million last year. Net income was also up strongly, rising from $60 million to $401 million. Third, The Hartford's go-forward businesses demonstrated increasing earnings momentum, benefiting from strong pricing trends, along with improved retention in Property & Casualty Commercial and new business growth in Consumer Markets. Mutual Funds also showed improved net flows. Core earnings from the 3 go-forward segments totaled $294 million this quarter compared with $121 million last year. 
Now while much of that improvement was due to last year's high catastrophe losses, combined ratios, excluding caps in prior development, improved in both Property & Casualty Commercial and Consumer Markets, as did the loss ratio in Group Benefits.
In Property & Casualty Commercial, we continued to generate sustained written price increases, with an 8% increase in standard commercial lines this quarter, up from 7% for the first half of 2012. Our focus on pricing discipline will continue in the fourth quarter and into 2013. Doug and his team are doing an excellent job balancing margin expansion with retention and pricing. Our primary goal, particularly in Middle Market, is to drive to acceptable levels of profitability. So there will continue to be a dampening effect on the top line as less profitable accounts move to other carriers.
We are pursuing similar tactics in Group Benefits. The Hartford was among the first to recognize and respond to the adverse incidents and termination trends. However, given the 3-year contract terms in this line, it takes longer for the results of pricing actions to fall to the bottom line. In the third quarter, core earnings trends benefited slightly from an improvement in termination rates, although they do remain lower than historical levels. Improving terminations, combined with our pricing initiatives, should slowly expand margins.
In Consumer Markets, Andy and his team are focused on maintaining margins in auto, expanding margins in homeowners, continuing new business growth and improving retention. We recently enhanced the pricing segmentation in our Open Road Advantage auto product, which has helped lift conversion rates. New business production is up, and we feel good about the mix of business. Homeowners continues to need rate, and we have been diligent in pursuing it. Efforts to improve retention are yielding positive results, with continuing quarterly improvements in auto and home.
The Mutual Funds business also made good progress during the quarter, as its balanced and fixed-income funds posted more favorable net flows. Overall flows remain negative due to continuing industry-wide withdrawals from domestic equity funds. However, the company's third quarter flows were the best we've seen since the first quarter of 2011. Several funds generated particularly strong performance in the quarter. For instance, the Balanced Income Fund had top quartile Lipper performance, both for the quarter and year-to-date, and was one of our top funds in gross sales at $385 million for the quarter. In addition, our World Bond Fund was recently recognized as a newcomer of the year by the Wall Street Journal.
In our Runoff division, third quarter financial results were in line with our expectations, with core earnings x DAC unlock declining 6% from the prior year, reflecting lower earnings from U.S. annuity. Beth Bombara and her team have been examining a range of options to address the legacy annuity blocks. One area of focus is on contract holder initiatives, such as the enhanced surrender value option -- offer that we filed earlier this week with the SEC. This option will be offered to contract holders who represent about 15% of our U.S. GMWB book in terms of account value, but more importantly, nearly 45% of the U.S. GMWB net amount at risk. Similar to programs introduced by several other companies, it offers the contract holder the option to surrender the policy at a premium to the current account value. We continue to aggressively examine other options to accelerate the runoff of the U.S. and international annuities and look forward to updating you on our progress. With any actions we take, we will continue to honor our obligations to contract holders.
Finally, I'm pleased that we reached definitive sales agreements for Individual Life, Retirement Plans and Woodbury Financial Services this quarter, ahead of our year-end target. We're selling these businesses at good values that will generate an estimated net statutory capital benefit of approximately $2.2 billion. Furthermore, they are being sold to market-leading strategic buyers who saw value in our innovative products, strong distribution and employee expertise. We expect to close the Woodbury transaction by year-end and Individual Life in the first quarter of 2013. We're working to close Retirement Plans by year-end, but it may slip a little into the new year as we work through the necessary regulatory approvals. 
Chris will discuss the company's expense initiatives. The bottom line, however, is that we will reduce about $850 million in expense. The vast majority of which relates to the elimination of all expenses of the divested businesses. Moreover, approximately 90% of the expenses will be eliminated by the end of 2013.
With the sales announced, I know investors are interested in our capital management plans. We are developing holistic capital management plans, which we will discuss with regulators and rating agencies and which we will share with you in early 2013, after the transactions are closed. Our goal in managing capital is to pursue accretive actions for shareholders while both maintaining a balance sheet sufficient for adverse economic environments and the current ratings of our go-forward businesses and preserving financial flexibility to be opportunistic in taking future actions to address the company's legacy annuity liabilities. Therefore, we expect that our capital management plans will include: debt repayment to reduce leverage and improve our interest coverage ratios over time; share repurchases, which at current prices are very accretive; and retaining some capital to take future actions for permanent solutions to reduce the size and risk of the legacy annuity liabilities, which should create significant shareholder value.
To conclude, The Hartford had a successful third quarter. We reached agreements in all 3 of the planned sales ahead of schedule at attractive prices and with strong buyers who value the skills and expertise of our teammates. We had strong core earnings. We demonstrated pricing and margin momentum in our go-forward businesses. And our Life Runoff team is considering options to accelerate the runoff of the legacy annuity blocks, including the recent filing of the enhanced surrender value program offer.
The Hartford is becoming a more focused company that has the potential to create greater shareholder value while providing policyholders with the protection and service that they depend on. I am confident that we are on the right path, and I look forward to communicating our continued progress.
I'll now turn the call over to Chris, who'll cover our financial results in more detail. Chris?"

Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'm going to focus on 3 topics: first, I'll cover key aspects of this quarter's financial results; second, I will provide an update on our expense initiatives, including efforts to remove all the direct and indirect expenses of the businesses we are selling; and third, I'll provide an outlook for fourth quarter and full year 2012 results.
I'll begin on Slide 5. Third quarter 2012 core earnings were $378 million or $0.78 per diluted share. These results were in line with our outlook of $0.75 to $0.80. On a run rate basis, core earnings were $0.77 per share, which excludes the items summarized on Slide 5, which totaled $0.01 per share. These items included a modest charge for reestimating current accident year prior quarter loss reserves for workers' compensation and commercial auto of approximately $0.05 per share. Restructuring expenses totaled $34 million after tax or about $0.07 per share, slightly above our August estimate.
Turning to Slide 6. The Hartford's book value per diluted share rose 10% over the past year to $48.13, including a $2 billion increase in net after-tax unrealized gains on fixed maturity investments as a result of continued low interest rates and tighter credit spreads over the last year. It also includes the approximately $900 million or $1.83 per share reduction in shareholders' equity due to the Allianz debt refinancing and warrant share repurchase in the first half of 2012. Book value, excluding AOCI, was $41.35 per diluted share, flat with prior year, as net income over the past year was largely offset by the impact of the Allianz transactions. For the last 12 months, our core earnings ROE was 7.2%, up from 6% for the 12 months ended September 30, 2011.
Slide 7 has a high-level summary of P&C Commercial results. Core earnings were $160 million, up 84% from prior year. Catastrophe losses came in at $7 million after tax compared with $60 million last year. In addition, the increase in core earnings reflects improved margins in Middle Market. The third quarter 2012 combined ratio, x cat, x prior year, was 97.5%, down from 99.4% in prior year. Favorable expenses and better experience in property lines were partially offset by a deterioration in commercial auto liability results.
Third quarter 2012 included $39 million of current accident year prior quarter loss reestimation or 2.5 points on the loss ratio. This compares to $47 million or 3 points on the loss ratio last year. This year's changes were due to higher severity in commercial auto, particularly in small commercial, and a slight adjustment for lost time workers' compensation claims. Even with this change, the 2012 workers' comp accident year loss ratio is approximately 4 points better than 2011 accident year. This reflects the pricing and underwriting actions we have taken over the last 12 to 18 months. Our pricing and underwriting discipline in P&C Commercial has resulted in pricing increases across the portfolio, and we remain committed to driving actions necessary to improve margins in the fourth quarter and beyond.
Middle Market workers' compensation is a key contributor to our achieved pricing increases, with rate increases averaging 15% this quarter, consistent with the rate achieved in the second quarter. In Middle Market property, rates increased 10% compared with 8% in the first half. Our team is proactively managing renewal rate increases, account retention and new business growth to optimize overall profitability. While aggregate rate increases may have leveled off, our focus on margin improvement will continue.
Group Benefits results are summarized on Slide 8. 
Although below historic levels, we're pleased with the trends we're seeing in the segment. Core earnings were $23 million, up 15%, due to improved loss trends. The loss ratio was 79.3%, an improvement over prior year's 80.1% and reflected better LTD results, offset by less favorable mortality in Group Life this quarter. As a result of our sustained pricing actions over the past 2 years, Group Benefits premiums declined 7% year-over-year. We expect this trend will continue into 2013 due to the impact of our renewal pricing strategies on persistency. Year-to-date, persistencies averaged 62%.
Turning to Consumer Markets on Slide 9. Core earnings were $93 million, a turnaround from core losses of $10 million in the third quarter of 2011, which had a significant level of catastrophes. This quarter had no net catastrophe losses as the $16 million of after-tax losses from the third quarter events, including Hurricane Isaac, were offset by favorable development on catastrophes from the first half of 2012. We continue to be pleased with the progress that Andy Napoli and his team are making, balancing profitability and growth. Consumer Markets underwriting margins, excluding catastrophes, have expanded as we take rate increases. 
The third quarter combined ratio, excluding cats and prior year development, was 93.3%, down more than 2 points from 95.5% last year, are duly because of improved homeowner results. Auto results were comparable to the prior year. We remain focused on achieving rate increases consistent with the loss cost trends. Loss costs continue to be slightly higher in auto due to physical damage severity, although it moderated from the first half of 2012. The increase in physical damage severity was largely offset by favorable trends on auto liability frequency this quarter. We achieved written rate increases of 6% in homeowners and 4% in auto this quarter.
On the growth side, new business premiums are up 9% this quarter and 18% year-to-date. AARP Agency is a strong growth source. In the first 9 months of 2012, written premiums in AARP Agency were $96 million, almost double that of the prior year period. Retention has also improved, up 2 points in auto and 3 points in homeowners compared to a year ago.
Mutual Fund results are summarized on Slide 10. Core earnings were $18 million, down from the prior year but flat with the second quarter of 2012. The principal reason for the decline was lower fees, reflecting lower average assets under management and higher distribution and marketing expenses as we execute our strategy with Wellington. Net flow performance has significantly improved from the past several quarters as a result of stronger deposits into our fixed income and balanced fund choices. We are optimistic about the prospects for this business as we work with Wellington to expand marketing for The Hartford funds.
The results of our combined Life and P&C Runoff division are on Slide 11. Core earnings x DAC unlock were $168 million, comprised of $147 million from Life other operations and $21 million from P&C. The DAC unlock included in core earnings for the quarter totaled a charge of $11 million compared with a $126 million charge in the third quarter of 2011. For the quarter, surrenders averaged 14.7% on the U.S. variable annuity book and 3.6% for Japan VA, slightly higher than historical levels but lower than the 17.5% and the 4.5%, respectively, we saw in the second quarter.
We recently filed for approval with the SEC an enhanced surrender value option, which Liam discussed. This represents our first of initiatives to provide contract holders with additional choices for their contract that also meet our objectives of reducing risk with reasonable economics.
Turning to the impact of the VA book in capital resources. Slide 12 provides a summary of VA hedging results for the quarter. During the quarter, the net statutory impact of our VA liabilities and hedges was a negative $4 million before tax, excluding fees earned in the quarter and other impacts to surplus. It's been about a year since we've completed the buildout of our Japan hedging program. The goal of all our hedging programs is to manage our economic exposure, which is our continued focus and which is performing as we expect in these market conditions. We have retained some market risk, although throughout 2012, we have increased interest rate protection. You can find our updated sensitivities in our 10-Q.
Slide 13 is a new slide that combines our statutory surplus roll-forward with our total capital resources. Total U.S. statutory surplus before dividends to the holding company increased by approximately $100 million from June 30, reflecting $215 million of increased P&C surplus that was offset by a slight decrease in U.S. Life surplus. After $200 million of dividends to -- from the P&C company to the holding company, surplus was essentially flat. Year-to-date, Life statutory surplus is up about $150 million. We perform our annual cash flow testing at the end of the year, which will impact full year results given sustained low interest rates and tighter credit spreads. Consistent with our prior outlook, we continue to expect U.S. Life statutory surplus to be flat or slightly down for the full year.
Our capital resources, which include U.S. statutory surplus, as well as the $1.3 billion in Japan capital, were equal to the $18 billion we had at the end of June 30. Holding company cash and short-term investments totaled $1.4 billion.
Looking forward, the 3 sales transactions are expected to increase our statutory surplus by approximately $1.4 billion, for a total net statutory capital benefit of about $2.2 billion based on current estimates. As Liam mentioned, we are working on our capital plans, and we look forward to sharing them with you in early 2013.
Turning to the second item on my agenda, Slide 14 sets forth our updated expense initiatives. As Liam mentioned, we expect to reduce expenses by approximately $850 million before tax, most of which will be completed in 2013. Slide 14 breaks out the components of the expense reductions. In addition to our prior efficiency commitments, we will reduce expenses by another $100 million related to putting U.S. VA into Runoff and $615 million related to the 3 businesses being sold. We have detailed plans for execution and have begun reducing expense levels in 2012, which will continue into 2013.
As a result of these initiatives, we expect to incur a restructuring charge of approximately $45 million to $50 million after tax in the fourth quarter. This charge will accrue for all planned 2013 severance costs for approximately 500 positions affected over the course of 2013, as well as other fourth quarter items, such as retention payments. At year-end, we will have expensed about 85% of ultimate restructuring costs we anticipate. In 2013, we currently expect to have approximately $30 million after tax of additional restructuring and other expenses. Bottom line, we have significant expense-reduction goals and have a high degree of confidence in our ability to achieve them. 
Finally, my last item before taking questions is to look at our year-to-date results and our fourth quarter outlook. As summarized on Slide 15, our core earnings, excluding DAC unlock, prior year developments, cats above budget and restructuring charges for the first 9 months of the year, totaled $1.2 billion or $2.40 per diluted share. 
Our current fourth quarter outlook projects core earnings of approximately $375 million to $400 million or $0.77 to $0.82 per diluted share based on an estimated diluted share count of approximately 486 million shares. This outlook does not include any estimate of DAC unlock or prior year loss development and is also before the previously mentioned restructuring charge, which approximates $0.10 per diluted share. 
This outlook includes a budgeted cat load of approximately $68 million before tax. This cat load does not include an estimate of expected losses from Sandy. Our plan is to update you on the impact of this major storm event when we have good estimates.
Combined with year-to-date results, our current 2012 outlook, excluding the DAC unlock, prior year development and other items listed on Slide 15, totals approximately $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion for the year, slightly less than our December '11 outlook of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. We are pleased with this result given the challenging microeconomic environment, as well as the significant strategic actions we took this year, which were not anticipated in our December outlook.
We are currently working on our 2013 plan, which we expect to share with you in February on our fourth quarter 2012 earnings call.
To conclude, I am pleased with both our business results and our strategic accomplishments this quarter and this year. Despite the weak economy and low interest rates, our business has performed largely in line with our expectations. Our capital resources remain strong and stable, and our hedging programs continue to protect us against adverse economic and market conditions.
At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Sabra to begin our Q&A session."

I think your point's a good one. This quarter was negative $4 million, as we talked about. And I remind you that, again, we're -- our hedge programs aren't, I'll call it, managing all the economics, so we still have risk positions on. So you're always going to have, I'll call it differences between your VACARVM liabilities and your changes in fair value of hedge assets. But as we've said before, generally, at the 1450 S&P level, we start to feel very good about the performance of the VA block going forward. You could see it in I'm going to call it the net amount of risk coming down this quarter. So we're at that inflection point where if markets continue to improve -- and it won't happen overnight, Mark, where we would generate a lot of statutory surplus off the VA block, but over time, with steady market performance, it is very positive for us. I would have to point out that offsetting that is really the continued low interest rate environment. So as much as equity markets are positive around the world, low interest rates in the U.S., Europe and in Japan are still a significant headwind for our statutory surplus creation on the Life side."

Just so I understand it correctly, the -- I heard, in response to John's question, what you said about the 2013 plan, which was you've only achieved 30% so far on the VA, $100 million, so that's an incremental $70 million there, and $135 million on other various initiatives. So let's just add this up to $200 million. That still leaves another $650 million. Should we assume this $650 million incremental is being offset by all the lost revenues that are going away with these asset sales?

And again, the way that these programs work, as I'm sure you know, is that they're made available to all policyholders that meet the criteria that is in the filing. So as far as targeting certain policyholders, again, it's open to all. When we think about the benefits that we might see, currently, this book we see about a 5% lapse rate. When I look at what might be reasonable expectations as to what we might see for sort of an increase in the take rate, I think to the extent that, that doubles or triples, I think that's a reasonable expectation because we would never think that this choice would be right for all policyholders that have this benefit. So that -- again, that's how we're thinking about it right now. And then as we go through the approval process and we're able to actually offer this benefit to policyholders, we'll trip those estimates as we see actual take rates from the program."

Number one, on the prior accident year, and we look at $18 million against the base of $6 billion. I look at that, Brian, really as tuning. We did do some minor strengthening to the accident years '11, '10 and '09, and we had some releases 5, 4 and 3. But $18 million and $6 billion, really, given what we've gone through the last 5 quarters, I feel very good about our position. And we will continue to monitor aggressively and not -- there might not be little bumps on the road, but we are in a completely different spot than we were 5 quarters ago. When I think about the current year, a little bit of 2 stories. One is 2/3 of our comp actions in the year were in Small Commercial. When you step back and think about Small Commercial, our returns and combined ratios in Small  are really, really outstanding, and I think they will stack up with pretty much anybody in the industry. We saw a little bit of medical severity in the quarter and a little bit of larger cases. So nothing major, but enough so that we made some minor modifications to our current accident year pick in Comp in Small. It's the first time we've had to do that in several years, but we're watching and staying very careful again, albeit you see the combined ratios and saw very solid returns and in line with outstanding rate adequacy across Small Commercial. A different story in Middle. We've talked aggressively about the rate actions we were taking in our Middle Market book the last 5, 6 quarters. We feel good about those rate actions. They do not stop in third quarter '12. We continue to march on. And as Liam mentioned, we're marching on into quarter 4. So we're out beyond our trends both on a frequency and severity standpoint and we now are improving margins. The prior actions had a little bit of Middle to them, but as I look at the current accident year, there isn't anything that concerns me. And I feel good about the actions we're taking in the marketplace and reflected in the balance sheet. So maybe some bumps along the way and a few bumps in the quarter but really very, very steady progress. And our behavior in the marketplace, both from a new business perspective and a rate retention, I think is a completely different spot than where we were third quarter 2011."

And then the enhancement that they get above that account value is if they get a payment of 20% of what the benefit base is, or think about that as the guarantee amount, subject to a cap of overall 90%.
