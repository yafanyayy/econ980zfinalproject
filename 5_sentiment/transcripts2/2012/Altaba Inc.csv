For those of you who are counting, it's been 3 weeks since I arrived and only 2 weeks since my official start date. And as you would imagine, I have been extremely busy as I've been rapidly coming up to speed. As I said on our last call, I did an extensive amount of research on Yahoo! and had formed strong opinions before I arrived. And since then, I've spent all my time meeting Yahoo!'s leaders, our employees and our customers, and I have validated what I believed coming in. I see even more today the strength of Yahoo!'s assets, the talent of our people and the huge opportunity in front of us. 
You all know Yahoo! has an exceptional foundation, a powerful brand, enormous numbers of unique visitors, 702 million of them globally, relationships with the world's leading advertisers and technology platforms operating at massive scale. We plan to do more with all of these advantages. We're going to work not just at scale, but with speed. We will focus on generating real, sustainable growth and value creation. I feel great about all that, but I'm also very clear that we have a lot of work to do. It's still early and I don't intend to lay out any detailed strategy until I fully assess our direction. But I think it may be helpful to talk a bit about my approach to operating the business and how that will guide the way we move forward at Yahoo!. 
Anytime you plan to move a company as large and as complex as Yahoo! quickly, aggressively and successfully, you need a guiding principle to ensure you keep all your key priorities clearly in view. The guiding principle for me is to insist that we be balanced. That balance applies to many things, how we think about our customers, who we are, our processes and, importantly, the way we allocate capital. I'm going to talk about each of these 4 concepts a bit later. 
By operating the business in a balanced way, we'll prioritize the most important things, move aggressively, and we'll move fast. We have to get great, innovative products that matter into the market, absorb feedback quickly from our customers and grab those products constantly. We'll discuss how we'll take advantage of our strength and tackle our challenges. 
So let's start first with the purpose of today's call, to discuss our Q4 results and progress and to lay out the foundation for our plans in 2012. Yahoo!'s Q4 2011 revenue was down 3% to $1,169,000,000. And our operating income was up 10% year-on-year to $242 million. Both numbers were near the midpoint of our guidance provided to you in October. The global company a few headline numbers like these don't tell the whole story. There's a lot more detail for you to know about Yahoo!'s performance in each of our businesses and the diverse regions we operate. In the future, I'll provide more insight about those details behind our results. 
In the face of all the commotion around Yahoo! last quarter, a lot of people worked very hard to achieve these results and they should be congratulated. Many of the products Yahoo! has brought to market are really driving engagement. You can see it in some of our core metrics this quarter, especially in our media properties, in our new Global Mail product. At the same time, there's no question that we need to do better, and we will. The company has been growing users and launching products at a faster rate, but we need better execution to accelerate time-to-market and to better monetize the engagement we have. 
Before I get into more detail, though, I'll ask Tim to go through our Q4 results and our expectations for Q1. Tim?"
91800,145703309,210191,"Yahoo! Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2012",2012-01-24,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, and welcome, Scott. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll begin with an overview of fourth quarter and full year 2011 results and then move to a more detailed discussion of 4Q revenue dynamics. I'll finish with guidance and color commentary on fir",1782,"Thanks, and welcome, Scott. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll begin with an overview of fourth quarter and full year 2011 results and then move to a more detailed discussion of 4Q revenue dynamics. I'll finish with guidance and color commentary on first quarter 2012. 
Let's start with our headline metrics for fourth quarter. As Scott said a few moments ago, revenue ex-TAC landed at $1,169,000,000, a 3% decline from prior year and 1% below the midpoint of our guidance. Operating income was $242 million for the quarter, an improvement of 10% from 4Q 2010 and 5% ahead of guidance midpoint. Operating margin was 21% on an ex-TAC basis, the highest quarterly result since fourth quarter 2006. 
This quarter was challenging in many respects, but I'm proud of what the company accomplished. Despite numerous distractions, our teams remain focused on delivering our commitments. Thanks to their efforts, we rolled out great new products, continued to reshape our Americas sales force, executed on the strategically important enter click acquisition, generated double-digit Display growth in EMEA and APAC, and once again exceeded expectations for operating income and margin expansion. I'd like to say a sincere thank you to all our teams across the globe for a job well done. 
Now let's pan out the full year 2011 and walk through our key financial metrics. Revenue ex-TAC for the year declined nearly 5% to $4,381,000,000. A little more than half of the decline was related to the first full year of our Search Alliance revenue share to Microsoft. As a result of the REVShare and the impact of the transition on our Search Affiliate network, ex-TAC Search revenue was down 13% from 2010. 
Turning to Display revenue, this is the key shortfall versus our expectations this year with 2% growth on an ex-TAC basis compared to prior year. Both our EMEA and APAC regions grew Display more than 20% in 2011, but flattish performance in our Americas region muted the global result. In contrast, our other revenue category, performed as expected in 2011, down 4% year-over-year, but flat, excluding the 2010 divestitures of HotJobs and Zimbra. 
Despite the overall revenue decline for 2011, operating income of $800 million improved by nearly 4% versus 2010 and operating margin expanded by roughly 1.5 points to 18.3% for the year. During 2011, we continue to reshape our cost structure. With the reduction of $235 million or 6% year-over-year, our costs are now roughly $1.3 billion or 27% lower than normalized 2008 levels. It's important to note, however, that within that net $1.3 billion reduction, we've actually invested roughly $250 million in developing new products, platforms and experiences. We have also absorbed the rise in infrastructure costs associated with the growth in our user base of almost 30% over the 3-year period. 
Moving to EPS, $0.82 per diluted share for full year 2011 was down 9% on a reported basis compared to $0.90 in 2010. However, you'll recall that 2010 included roughly $0.20 per share in onetime gains related to the Search Alliance and the divestitures of HotJobs and Zimbra. Adjusting for these items, EPS grew roughly 16%. Return on invested capital was 11% for full year 2011, down 2 points compared to 2010. On a constant tax rate basis, ROIC was roughly flat. In terms of cash generation, cash flow from operating activities grew by 7% year-over-year and free cash flow grew by 22% compared to 2010. Much of the free cash flow improvement was driven by a 17% reduction in capital spending, in line with our original guidance for the year. 
Finally, we ended 2011 with approximately $2.5 billion in cash and marketable debt securities. And throughout the year, we repurchased roughly $1.6 billion of Yahoo! stock at an average price of approximately $14.75. 
Let's return now to fourth quarter operating dynamics and begin with Display revenue. In total, ex-TAC Display revenue missed our expectations by roughly $15 million. About $10 million of that total was attributable to macroeconomic weakness, primarily in Europe. The other $5 million was in U.S. Display and was split evenly between guaranteed volume and new. Our non-guaranteed placement revenue performed in line with expectations and we believe should benefit significantly in 2012 from our acquisition of Interclick. Over the past couple of quarters, we've discussed with you the effort under way to transform our U.S.-based sales force. We're now roughly 9 months into that process and we continue to make good progress. Two key measures of sales force effectiveness are sell-through rate and FrontPage days sold. And although both declined versus prior year, each improved substantially on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter. We're pleased that several major advertisers that had reduced or eliminated spending with Yahoo! in 2011 see the promise in our new approach to content and solutions selling and it made meaningful upfront commitments for 2012. 
Turning now to Search, fourth quarter results landed slightly ahead of expectations. Having passed the anniversary of the paid Search transition in the U.S., our year-over-year REVShare comparisons are cleaner and global Owned and Operated ex-TAC grew 4% year-over-year, the first Search growth we've achieved since fourth quarter 2008. Revenue for Search improved globally by mid single digits compared to last year, partially offset by slightly lower query volume. Although our U.S. results still benefited from the Search Alliance RPS guarantee, operational RPS in the U.S. improved by mid to high single digits compared to both prior quarter and prior year. U.S. queries also grew on a year-over-year basis for the fifth consecutive quarter. 
As a reminder, to create more financial certainty, Microsoft and Yahoo! agreed in 4Q to extend the RPS guarantee in the U.S. and Canada through March 2013. Both companies remain hard at work to improve RPS in the joint marketplace as quickly as possible. In  fourth quarter, Microsoft implemented several improvements that generated greater clicks for advertisers, especially on critical dates like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Yahoo!'s sales teams also executed well on account optimization, delivering strong results for many key Search advertisers. In fact, last quarter, we saw some of the best execution to date from the alliance, from algo performance to technology enhancements to sales optimization. With the transition of all algorithmic markets now complete, next on the Search Alliance agenda is to roll out adCenter in the U.K. and France in the first half. Customer outreach is well underway, and testing commenced this month. 
Before moving the first quarter 2012 guidance, I'd like to take a few moments to wrap up the key operational initiatives from 2011 that we've been tracking throughout the year. Beginning with audience, we grew our unique visitors by 11% and our media property page views by 8% for full year 2011, largely through a combination of content and product rollouts. On the content side of the house, we launched our tent poles and ANCHORS strategy with aggressive programming around the Super Bowl, Oscars, Royal Wedding and several other major events. And in 2012, we're building on that momentum with the major tentpole event of the U.S. elections and the Olympics. 
During 2011, we also built out our editorial voice, most notably in news and sports, and we struck new partnerships, including Yahoo!'s alliance with ABC News. For video, we launched Yahoo! Screen as our destination site and introduced 14 new shows into our Web-leading collection of short form original programming. 1 in 6 Americans online watched a Yahoo! original video in December. Many of these advances were made possible by underlying improvements in our platforms and products. We've expanded the Yahoo! Publisher platform to more than 130 sites, improved click-through in key properties with our core personalization engine, introduced innovations like the SocialGuard and News, omg! and Shine, expanded our new Mail platform to 80% of our global users, including 27 new markets in 22  new languages and created new experiences on the iPad like Livestand. Finally, we continue to innovate and Search with new front-end user experiences like Search Direct, App Search, QuickApps and a revamped image Search, while meaningfully improving algo relevance with the transition of Microsoft algo platform in 60-plus markets around the world. In short, we made progress on many fronts, but that's obviously not the whole story. In a larger context, despite those foundational improvements, revenue isn't growing. In fact, we've lost share in Display advertising. Given the investments we've made over the last couple of years, we expected better. And as Scott said earlier, we believe this business should and will achieve better. 
Turning now to first quarter guidance, we expect ex-TAC revenue to be in the range of $1,025,000,000 to $1,105,000,000. For ex-TAC expense, we expect a range of $920 million to $950 million, excluding any costs related to potential restructuring charges or other transactions currently under consideration. At the midpoint of these ranges, operating income would be $130 million or an ex-TAC margin rate of approximately 12%. Guidance that shows flat year-over-year revenue and a 6 point decline in margin rate is not reflective of our long-term financial objectives for the company. Breaking that guidance down a bit, the midpoint of the cost is up $60 million or 7% compared to first quarter 2011. Roughly $25 million of the increase is associated with our recent acquisition of Interclick and it accounts for almost 1.5 points of the margin rate decline. The remaining $35 million of the cost increase is related to our previously discussed investments in content and editorial, sales force expansion, text buildout and new Product Development. These investments are intended to generate meaningful revenue growth, but we're obviously not at that point yet. 
A key message I'd leave you with is that the road to midteens operating margin rate is not what you should expect from us in the future. We're committed to continuing our efforts to expand margins via revenue growth, as well as through continued improvements to our cost structure. We're not in a position today to provide you with a roadmap or timetable for that effort, but we will be aggressive and plan to update you on our next earnings call. 
Finally, our efforts to reposition Yahoo! are not limited to reshaping the core business. We have engaged in a variety of discussions with potential partners to enhance shareholder value. We're in active discussions with our Asian partners to significantly restructure our holdings in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan in order to unlock value for our shareholders. While we're pursuing these discussions with enthusiasm, given the complex, unproven and multifaceted nature of their restructuring, we're not in a position to provide further detail or certainty on today's call. 
With that, I'll turn things back over to Scott"

While I know Tim agrees that our results need to improve, he's done a remarkable job, especially over the last several months in the dual role. The board and all of us at Yahoo! are really grateful to Tim for leading through this transition.",1658,"Thanks, Tim. While I know Tim agrees that our results need to improve, he's done a remarkable job, especially over the last several months in the dual role. The board and all of us at Yahoo! are really grateful to Tim for leading through this transition. 
Now let me come back to this idea of a balanced approach to operating the business. What does that really mean? Well, there are 4 obvious areas where I see the need to focus intensely on balance here at Yahoo!. First, our customers. Our focus will be on the needs and experiences of our customers. When I refer to our customers, I mean both our users, the consumers of our products and our advertisers. We want both our users and our advertisers to get real value from us, and we will focus equally on both. I believe that creating the best experiences for all our customers will drive revenue and, ultimately, the financial outcomes we want and you want. Our users really need to see the value in stopping by Yahoo! to consume content and use our services more frequently. And advertisers need to know that we see our success as being defined by their success. We have to reflect customer balance in our decision-making, in our prioritization and in our execution. That's my first point about balance with our customers. 
Second, is balancing who we are. Yahoo! is fundamentally both a media company and a technology company. We need to be great at both. Our media leadership is imperative and we have and we'll continue to develop best-in-class product, engineering and technology expertise. So we end the debate about which is more important. We are both a media company and a tech company. We must do both, end of the discussion. 
The third point about balance is that we need to balance a thoughtful, analytical and detailed approach with speed. By nature, I want to go fast. Those of you who know me, understand that I want to hear all the options. I'll always ask a lot of questions and I'll immerse myself in the details. But when it comes to making decisions, I make them quickly and then push to move fast, fast, fast. We will get speed back into the equation and move aggressively. To me, that's how we get to play offense rather than defense. 
Finally, and this is really important, we will focus on balancing our investment resources and our allocation of capital on the products of today, of tomorrow and of the long term. Being a leading company in any industry requires intense focus on the right allocation of capital. To strike the right investment balance, I believe the majority of our resources should be dedicated to our current core business, that is, the products that are driving results today. But I also believe that we must dedicate a very significant percentage of that capital to investments in the business of tomorrow, the products that we'll launch over the next year. And on top of that, we'll also need to invest a small, but meaningful percentage against product initiatives that will play out longer than 12 months from now. Discipline comes not from investing every dollar that we have in the current core business. It comes from optimizing the core and then investing for the future. Our plan is to invest in a disciplined way to create a vibrant, long-term product pipeline. And importantly, we'll consider revenue streams that look different from what we're doing today. 
Now we could put everything we have into the core business, focus solely on maximizing today's profits, and invest nothing in the future, and we won't spend any time of that approach because that's not just the way to build the business for the long term. But I really need to be clear when I talk about investing. This isn't about starting from scratch on a new investment cycle. We will concentrate on our strengths by repurposing existing investment dollars. As a result, there will be some things that we stop doing. 
Going forward, our processes will be relatively straightforward, prioritize and allocate capital to what matters and do more than just protect our current revenue streams. We need to innovate and disrupt, and not just in the areas where we've always been. We will consider new business models and revenue sources and we will build on our core technology and platform expertise. I, along with the rest of Yahoo!'s leadership, has very clear ideas about the specifics of what we'll do, and we're already deeply engaged in this. I'm not prepared to share those details today with you, but I will point out at least 2 fundamental building blocks of what we'll do. The first is focusing on customer experiences as I've noted; and the second is data. First, on our customer experiences. There've been many questions around Yahoo!, but 1 thing you can't question is our scale. We have 702 million unique visitors that come to our site every month. That 702 million people right in front of us who come to us to look at their email, news, sports, to be entertained and much, much more. But the sheer number of users will not get us where we need to be. We need to improve the quality of our relationship with these customers and their experiences with Yahoo!. We want our users to spend more time with Yahoo! because they love what we do for them. There are many ways to make that happen, better interfaces, faster speed, deeper and much more relevant content. We'll focus on all of those things with the goal of making the experiences so good that the users we really want come back to visit Yahoo! more and more often to get whatever they want, whenever they want it on the devices that they choose. And for our advertisers, we need them to give better results and spend more money with Yahoo!. We intend to make it easier for them to do business with us by giving them better tools to improve the effectiveness and the ROI of their advertising spend with us versus their other options. 
One of the most important ways we will focus on optimizing the customer experience and advertising performance is by using data. We can use data to render the experience exactly the way you want it, to create uniquely relevant experiences in everything from content to the layout of the page, to the flows between pages, and then of course, the advertising. Nobody's done that yet on the Web, and why you heard me mention data from day 1, it's important to know that Yahoo! has made some real progress in this area, but there's a long way to go to get to that uniquely relevant experience that will really differentiate us. I know lots of companies talk about using data. If there's 1 thing I want to take away from today, it's that our data may be Yahoo!'s singlemost underrated, underappreciated and underused asset. And we intend to leverage that data. We're getting out with this with a real sense of urgency. I believe that data will be the key component for driving innovation at Yahoo! and it will be the cornerstone of the next generation of Yahoo! products and customer experiences. 
I've worked in the past with talented teams to create great customer experiences, and we have the talent, the technology and the energy to make that happen here at Yahoo!. So that's some insight into how I'm thinking about the opportunity here after 2 short weeks. Let me turn now briefly to the strategic review process. Roy said on our last call that very significant work was done by the board over the last several months, with a wide range of opportunities considered. In September, the board initiated a process to examine many options for Yahoo! and has worked systematically to narrow down the alternatives. It's important for you to know that the company remains open to anything that's good for our shareholders. And as you'd expect, after evaluating multiple options, we're focusing on what appears most promising. I arrived with strong and well-informed opinions about the current and future value of Yahoo!'s core business, including our Asian assets. I was clear about those opinions with the board when we discussed my role here. My plan was to quickly get up to speed on the comprehensive review process, and I have. The work is ongoing and I won't say more about that today, but I am absolutely confident the steps we take will be in the best interest for our shareholders. 
Before we turn to your questions, I want to say again that I'm here because I believe that big potential at Yahoo!, much bigger than the outside world imagines for us today. I've led customer-facing Internet businesses for a long time. I've operated successfully in fast-paced mobile technology companies with big deep-pocketed competitors. And I also have a proven track record of executing ambitious plans and generating growth through investment in technology, great products and great customer experiences. And I'm here because I believe this company can do much more to innovate and disrupt, to build rate great products and to also leverage data and technology in ways the world hasn't yet conceived. I firmly believe that getting back to these core principles will grow this business. Maybe the most important thing to know about me is that I define success by the success of my customers. I want our users to have the best possible experiences we can give them. I want our advertisers to know that we are focused on how we can help them grow their businesses. Our actions will tell our customers and our partners exactly who we intend to be going forward. Thanks for your attention today. And now let's open it up for your questions. Operator?"

But we expect to continue to ramp and ramp helpfully throughout the year. We've got big plans for that acquisition. And as I noted back on the October call, it really fills in a piece of our market presence in the nonguaranteed space that's important to our growth. On your second question, RPS gains in the fourth quarter, nice job, I would say, by Microsoft. I also noted that our sales force, I think, is starting to now getting to the swing of things and be able to go on the offense of a little bit there. On the technology side, with Microsoft's implementations, we saw some good RPS improvements, as I said in the script, mid to high single digits versus last year and versus last few. So we're definitely closing the gap. The guarantee is getting smaller obviously. I don't think it makes a whole lot of sense to go into kind of play-by-play improvements there because the guarantee covers us through March 2013. But as I did note, I think the progress we've made across a wide variety of areas for the Search Alliance in the fourth quarter was definitely the best we've seen."

As you heard me say earlier, Europe was a chief driver of probably $10 million or so of macroeconomic weakness we saw in the fourth quarter. Early indications are it's no better, off to a little bit of a slow start in the first quarter. But maybe over the last week, again, it's really, maybe ramping up a little bit, but still tough to look out. There are so many factors at play especially with the European Union, tough to look out and extrapolate too much.

But when I look at the last publicly released Interclick numbers, it looks like they were running closer to $50 million a quarter of gross profit revenue ex-TAC, which might be the same thing here and running about $2 million of EBITDA per quarter. What exactly has changed so much given that 1 would expect the contribution from Yahoo! or with Yahoo! to go up since it wouldn't have to pay Yahoo! for some of the inventory it was paying Yahoo! before."

In intercompany, you can't report revenue, kind of going to yourself or for yourself, so that's part of it. I would say some of our investments in continuing to build out. Their ability to take on more volume is part of it. And I would say, lastly, part of it is that when you purchase a company, you have to take the intangibles and start amortizing the intangibles, and that's a good $8 million, $9 million here for the quarter. I'd stress, too, though, that this is the first quarter result right out of the gate and we're expecting to be able to ramp up Interclick and to have it help out not only its traditional business, but our O&O nonguaranteed business. So we do expect a significant and meaningful ramping throughout the year. I think the team's off to good start, but that's kind of how you reconcile all those pieces from a financial perspective."

First is, I have had a terrific opportunity to this point to meet a number, seemingly all of our biggest customers. Now it's a preliminary interaction of course, early days. And I would tell you, the conversations were fascinating, fascinating because of a number of reasons. One, these are businesses that really want us to be successful. They really do. And after all kinds of reasons, there's no real need to get into it. And 2, they are businesses and people were willing to share with us and did through my first interactions, exactly what we have to do to get more of this spend today. And that encouraged me. It encouraged me a lot because it tells me that we have, really, a wealth of opportunity to grow the core business and we don't have to get growth by M&A as the only channel available to us. And now, that said, as I was asking questions and taking notes, there are a list of things we need to do better, and we need to do better almost immediately on those things if we want to see incremental revenue growth. But the good news is, the really good news is, the customers are there; they're cheering for us; they will spend all kinds of time with us; they will tell us and we need to do, and, that is a healthy relationship to start from, and I'm encouraged by that, as I said. On your second question, I have not seen this data. Tim's sitting right next to me.

For those of you who are counting, it's been 3 weeks since I arrived and only 2 weeks since my official start date. And as you would imagine, I have been extremely busy as I have been rapidly coming up to speed. As I said on our last call, I did an extensive amount of research on Yahoo! and had formed strong opinions before I arrived. And since then, I've spent all my time meeting Yahoo!'s leaders, our employees and our customers, and I have validated what I believed coming in. I see even more, today, the strength of Yahoo!'s assets, the talent of our people and the huge opportunity in front of us. 
You all know Yahoo! has an exceptional foundation; a powerful brand; enormous numbers of unique visitors, 702 million of them globally; relationships with the world's leading advertisers and technology platforms operating at massive scale. We plan to do more with all of these advantages. We're going to work not just at scale, but with speed. We will focus on generating real, sustainable growth and value creation. I feel great about all that, but I'm also very clear that we have a lot of work to do. It is still early, and I don't intend to lay out any detailed strategy until I fully assess our direction, but I think it may be helpful to talk a bit about my approach to operating the business and how that will guide the way we move forward at Yahoo!. 
Anytime you plan to move a company as large and as complex as Yahoo! quickly, aggressively and successfully, you need a guiding principle to ensure you keep all your key priorities clearly in view. The guiding principle for me is to insist that we be balanced. That balance applies to many things: how we think about our customers, who we are, our processes and, importantly, the way we allocate capital. I'm going to talk about each of these 4 concepts a bit later. 
By operating the business in a balanced way, we'll prioritize the most important things, move aggressively, and we'll move fast. We have to get great, innovative products that matter into the market, absorb feedback quickly from our customers and grab those products constantly. We'll discuss how we'll take advantage of our strengths and tackle our challenges. 
So let's start first with the purpose of today's call: to discuss our Q4 results and progress and to lay out the foundation for our plans in 2012. Yahoo!'s Q4 2011 revenue was down 3% to $1,169,000,000. And our operating income was up 10% year-on-year to $242 million. Both numbers were near the midpoints of our guidance provided to you in October. At a global company, a few headline numbers like these don't tell the whole story. There's a lot more detail for you to know about Yahoo!'s performance in each of our businesses and the diverse regions we operate. In the future, I'll provide more insight about those details behind our results. 
In the face of all the commotion around Yahoo! last quarter, a lot of people worked very hard to achieve this result, and they should be congratulated. Many of the products Yahoo! has brought to market are really driving engagement. You can see it in some of our core metrics this quarter, especially in our media properties and in our new global mail product. At the same time, there's no question that we need to do better, and we will. The company has been growing users and launching products at a faster rate, but we need better execution to accelerate time-to-market and to better monetize the engagement we have. 
Before I get into more detail, though, I'll ask Tim to go through our Q4 results and our expectations for Q1. Tim?"
91800,145703309,210290,"Yahoo! Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2012",2012-01-24,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, and welcome, Scott. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll begin with an overview of fourth quarter and full year 2011 results and then move to a more detailed discussion of 4Q revenue dynamics. I'll finish with guidance and color commentary on fir",1784,"Thanks, and welcome, Scott. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll begin with an overview of fourth quarter and full year 2011 results and then move to a more detailed discussion of 4Q revenue dynamics. I'll finish with guidance and color commentary on first quarter 2012. 
Let's start with our headline metrics for fourth quarter. As Scott said a few moments ago, revenue ex-TAC landed at $1,169,000,000, a 3% decline from prior year and 1% below the midpoint of our guidance. Operating income was $242 million for the quarter, an improvement of 10% from 4Q 2010 and 5% ahead of guidance midpoint. Operating margin was 21% on an ex-TAC basis, the highest quarterly result since fourth quarter 2006. 
This quarter was challenging in many respects, but I'm proud of what the company accomplished. Despite numerous distractions, our teams remain focused on delivering our commitments. Thanks to their efforts, we rolled out great new products, continued to reshape our Americas sales force, executed on the strategically important Interclick acquisition, generated double-digit Display growth in EMEA and APAC, and once again, exceeded expectations for operating income and margin expansion. I'd like to say a sincere thank you to all our teams across the globe for a job well done. 
Now let's pan out the full year 2011 and walk through our key financial metrics. Revenue ex-TAC for the year declined nearly 5% to $4,381,000,000. A little more than half of the decline was related to the first full year of our Search Alliance revenue share to Microsoft. As a result of the rev share and the impact of the transition on our Search Affiliate network, ex-TAC Search revenue was down 13% from 2010. 
Turning to Display revenue, this is the key shortfall versus our expectations this year with 2% growth on an ex-TAC basis compared to prior year. Both our EMEA and APAC regions grew Display more than 20% in 2011, but flattish performance in our Americas region muted the global result. In contrast, our other revenue category, performed as expected in 2011, down 4% year-over-year, but flat, excluding the 2010 divestitures of HotJobs and Zimbra. 
Despite the overall revenue decline for 2011, operating income of $800 million improved by nearly 4% versus 2010 and operating margin expanded by roughly 1.5 points to 18.3% for the year. During 2011, we continue to reshape our cost structure. With a reduction of $235 million or 6% year-over-year, our costs are now roughly $1.3 billion or 27% lower than normalized 2008 levels. It's important to note, however, that within that net $1.3 billion reduction, we have actually invested roughly $250 million in developing new products, platforms and experiences. We have also absorbed the rise in infrastructure costs associated with the growth in our user base of almost 30% over the 3-year period. 
Moving to EPS, $0.82 per diluted share for full year 2011 was down 9% on a reported basis compared to $0.90 in 2010. However, you'll recall that 2010 included roughly $0.20 per share in onetime gains related to the Search Alliance and the divestitures of HotJobs and Zimbra. Adjusting for these items, EPS grew roughly 16%. Return on invested capital was 11% for full year 2011, down 2 points compared to 2010. On a constant tax rate basis, ROIC was roughly flat. In terms of cash generation, cash flow from operating activities grew by 7% year-over-year, and free cash flow grew by 22% compared to 2010. Much of the free cash flow improvement was driven by a 17% reduction in capital spending, in line with our original guidance for the year. 
Finally, we ended 2011 with approximately $2.5 billion in cash and marketable debt securities. And throughout the year, we repurchased roughly $1.6 billion of Yahoo! stock at an average price of approximately $14.75. 
Let's return now to fourth quarter operating dynamics and begin with Display revenue. In total, ex-TAC Display revenue missed our expectations by roughly $15 million. About $10 million of that total was attributable to macroeconomic weakness, primarily in Europe. The other $5 million was in U.S. Display and was split evenly between guaranteed volume and yield. Our non-guaranteed placement revenue performed in line with expectations, and we believe should benefit significantly in 2012 from our acquisition of Interclick. 
Over the past couple of quarters, we've discussed with you the effort under way to transform our U.S.-based sales force. We're now roughly 9 months into that process, and we continue to make good progress. Two key measures of sales force effectiveness are sell-through rate and front page days sold. And although both declined versus prior year, each improved substantially on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter. We're pleased that several major advertisers that had reduced or eliminated spending with Yahoo! in 2011 see the promise in our new approach to content and solutions selling, and it made meaningful upfront commitments for 2012. 
Turning now to Search, fourth quarter results landed slightly ahead of expectation. Having passed the anniversary of the paid Search transition in the U.S., our year-over-year rev share comparisons are cleaner and global Owned and Operated revenue ex-TAC grew 4% year-over-year, the first Search growth we've achieved since fourth quarter 2008. Revenue for Search improved globally by mid-single digits compared to last year, partially offset by slightly lower query volume. Although our U.S. results still benefited from the Search Alliance RPS guarantee, operational RPS in the U.S. improved by mid- to high-single digits compared to both prior quarter and prior year. U.S. queries also grew on a year-over-year basis for the fifth consecutive quarter. 
As a reminder, to create more financial certainty, Microsoft and Yahoo! agreed in 4Q to extend the RPS guarantee in the U.S. and Canada through March 2013. Both companies remain hard at work to improve RPS in the joint marketplace as quickly as possible. In  fourth quarter, Microsoft implemented several improvements that generated greater clicks for advertisers, especially on critical dates like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Yahoo!'s sales teams also executed well on account optimization, delivering strong results for many key Search advertisers. In fact, last quarter, we saw some of the best execution to date from the alliance, from algo performance to technology enhancements to sales optimization. With the transition of all algorithmic markets now complete, next on the Search Alliance agenda is to roll out adCenter in the U.K. and France in first half. Customer outreach is well underway, and testing commenced this month. 
Before moving to first quarter 2012 guidance, I'd like to take a few moments to wrap up the key operational initiatives from 2011 that we've been tracking throughout the year. Beginning with audience, we grew our unique visitors by 11% and our media property page views by 8% for full year 2011, largely through a combination of content and product rollouts. On the content side of the house, we launched our TENTPOLES and ANCHORS strategy with aggressive programming around the Super Bowl, Oscars, Royal Wedding and several other major events. And in 2012, we're building on that momentum with a major TENTPOLE event of the U.S. elections and the Olympics. 
During 2011, we also built out our editorial voice, most notably in news and sports, and we struck new partnerships, including Yahoo!'s alliance with ABC news. For video, we launched Yahoo! Screen as our destination site and introduced 14 new shows into our Web-leading collection of short form original programming. One in 6 Americans online watched a Yahoo! original video in December. Many of these advances were made possible by underlying improvements in our platforms and products. We've expanded the Yahoo! Publishing platform to more than 130 sites, improved click-through in key properties with our core personalization engine, introduced innovations like the SocialGuard and News, omg! and Shine, expanded our new Mail platform to 80% of our global users, including 27 new markets and 22  new languages and created new experiences on the iPad like Livestand.
Finally, we continue to innovate and Search with new front-end user experiences like Search Direct, App Search, QuickApps and a revamped image search, while meaningfully improving algo relevance with the transition of Microsoft's algo platform in 60-plus markets around the world. In short, we made progress on many fronts, but that's obviously not the whole story. In the larger context, despite those foundational improvements, revenue isn't growing. In fact, we've lost share in Display advertising. Given the investments we've made over the last couple of years, we expected better. And as Scott said earlier, we believe this business should and will achieve better. 
Turning now to first quarter guidance, we expect ex-TAC revenue to be in the range of $1,025,000,000 to $1,105,000,000. For ex-TAC expense, we expect a range of $920 million to $950 million, excluding any costs related to potential restructuring charges or other transactions currently under consideration. At the midpoint of these ranges, operating income would be $130 million or an ex-TAC margin rate of approximately 12%. Guidance that shows flat year-over-year revenue and a 6-point decline in margin rate is not reflective of our long-term financial objectives for the company. 
Breaking that guidance down a bit, the midpoint of the cost is up $60 million or 7% compared to first quarter 2011. Roughly $25 million of the increase is associated with our recent acquisition of Interclick, and it accounts for almost 1.5 points of the margin rate decline. The remaining $35 million of the cost increase is related to our previously discussed investments in content and editorial, sales force expansion, tech stack build out and new Product Development. These investments are intended to generate meaningful revenue growth, but we're obviously not at that point yet. 
The key message I'd leave you with is that the road to mid-teens operating margin rate is not what you should expect from us in the future. We are committed to continuing our efforts to expand margins via revenue growth, as well as through continued improvements to our cost structure. We're not in a position today to provide you with a roadmap or timetable for that effort, but we will be aggressive and plan to update you on our next earnings call. 
Finally, our efforts to reposition Yahoo! are not limited to reshaping the core business. We have engaged in a variety of discussions with potential partners to enhance shareholder value. We're in active discussions with our Asian partners to significantly restructure our holdings in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan in order to unlock value for our shareholders. While we're pursuing these discussions with enthusiasm, given the complex, unproven and multifaceted nature of the restructuring, we're not in a position to provide further detail or certainty on today's call. 
With that, I'll turn things back over to Scott"

While I know Tim agrees that our results need to improve, he's done a remarkable job, especially over the last several months in the dual role.

While I know Tim agrees that our results need to improve, he's done a remarkable job, especially over the last several months in the dual role. The board and all of us at Yahoo! are really grateful to Tim for leading through this transition. 
Now let me come back to this idea of a balanced approach to operating the business. What does that really mean? Well, there are 4 obvious areas where I see the need to focus intensely on balance here at Yahoo!. First, our customers. Our focus will be on the needs and experiences of our customers. When I refer to our customers, I mean both our users, the consumers of our products and our advertisers. We want both our users and our advertisers to get real value from us, and we will focus equally on both. I believe that creating the best experiences for all our customers will drive revenue and, ultimately, the financial outcomes we want and you want. Our users really need to see the value in stopping by Yahoo! to consume content and use our services more frequently. And advertisers need to know that we see our success as being defined by their success. We have to reflect customer balance in our decision-making, in our prioritization and in our execution. So that's my first point about balance with our customers. 
Second is balance in who we are. Yahoo! is fundamentally both a media company and a technology company. We need to be great at both. Our media leadership is imperative, and we have and we'll continue to develop best-in-class product, engineering and technology expertise. So we end the debate about which is more important. We are both a media company and a tech company. We must do both, end of the discussion. 
The third point about balance is that we need to balance a thoughtful, analytical and detailed approach with speed. By nature, I want to go fast. Those of you who know me, understand that I want to hear all the options. I'll always ask a lot of questions, and I'll immerse myself in the details. But when it comes to making decisions, I make them quickly and then push to move fast, fast, fast. We will get speed back into the equation and move aggressively. To me, that's how we get to play in offense rather than defense. 
Finally, and this is really, really important, we will focus on balancing our investment resources and our allocation of capital on the products of today, of tomorrow and of the long term. Being a leading company in any industry requires intense focus on the right allocation of capital. To strike the right investment balance, I believe the majority of our resources should be dedicated to our current core business, that is, the products that are driving results today. But I also believe that we must dedicate a very significant percentage of our capital to investments in the businesses of tomorrow, the products that we'll launch over the next year. 
And on top of that, we'll also need to invest a small, but meaningful, percentage against product initiatives that will play out longer than 12 months from now. Discipline comes not from investing every dollar that we have in the current core business. It comes from optimizing the core and then investing for the future. Our plan is to invest in a disciplined way to create a vibrant, long-term product pipeline. And importantly, we'll consider revenue streams that look different from what we're doing today. 
Now we could put everything we have into the core business, focus solely on maximizing today's profits and invest nothing in the future. But I won't spend any time on that approach because that's just not the way to build the business for the long term. But I really need to be clear when I talk about investing. This isn't about starting from scratch on a new investment cycle. We will concentrate on our strengths by re-purposing existing investment dollars. As a result, there will be some things that we stop doing. 
Going forward, our processes will be relatively straightforward, prioritize and allocate capital to what matters and do more than just protect our current revenue streams. We need to innovate and disrupt, and not just in the areas where we've always been. We will consider new business models and revenue sources, and we will build on our core technology and platform expertise. 
I, along with the rest of Yahoo!'s leadership, have some very clear ideas about the specifics of what we'll do, and we're already deeply engaged in this. I'm not prepared to share those details today with you, but I will point out at least 2 fundamental building blocks of what we'll do. The first is focusing on customer experiences, as I've noted; and the second is data. 
First, on the customer experiences. There have been many questions around Yahoo!, but one thing you can't question is our scale. We have 702 million unique visitors that come to our site every month. That 702 million people right in front of us who come to us to look at their email, news, sports, to be entertained and much, much more. But the sheer number of users will not get us where we need to be. We need to improve the quality of our relationship with these customers and their experiences with Yahoo!. We want our users to spend more time with Yahoo! because they love what we do for them. There are many ways to make that happen, better interfaces, faster speed, deeper and much more relevant content. We'll focus on all of those things with the goal of making the experiences so good that the users we really want come back to visit Yahoo! more and more often to get whatever they want, whenever they want it on the devices that they choose. And for our advertisers, we need them to give better results and spend more money with Yahoo!. We intend to make it easier for them to do business with us by giving them better tools to improve the effectiveness and the ROI of their advertising spend with us versus their other options. 
One of the most important ways we will focus on optimizing the customer experience and advertising performance is by using data. We can use data to render the experience exactly the way you want it, to create uniquely relevant experiences and everything from content to the layout of the page, to the flows between pages, and then, of course, the advertising. Nobody's done that yet on the Web. And why you've heard me mention data from day 1, it's important to note that Yahoo! has made some real progress in this area. But there's a long way to go to get to that uniquely relevant experience that really differentiate us. I know lots of companies talk about using data. If there's one thing I want you to take away from today, it's that our data may be Yahoo!'s single most underrated, underappreciated and underused asset. And we intend to leverage that data. We're getting after this with a real sense of urgency. I believe that data will be the key component for driving innovation at Yahoo! and it will be the cornerstone of the next generation of Yahoo! products and customer experiences. 
I've worked in the past with talented teams to create great customer experiences, and we have the talent, the technology and the energy to make that happen here at Yahoo!. So that's some insight into how I'm thinking about the opportunity here after 2 short weeks. Let me turn now briefly to the strategic review process. Roy said on our last call that very significant work was done by the board over the last several months, with a wide range of opportunities considered. In September, the board initiated a process to examine many options for Yahoo! and has worked systematically to narrow down the alternatives. It's important for you to know that the company remains open to anything that's good for our shareholders. 
And as you'd expect, after evaluating multiple options, we're focusing on what appears most promising. I arrived with strong and well-informed opinions about the current and future value of Yahoo!'s core business, including our Asian assets. I was clear about those opinions with the board when we discussed my role here. My plan was to quickly get up to speed on the comprehensive review process, and I have. The work is ongoing, and I won't say more about that today, but I am absolutely confident the steps we take will be in the best interest for our shareholders. 
Before we turn to your questions, I want to say again that I'm here because I believe the big potential at Yahoo!, much bigger than the outside world imagines for us today. I've led customer-facing Internet businesses for a long time. I've operated successfully in fast-paced global technology companies with big deep-pocketed competitors. I also have a proven track record of executing ambitious plans and generating growth through investment in technology, great products and great customer experiences. And I'm here because I believe this company can do much more to innovate and disrupt, to build great products and to also leverage data and technology in ways the world hasn't yet conceived. I firmly believe that getting back to these core principles will grow this business. 
Maybe the most important thing to know about me is that I define success by the success of my customers. I want our users to have the best possible experiences we can give them. I want our advertisers to know that we are focused on how we can help them grow their businesses. Our actions will tell our customers and our partners exactly who we intend to be going forward. 
Thanks for your attention today. And now let's open it up to your questions. Operator?"

We've got big plans for that acquisition. And as I noted back on the October call, it really fills in a piece of our market presence in the non-guaranteed space that's important to our growth. On your second question, RPS gains in the fourth quarter, nice job. I would say, by Microsoft. I also noted, our sales force, I think, is starting to now getting the swing of things and be able to go on the offense just a little bit there. On the technology side, with Microsoft's implementations, we saw some good RPS improvements, as I said in the script, mid- to high-single digits versus last year and versus last quarter. So we're definitely closing the gap. The guarantee is getting smaller, obviously. I don't think it makes a whole lot of sense to go into kind of play-by-play improvements there because the guarantee covers us through March 2013. But as I did note, I think the progress we've made across a wide variety of areas for the Search Alliance in the fourth quarter was definitely the best we've seen."

So I understand the question. I understand the external need for us to be very specific on this at a point in the near future. And I actually feel a little bit bad that I'm 2 weeks and 2 days into it and can't tell you more. But please accept that getting our Display business headed on the right course and articulating our strategy for the future of the business is what I spend all my waking moments thinking about.

So there's a lot of things that you're going to see from us that are very similar to what you've seen from us in the past. As I noted, it would take $1.3 billion out of the company on a net basis here, cost-wise over the last few years. And that's with absorbing rising infrastructure costs. We have 30% more users. It's with investing about $250 million more in new products and platforms and experiences. So constantly, kind of evolving our cost structure to match the opportunity set that we have, continuing to become a better business, more able to grow in a sustainable way. That's what we're after.

First is, I have had a terrific opportunity to this point to meet a number, seemingly all of our biggest customers. Now it's a preliminary interaction, of course, early days.

And for all kinds of reasons, there's no real need to get into it. And two, there are businesses and people who are willing to share with us and did through my first interactions exactly what we have to do to get more of this spend today. And that encouraged me. It encouraged me a lot because it tells me that we have, really, wealth of opportunity to grow the core business. And we don't have to get growth by M&A as the only channel available to us. And now that said, as I was asking questions and taking notes, there were a list of things that we need to do better. And we need to do better almost immediately on those things if we want to see incremental revenue growth. But the good news is, the really good news is, the customers are there. They're cheering for us. They will spend all kinds of time with us. They will tell us what we need to do, and that is a healthy relationship to start from. And I'm encouraged by that, as I said.

For those of you who are counting, it's been 3 weeks since I arrived and only 2 weeks since my official start date. And as you would imagine, I have been extremely busy as I’ve been rapidly coming up to speed. As I said on our last call, I did an extensive amount of research on Yahoo! and had formed strong opinions before I arrived. And since then, I've spent all my time meeting Yahoo!'s leaders, our employees and our customers, and I have validated what I believed coming in. I see even more, today, the strength of Yahoo!'s assets, the talent of our people and the huge opportunity in front of us. 
You all know Yahoo! has an exceptional foundation; a powerful brand; enormous numbers of unique visitors, 702 million of them globally; relationships with the world's leading advertisers and technology platforms operating at massive scale. We plan to do more with all of these advantages. We're going to work not just at scale, but with speed. We will focus on generating real, sustainable growth and value creation. I feel great about all that, but I'm also very clear that we have a lot of work to do. It’s still early, and I don't intend to lay out any detailed strategy until I fully assess our direction, but I think it may be helpful to talk a bit about my approach to operating the business and how that will guide the way we move forward at Yahoo!. 
Anytime you plan to move a company as large and as complex as Yahoo! quickly, aggressively and successfully, you need a guiding principle to ensure you keep all your key priorities clearly in view. The guiding principle for me is to insist that we be balanced. That balance applies to many things: how we think about our customers, who we are, our processes and, importantly, the way we allocate capital. I'm going to talk about each of these 4 concepts a bit later. 
By operating the business in a balanced way, we'll prioritize the most important things, move aggressively, and we'll move fast. We have to get great, innovative products that matter into the market, absorb feedback quickly from our customers and grab those products constantly. We'll discuss how we'll take advantage of our strengths and tackle our challenges. 
So let's start first with the purpose of today's call: to discuss our Q4 results and progress and to lay out the foundation for our plans in 2012. Yahoo!'s Q4 2011 revenue was down 3% to $1,169,000,000. And our operating income was up 10% year-on-year to $242 million. Both numbers were near the midpoints of our guidance provided to you in October. At a global company, a few headline numbers like these don't tell the whole story. There's a lot more detail for you to know about Yahoo!'s performance in each of our businesses and the diverse regions we operate. In the future, I'll provide more insight about those details behind our results. 
In the face of all the commotion around Yahoo! last quarter, a lot of people worked very hard to achieve this result, and they should be congratulated. Many of the products Yahoo! has brought to market are really driving engagement. You can see it in some of our core metrics this quarter, especially in our media properties and in our new global mail product. At the same time, there's no question that we need to do better, and we will. The company has been growing users and launching products at a faster rate, but we need better execution to accelerate time-to-market and to better monetize the engagement we have. 
Before I get into more detail, though, I'll ask Tim to go through our Q4 results and our expectations for Q1. Tim?"
91800,145703309,210320,"Yahoo! Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2012",2012-01-24,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, and welcome, Scott. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll begin with an overview of fourth quarter and full year 2011 results and then move to a more detailed discussion of 4Q revenue dynamics. I'll finish with guidance and color commentary on fir",1784,"Thanks, and welcome, Scott. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll begin with an overview of fourth quarter and full year 2011 results and then move to a more detailed discussion of 4Q revenue dynamics. I'll finish with guidance and color commentary on first quarter 2012. 
Let's start with our headline metrics for fourth quarter. As Scott said a few moments ago, revenue ex-TAC landed at $1,169,000,000, a 3% decline from prior year and 1% below the midpoint of our guidance. Operating income was $242 million for the quarter, an improvement of 10% from 4Q 2010 and 5% ahead of guidance midpoint. Operating margin was 21% on an ex-TAC basis, the highest quarterly result since fourth quarter 2006. 
This quarter was challenging in many respects, but I'm proud of what the company accomplished. Despite numerous distractions, our teams remain focused on delivering our commitments. Thanks to their efforts, we rolled out great new products, continued to reshape our Americas sales force, executed on the strategically important Interclick acquisition, generated double-digit Display growth in EMEA and APAC, and once again, exceeded expectations for operating income and margin expansion. I'd like to say a sincere thank you to all our teams across the globe for a job well done. 
Now let's pan out to full year 2011 and walk through our key financial metrics. Revenue ex-TAC for the year declined nearly 5% to $4,381,000,000. A little more than half of the decline was related to the first full year of our Search Alliance revenue share to Microsoft. As a result of the rev share and the impact of the transition on our Search Affiliate network, ex-TAC Search revenue was down 13% from 2010. 
Turning to Display revenue, this is the key shortfall versus our expectations this year, with 2% growth on an ex-TAC basis compared to prior year. Both our EMEA and APAC regions grew Display more than 20% in 2011, but flattish performance in our Americas region muted the global result. In contrast, our other revenue category performed as expected in 2011, down 4% year-over-year, but flat, excluding the 2010 divestitures of HotJobs and Zimbra. 
Despite the overall revenue decline for 2011, operating income of $800 million improved by nearly 4% versus 2010 and operating margin expanded by roughly 1.5 points to 18.3% for the year. During 2011, we continue to reshape our cost structure. With a reduction of $235 million or 6% year-over-year, our costs are now roughly $1.3 billion or 27% lower than normalized 2008 levels. It's important to note, however, that within that net $1.3 billion reduction, we have actually invested roughly $250 million in developing new products, platforms and experiences. We have also absorbed the rise in infrastructure costs associated with the growth in our user base of almost 30% over the 3-year period. 
Moving to EPS, $0.82 per diluted share for full year 2011 was down 9% on a reported basis, compared to $0.90 in 2010. However, you'll recall that 2010 included roughly $0.20 per share in onetime gains related to the Search Alliance and the divestitures of HotJobs and Zimbra. Adjusting for these items, EPS grew roughly 16%. Return on invested capital was 11% for full year 2011, down 2 points compared to 2010. On a constant tax rate basis, ROIC was roughly flat. In terms of cash generation, cash flow from operating activities grew by 7% year-over-year, and free cash flow grew by 22% compared to 2010. Much of the free cash flow improvement was driven by a 17% reduction in capital spending, in line with our original guidance for the year. 
Finally, we ended 2011 with approximately $2.5 billion in cash and marketable debt securities. And throughout the year, we repurchased roughly $1.6 billion of Yahoo! stock at an average price of approximately $14.75. 
Let's return now to fourth quarter operating dynamics and begin with Display revenue. In total, ex-TAC Display revenue missed our expectations by roughly $15 million. About $10 million of that total was attributable to macroeconomic weakness, primarily in Europe. The other $5 million was in U.S. Display and was split evenly between guaranteed volume and yield. Our non-guaranteed placement revenue performed in line with expectations, and we believe should benefit significantly in 2012 from our acquisition of Interclick. 
Over the past couple of quarters, we've discussed with you the effort under way to transform our U.S.-based sales force. We're now roughly 9 months into that process, and we continue to make good progress. Two key measures of sales force effectiveness are sell-through rate and front page days sold. And although both declined versus prior year, each improved substantially on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter. We're pleased that several major advertisers that had reduced or eliminated spending with Yahoo! in 2011 see the promise in our new approach to content and solutions selling, and it made meaningful upfront commitments for 2012. 
Turning now to Search, fourth quarter results landed slightly ahead of expectation. Having passed the anniversary of the paid Search transition in the U.S., our year-over-year rev share comparisons are cleaner and global Owned and Operated revenue ex-TAC grew 4% year-over-year, the first Search growth we've achieved since fourth quarter 2008. Revenue for Search improved globally by mid-single digits compared to last year, partially offset by slightly lower query volume. Although our U.S. results still benefited from the Search Alliance RPS guarantee, operational RPS in the U.S. improved by mid- to high-single digits compared to both prior quarter and prior year. U.S. queries also grew on a year-over-year basis for the fifth consecutive quarter. 
As a reminder, to create more financial certainty, Microsoft and Yahoo! agreed in 4Q to extend the RPS guarantee in the U.S. and Canada through March 2013. Both companies remain hard at work to improve RPS in the joint marketplace as quickly as possible. In fourth quarter, Microsoft implemented several improvements that generated greater clicks for advertisers, especially on critical dates like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Yahoo!'s sales teams also executed well on account optimization, delivering strong results for many key Search advertisers. In fact, last quarter, we saw some of the best execution to date from the alliance, from algo performance to technology enhancements to sales optimization. With the transition of all algorithmic markets now complete, next on the Search Alliance agenda is to roll out adCenter in the U.K. and France in first half. Customer outreach is well underway, and testing commenced this month. 
Before moving to first quarter 2012 guidance, I'd like to take a few moments to wrap up the key operational initiatives from 2011 that we've been tracking throughout the year. Beginning with audience, we grew our unique visitors by 11% and our media property page views by 8% for full year 2011, largely through a combination of content and product rollouts. On the content side of the house, we launched our TENTPOLES and ANCHORS strategy with aggressive programming around the Super Bowl, Oscars, Royal Wedding and several other major events. And in 2012, we're building on that momentum with a major TENTPOLE event of the U.S. elections and the Olympics. 
During 2011, we also built out our editorial voice, most notably in news and sports, and we struck new partnerships, including Yahoo!'s alliance with ABC news. For video, we launched Yahoo! Screen as our destination site and introduced 14 new shows into our Web-leading collection of short form original programming. One in 6 Americans online watched a Yahoo! original video in December. Many of these advances were made possible by underlying improvements in our platforms and products. We've extended the Yahoo! Publishing platform to more than 130 sites, improved click-through in key properties with our core personalization engine, introduced innovations like the SocialGuard and News, omg! and Shine, expanded our new Mail platform to 80% of our global users, including 27 new markets and 22  new languages and created new experiences on the iPad, like Livestand.
Finally, we continue to innovate and Search with new front-end user experiences like Search Direct, App Search, QuickApps and a revamped image search, while meaningfully improving algo relevance with the transition of Microsoft's algo platform in 60-plus markets around the world. In short, we made progress on many fronts, but that's obviously not the whole story. In the larger context, despite those foundational improvements, revenue isn't growing. In fact, we've lost share in Display advertising. Given the investments we've made over the last couple of years, we expected better. And as Scott said earlier, we believe this business should and will achieve better. 
Turning now to first quarter guidance, we expect ex-TAC revenue to be in the range of $1,025,000,000 to $1,105,000,000. For ex-TAC expense, we expect a range of $920 million to $950 million, excluding any costs related to potential restructuring charges or other transactions currently under consideration. At the midpoint of these ranges, operating income would be $130 million or an ex-TAC margin rate of approximately 12%. Guidance that shows flat year-over-year revenue and a 6-point decline in margin rate is not reflective of our long-term financial objectives for the company. 
Breaking that guidance down a bit, the midpoint of the cost is up $60 million or 7% compared to first quarter 2011. Roughly $25 million of the increase is associated with our recent acquisition of Interclick, and it accounts for almost 1.5 points of the margin rate decline. The remaining $35 million of the cost increase is related to our previously discussed investments in content and editorial, sales force expansion, tech stack build out and new Product Development. These investments are intended to generate meaningful revenue growth, but we're obviously not at that point yet. 
The key message I'd leave you with is that a low to mid-teens operating margin rate is not what you should expect from us in the future. We are committed to continuing our efforts to expand margins via revenue growth, as well as through continued improvements to our cost structure. We're not in a position today to provide you with a roadmap or timetable for that effort, but we will be aggressive and plan to update you on our next earnings call. 
Finally, our efforts to reposition Yahoo! are not limited to reshaping the core business. We have engaged in a variety of discussions with potential partners to enhance shareholder value. We're in active discussions with our Asian partners to significantly restructure our holdings in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan in order to unlock value for our shareholders. While we're pursuing these discussions with enthusiasm, given the complex, unproven and multifaceted nature of the restructuring, we're not in a position to provide further detail or certainty on today's call. 
With that, I'll turn things back over to Scott"

While I know Tim agrees that our results need to improve, he's done a remarkable job, especially over the last several months in the dual role. The board and all of us at Yahoo! are really grateful to Tim for leading through this transition.",1663,"Thanks, Tim. While I know Tim agrees that our results need to improve, he's done a remarkable job, especially over the last several months in the dual role. The board and all of us at Yahoo! are really grateful to Tim for leading through this transition.  
Now let me come back to this idea of a balanced approach to operating the business. What does that really mean? Well, there are 4 obvious areas where I see the need to focus intensely on balance here at Yahoo!. First, our customers. Our focus will be on the needs and experiences of our customers. When I refer to our customers, I mean both our users, the consumers of our products and our advertisers. We want both our users and our advertisers to get real value from us, and we will focus equally on both. I believe that creating the best experiences for all our customers will drive revenue and, ultimately, the financial outcomes we want and you want. Our users really need to see the value in stopping by Yahoo! to consume content and use our services more frequently. And advertisers need to know that we see our success as being defined by their success. We have to reflect customer balance in our decision-making, in our prioritization and in our execution. So that's my first point about balance with our customers. 
Second is balance in who we are. Yahoo! is fundamentally both a media company and a technology company. We need to be great at both. Our media leadership is imperative, and we have and will continue to develop best-in-class product, engineering and technology expertise. So we end the debate about which is more important. We are both a media company and a tech company. We must do both, end of the discussion. 
The third point about balance is that we need to balance a thoughtful, analytical and detailed approach with speed. By nature, I want to go fast. Those of you who know me, understand that I want to hear all the options. I'll always ask a lot of questions, and I'll immerse myself in the details. But when it comes to making decisions, I make them quickly and then push to move fast, fast, fast. We will get speed back into the equation and move aggressively. To me, that's how we get to play in offense rather than defense. 
Finally, and this is really, really important, we will focus on balancing our investment resources and our allocation of capital on the products of today, of tomorrow and of the long term. Being a leading company in any industry requires intense focus on the right allocation of capital. To strike the right investment balance, I believe the majority of our resources should be dedicated to our current core business, that is, the products that are driving results today. But I also believe that we must dedicate a very significant percentage of our capital to investments in the businesses of tomorrow, the products that we'll launch over the next year. 
And on top of that, we'll also need to invest a small, but meaningful, percentage against product initiatives that will play out longer than 12 months from now. Discipline comes not from investing every dollar that we have in the current core business. It comes from optimizing the core and then investing for the future. Our plan is to invest in a disciplined way to create a vibrant, long-term product pipeline. And importantly, we'll consider revenue streams that look different from what we're doing today.  
Now we could put everything we have into the core business, focus solely on maximizing today's profits and invest nothing in the future. But I won't spend any time on that approach because that's just not the way to build a business for the long term. But I really need to be clear when I talk about investing. This isn't about starting from scratch on a new investment cycle. We will concentrate on our strengths by re-purposing existing investment dollars. As a result, there will be some things that we stop doing. 
Going forward, our processes will be relatively straightforward, prioritize and allocate capital to what matters and do more than just protect our current revenue streams. We need to innovate and disrupt, and not just in the areas where we've always been. We will consider new business models and revenue sources, and we will build on our core technology and platform expertise. 
I, along with the rest of Yahoo!'s leadership, have some very clear ideas about the specifics of what we'll do, and we're already deeply engaged in this. I'm not prepared to share those details today with you, but I will point out at least 2 fundamental building blocks of what we'll do. The first is focusing on customer experiences, as I've noted; and the second is data. 
First, on the customer experiences. There have been many questions around Yahoo!, but one thing you can't question is our scale. We have 702 million unique visitors that come to our site every month. That’s 702 million people right in front of us, who come to us to look at their email, news, sports, to be entertained and much, much more. But the sheer number of users will not get us where we need to be. We need to improve the quality of our relationship with these customers and their experiences with Yahoo!.
We want our users to spend more time with Yahoo! because they love what we do for them. There are many ways to make that happen, better interfaces, faster speed, deeper and much more relevant content. We'll focus on all of those things with the goal of making the experiences so good that the users we really want come back to visit Yahoo! more and more often to get whatever they want, whenever they want it on the devices that they choose. And for our advertisers, we need them to give better results and spend more money with Yahoo!. We intend to make it easier for them to do business with us by giving them better tools to improve the effectiveness and the ROI of their advertising spend with us versus their other options. 
One of the most important ways we will focus on optimizing the customer experience and advertising performance is by using data. We can use data to render the experience exactly the way you want it, to create uniquely relevant experiences and everything from content to the layout of the page, to the flows between pages, and then, of course, the advertising. Nobody's done that yet on the Web. And why you've heard me mention data from day 1, it's important to note that Yahoo! has made some real progress in this area. But there's a long way to go to get to that uniquely relevant experience that really differentiate us. I know lots of companies talk about using data. If there's one thing I want you to take away from today, it's that our data may be Yahoo!'s single most underrated, underappreciated and underused asset. And we intend to leverage that data. We're getting after this with a real sense of urgency. I believe that data will be the key component for driving innovation at Yahoo! and it will be the cornerstone of the next generation of Yahoo! products and customer experiences. I've worked in the past with talented teams to create great customer experiences, and we have the talent, the technology and the energy to make that happen here at Yahoo!. 
So that's some insight into how I'm thinking about the opportunity here after 2 short weeks. Let me turn now briefly to the strategic review process. Roy said on our last call that very significant work was done by the board over the last several months, with a wide range of opportunities considered. In September, the board initiated a process to examine many options for Yahoo! and has worked systematically to narrow down the alternatives. It's important for you to know that the company remains open to anything that's good for our shareholders. 
But as you'd expect, after evaluating multiple options, we're focusing on what appears most promising. I arrived with strong and well-informed opinions about the current and future value of Yahoo!'s core business, including our Asian assets. I was clear about those opinions with the board when we discussed my role here. My plan was to quickly get up to speed on the comprehensive review process, and I have. The work is ongoing, and I won't say more about that today, but I am absolutely confident that the steps we take will be in the best interest for our shareholders. 
Before we turn to your questions, I want to say again that I'm here because I believe the big potential at Yahoo!, much bigger than the outside world imagines for us today. I've led customer-facing Internet businesses for a long time. I've operated successfully in fast-paced global technology companies with big deep-pocketed competitors. I also have a proven track record of executing ambitious plans and generating growth through investment in technology, great products and great customer experiences. And I'm here because I believe this company can do much more to innovate and disrupt, to build great products and to also leverage data and technology in ways the world hasn't yet conceived. I firmly believe that getting back to these core principles will grow this business. 
Maybe the most important thing to know about me is that I define success by the success of my customers. I want our users to have the best possible experiences we can give them. I want our advertisers to know that we are focused on how we can help them grow their businesses. Our actions will tell our customers and our partners exactly who we intend to be going forward. 
Thanks for your attention today. And now let's open it up to your questions. Operator?"

We've got big plans for that acquisition. And as I noted back on the October call, it really fills in a piece of our market presence in the non-guaranteed space that's important to our growth. On your second question, RPS gains in the fourth quarter, nice job. I would say, by Microsoft. I also noted, our sales force, I think, is starting to now get into the swing of things and be able to go on the offense just a little bit there. On the technology side, with Microsoft's implementations, we saw some good RPS improvements, as I said in the script, mid- to high-single digits versus last year and versus last quarter. So we're definitely closing the gap. The guarantee is getting smaller, obviously. I don't think it makes a whole lot of sense to go into kind of play-by-play improvements there because the guarantee covers us through March 2013. But as I did note, I think the progress we've made across a wide variety of areas for the Search Alliance in the fourth quarter was definitely the best we've seen."

I think it's -- there's a lot yet left to evolve, both in Search and Display, somewhat, but it just -- in pioneering some new revenue streams through mobile, I think, is going to be the critical thing. So – am I concerned? No. I'm actually kind of optimistic about how mobile and local, it all converges and the opportunities that Yahoo! has with its unique reach of data sets."

I couldn't agree more, Tim, with what you just said. And I do believe that's a big opportunity for us, if we choose to go that way. Ben, the only thing I would add to my first remarks here is that I said this now a couple of times, and I really genuinely mean it, the data that this company has is -- it's more than I would've imagined coming in the door. It's very, very impressive. The -- kind of the history and the data that they have against lots and lots and lots of that 702 million users that we have. And if you believe -- and I don't know whether you do or not, Ben, but it you believe data and great technology and great technologists can begin to predict what is in a user's mind and what they want to do next, having that base of data to start from is a big, big, big advantage. So I think you -- I'm certain you will see some interesting data-oriented products and experiences coming out from us, sooner versus later. So I hope that narrows it a little bit for you."

First is, I have had a terrific opportunity to this point to meet a number -- seemingly all of our biggest customers. Now it's a preliminary interaction, of course, early days.

And two, they’re are businesses and people who are willing to share with us, and did through my first interactions, exactly what we have to do to get more of this spend today. And that encouraged me. It encouraged me a lot because it tells me that we have, really, wealth of opportunity to grow the core business. And we don't have to get growth by M&A as the only channel available to us. And now that said, as I was asking questions and taking notes, there were a list of things that we need to do better. And we need to do better almost immediately on those things if we want to see incremental revenue growth. But the good news is, the really good news is, the customers are there. They're cheering for us. They will spend all kinds of time with us. They will tell us what we need to do, and that is a healthy relationship to start from. And I'm encouraged by that, as I said.

We've been moving very quickly on a number of initiatives since we last spoke. During that time, I've become more convinced than ever of the value of our assets, the potential of this business and what we can do to make the most of Yahoo!'s huge market opportunity. I'll have a lot to share on that, but we'll start today with a discussion of our first quarter results. And we'll talk about what we're doing to refocus Yahoo!'s core business and our renewed focus on our customers, the users and advertisers that are vital to Yahoo!'s future. 
First, on Q1, we're pleased that revenue and profits were higher than we expected, costs were lower than expected and we beat consensus across the board. And we're encouraged that revenue grew year-over-year for the first time since the third quarter of 2008. But I want to be very clear. I'm not satisfied with the pace of top line growth and I won't be satisfied until we're growing at least in line with the market. 
Taking a brief look at our performance in Search and Display, Search came in ahead of our expectations, driven by higher RPS. The majority of our Q1 gains were driven by changes Yahoo! made to the Search experience that drove higher click-through on our Search ads. While Microsoft has continued to enhance its and paid Search technology, the Search Alliance is not yet delivering what we expected. I'm personally working with Microsoft to ensure the alliance does deliver going forward and meet our high expectations for user experience, advertiser ROI and revenue for Yahoo!. 
Turning to Display, revenue was down versus last year and a bit lower than our expectations. We've had a few wins on engagement Display like the growing engagement on Yahoo! News, driven by our partnership with ABC News and by Yahoo!'s social bar. We also see some positive signs on monetization, with the stabilization of our U.S. sales force and renewed partnerships with some important advertisers. But let me be very clear that our Display business is no way close to where it needs to be in any of our 3 regions. Hundreds of millions of people engage on Yahoo!'s Homepage, Mail and other marquee media properties and we must improve monetization and achieve higher returns from that engagement. 
Looking at overall growth by region, Americas and APAC drove the top line in Q1, up 2% and 5%, respectively. Our smallest region, EMEA, saw the impact of macro dislocations in the region with revenue down 9% year-over-year. It came in much lower-than-expected, so overall operating income was above the reach we gave you January. EPS were up 38% year-over-year due mostly to improvements and our equity interest line. I have more to share about the actions we took in Q1 and our future plans, but first, I'd like Tim to provide more detail on our Q1 results, our Q2 guidance, as well as the financial framework we're using to manage business going forward. Tim?"
91800,183587364,284753,"Yahoo! Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter 2012 results, set up our second quarter guidance and update our longer-term financial model. Let's start with our headlines for first quarter. As Scott mentioned a few moments",1563,"Thanks, Scott. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter 2012 results, set up our second quarter guidance and update our longer-term financial model. 
Let's start with our headlines for first quarter. As Scott mentioned a few moments ago, revenue ex-TAC of $1,077,000,000 finished in the top half of our guidance range and, more importantly, grew on a year-over-year basis for the first time since third quarter 2008. That's a long way from the growth we aspire to, but it's an important milestone nonetheless. Operating income landed at $169 million, exceeding the top end of our guidance range by a combination of revenue and cost favorability. With respect to operating margin rate, first quarter was nearly 16% on an ex-TAC basis, up 3.5 points from guidance midpoint. Earnings per diluted share increased by 38% from prior year on improvements in our equity interest line. 
In cash flow, we're similarly strong in the first quarter, with cash flow from operating activities up 45% from 2011 and free cash flow up more than 245% as we continue to optimize capital spending. 
Finally, we've recently announced actions to further streamline our cost structure with steady state annual savings of roughly $375 million. More on the financial model implications of that action in just a few minutes. 
Turning to first quarter ex-TAC revenue results, our 1% improvement versus prior year was driven by 8% growth in Search, 1% growth in our Other revenue category and a 4% decline in Display. Starting with Search, query volume generated by our properties was up slightly in the Americas region and roughly flat globally. Revenue per Search, therefore, drove the bulk of the 8% ex-TAC revenue improvement compared to last year. Breaking down the RPS strength, Americas click-through rates improved by high single digits, implying that users are finding more relevant results and clicking on them more often. At the same time, we're absorbing some weakness in the Search marketplace itself that's being offset by the Search Alliance RPS guarantee. This quarter, we're not able to report significant progress by Microsoft on their effort to close the gap in marketplace RPS, but we are actively working with them to improve those results, as well as to achieve more consistent progress in closing the RPS gap in the future. 
Moving to Display, an ex-TAC revenue decline of 4% year-over-year, obviously isn't acceptable. On geography, Americas declined 5%, EMEA declined 4% and APAC grew 6%. The Americas turnaround effort remains our primary focus, so let me provide a bit more detail there. First, audience metrics continue to grow with media property page views improving by 10% year-over-year. However, total graphical supply including Mail, was down roughly 10% from a year ago and guaranteed placement sell-through rates remained well below first quarter 2011 levels. On a more positive note, we did generate strong yield improvements in the quarter, especially in guaranteed placements, thereby partially offsetting the impact of supply in sell-through. Rounding out displaying, our recent acquisition of Interclick performed in line with expectations, generating roughly $10 million incremental revenue.  
That's my first quarter overview for today. Now let's turn to second quarter guidance. Given the uncertainties that typically accompany both a large reduction in force in a business unit reorganization, our guidance ranges this quarter will be wider than those we usually provide. In short, this quarter has more potential for variability than other quarters. The most effective way to deal with additional variability is to provide as much transparency as we can with regard to our underlying dynamics. 
First, on revenue ex-TAC, we expect a range of $1,030,000,000 to $1,140,000,000 or $1,085,000,000 midpoint of this range equates to roughly 1% growth versus 2011. By revenue category on a year-over-year basis, we expect Search to be flat to up, other to be down slightly and Display to return to mid-single digits growth. Early bookings indications in Display are encouraging for consumer packaged goods, automotive and Finance. We also expect sequential revenue contributions from our Interclick acquisition and improvements in guaranteed placement sell-through rates. 
Moving to ex-TAC costs, it'll take about a year to reach substantially all of the $375 million steady state cost savings associated with the reduction in force we recently announced. During the interim period, we'll incur transition-related costs for work such as property rationalization, data center consolidation, improved cloud infrastructure utilization and the elimination or right sourcing of support functions. At the end of the transition period, those costs will obviously go away completely. 
In order to facilitate tracking and communication of our progress towards steady state, we'll provide cost guidance and reporting throughout this transition period in 3 pieces. Those are: one, ongoing costs; two, transition-related expenses; and three, restructuring charges. 
Let me take a moment to ensure each of these 3 pieces is clear. The first of the 3 is ongoing or look through costs. Those are the cost involved in running our business on a go-forward basis. The second of the 3 is transition-related expense. Now as I noted just a moment ago, we expect those costs will be reduced to 0 by roughly mid-2013. And finally, we'll have restructuring charges for severance, facilities exits and asset write-downs. By nature, these costs will vary from quarter-to-quarter, with some quarters potentially like this present quarter containing a sizable charge and others with little or no charge at all. Providing this transparency should facilitate everyone's ability to clearly track the operational progress of the business by focusing on ex-TAC revenue in ongoing costs. Resulting pro forma, ongoing operating income and ex-TAC operating margin rate are the best indication of our longer-term financial model. However, it's worth emphasizing that we will continue to provide and explain our fall GAAP picture of cost and profits, including all transitional costs and restructuring charges in addition to the look-through of the core business I just described. 
With that construct in mind, our second quarter ex-TAC cost guidance is as follows. We expect costs on a look-through or ongoing basis to be $875 million to $895 million. This range includes normal seasonal increases related to our annual wage and stock -based comp cycles, as well as marketing costs related to upcoming events such as the Olympics. Our transition-related costs are expected to be $40 million to $50 million. The majority of this cost is related to employees who are impacted by the April 4th actions, but who will continue employment through a set date over the next year. These employees, in other words, are in roles that will require transition work in order to reach steady-state. 
Finally, with respect to restructuring charges, while we expect to incur roughly $135 million in total severance related to our recent reduction in force, we'll undoubtedly add to that charge as a result of the associated efforts to streamline, rationalize and simplify our offerings in infrastructure. It's too early to put a range on the all-in charge and similarly too early to quantify it for this quarter. So we're going to guide on an ex-restructuring basis, but we'll plan to discuss it during our July earnings call. 
To sum up, the $1,085,000,000 midpoint of ex-TAC revenue and the $885 million midpoint of look-through ex-TAC cost implies $200 million of ongoing pro forma operating income, an improvement of 5% from prior year in roughly an 18.5% ex-TAC operating margin rate. That brings us to a discussion of the longer-term financial model we're targeting. Scott will provide more detail in a moment regarding our go-forward operating objectives, but the overarching financial theme is to streamline our current business in order to create investment capacity for future growth. Ultimately, we believe a reported ex-TAC operating margin rate of 20% is the proper target level. Let me take a few moments to walk you through that. 
First, at steady-state, the actions we've already announced should bring us to an ex-TAC margin range of 20% to 25%. Over the next few quarters, we'll be working to improve that range to a minimum 25% rate by driving both higher revenue and a more optimal cost structure. Ultimately, our goal was to create a business that's capable of growing revenue at or above market rates. By necessity, this will require us to improve our current operations, but more importantly, it will mean diversifying our revenue streams, both geographically and beyond the traditional scope of Search and Display. Our newly created commerce business unit is an early indication of the focus we'll bring to generating additional revenue sources. Commerce and transaction-related services are a natural opportunity to add value to our users while providing better monetization for Yahoo!. 
As we expand in our current marketplaces and simultaneously work to develop new business models, investment will be required. Preliminarily, we view our investment capacity as being roughly 5 points of ex-TAC operating margin. In order to deliver 20% on a reported basis for the company, we must, therefore, lift margins in our existing business to make room for the investments we'll make in the future. Given the dynamic nature of our industry, investment in the future is absolutely critical to longer-term success. As our business model evolves, we'll provide clarity on core margins, investments and returns on investment. The entire equation must work together to produce the kind of long-term revenue growth we now are capable of. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Scott."
91800,183587364,284753,"Yahoo! Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. And as Tim said, our model assumes this business can and will grow going forward. When I joined Yahoo! in February, I knew Yahoo!'s brands, assets and data provided a unique opportunity for this business. The foundation we have today is still",1731,"Thanks, Tim. And as Tim said, our model assumes this business can and will grow going forward. When I joined Yahoo! in February, I knew Yahoo!'s brands, assets and data provided a unique opportunity for this business. The foundation we have today is still extremely valuable. Any company that start with nearly 700 million users, relationships with thousands of advertisers, hundreds of millions of dollars in cash flow and long-standing strategic relationships and investments have a significant opportunity to create value. Among other things, we deliver content that matters to millions of users who visit us every day, and many of our offerings, especially in the U.S. had been #1 in their categories for many years. As you also know the challenges we face, even as we've maintained our leadership position and distanced ourselves from competitors in certain key media categories, we've lost share of time spent online in the recent years. While a strong pride of consumer engagement and ad spend continues to come online, Yahoo!'s engagement and revenue has not been rising with that tide. 
So one of my first actions whatever bit Yahoo! was to gather our leaders and ask them to change their thinking. I specifically asked what would it take to refine Yahoo!'s focus to get us back to doing our best for our users and advertisers, to grow this business and to move fast. We started with a clean slate and asked how would we build Yahoo! from the ground up if we were building it from scratch today. We took a  comprehensive look at everything, all of the media, communication, Search, social and commerce experiences that we offer our users. We also looked at the major platforms, systems and technologies we used to operate those properties for us and our partners, including the data center footprint and other corporate services required to make it all run, every part of the business. And here was the simple answer: Yahoo! has been doing way too much for too long and was only doing a few things really well. The power of Yahoo!'s distribution network gave us the ability to provide hundreds of offerings for users and advertisers all around the world. Each of our products and services may individually generate more engagement than most startups or even midsized companies in certain markets, but that does not mean that we should continue to do everything we currently do. In fact, dispersing the efforts of our best designers, developers, content producers and other dedicated Yahoo!s across every one of the markets and niches we serve initially put us in a great position, but that position isn't sustainable. I am certain we need to be clear going forward about what we won't do. In fact, with all the growth opportunities we have, one of the most important pieces of our strategy and that of any business in a fast-growing market is in regularly defining what we won't do. What we will do is get clear on our core business, dedicate some of our best people in the most resources there and put our customers first. 
So let's talk about how we do that. We've completed a detailed and diligent review in an accelerated time frame and the team working on this really delivered. We produced a comprehensive strategic framework that will change what we do and, most importantly, how we do it. During this process, the point I came back to over and over again is that we need to put our customers first in everything that we do. The restructuring we announced 2 weeks ago, the organization structure we announced last week and yesterday's leadership announcement for our newly formed commerce group are just the first steps. We are now cascading the rest of the plan through Yahoo!. 
Let me outline several essential elements of that plan. First, we're consolidating technology platforms and shutting down on transitioning roughly 50 properties that don't contribute meaningfully to engagement of revenue. Second, we're clearly defining our core media connections and commerce businesses, including News, Finance, Sports, Entertainment, Mail and a handful of others. Those properties that generate the majority of our engagement and revenue. Third, we're moving engineers into our commerce must to put them closer to our user and dedicated some of our best and brightest Yahoo!s to meaningful innovation in those core businesses. Fourth, we're accelerating the deployment of the platforms and technologies we built to make each of our properties more scalable, nimble and flexible, and therefore, less costly and time-consuming to run. Fifth, we're making better use of Yahoo!'s vast data to personalize user experiences and dramatically improve advertiser ROI. Sixth, we're refocusing our R&D on Owned and Operated properties and stopping development of a number of initiatives, including platforms for outside publishers, the theoretical science that were outside of our court. All of this puts us in a position to achieve the most important objective, which is to produce clear, measurable results for our advertisers, including genuine insights from our vast data so that they can feel, see real ROI, really understanding our advertisers' needs will position Yahoo! to better monetize all of our traffic globally. 
In addition to the 6 points I've outlined here, we've also identified execution issues that we are taking swift action to change. A key example is the complexity of Yahoo!'s development and delivery process. That is what it takes to get an idea from concept to launch. Yahoo! has built processes that were originally intended to help us scale, but they've come way too complex and has stifled innovation. We've made some strides here but not enough. Some of our processes continued to degrade the user experience, limit our ability to deliver for advertisers and frustrate Yahoo!'s who really want to produce for our customers. We simply must change that. 
The announcements we've made over the last several weeks represent the first steps in executing on our plans to get back to our core businesses, execute and move faster. We're putting in place a more focused organizational structure and decreasing the size of our footprint, including reusing our workforce. I don't take decisions to eliminate jobs lightly as we have thousands of hard-working and loyal people here at Yahoo!. But I also believe we have way too many people for the amount of output from this business. The streamlined structure and less bureaucracy will help Yahoo! get stuff done at the pace our customers and our industry require. As we've defined our core businesses and move to optimize our allocation of resources, we look closely at user engagement and market potential, as well as current revenue and margins. As Tim discussed a moment ago, our recent actions and our plan are fully aligned with a very clear target financial model for this business. We believe there may be some modest revenue implications from the actions we've taken recently, but the result will be higher margins and more flexibility to invest more aggressively in our core businesses and in adjacent opportunities over time. 
In addition to all the work on Yahoo!s core business that we've discussed with you today, we've been moving very quickly and deliberately on a number of other fronts as well. I'll touch briefly on 3. First, our board. After a thorough review of a broad range of highly qualified candidates by our nominating and corporate governance committee, our board has appointed 5 new members, all with impressive records of significant accomplishments at high levels of media, advertising, marketing, technology, the Internet and Finance. 
Second, on our intellectual property. After attempting to resolve the matter, we took action to protect our patented innovations and address Facebook's unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Yahoo!'s intellectual property is one of the foundations of our business and our future growth. Other leading companies licensed our patented technologies and Facebook must do the same or change the way it operates. 
Third, on our Asian assets, we can are continuing to pursue active discussions with Alibaba. We are currently exploring a simplified transaction structure which if executed would provide greater certainty of closing to monetize a portion of our Alibaba stake. While we also plan to continue exploring alternatives to unlock the value of our Yahoo! Japan stake for shareholders, any transaction has to be at a value that makes sense for Yahoo! and its shareholders. We currently have a valuation gap with respect to the Yahoo! Japan stake that we have not been able to bridge. Given that, we are focusing on our discussions with Alibaba and we are not in a position to provide further details for certainty on today's call. 
So to summarize, we have a clear near-term focus. We intend to win in our core and put our customers first. We will get that core business right and bring innovation and excitement back into Yahoo!. That's our top priority right now. Over time, we will earn the right to pursue new growth opportunities and we look forward to more discussion about those opportunities with you in future quarters. I am convinced that we don't need to reinvent who we are. We're one of the leading media and communications companies in the world. But I'm equally convinced we absolutely do need to reinvent the experiences our users have with the marquee properties that bring them to Yahoo! every day. We continually engage today's online users, Yahoo!'s experiences must always be fresh, highly personalized, enhanced with great video content and offer exceptional experiences on any screen. Our goal is to have the #1 properties in our core businesses in every way our users choose to interact with us, on the PC, through tablets, on their phones or whatever comes next. 
The Q1 progress I've shared with you should make clear that we intend to move fast. In our industry, unbelievable innovation happens at a lightning fast pace. We must get back to moving at that pace, and Q1 was just the beginning. Yahoo! must be nimble, responsive and act with a real sense of urgency. We have to think and to move like a growth company. Yahoo! moving forward will be centered around delivering for our customers. I am determined that our leadership team and organization will make that happen. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to you so we can answer any questions you have this afternoon."

Scott touched on that in terms of monetization in his script. Our sell-through rate, frankly was a little mixed, better in some properties, a little worse than we expected and others, so we need to keep working through that and do expect that to improve into second quarter. And then finally, another one of the big metrics that we talk about in terms of sales force effectiveness is the front page in the days sold on the front page, and that in first quarter is actually flat with fourth quarter, which is quite an accomplishment given the seasonal miss of 4Q. So flat with 4Q and well above 2 quarter and 3 quarter of last year. Finally, I guess the best indication of sales force progress almost 1 year into this transformation is we do see, as I noted in my script, Display revenue regaining growth year-over-year in the second quarter. So feel good about that. The second question you had was on RPS GAAP. So we're working hard with Microsoft, working hard on our own initiatives and Microsoft certainly working hard on the platform for our marketplace RPS. And it didn't make us much progress, frankly, as we wanted to or envisioned for first quarter, and that is concerning. But we're covered for another year here of the RPS guarantee and I still firmly believe we'll get there by the time that the RPS guarantee runs out.

On earnings and equity interest, obviously, 2 pieces to that, the wide RP for the YJ earnings and piece of obviously Bob was earnings, you'll all recall we actually report 1 quarter in arrears for both of those,'s so on the Alibaba side, big quarter, they've got operational momentum, very proud of and happy with the terrific job that the management team there is doing. So they had a great quarter, far ahead of where they were fourth quarter the prior year. So again, we report fourth quarter in our first quarter earnings It's a 1-quarter lag, so reporting their fourth quarter of 2011 and they have terrific operating momentum. On YJ, we saw some nice operating increases, but also if you recall, we had booked our share of an impairment of one of their investments first quarter last year. And the absence of that level of impairment this year obviously turns into more year-over-year growth. So you have both components, YJ that's doing well and Alibaba that hasn't really great operational momentum to it. On Interclick, I talked briefly in my prepared comments that we will have revenue contributions in second quarter sequentially, contributing to the growth sequentially from Interclick. That will continue to ramp throughout the year. we'll have some investments to grow along with it but I still view, as I think I said back on the January call, that 1Q, the first quarter that we have fully consolidated for Interclick, would be the low point and it would rise dramatically in both revenue and operating income increments to us. So I'm not going to lay out the numbers or give specific guidance for Interclick, but we continue to see that to ramp throughout the year. That's what our objective is."

And a lot of that work that, that team does has implications on RPS and it has implications on RPS in a number of different ways. But probably the most direct way is through this click-through rate that both Scott and I referenced in our prepared remarks. And that is, how do you design that page such that more people will click on it? And that's exactly the kind of improvement we saw. We have more people being attracted to those page search links and more people clicking through them. I don't want to short change Microsoft obviously. Their work on making sure that there's good coverage there and good models for PPC, price per click, is important as well and their relevancy of their algo et cetera, all very important.

Then on premium pricing, I did talk about this in my script and in one of these Q&As. And the answer is, the yield was up strongly, double-digit, in fact, on premium so that's 1 of the places I cited is actually some positive news.

We've been moving very quickly on a number of initiatives since we last spoke. During that time, I've become more convinced than ever of the value of our assets, the potential of this business and what we can do to make the most of Yahoo!'s huge market opportunity. I'll have a lot to share on that, but we'll start today with a discussion of our first quarter results. And we'll talk about what we're doing to refocus Yahoo on its core business and our renewed focus on our customers, the users and advertisers that are vital to Yahoo!'s future. 
First, on Q1, we're pleased that revenue and profits were higher than we expected, costs were lower than expected and we beat consensus across the board. And we're encouraged that revenue grew year-over-year for the first time since the third quarter of 2008. But I want to be very clear. I'm not satisfied with the pace of top line growth and I won't be satisfied until we're growing at least in line with the market. 
Taking a brief look at our performance in Search and Display, Search came in ahead of our expectations, driven by higher RPS. The majority of our Q1 gains were driven by changes Yahoo! made to the Search experience that drove higher click-through on our Search ads. While Microsoft has continued to enhance its algo in paid search technology, the Search Alliance is not yet delivering what we expected. I'm personally working with Microsoft to ensure the alliance does deliver going forward and meets our high expectations for user experience, advertiser ROI and revenue for Yahoo!. 
Turning to Display, revenue was down versus last year and a bit lower than our expectations. We've got a few wins on engagement Display like the growing engagement on Yahoo! News, driven by our partnership with ABC News, and by Yahoo!'s social bar. We also see some positive signs on monetization, with the stabilization of our U.S. sales force and renewed partnerships with some important advertisers. But let me be very clear that our Display business is no way close to where it needs to be in any of our 3 regions. Hundreds of millions of people engage on Yahoo!'s homepage, Mail and other marquee media properties, and we must improve monetization and achieve higher returns from that engagement. 
Looking at overall growth by region, Americas and APAC drove the top line in Q1, up 2% and 5%, respectively. Our smallest region, EMEA, felt the impact of macro dislocations in the region, with revenue down 9% year-over-year. That came in much lower than we expected, so overall operating income was above the range we gave you in January. EPS were up 38% year-over-year due mostly to improvements and our equity interest line. I have more to share about the actions we took in Q1 and our future plans, but first I'd like Tim to provide more detail on our Q1 results, our Q2 guidance, as well as the financial framework we're using to manage the business going forward.

As Scott mentioned a few moments ago, revenue ex-TAC of $1,077,000,000 finished in the top half of our guidance range and, more importantly, grew on a year-over-year basis for the first time since third quarter 2008. That's a long way from the growth we aspire to, but it's an important milestone nonetheless. Operating income landed at $169 million, exceeding the top end of our guidance range by a combination of revenue and cost favorability. With respect to operating margin rate, first quarter was nearly 16% on an ex-TAC basis, up 3.5 points from guidance midpoint. Earnings per diluted share increased by 38% from prior year on improvements in our equity interest line. 
In cash flow, we're similarly strong in the first quarter with cash flow from operating activities up 45% from 2011 and free cash flow up more than 245% as we continue to optimize capital spending. 
Finally, we recently announced actions to further streamline our cost structure with steady state annual savings of roughly $375 million. More on the financial model implications of that action in just a few minutes. 
Turning to first quarter ex-TAC revenue results, our 1% improvement versus prior year was driven by 8% growth in Search, 1% growth in our other revenue category and a 4% decline in Display. Starting with Search, query volume generated by our properties was up slightly in the Americas region and roughly flat globally. Revenue per search, therefore, drove the bulk of the 8% ex-TAC revenue improvement compared to last year. Breaking down the RPS strength, Americas click-through rates improved by high single digits, implying that users are finding more relevant results and clicking on them more often. At the same time, we're absorbing some weakness in the Search marketplace itself that's being offset by the Search Alliance RPS guarantee. This quarter, we're not able to report significant progress by Microsoft on their effort to close the gap in marketplace RPS, but we are actively working with them to improve those results, as well as to achieve more consistent progress in closing the RPS gap in the future. 
Moving to Display, an ex-TAC revenue decline of 4% year-over-year obviously isn't acceptable. By geography, Americas declined 5%, EMEA declined 4% and APAC grew 6%. The Americas' turnaround effort remains our primary focus, so let me provide a bit more detail there. First, audience metrics continue to grow with media property page views improving by 10% year-over-year. However, total graphical supply including Mail was down roughly 10% from a year ago and guaranteed placement sell-through rates remained well below first quarter 2011 levels. On a more positive note, we did generate strong yield improvements in the quarter, especially in guaranteed placements, thereby, partially offsetting the impact of supply in sell-through. Rounding out Display, our recent acquisition of Interclick performed in line with expectations, generating roughly $10 million incremental revenue. That's my first quarter overview for today. 
Now let's turn to second quarter guidance. Given the uncertainties that typically accompany both a large reduction in force and a business unit reorganization, our guidance ranges this quarter will be wider than those we usually provide. In short, this quarter has more potential for variability than other quarters. The most effective way to deal with additional variability is to provide as much transparency as we can with regard to our underlying dynamics. 
First, on revenue ex-TAC, we expect a range of $1,030,000,000 to $1,140,000,000 or $1,085,000,000 midpoint of this range equates to roughly 1% growth versus 2011. By revenue category on a year-over-year basis, we expect Search to be flat to up, other to be down slightly and Display to return to mid-single digits growth. Early bookings indications in Display are encouraging for consumer packaged goods, automotive and Finance. We also expect sequential revenue contributions from our Interclick acquisition and improvements in guaranteed placement sell-through rates. 
Moving to ex-TAC costs, it will take about a year to reach substantially all of the $375 million steady state cost savings associated with the reduction in force we recently announced. During the interim period, we'll incur transition-related costs for works such as property rationalization, data center consolidation, improved cloud infrastructure utilization and the elimination or rightsourcing of support functions. At the end of the transition period, those costs will obviously go away completely. 
In order to facilitate tracking and communication of our progress towards steady state, we'll provide cost guidance and reporting throughout this transition period in 3 pieces. Those are: one, ongoing costs; two, transition-related expenses; and three, restructuring charges. 
Let me take a moment to ensure each of these 3 pieces is clear. The first of the 3 is ongoing or look-through costs. Those are the costs involved in running our business on a go-forward basis. The second of the 3 is transition-related expense. Now as I noted just a moment ago, we expect those costs will be reduced to 0 by roughly mid-2013. And finally, we'll have restructuring charges for severance, facilities' exits and asset write-downs. By nature, these costs will vary from quarter-to-quarter with some quarters, potentially like this present quarter, containing a sizable charge and others with little or no charge at all. Providing this transparency should facilitate everyone's ability to clearly track the operational progress of the business by focusing on ex-TAC revenue and ongoing costs. Resulting pro forma ongoing operating income and ex-TAC operating margin rate are the best indication of our longer-term financial model. However, it's worth emphasizing that we will continue to provide and explain our full GAAP picture of cost and profits, including all transitional costs and restructuring charges in addition to the look-through of the core business I just described. 
With that construct in mind, our second quarter ex-TAC cost guidance is as follows. We expect costs on a look-through or ongoing basis to be $875 million to $895 million. This range includes normal seasonal increases related to our annual wage and stock-based comp cycles, as well as marketing costs related to upcoming events such as the Olympics. Our transition-related costs are expected to be $40 million to $50 million. The majority of this cost is related to employees who are impacted by the April 4 actions, but who will continue employment through a set date over the next year. These employees, in other words, are in roles that will require transition work in order to reach steady state. 
Finally, with respect to restructuring charges, while we expect to incur roughly $135 million in total severance related to our recent reduction in force, we'll undoubtedly add to that charge as a result of the associated efforts to streamline, rationalize and simplify our offerings and infrastructure. It's too early to put a range on the all-in charge and similarly too early to quantify it for this quarter. So we're going to guide on an ex-restructuring basis, but we'll plan to discuss it during our July earnings call. 
To sum up, the $1,085,000,000 midpoint of ex-TAC revenue and the $885 million midpoint of look-through ex-TAC cost implies $200 million of ongoing pro forma operating income, an improvement of 5% from prior year, and roughly an 18.5% ex-TAC operating margin rate. 
That brings us to a discussion of the longer-term financial model we're targeting. Scott will provide more detail in a moment regarding our go-forward operating objectives, but the overarching financial theme is to streamline our current business in order to create investment capacity for future growth. Ultimately, we believe a reported ex-TAC operating margin rate of 20% is the proper target level. Let me take a few moments to walk you through that. 
First, at steady state, the actions we've already announced should bring us to an ex-TAC margin range of 20% to 25%. Over the next few quarters, we'll be working to improve that range to a minimum 25% rate by driving both higher revenue and a more optimal cost structure. Ultimately, our goal was to create a business that's capable of growing revenue at or above market rates. By necessity, this will require us to improve our current operations, but more importantly, it will mean diversifying our revenue streams, both geographically and beyond the traditional scope of Search and Display. Our newly created commerce business unit is an early indication of the focus we'll bring to generating additional revenue sources. Commerce and transaction-related services are a natural opportunity to add value to our users while providing better monetization for Yahoo!. 
As we expand in our current marketplaces and simultaneously work to develop new business models, investment will be required. Preliminarily, we view our investment capacity as being roughly 5 points of ex-TAC operating margin. In order to deliver 20% on a reported basis for the company, we must, therefore, lift margins in our existing business to make room for the investments we'll make in the future. Given the dynamic nature of our industry, investment in the future is absolutely critical to longer-term success. As our business model evolves, we'll provide clarity on core margins, investments and returns on investment. The entire equation must work together to produce the kind of long-term revenue growth we know we're capable of. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Scott."
91800,183587364,284805,"Yahoo! Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. And as Tim said, our model assumes this business can and will grow going forward. When I joined Yahoo! in February, I knew Yahoo!'s brands, assets and data provided a unique opportunity for this business. The foundation we have today is still",1733,"Thanks, Tim. And as Tim said, our model assumes this business can and will grow going forward. When I joined Yahoo! in February, I knew Yahoo!'s brands, assets and data provided a unique opportunity for this business. The foundation we have today is still extremely valuable. Any company that starts with nearly 700 million users, relationships with thousands of advertisers, hundreds of millions of dollars in cash flow and long-standing strategic relationships and investments has a significant opportunity to create value. Among other things, we deliver content that matters to millions of users who visit us every day, and many of our offerings, especially in the U.S., have been #1 in their categories for many years. As you also know the challenges we face, even as we've maintained our leadership position and distanced ourselves from competitors in certain key media categories, we've lost share of time spent online in the recent years. Below a strong tide of consumer engagement and ad spend continues to come online, Yahoo!'s engagement and revenue has not been rising with that tide. 
So one of my first actions when I arrived at Yahoo! was to gather our leaders and ask them to change their thinking. I specifically asked what would it take to refine Yahoo!'s focus to get us back to doing our best for our users and advertisers, to grow this business and to move fast. We started with a clean slate and asked how would we build Yahoo! from the ground up if we were building it from scratch today. We took a comprehensive look at everything, all of the media, communication, Search, social and commerce experiences that we offer our users. We also looked at the major platforms, systems and technologies we use to operate those properties for us and our partners, including the data center footprint and other corporate services required to make it all run, every part of the business. And here was the simple answer: Yahoo! had been doing way too much for too long and was only doing a few things really well. The power of Yahoo!'s distribution network gave us the ability to provide hundreds of offerings for users and advertisers all around the world. Each of our products and services may individually generate more engagement than most startups or even midsized companies in certain markets, but that does not mean that we should continue to do everything we currently do. In fact, dispersing the efforts of our best designers, developers, content producers and other dedicated Yahoo!s across every one of the markets and niches we serve initially put us in a great position, but that position isn't sustainable. I'm certain we need to be clearer going forward about what we won't do. In fact, with all the growth opportunities we have, one of the most important pieces of our strategy and that of any business in a fast-growing market isn't regularly defining what we won't do. What we will do is get clear on our core business, dedicate some of our best people in the most resources there and put our customers first. 
So let's talk about how we do that. We've completed the detail and diligent review in an accelerated time frame and the team working on this really delivered. We produced a comprehensive strategic framework that will change what we do and, most importantly, how we do it. During this process, the point I came back to over and over again is that we need to put our customers first in everything that we do. The restructuring we announced 2 weeks ago, the organization structure we announced last week and yesterday's leadership announcement for our newly formed commerce group are just the first steps. We are now cascading the rest of the plan through Yahoo!. 
Let me outline several essential elements of that plan. First, we're consolidating technology platforms and shutting down on transitioning roughly 50 properties that don't contribute meaningfully to engagement of revenue. Second, we're clearly defining our core media connections and commerce businesses, including News, Finance, Sports, Entertainment, Mail and a handful of others. Those properties that generate the majority of our engagement and revenue. Third, we're moving engineers into our commerce businesses to put them closer to our user and dedicating some of our best and brightest Yahoo!s to meaningful innovation in those core businesses. Fourth, we're accelerating the deployment of the platforms and technologies we've built to make each of our properties more scalable, nimble and flexible, and therefore, less costly and time consuming to run. Fifth, we're making better use of Yahoo!'s vast data to personalize user experiences and dramatically improve advertiser ROI. Sixth, we're refocusing our R&D on Owned and Operated properties and stopping development of a number of initiatives, including platforms for outside publishers and theoretical science that were outside of our core. All of this puts us in a position to achieve the most important objective, which is to produce clear, measurable results for our advertisers, including genuine insights from our vast data so that they can feel -- see real ROI. Really understanding our advertisers' needs will position Yahoo! to better monetize all of our traffic globally. 
In addition to the 6 points I've outlined here, we've also identified execution issues that we are taking swift action to change. A key example is the complexity of Yahoo!'s development and delivery process. That is what it takes to get an idea from concept to launch. Yahoo! has built processes that were originally intended to help us scale, but they've become way too complex and has stifled innovation. We've made some strides here, but not enough. Some of our processes continued to degrade the user experience, limit our ability to deliver for advertisers and frustrate Yahoo!s who really want to produce for our customers. We simply must change that. 
The announcements we've made over the last several weeks represent the first steps in executing on our plans to get back to our core businesses, execute and move faster. We're putting in place a more focused organizational structure and decreasing the size of our footprint, including reducing our workforce. I don't take decisions to eliminate jobs lightly as we have thousands of hard working and loyal people here at Yahoo!. But I also believe we have way too many people for the amount of output from this business. A streamlined structure and less bureaucracy will help Yahoo! get stuff done at the pace our customers and our industry require. As we've defined our core businesses and move to optimize our allocation of resources, we look closely at user engagement and market potential, as well as current revenue and margins. As Tim discussed a moment ago, our recent actions and our plan are fully aligned with a very clear target financial model for this business. We believe there may be some modest revenue implications from the actions we've taken recently, but the result will be higher margins and more flexibility to invest more aggressively in our core businesses and in adjacent opportunities over time. 
In addition to all the work on Yahoo!s core business that we've discussed with you today, we've been moving very quickly and deliberately on a number of other fronts as well. I'll touch briefly on 3. First, our board. After a thorough review of a broad range of highly qualified candidates by our nominating and corporate governance committee, our board has appointed 5 new members, all with impressive records of significant accomplishments at high levels of media, advertising, marketing, technology, the Internet and finance. 
Second, on our intellectual property. After attempting to resolve the matter, we took action to protect our patented innovations and addressed Facebook's unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Yahoo!'s intellectual property is one of the foundations of our business and our future growth. Other leading companies licensed our patented technologies and Facebook must do the same or change the way it operates. 
Third, on our Asian assets, we are continuing to pursue active discussions with Alibaba. We are currently exploring a simplified transaction structure which, if executed, would provide greater certainty of closing to monetize a portion of our Alibaba stake. While we also plan to continue exploring alternatives to unlock the value of our Yahoo! Japan stake for shareholders, any transaction has to be at a value that makes sense for Yahoo! and its shareholders. We currently have a valuation gap with respect to the Yahoo! Japan stake that we have not been able to bridge. Given that, we are focusing on our discussions with Alibaba and we are not in a position to provide further details or certainty on today's call. 
So to summarize, we have a clear near-term focus. We intend to win in our core and put our customers first. We will get that core business right and bring innovation and excitement back into Yahoo!. That's our top priority right now. Over time, we will earn the right to pursue new growth opportunities and we look forward to more discussion about those opportunities with you in future quarters. I am convinced that we don't need to reinvent who we are. We're one of the leading media and communications companies in the world. But I'm equally convinced we absolutely do need to reinvent the experiences our users have with the marquee properties that bring them to Yahoo! every day. We continually engage today's online users. Yahoo!'s experiences must always be fresh, highly personalized, enhanced with great video content and offer exceptional experiences on any screen. Our goal is to have the #1 properties in our core businesses in every way our users choose to interact with us, on the PC, through tablets, on their phones or whatever comes next. 
The Q1 progress I've shared with you should make clear that we intend to move fast. In our industry, unbelievable innovation happens at a lightning fast pace. We must get back to moving at that pace, and Q1 was just the beginning. Yahoo! must be nimble, responsive and act with a real sense of urgency. We have to think and to move like a growth company. Yahoo! moving forward will be centered around delivering for our customers. I am determined that our leadership team and organization will make that happen. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to you so we can answer any questions you have this afternoon."

As I said in my script, yield, especially in the guaranteed side of the business, was up very strong double digits versus prior year, so that was a very good indication, obviously one of the objectives for our sales force. Scott touched on that in terms of monetization in his script. Sell-through rate, frankly, was a little mixed, better in some properties, a little worse than we'd expected and others, so we need to keep working through that and do expect that to improve into second quarter. And then finally, another one of the big metrics that we talk about in terms of sales force effectiveness is the front page and the days sold on the front page. And that, in first quarter, is actually flat with fourth quarter, which is quite an accomplishment given the seasonalness of 4Q. So flat with 4Q and well above 2Q and 3Q of last year. Finally, I guess the best indication of sales force progress almost one year into this transformation is we do see, as I noted in my script, Display revenue regaining growth year-over-year in the second quarter. So feel good about that. The second question you had was on RPS gap. So we're working hard with Microsoft, working hard on our own initiatives and Microsoft certainly working hard on the platform for our marketplace RPS. And it didn't make as much progress, frankly, as we wanted to or envisioned for first quarter, and that is concerning. But we're covered for another year here of the RPS guarantee, and I still firmly believe we'll get there by the time that the RPS guarantee runs out. So it's an important thing for both of us, and they're certainly working hard and we're helping right along with them."

And at the meeting, not all of our customers of course, but a very large number in the first 90 days. One of the things that I didn't mention in the script, but I am certain of, is that we just have to be better business partners. Easy to say, difficult to do. We need to understand their business, what they're trying to accomplish and how best to use all of our properties, all of the audience we have, all of our capabilities to give them the best return on their advertising spend. And we've got a long way, frankly, to go on that, to the point where we're viewed as a strategic partner and integral to their businesses. But we're not going to stop until we've gotten to that point, and we see the results of that as growing at or above the market rate. And on the RPS guarantee, Tim mentioned it. I just want to echo his final thought and comment which was, Search is a really important part of our business and obviously an important business for Microsoft. And we will invest and have been investing a lot of time to make sure that the relationship we have is strong and that we have really forward-looking ways of doing business together that make sense for both of these businesses.

On earnings and equity interest, obviously, 2 pieces to that, the wide RP so the YJ earnings and RPs of Alibaba's earnings. You'll all recall that we actually report one quarter in arrears for both of those. So on the Alibaba side, big quarter, they've got operational momentum, very proud of it and happy with the terrific job that the management team there is doing. So they had a great quarter, far ahead of where they were fourth quarter the prior year. So again, we report fourth quarter in our first quarter earnings. It's a one-quarter lag, so reporting their fourth quarter of 2011 and they have a terrific operating momentum. On YJ, we saw some nice operating increases, but also if you recall, we had booked our share of an impairment of one of their investments first quarter last year. And the absence of that level of impairment this year, obviously, turns into more year-over-year growth. So you have both components, YJ that's doing well and Alibaba that has some really great operational momentum to it. On Interclick, I had talked briefly in my prepared comments that we will have revenue contributions in second quarter sequentially, contributing to the growth sequentially from Interclick. That will continue to ramp throughout the year. We'll have some investments to go along with it, but I still view, as I think I have said back on the January call, that 1Q, the first quarter that we have fully consolidated for Interclick would be the low point and it would rise dramatically in both revenue and operating income increments to us. So I'm not going to lay out the numbers. It doesn't make sense to give specific guidance for Interclick, but we can start to see that to ramp throughout the year. That's what our objective is."

And a lot of that work that, that team does has implications on RPS and it has implications on RPS in a number of different ways. But probably, the most direct way is through this click-through rate that both Scott and I referenced in our prepared remarks. And that is, how do you design that page such that more people will click on it, and that's exactly the kind of improvement we saw. We have more people being attracted to those page search links and more people clicking through them. I don't want to shortchange Microsoft obviously. Their work on making sure that there's good coverage there and a good model for PPC, price-per-click, is important as well and the relevancy of their algo, et cetera, all very important. So we really are working very much together, but I do want to make sure we give credit to the team here that has done a very nice job in starting to deliver on their charter, which is to improve the front-end experience which you'd expect would translate into things like better click-through. Then on premium pricing, I did talk about this in my script and in one of these Q&As. And the answer is, the yield was up strongly, double digit, in fact, on premium. So that's one of the places I've cited as actually some positive news. Supply and sell-through were down a little bit, but we had at least a partial offset in better yield, better CPMs, and was on the premium or guaranteed side. So a nice piece of news there."

We've been moving very quickly on a number of initiatives since we last spoke. During that time, I've become more convinced than ever of the value of our assets, the potential of this business and what we can do to make the most of Yahoo!'s huge market opportunity. I'll have a lot to share on that, but we'll start today with a discussion of our first quarter results. Then we'll talk about what we're doing to refocus Yahoo! on its core business and our renewed focus on our customers, the users and advertisers that are vital to Yahoo!'s future. 
First, on Q1, we're pleased that revenue and profits were higher than we expected, costs were lower than expected and we beat consensus across the board. And we're encouraged that revenue grew year-over-year for the first time since the third quarter of 2008. But I want to be very clear. I'm not satisfied with the pace of top line growth and I won't be satisfied until we're growing at least in line with the market. 
Taking a brief look at our performance in Search and Display, Search came in ahead of our expectations, driven by higher RPS. The majority of our Q1 gains were driven by changes Yahoo! made to the Search experience that drove higher click-through on our Search ads. While Microsoft has continued to enhance its algo in paid search technology, the Search Alliance is not yet delivering what we expected. I'm personally working with Microsoft to ensure the alliance does deliver going forward and meets our high expectations for user experience, advertiser ROI and revenue for Yahoo!. 
Turning to Display, revenue was down versus last year and a bit lower than our expectations. We've got a few wins on engagement Display, like the growing engagement on Yahoo! News, driven by our partnership with ABC News, and by Yahoo!'s social bar. We also see some positive signs on monetization, with the stabilization of our U.S. sales force and renewed partnerships with some important advertisers. But let me be very clear that our Display business is no way close to where it needs to be in any of our 3 regions. Hundreds of millions of people engage on Yahoo!'s homepage, Mail and other marquee media properties, and we must improve monetization and achieve higher returns from that engagement. 
Looking at overall growth by region, Americas and APAC drove the top line in Q1, up 2% and 5%, respectively. Our smallest region, EMEA, felt the impact of macro dislocations in the region, with revenue down 9% year-over-year. Costs [ph] came in much lower than we expected, so overall operating income was above the range we gave you in January. EPS were up 38% year-over-year due mostly to improvements and our equity interest line. I have more to share about the actions we took in Q1 and our future plans, but first I'd like Tim to provide more detail on our Q1 results, our Q2 guidance, as well as the financial framework we're using to manage the business going forward.

91800,183587364,284844,"Yahoo! Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter 2012 results, set up our second quarter guidance and update our longer-term financial model. Let's start with our headlines for first quarter. As Scott mentioned a few moments",1564,"Thanks, Scott. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter 2012 results, set up our second quarter guidance and update our longer-term financial model. 
Let's start with our headlines for first quarter. As Scott mentioned a few moments ago, revenue ex-TAC of $1,077,000,000 finished in the top half of our guidance range and, more importantly, grew on a year-over-year basis for the first time since third quarter 2008. That's a long way from the growth we aspire to, but it's an important milestone nonetheless. Operating income landed at $169 million, exceeding the top end of our guidance range by a combination of revenue and cost favorability. With respect to operating margin rate, first quarter was nearly 16% on an ex-TAC basis, up 3.5 points from guidance midpoint. Earnings per diluted share increased by 38% from prior year on improvements in our equity interest line. 
In cash flow, we're similarly strong in the first quarter with cash flow from operating activities up 45% from 2011 and free cash flow up more than 245% as we continue to optimize capital spending. 
Finally, we recently announced actions to further streamline our cost structure with steady state annual savings of roughly $375 million. More on the financial model implications of that action in just a few minutes. 
Turning to first quarter ex-TAC revenue results, our 1% improvement versus prior year was driven by 8% growth in Search, 1% growth in our other revenue category and a 4% decline in Display. Starting with Search, query volume generated by our properties was up slightly in the Americas region and roughly flat globally. Revenue per search, therefore, drove the bulk of the 8% ex-TAC revenue improvement compared to last year. Breaking down the RPS strength, Americas click-through rates improved by high single digits, implying that users are finding more relevant results and clicking on them more often. At the same time, we're absorbing some weakness in the Search marketplace itself that's being offset by the Search Alliance RPS guarantee. This quarter, we're not able to report significant progress by Microsoft on their effort to close the gap in marketplace RPS, but we are actively working with them to improve those results, as well as to achieve more consistent progress in closing the RPS gap in the future. 
Moving to Display, an ex-TAC revenue decline of 4% year-over-year obviously isn't acceptable. By geography, Americas declined 5%, EMEA declined 4% and APAC grew 6%. The Americas' turnaround effort remains our primary focus, so let me provide a bit more detail there. First, audience metrics continue to grow with media property page views improving by 10% year-over-year. However, total graphical supply including Mail was down roughly 10% from a year ago and guaranteed placement sell-through rates remained well below first quarter 2011 levels. On a more positive note, we did generate strong yield improvements in the quarter, especially in guaranteed placements, thereby, partially offsetting the impact of supply in sell-through. Rounding out Display, our recent acquisition of Interclick performed in line with expectations, generating roughly $10 million incremental revenue. That's my first quarter overview for today. 
Now let's turn to second quarter guidance. Given the uncertainties that typically accompany both a large reduction in force and a business unit reorganization, our guidance ranges this quarter will be wider than those we usually provide. In short, this quarter has more potential for variability than other quarters. The most effective way to deal with additional variability is to provide as much transparency as we can with regard to our underlying dynamics. 
First, on revenue ex-TAC, we expect a range of $1,030,000,000 to $1,140,000,000 or $1,085,000,000 midpoint of this range equates to roughly 1% growth versus 2011. By revenue category on a year-over-year basis, we expect Search to be flat to up, other to be down slightly and Display to return to mid-single digits growth. Early bookings indications in Display are encouraging for consumer packaged goods, automotive and Finance. We also expect sequential revenue contributions from our Interclick acquisition and improvements in guaranteed placement sell-through rates. 
Moving to ex-TAC costs, it will take about a year to reach substantially all of the $375 million steady state cost savings associated with the reduction in force we recently announced. During the interim period, we'll incur transition-related costs for works such as property rationalization, data center consolidation, improved cloud infrastructure utilization and the elimination or right sourcing of support functions. At the end of the transition period, those costs will obviously go away completely. 
In order to facilitate tracking and communication of our progress towards steady state, we'll provide cost guidance and reporting throughout this transition period in 3 pieces. Those are: one, ongoing costs; two, transition-related expenses; and three, restructuring charges. 
Let me take a moment to ensure each of these 3 pieces is clear. The first of the 3 is ongoing or look-through costs. Those are the costs involved in running our business on a go-forward basis. The second of the 3 is transition-related expense. Now as I noted just a moment ago, we expect those costs will be reduced to 0 by roughly mid-2013. And finally, we'll have restructuring charges for severance, facilities' exits and asset write-downs. By nature, these costs will vary from quarter-to-quarter with some quarters, potentially like this present quarter, containing a sizable charge and others with little or no charge at all. Providing this transparency should facilitate everyone's ability to clearly track the operational progress of the business by focusing on ex-TAC revenue and ongoing costs. Resulting pro forma ongoing operating income and ex-TAC operating margin rate are the best indication of our longer-term financial model. However, it's worth emphasizing that we will continue to provide and explain our full GAAP picture of cost and profits, including all transitional costs and restructuring charges in addition to the look-through of the core business I just described. 
With that construct in mind, our second quarter ex-TAC cost guidance is as follows. We expect costs on a look-through or ongoing basis to be $875 million to $895 million. This range includes normal seasonal increases related to our annual wage and stock-based comp cycles, as well as marketing costs related to upcoming events such as the Olympics. Our transition-related costs are expected to be $40 million to $50 million. The majority of this cost is related to employees who are impacted by the April 4 actions, but who will continue employment through a set date over the next year. These employees, in other words, are in roles that will require transition work in order to reach steady state. 
Finally, with respect to restructuring charges, while we expect to incur roughly $135 million in total severance related to our recent reduction in force, we'll undoubtedly add to that charge as a result of the associated efforts to streamline, rationalize and simplify our offerings and infrastructure. It's too early to put a range on the all-in charge and similarly too early to quantify it for this quarter. So we're going to guide on an ex-restructuring basis, but we'll plan to discuss it during our July earnings call. 
To sum up, the $1,085,000,000 midpoint of ex-TAC revenue and the $885 million midpoint of look-through ex-TAC cost implies $200 million of ongoing pro forma operating income, an improvement of 5% from prior year, and roughly an 18.5% ex-TAC operating margin rate. 
That brings us to a discussion of the longer-term financial model we're targeting. Scott will provide more detail in a moment regarding our go-forward operating objectives, but the overarching financial theme is to streamline our current business in order to create investment capacity for future growth. Ultimately, we believe a reported ex-TAC operating margin rate of 20% is the proper target level. Let me take a few moments to walk you through that. 
First, at steady state, the actions we've already announced should bring us to an ex-TAC margin range of 20% to 25%. Over the next few quarters, we'll be working to improve that range to a minimum 25% rate by driving both higher revenue and a more optimal cost structure. Ultimately, our goal was to create a business that's capable of growing revenue at or above market rates. By necessity, this will require us to improve our current operations, but more importantly, it will mean diversifying our revenue streams, both geographically and beyond the traditional scope of Search and Display. Our newly created commerce business unit is an early indication of the focus we'll bring to generating additional revenue sources. Commerce and transaction-related services are a natural opportunity to add value to our users while providing better monetization for Yahoo!. 
As we expand in our current marketplaces and simultaneously work to develop new business models, investment will be required. Preliminarily, we view our investment capacity as being roughly 5 points of ex-TAC operating margin. In order to deliver 20% on a reported basis for the company, we must, therefore, lift margins in our existing business to make room for the investments we'll make in the future. Given the dynamic nature of our industry, investment in the future is absolutely critical to longer-term success. As our business model evolves, we'll provide clarity on core margins, investments and returns on investment. The entire equation must work together to produce the kind of long-term revenue growth we know we're capable of. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Scott."
91800,183587364,284844,"Yahoo! Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. And as Tim said, our model assumes this business can and will grow going forward. When I joined Yahoo! in February, I knew Yahoo!'s brands, assets and data provided a unique opportunity for this business. The foundation we have today is still",1733,"Thanks, Tim. And as Tim said, our model assumes this business can and will grow going forward. When I joined Yahoo! in February, I knew Yahoo!'s brands, assets and data provided a unique opportunity for this business. The foundation we have today is still extremely valuable. Any company that starts with nearly 700 million users, relationships with thousands of advertisers, hundreds of millions of dollars in cash flow and long-standing strategic relationships and investments has a significant opportunity to create value. Among other things, we deliver content that matters to millions of users who visit us every day, and many of our offerings, especially in the U.S., have been #1 in their categories for many years. As you also know the challenges we face, even as we've maintained our leadership position and distanced ourselves from competitors in certain key media categories, we've lost share of time spent online in the recent years. Below a strong tide of consumer engagement and ad spend continues to come online, Yahoo!'s engagement and revenue has not been rising with that tide. 
So one of my first actions when I arrived at Yahoo! was to gather our leaders and ask them to change their thinking. I specifically asked what would it take to refine Yahoo!'s focus to get us back to doing our best for our users and advertisers, to grow this business and to move fast. We started with a clean slate and asked: How would we build Yahoo! from the ground up if we were building it from scratch today? We took a comprehensive look at everything, all of the media, communication, Search, social and commerce experiences that we offer our users. We also looked at the major platforms, systems and technologies we use to operate those properties for us and our partners, including the data center footprint and other corporate services required to make it all run, every part of the business. And here was the simple answer: Yahoo! had been doing way too much for too long and was only doing a few things really well. The power of Yahoo!'s distribution network gave us the ability to provide hundreds of offerings for users and advertisers all around the world. Each of our products and services may individually generate more engagement than most startups or even midsized companies in certain markets, but that does not mean that we should continue to do everything we currently do. In fact, dispersing the efforts of our best designers, developers, content producers and other dedicated Yahoo!s across every one of the markets and niches we serve initially put us in a great position, but that position isn't sustainable. I'm certain we need to be clearer going forward about what we won't do. In fact, with all the growth opportunities we have, one of the most important pieces of our strategy and that of any business in a fast-growing market isn't regularly defining what we won't do. What we will do is get clear on our core business, dedicate some of our best people in the most resources there and put our customers first. 
So let's talk about how we do that. We've completed the detail and diligent review in an accelerated time frame and the team working on this really delivered. We produced a comprehensive strategic framework that will change what we do and, most importantly, how we do it. During this process, the point I came back to over and over again is that we need to put our customers first in everything that we do. The restructuring we announced 2 weeks ago, the organization structure we announced last week and yesterday's leadership announcement for our newly formed commerce group are just the first steps. We are now cascading the rest of the plan through Yahoo!. 
Let me outline several essential elements of that plan. First, we're consolidating technology platforms and shutting down on transitioning roughly 50 properties that don't contribute meaningfully to engagement of revenue. Second, we're clearly defining our core media connections and commerce businesses, including News, Finance, Sports, Entertainment, Mail and a handful of others. Those properties that generate the majority of our engagement and revenue. Third, we're moving engineers into our commerce businesses to put them closer to our user and dedicating some of our best and brightest Yahoo!s to meaningful innovation in those core businesses. Fourth, we're accelerating the deployment of the platforms and technologies we've built to make each of our properties more scalable, nimble and flexible, and therefore, less costly and time consuming to run. Fifth, we're making better use of Yahoo!'s vast data to personalize user experiences and dramatically improve advertiser ROI. Sixth, we're refocusing our R&D on Owned and Operated properties and stopping development of a number of initiatives, including platforms for outside publishers and theoretical science that were outside of our core. All of this puts us in a position to achieve the most important objective, which is to produce clear, measurable results for our advertisers, including genuine insights from our vast data so that they can feel -- see real ROI. Really understanding our advertisers' needs will position Yahoo! to better monetize all of our traffic globally. 
In addition to the 6 points I've outlined here, we've also identified execution issues that we are taking swift action to change. A key example is the complexity of Yahoo!'s development and delivery process. That is what it takes to get an idea from concept to launch. Yahoo! has built processes that were originally intended to help us scale, but they've become way too complex and has stifled innovation. We've made some strides here, but not enough. Some of our processes continued to degrade the user experience, limit our ability to deliver for advertisers and frustrate Yahoo!s who really want to produce for our customers. We simply must change that. 
The announcements we've made over the last several weeks represent the first steps in executing on our plans to get back to our core businesses, execute and move faster. We're putting in place a more focused organizational structure and decreasing the size of our footprint, including reducing our workforce. I don't take decisions to eliminate jobs lightly as we have thousands of hard working and loyal people here at Yahoo!. But I also believe we have way too many people for the amount of output from this business. A streamlined structure and less bureaucracy will help Yahoo! get stuff done at the pace our customers and our industry require. 
As we've defined our core businesses and move to optimize our allocation of resources, we look closely at user engagement and market potential, as well as current revenue and margins. As Tim discussed a moment ago, our recent actions and our plan are fully aligned with a very clear target financial model for this business. We believe there may be some modest revenue implications from the actions we've taken recently, but the result will be higher margins and more flexibility to invest more aggressively in our core businesses and in adjacent opportunities over time. 
In addition to all the work on Yahoo!s core business that we've discussed with you today, we've been moving very quickly and deliberately on a number of other fronts as well. I'll touch briefly on 3. First, our board. After a thorough review of a broad range of highly qualified candidates by our nominating and corporate governance committee, our board has appointed 5 new members, all with impressive records of significant accomplishments at high levels of media, advertising, marketing, technology, the Internet and finance. 
Second, on our intellectual property. After attempting to resolve the matter, we took action to protect our patented innovations and addressed Facebook's unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Yahoo!'s intellectual property is one of the foundations of our business and our future growth. Other leading companies licensed our patented technologies and Facebook must do the same or change the way it operates. 
Third, on our Asian assets, we are continuing to pursue active discussions with Alibaba. We are currently exploring a simplified transaction structure which, if executed, would provide greater certainty of closing to monetize a portion of our Alibaba stake. While we also plan to continue exploring alternatives to unlock the value of our Yahoo! Japan stake for shareholders, any transaction has to be at a value that makes sense for Yahoo! and its shareholders. We currently have a valuation gap with respect to the Yahoo! Japan stake that we have not been able to bridge. Given that, we are focusing on our discussions with Alibaba and we are not in a position to provide further details or certainty on today's call. 
So to summarize, we have a clear near-term focus. We intend to win in our core and put our customers first. We will get that core business right and bring innovation and excitement back into Yahoo!. That's our top priority right now. Over time, we will earn the right to pursue new growth opportunities and we look forward to more discussion about those opportunities with you in future quarters. 
I am convinced that we don't need to reinvent who we are. We're one of the leading media and communications companies in the world. But I'm equally convinced we absolutely do need to reinvent the experiences our users have with the marquee properties that bring them to Yahoo! every day. We continually engage today's online users. Yahoo!'s experiences must always be fresh, highly personalized, enhanced with great video content and offer exceptional experiences on any screen. Our goal is to have the #1 properties in our core businesses in every way our users choose to interact with us, on the PC, through tablets, on their phones or whatever comes next. 
The Q1 progress I've shared with you should make clear that we intend to move fast. In our industry, unbelievable innovation happens at a lightning fast pace. We must get back to moving at that pace, and Q1 was just the beginning. Yahoo! must be nimble, responsive and act with a real sense of urgency. We have to think and to move like a growth company. Yahoo! moving forward will be centered around delivering for our customers. I am determined that our leadership team and organization will make that happen. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to you so we can answer any questions you have this afternoon."

As I said in my script, yield, especially in the guaranteed side of the business, was up very strong double digits versus prior year, so that was a very good indication, obviously one of the objectives for our sales force. Scott touched on that in terms of monetization in his script. Sell-through rate, frankly, was a little mixed, better in some properties, a little worse than we'd expected and others, so we need to keep working through that and do expect that to improve into second quarter. And then finally, another one of the big metrics that we talk about in terms of sales force effectiveness is the front page and the days sold on the front page. And that, in first quarter, is actually flat with fourth quarter, which is quite an accomplishment given the seasonalness of 4Q. So flat with 4Q and well above 2Q and 3Q of last year. Finally, I guess the best indication of sales force progress almost one year into this transformation is we do see, as I noted in my script, Display revenue regaining growth year-over-year in the second quarter. So feel good about that. The second question you had was on RPS gap. So we're working hard with Microsoft, working hard on our own initiatives and Microsoft certainly working hard on the platform for our marketplace RPS. And it didn't make as much progress, frankly, as we wanted to or envisioned for first quarter, and that is concerning. But we're covered for another year here of the RPS guarantee, and I still firmly believe we'll get there by the time that the RPS guarantee runs out. So it's an important thing for both of us, and they're certainly working hard and we're helping right along with them."

We need to understand their business, what they're trying to accomplish and how best to use all of our properties, all of the audience we have, all of our capabilities to give them the best return on their advertising spend. And we've got a long way, frankly, to go on that, to the point where we're viewed as a strategic partner and integral to their businesses. But we're not going to stop until we've gotten to that point, and we see the results of that as growing at or above the market rate. And on the RPS guarantee, Tim mentioned it. I just want to echo his final thought and comment which was, Search is a really important part of our business and obviously an important business for Microsoft. And we will invest and have been investing a lot of time to make sure that the relationship we have is strong and that we have really forward-looking ways of doing business together that make sense for both of these businesses.

In addition to that, Mark, very, very consistent with your question, we need to get good, real fast in Mobile, and I would say we need to get good real fast in devices overall and that includes Mobile, of course. And we're not there today. And I think you should expect, let me see, if we have a #1 property, a #1 site through a browser, we just won't stop until we have a #1 position for that same content on mobile devices, really, any device that the user wants to come at us. So we have a really heightened focus on this and have some of our top people working on how we get after the new experience we need for mobile devices. So thank you for the question."

On earnings and equity interest, obviously, 2 pieces to that, the wide RP so the YJ earnings and RPs of Alibaba's earnings. You'll all recall that we actually report one quarter in arrears for both of those. So on the Alibaba side, big quarter, they've got operational momentum, very proud of it and happy with the terrific job that the management team there is doing. So they had a great quarter, far ahead of where they were fourth quarter the prior year. So again, we report fourth quarter in our first quarter earnings. It's a one-quarter lag, so reporting their fourth quarter of 2011 and they have a terrific operating momentum. On YJ, we saw some nice operating increases, but also if you recall, we had booked our share of an impairment of one of their investments first quarter last year. And the absence of that level of impairment this year, obviously, turns into more year-over-year growth. So you have both components, YJ that's doing well and Alibaba that has some really great operational momentum to it. On Interclick, I had talked briefly in my prepared comments that we will have revenue contributions in second quarter sequentially, contributing to the growth sequentially from Interclick. That will continue to ramp throughout the year. We'll have some investments to go along with it, but I still view, as I think I have said back on the January call, that 1Q, the first quarter that we have fully consolidated for Interclick would be the low point and it would rise dramatically in both revenue and operating income increments to us. So I'm not going to lay out the numbers. It doesn't make sense to give specific guidance for Interclick, but we can start to see that to ramp throughout the year. That's what our objective is."

And a lot of that work that, that team does has implications on RPS and it has implications on RPS in a number of different ways. But probably, the most direct way is through this click-through rate that both Scott and I referenced in our prepared remarks. And that is, how do you design that page such that more people will click on it, and that's exactly the kind of improvement we saw. We have more people being attracted to those page search links and more people clicking through them. I don't want to shortchange Microsoft obviously. Their work on making sure that there's good coverage there and a good model for PPC, price-per-click, is important as well and the relevancy of their algo, et cetera, all very important. So we really are working very much together, but I do want to make sure we give credit to the team here that has done a very nice job in starting to deliver on their charter, which is to improve the front-end experience which you'd expect would translate into things like better click-through. Then on premium pricing, I did talk about this in my script and in one of these Q&As. And the answer is, the yield was up strongly, double digit, in fact, on premium. So that's one of the places I've cited as actually some positive news. Supply and sell-through were down a little bit, but we had at least a partial offset in better yield, better CPMs, and was on the premium or guaranteed side. So a nice piece of news there."

We've been moving very quickly on a number of initiatives since we last spoke. During that time, I've become more convinced than ever of the value of our assets, the potential of this business and what we can do to make the most of Yahoo!'s huge market opportunity. I'll have a lot to share on that, but we'll start today with a discussion of our first quarter results. Then we'll talk about what we're doing to refocus Yahoo! on its core business and our renewed focus on our customers, the users and advertisers that are vital to Yahoo!'s future. 
First, on Q1, we're pleased that revenue and profits were higher than we expected, costs were lower than expected and we beat consensus across the board. And we're encouraged that revenue grew year-over-year for the first time since the third quarter of 2008. But I want to be very clear. I'm not satisfied with the pace of top line growth and I won't be satisfied until we're growing at least in line with the market. 
Taking a brief look at our performance in Search and Display, Search came in ahead of our expectations, driven by higher RPS. The majority of our Q1 gains were driven by changes Yahoo! made to the Search experience that drove higher click-through on our Search ads. While Microsoft has continued to enhance its algo in paid search technology, the Search Alliance is not yet delivering what we expected. I'm personally working with Microsoft to ensure the alliance does deliver going forward and meets our high expectations for user experience, advertiser ROI and revenue for Yahoo!. 
Turning to Display, revenue was down versus last year and a bit lower than our expectations. We've got a few wins on engagement Display, like the growing engagement on Yahoo! News, driven by our partnership with ABC News, and by Yahoo!'s social bar. We also see some positive signs on monetization, with the stabilization of our U.S. sales force and renewed partnerships with some important advertisers. But let me be very clear that our Display business is no way close to where it needs to be in any of our 3 regions. Hundreds of millions of people engage on Yahoo!'s homepage, Mail and other marquee media properties, and we must improve monetization and achieve higher returns from that engagement. 
Looking at overall growth by region, Americas and APAC drove the top line in Q1, up 2% and 5%, respectively. Our smallest region, EMEA, felt the impact of macro dislocations in the region, with revenue down 9% year-over-year. Costs [ph] came in much lower than we expected, so overall operating income was above the range we gave you in January. EPS were up 38% year-over-year due mostly to improvements and our equity interest line. I have more to share about the actions we took in Q1 and our future plans, but first I'd like Tim to provide more detail on our Q1 results, our Q2 guidance, as well as the financial framework we're using to manage the business going forward. 
Tim?"
91800,183587364,284857,"Yahoo! Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter 2012 results, set up our second quarter guidance and update our longer-term financial model. Let's start with our headlines for first quarter. As Scott mentioned a few moments",1564,"Thanks, Scott. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter 2012 results, set up our second quarter guidance and update our longer-term financial model. 
Let's start with our headlines for first quarter. As Scott mentioned a few moments ago, revenue ex-TAC of $1,077,000,000 finished in the top half of our guidance range and, more importantly, grew on a year-over-year basis for the first time since third quarter 2008. That's a long way from the growth we aspire to, but it's an important milestone nonetheless. Operating income landed at $169 million, exceeding the top end of our guidance range by a combination of revenue and cost favorability. With respect to operating margin rate, first quarter was nearly 16% on an ex-TAC basis, up 3.5 points from guidance midpoint. Earnings per diluted share increased by 38% from prior year on improvements in our equity interest line. 
In cash flow, we're similarly strong in the first quarter with cash flow from operating activities up 45% from 2011 and free cash flow up more than 245% as we continue to optimize capital spending. 
Finally, we recently announced actions to further streamline our cost structure with steady state annual savings of roughly $375 million. More on the financial model implications of that action in just a few minutes. 
Turning to first quarter ex-TAC revenue results, our 1% improvement versus prior year was driven by 8% growth in Search, 1% growth in our other revenue category and a 4% decline in Display. Starting with Search, query volume generated by our properties was up slightly in the Americas region and roughly flat globally. Revenue per search, therefore, drove the bulk of the 8% ex-TAC revenue improvement compared to last year. Breaking down the RPS strength, Americas click-through rates improved by high single digits, implying that users are finding more relevant results and clicking on them more often. At the same time, we're absorbing some weakness in the Search marketplace itself that's being offset by the Search Alliance RPS guarantee. This quarter, we're not able to report significant progress by Microsoft on their effort to close the gap in marketplace RPS, but we are actively working with them to improve those results, as well as to achieve more consistent progress in closing the RPS gap in the future. 
Moving to Display, an ex-TAC revenue decline of 4% year-over-year obviously isn't acceptable. By geography, Americas declined 5%, EMEA declined 4% and APAC grew 6%. The Americas' turnaround effort remains our primary focus, so let me provide a bit more detail there. First, audience metrics continue to grow with media property page views improving by 10% year-over-year. However, total graphical supply including Mail was down roughly 10% from a year ago and guaranteed placement sell-through rates remained well below first quarter 2011 levels. On a more positive note, we did generate strong yield improvements in the quarter, especially in guaranteed placements, thereby, partially offsetting the impact of supply in sell-through. Rounding out Display, our recent acquisition of Interclick performed in line with expectations, generating roughly $10 million incremental revenue. That's my first quarter overview for today. 
Now let's turn to second quarter guidance. Given the uncertainties that typically accompany both a large reduction in force and a business unit reorganization, our guidance ranges this quarter will be wider than those we usually provide. In short, this quarter has more potential for variability than other quarters. The most effective way to deal with additional variability is to provide as much transparency as we can with regard to our underlying dynamics. 
First, on revenue ex-TAC, we expect a range of $1,030,000,000 to $1,140,000,000 or $1,085,000,000 midpoint of this range equates to roughly 1% growth versus 2011. By revenue category on a year-over-year basis, we expect Search to be flat to up, other to be down slightly and Display to return to mid-single digits growth. Early bookings indications in Display are encouraging for consumer packaged goods, automotive and Finance. We also expect sequential revenue contributions from our Interclick acquisition and improvements in guaranteed placement sell-through rates. 
Moving to ex-TAC costs, it will take about a year to reach substantially all of the $375 million steady state cost savings associated with the reduction in force we recently announced. During the interim period, we'll incur transition-related costs for works such as property rationalization, data center consolidation, improved cloud infrastructure utilization and the elimination or right sourcing of support functions. At the end of the transition period, those costs will obviously go away completely. 
In order to facilitate tracking and communication of our progress towards steady state, we'll provide cost guidance and reporting throughout this transition period in 3 pieces. Those are: one, ongoing costs; two, transition-related expenses; and three, restructuring charges. 
Let me take a moment to ensure each of these 3 pieces is clear. The first of the 3 is ongoing or look-through costs. Those are the costs involved in running our business on a go-forward basis. The second of the 3 is transition-related expense. Now as I noted just a moment ago, we expect those costs will be reduced to 0 by roughly mid-2013. And finally, we'll have restructuring charges for severance, facilities' exits and asset write-downs. By nature, these costs will vary from quarter-to-quarter with some quarters, potentially like this present quarter, containing a sizable charge and others with little or no charge at all. Providing this transparency should facilitate everyone's ability to clearly track the operational progress of the business by focusing on ex-TAC revenue and ongoing costs. Resulting pro forma ongoing operating income and ex-TAC operating margin rate are the best indication of our longer-term financial model. However, it's worth emphasizing that we will continue to provide and explain our full GAAP picture of cost and profits, including all transitional costs and restructuring charges in addition to the look-through of the core business I just described. 
With that construct in mind, our second quarter ex-TAC cost guidance is as follows. We expect costs on a look-through or ongoing basis to be $875 million to $895 million. This range includes normal seasonal increases related to our annual wage and stock-based comp cycles, as well as marketing costs related to upcoming events such as the Olympics. Our transition-related costs are expected to be $40 million to $50 million. The majority of this cost is related to employees who are impacted by the April 4 actions, but who will continue employment through a set date over the next year. These employees, in other words, are in roles that will require transition work in order to reach steady state. 
Finally, with respect to restructuring charges, while we expect to incur roughly $135 million in total severance related to our recent reduction in force, we'll undoubtedly add to that charge as a result of the associated efforts to streamline, rationalize and simplify our offerings and infrastructure. It's too early to put a range on the all-in charge and similarly too early to quantify it for this quarter. So we're going to guide on an ex-restructuring basis, but we'll plan to discuss it during our July earnings call. 
To sum up, the $1,085,000,000 midpoint of ex-TAC revenue and the $885 million midpoint of look-through ex-TAC cost implies $200 million of ongoing pro forma operating income, an improvement of 5% from prior year, and roughly an 18.5% ex-TAC operating margin rate. 
That brings us to a discussion of the longer-term financial model we're targeting. Scott will provide more detail in a moment regarding our go-forward operating objectives, but the overarching financial theme is to streamline our current business in order to create investment capacity for future growth. Ultimately, we believe a reported ex-TAC operating margin rate of 20% is the proper target level. Let me take a few moments to walk you through that. 
First, at steady state, the actions we've already announced should bring us to an ex-TAC margin range of 20% to 25%. Over the next few quarters, we'll be working to improve that range to a minimum 25% rate by driving both higher revenue and a more optimal cost structure. Ultimately, our goal was to create a business that's capable of growing revenue at or above market rates. By necessity, this will require us to improve our current operations, but more importantly, it will mean diversifying our revenue streams, both geographically and beyond the traditional scope of Search and Display. Our newly created commerce business unit is an early indication of the focus we'll bring to generating additional revenue sources. Commerce and transaction-related services are a natural opportunity to add value to our users while providing better monetization for Yahoo!. 
As we expand in our current marketplaces and simultaneously work to develop new business models, investment will be required. Preliminarily, we view our investment capacity as being roughly 5 points of ex-TAC operating margin. In order to deliver 20% on a reported basis for the company, we must, therefore, lift margins in our existing business to make room for the investments we'll make in the future. Given the dynamic nature of our industry, investment in the future is absolutely critical to longer-term success. As our business model evolves, we'll provide clarity on core margins, investments and returns on investment. The entire equation must work together to produce the kind of long-term revenue growth we know we're capable of. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Scott."

And as Tim said, our model assumes this business can and will grow going forward. When I joined Yahoo! in February, I knew Yahoo!'s brands, assets and data provided a unique opportunity for this business. The foundation we have today is still",1733,"Thanks, Tim. And as Tim said, our model assumes this business can and will grow going forward. When I joined Yahoo! in February, I knew Yahoo!'s brands, assets and data provided a unique opportunity for this business. The foundation we have today is still extremely valuable. Any company that starts with nearly 700 million users, relationships with thousands of advertisers, hundreds of millions of dollars in cash flow and long-standing strategic relationships and investments has a significant opportunity to create value. Among other things, we deliver content that matters to millions of users who visit us every day, and many of our offerings, especially in the U.S., have been #1 in their categories for many years. As you also know the challenges we face, even as we've maintained our leadership position and distanced ourselves from competitors in certain key media categories, we've lost share of time spent online in the recent years. Below a strong tide of consumer engagement and ad spend continues to come online, Yahoo!'s engagement and revenue has not been rising with that tide. 
So one of my first actions when I arrived at Yahoo! was to gather our leaders and ask them to change their thinking. I specifically asked what would it take to refine Yahoo!'s focus to get us back to doing our best for our users and advertisers, to grow this business and to move fast. We started with a clean slate and asked: How would we build Yahoo! from the ground up if we were building it from scratch today? We took a comprehensive look at everything, all of the media, communication, Search, social and commerce experiences that we offer our users. We also looked at the major platforms, systems and technologies we use to operate those properties for us and our partners, including the data center footprint and other corporate services required to make it all run, every part of the business. And here was the simple answer: Yahoo! had been doing way too much for too long and was only doing a few things really well. The power of Yahoo!'s distribution network gave us the ability to provide hundreds of offerings for users and advertisers all around the world. Each of our products and services may individually generate more engagement than most startups or even midsized companies in certain markets, but that does not mean that we should continue to do everything we currently do. In fact, dispersing the efforts of our best designers, developers, content producers and other dedicated Yahoo!s across every one of the markets and niches we serve initially put us in a great position, but that position isn't sustainable. I'm certain we need to be clearer going forward about what we won't do. In fact, with all the growth opportunities we have, one of the most important pieces of our strategy and that of any business in a fast-growing market isn't regularly defining what we won't do. What we will do is get clear on our core business, dedicate some of our best people in the most resources there and put our customers first. 
So let's talk about how we do that. We've completed the detail and diligent review in an accelerated time frame and the team working on this really delivered. We produced a comprehensive strategic framework that will change what we do and, most importantly, how we do it. During this process, the point I came back to over and over again is that we need to put our customers first in everything that we do. The restructuring we announced 2 weeks ago, the organization structure we announced last week and yesterday's leadership announcement for our newly formed commerce group are just the first steps. We are now cascading the rest of the plan through Yahoo!. 
Let me outline several essential elements of that plan. First, we're consolidating technology platforms and shutting down on transitioning roughly 50 properties that don't contribute meaningfully to engagement of revenue. Second, we're clearly defining our core media connections and commerce businesses, including News, Finance, Sports, Entertainment, Mail and a handful of others. Those properties that generate the majority of our engagement and revenue. Third, we're moving engineers into our commerce businesses to put them closer to our user and dedicating some of our best and brightest Yahoo!s to meaningful innovation in those core businesses. Fourth, we're accelerating the deployment of the platforms and technologies we've built to make each of our properties more scalable, nimble and flexible, and therefore, less costly and time consuming to run. Fifth, we're making better use of Yahoo!'s vast data to personalize user experiences and dramatically improve advertiser ROI. Sixth, we're refocusing our R&D on Owned and Operated properties and stopping development of a number of initiatives, including platforms for outside publishers and theoretical science that were outside of our core. All of this puts us in a position to achieve the most important objective, which is to produce clear, measurable results for our advertisers, including genuine insights from our vast data so that they can feel -- see real ROI. Really understanding our advertisers' needs will position Yahoo! to better monetize all of our traffic globally. 
In addition to the 6 points I've outlined here, we've also identified execution issues that we are taking swift action to change. A key example is the complexity of Yahoo!'s development and delivery process. That is what it takes to get an idea from concept to launch. Yahoo! has built processes that were originally intended to help us scale, but they've become way too complex and has stifled innovation. We've made some strides here, but not enough. Some of our processes continued to degrade the user experience, limit our ability to deliver for advertisers and frustrate Yahoo!s who really want to produce for our customers. We simply must change that. 
The announcements we've made over the last several weeks represent the first steps in executing on our plans to get back to our core businesses, execute and move faster. We're putting in place a more focused organizational structure and decreasing the size of our footprint, including reducing our workforce. I don't take decisions to eliminate jobs lightly as we have thousands of hard working and loyal people here at Yahoo!. But I also believe we have way too many people for the amount of output from this business. A streamlined structure and less bureaucracy will help Yahoo! get stuff done at the pace our customers and our industry require. 
As we've defined our core businesses and move to optimize our allocation of resources, we look closely at user engagement and market potential, as well as current revenue and margins. As Tim discussed a moment ago, our recent actions and our plan are fully aligned with a very clear target financial model for this business. We believe there may be some modest revenue implications from the actions we've taken recently, but the result will be higher margins and more flexibility to invest more aggressively in our core businesses and in adjacent opportunities over time. 
In addition to all the work on Yahoo!s core business that we've discussed with you today, we've been moving very quickly and deliberately on a number of other fronts as well. I'll touch briefly on 3. First, our board. After a thorough review of a broad range of highly qualified candidates by our nominating and corporate governance committee, our board has appointed 5 new members, all with impressive records of significant accomplishments at high levels of media, advertising, marketing, technology, the Internet and finance. 
Second, on our intellectual property. After attempting to resolve the matter, we took action to protect our patented innovations and addressed Facebook's unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Yahoo!'s intellectual property is one of the foundations of our business and our future growth. Other leading companies licensed our patented technologies and Facebook must do the same or change the way it operates. 
Third, on our Asian assets, we are continuing to pursue active discussions with Alibaba. We are currently exploring a simplified transaction structure which, if executed, would provide greater certainty of closing to monetize a portion of our Alibaba stake. While we also plan to continue exploring alternatives to unlock the value of our Yahoo! Japan stake for shareholders, any transaction has to be at a value that makes sense for Yahoo! and its shareholders. We currently have a valuation gap with respect to the Yahoo! Japan stake that we have not been able to bridge. Given that, we are focusing on our discussions with Alibaba and we are not in a position to provide further details or certainty on today's call. 
So to summarize, we have a clear near-term focus. We intend to win in our core and put our customers first. We will get that core business right and bring innovation and excitement back into Yahoo!. That's our top priority right now. Over time, we will earn the right to pursue new growth opportunities and we look forward to more discussion about those opportunities with you in future quarters. 
I am convinced that we don't need to reinvent who we are. We're one of the leading media and communications companies in the world. But I'm equally convinced we absolutely do need to reinvent the experiences our users have with the marquee properties that bring them to Yahoo! every day. We continually engage today's online users. Yahoo!'s experiences must always be fresh, highly personalized, enhanced with great video content and offer exceptional experiences on any screen. Our goal is to have the #1 properties in our core businesses in every way our users choose to interact with us, on the PC, through tablets, on their phones or whatever comes next. 
The Q1 progress I've shared with you should make clear that we intend to move fast. In our industry, unbelievable innovation happens at a lightning fast pace. We must get back to moving at that pace, and Q1 was just the beginning. Yahoo! must be nimble, responsive and act with a real sense of urgency. We have to think and to move like a growth company. Yahoo! moving forward will be centered around delivering for our customers. I am determined that our leadership team and organization will make that happen. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to you so we can answer any questions you have this afternoon."

As I said in my script, yield, especially in the guaranteed side of the business, was up very strong double digits versus prior year, so that was a very good indication, obviously one of the objectives for our sales force. Scott touched on that in terms of monetization in his script. Sell-through rate, frankly, was a little mixed, better in some properties, a little worse than we'd expected and others, so we need to keep working through that and do expect that to improve into second quarter. And then finally, another one of the big metrics that we talk about in terms of sales force effectiveness is the front page and the days sold on the front page. And that, in first quarter, is actually flat with fourth quarter, which is quite an accomplishment given the seasonalness of 4Q. So flat with 4Q and well above 2Q and 3Q of last year. Finally, I guess the best indication of sales force progress almost one year into this transformation is we do see, as I noted in my script, Display revenue regaining growth year-over-year in the second quarter. So feel good about that. The second question you had was on RPS gap. So we're working hard with Microsoft, working hard on our own initiatives and Microsoft certainly working hard on the platform for our marketplace RPS. And it didn't make as much progress, frankly, as we wanted to or envisioned for first quarter, and that is concerning. But we're covered for another year here of the RPS guarantee, and I still firmly believe we'll get there by the time that the RPS guarantee runs out. So it's an important thing for both of us, and they're certainly working hard and we're helping right along with them."

One of the things that I didn't mention in the script, but I am certain of, is that we just have to be better business partners. Easy to say, difficult to do. We need to understand their business, what they're trying to accomplish and how best to use all of our properties, all of the audience we have, all of our capabilities to give them the best return on their advertising spend. And we've got a long way, frankly, to go on that, to the point where we're viewed as a strategic partner and integral to their businesses. But we're not going to stop until we've gotten to that point, and we see the results of that as growing at or above the market rate. And on the RPS guarantee, Tim mentioned it. I just want to echo his final thought and comment which was, Search is a really important part of our business and obviously an important business for Microsoft.

You'll all recall that we actually report one quarter in arrears for both of those. So on the Alibaba side, big quarter, they've got operational momentum, very proud of it and happy with the terrific job that the management team there is doing. So they had a great quarter, far ahead of where they were fourth quarter the prior year. So again, we report fourth quarter in our first quarter earnings. It's a one-quarter lag, so reporting their fourth quarter of 2011 and they have a terrific operating momentum. On YJ, we saw some nice operating increases, but also if you recall, we had booked our share of an impairment of one of their investments first quarter last year. And the absence of that level of impairment this year, obviously, turns into more year-over-year growth. So you have both components, YJ that's doing well and Alibaba that has some really great operational momentum to it. On Interclick, I had talked briefly in my prepared comments that we will have revenue contributions in second quarter sequentially, contributing to the growth sequentially from Interclick. That will continue to ramp throughout the year. We'll have some investments to go along with it, but I still view, as I think I have said back on the January call, that 1Q, the first quarter that we have fully consolidated for Interclick would be the low point and it would rise dramatically in both revenue and operating income increments to us. So I'm not going to lay out the numbers. It doesn't make sense to give specific guidance for Interclick, but we can start to see that to ramp throughout the year. That's what our objective is."

And a lot of that work that, that team does has implications on RPS and it has implications on RPS in a number of different ways. But probably, the most direct way is through this click-through rate that both Scott and I referenced in our prepared remarks. And that is, how do you design that page such that more people will click on it, and that's exactly the kind of improvement we saw. We have more people being attracted to those page search links and more people clicking through them. I don't want to shortchange Microsoft obviously. Their work on making sure that there's good coverage there and a good model for PPC, price-per-click, is important as well and the relevancy of their algo, et cetera, all very important. So we really are working very much together, but I do want to make sure we give credit to the team here that has done a very nice job in starting to deliver on their charter, which is to improve the front-end experience which you'd expect would translate into things like better click-through. Then on premium pricing, I did talk about this in my script and in one of these Q&As. And the answer is, the yield was up strongly, double digit, in fact, on premium. So that's one of the places I've cited as actually some positive news. Supply and sell-through were down a little bit, but we had at least a partial offset in better yield, better CPMs, and was on the premium or guaranteed side. So a nice piece of news there."

Good afternoon, and thank you, all, for joining us today. Obviously, this is a very exciting and dynamic day to have our earnings call given yesterday's announcement of the hiring of Marissa Mayer as CEO. Since this is Marissa's first day on",2008,"Thanks, June. Good afternoon, and thank you, all, for joining us today. Obviously, this is a very exciting and dynamic day to have our earnings call given yesterday's announcement of the hiring of Marissa Mayer as CEO. Since this is Marissa's first day on the job, she will not be joining us on the call today. However, she is very mindful of the importance of the investor community and I'm sure that you'll be hearing from her soon. Suffice to say that anyone at Yahoo! is incredibly energized today and looking forward to working with our new CEO. 
While I recognize you all have a lot of questions for her about Yahoo!'s future plans, I obviously won't be able to address those questions for you today on the earnings call. I will spend some time providing an overview of our results and progress in the quarter and also give you a brief update on the status of our planned sale of part of our stake in Alibaba Group, after which we'll have a brief Q&A session. I'm happy to answer what questions I can, but I ask for your patience on those questions we can't address today. 
So let's start with the second quarter financial results. In 2Q, Yahoo!'s revenue ex-TAC grew slightly year-over-year with both Search and Display up. 2Q operating income on an ongoing basis was well ahead of the guidance midpoint provided on last quarter's call. 
Back in April, we initiated the restructuring plan intended to consolidate technology platforms, transition dozens of properties and free up investment dollars for growth opportunities. As a result, we've guided you to think of our expenses and operating income in 3 distinct parts: ongoing operating income, transition-related expenses and restructuring charges. But some of those parts, of course, is equal to our reported numbers in total. To help visualize this framework, please access our Investor Relations site and see Page 6 of our earnings presentation entitled, 2Q operating income detail. 
With that overview format to guide us, our more detailed second quarter financial commentary is as follows. Revenue ex-TAC of $1,081,000,000 was fractionally under the guidance midpoint and grew about 0.5% year-over-year. On our April earnings call, we discussed the potential for a number of uncertainties in 2Q related to our reduction-in-force and business unit reorganization. As it turns out, there are many other dynamics that also played out over these past 3 months, and in that context, we're pleased to be so close to the midpoint. 
Turning to ongoing operating income, excluding unusual costs such as restructuring charges and transition-related expense, in the second quarter, we generated $228 million or $28 million above the guidance midpoint. On an apples-to-apples basis with last year, ongoing operating income grew 19%. With regard to margin rates, we guided the midpoint of roughly 18.5% on an ongoing basis and exceeded that expectation by a full 2.5 points, landing at 21%. While the low 20% margin rate is representative of our longer-term aspirations, at this time, it's a bit ahead of schedule, primarily as a result of lower costs related to the uncertainty we've been experiencing. 
Rounding up the income statement, earnings per diluted share were $0.18 for second quarter, up slightly from the prior year. However, that reported result included restructuring in Alibaba deal-related charges of $0.08 that was specifically unguided on our last earnings call. Excluding those charges, EPS was $0.27 this quarter or 47% above last year, primarily as a result of growth in our equity investments and share repurchases. 
Finally, within the quarter, we made a substantial downpayment on returning the expected proceeds from our Alibaba sale. Share repurchases for 2Q were $456 million or roughly 30 million shares at an average price of $15.34 per share. This brings the total capital returns to shareholders via share repurchases since 2009 to over $4 billion at an average price of $14.81 per share.
Let's move now to a deeper discussion of second quarter ex-TAC revenue results. By revenue category, year-over-year Display grew 1%, reversing declines in the past 2 consecutive quarters, while Search grew 4% and other revenue declined 7% on the final material step-down in broadband fee amortization that we've previously noted. Within Display, this quarter, our Americas region crossed into positive growth territory and APAC grew double digits. EMEA, on the other hand, declined 7% as demand continued to be weak as a result of the macroeconomic climate. 
As I did last quarter, let me focus on our Americas turnaround with more detail. First, media property page views grew mid-single digits. Second, total graphical supply, including Mail, declined in the high single digits, a slight improvement in year-over-year trends compared to prior quarters. Third, sell-through rates of guaranteed or premium ads include substantially year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, a good indication that our sales force continues to become more effective. Pricing was a little softer than expected, but yield did rise slightly year-over-year as premium ad mix improved. 
Finally, our Interclick acquisition continued to ramp with strong build double-digit year-over-year growth and a positive quarter-over-quarter contribution to our top line, albeit at a slower pace than planned. 
Moving now to Search, ex-TAC revenue grew by 4% year-over-year, driven by 7% improvement on our Owned and Operated sites. O&O's Search query volume registered slight growth on a global basis and Yahoo! generated RPS gains represented the remainder of the improvement versus last year. Unfortunately, similar to last quarter, we're unable to report progress by Microsoft on closing the gap in marketplace RPS. The Search Alliance marketplace RBS continues to be below our goal, and therefore, we are still benefiting from the RPS guarantee from Microsoft. Both companies continue to work hard to materially improve the performance and we'll plan to provide an update on our joint efforts at our next earnings call. 
Panning back out, let's spend a few moments on how transition-related expenses and restructuring charges impacted our total reported operating income. Here, I once again refer you to Page 6 of the earnings presentation on IR site. To the right of our ongoing operating income column, you'll see transition expenses of $37 million and restructuring charges of $129 million. You'll also see an additional column labeled deal-related. This refers to the initial expense incurred in preparation for the Alibaba sale transaction. We'll continue to break out transaction fees going forward as they're not operational in nature. The majority of these fees be will recognized when the initial sale is closed. 
As I explained back in April, we're providing this insight to maximize transparency and thereby facilitate your ability to track the operational performance of the company. We fully realize that the multiple views also create the potential for confusion, however. To help achieve clarity, the following is a step-by-step walk from ongoing to reported operating income. Beginning with $228 million ongoing operating income, we deduct $37 million for transition-related expense. That brings operating income down to roughly $190 million. Back in April, we did provide a guidance midpoint of $155 million on this basis and it's also the same basis as the current $170 million consensus in Wall Street models. Therefore, we exceeded the midpoint of our own guidance by $35 million and consensus by $20 million. From that consensus basis, we deduct the 2 unguided cost elements of restructuring for $129 million and deal-related costs for $7 million to arrive at the final reported GAAP operating income of $55 million. 
With respect to the $37 million transition cost bucket, we landed $8 million below the midpoint we've communicated back in April. As a reminder, these are the costs that we've refinanced for property rationalization, data center consolidation, improved cloud infrastructure utilization and the elimination or rightsizing of support functions. Without those efforts, we wouldn't be able to operate on the lower cost basis we're targeting in our ongoing model. At the end of the transition period, therefore, those costs will obviously go away completely. 
For the sake of completeness, let me provide a bit more color on the restructuring charge this quarter. It breaks down into the following components: $88 million for severance, $23 million for facilities exits and $18 million for asset write-downs. As we continue to execute the reduction in force and operational transformation over the next year, we will incur additional restructuring charges. Given the inherent variability of these kinds of charges, however, we'll continue to report and explain actual charges, but not provide explicit guidance on them. That's my second quarter overview for today. Typically, we'd also provide guidance for the upcoming quarter. In light of the announcement we made yesterday, however, we believe it's best to give our new CEO time to get acclimated to Yahoo! before providing any future guidance. 
With that, let me share some highlights of the recent progress we've made on content relationships and technology solutions. Starting with content, this quarter, we continue to develop and expand key relationships with premier media companies including ABC News, CNBC, Eurosport, Spotify and Clear Channel. 
Briefly on each, in News, our ABC News deal combines their world-class television content with Yahoo!'s massive online audience and targeting capabilities. We're seeing very promising results from the partnership, particularly in online news video viewership. In June, Yahoo! News and ABC News accounted for nearly 50% of all PC-based online news videos viewed in the United States according to comScore. 
In Finance, the CNBC agreement explains the ability of Yahoo! Finance to create and deliver premium Finance content and strengthens our position as the most viewed and utilized finance site in the world. 
In Sports, we extended our agreement with Eurosport to allow Yahoo! to continue to bring exclusive, high-quality sports content online in key international markets. 
In music and entertainment, the recently announced deals with Spotify and Clear Channel provide us with new ways to build audiences and distribute premium music and entertainment content and experiences. 
In addition to these new and enhanced content partnerships, we've also made progress on several key technology innovations, including Social Bar, Search access and Genome. Social Bar was launched in September to enable users on Yahoo! and Facebook to share content with their friends and has since become one of the top overall applications on the Facebook platform, steadily increasing to approximately 90 million installations today. 
Search access, which launched in May, serves as the mobile browser or a desktop browser plug-in providing instant answers using an intuitive interface that expands the display from previews as a user types into Search. We're not just innovating for consumers, but also for our advertisers. We recently launched Genome for marketers. Genome combines an expensive audience data set, leading data analytics and a premier media footprint with Yahoo!'s unique technology at scale. 
We feel good about all these signs of progress and I'd also like to highlight 2 important upcoming events for Yahoo! that are right around the corner, the Summer Olympics and the 2012 elections. For the Olympics, we expect Yahoo! will once again be the most viewed site in the category and take a leading position for online coverage with original video programs, breaking news and expert analysis. And the upcoming U.S. elections will allow us another opportunity to demonstrate our leadership in online coverage and audience engagement for major events with help from some outstanding new talent and leadership in our Washington bureau. 
Before we proceed to Q&A, let me also provide a quick update on the progress of our Alibaba sale transaction. In May, we announced the transaction in which we intend to sell up to 1/2 of our current ownership in Alibaba Group at an attractive valuation. Alibaba management reports that the financing efforts for this transaction are well on track and the closing date should be well within the six months we've previously communicated. 
Thank you for your time today, and as a reminder, I appreciate your understanding that my interest to your questions may be somewhat limited on this call, but I'll be happy to address all I can. Operator, let's begin the Q&A session."

I don't know that I'd say we saw anything overwhelming in terms of demand in the U.S. I mean, obviously, the Fed's comments today were a little bit cool on the economy and that probably colors things perhaps going into the second half. But with pricing specifically, we've had a few strong quarters of pricing in a row, so it wasn't, again, it wasn't bad but it was a little bit less than we expected, a little bit softer. I wouldn't draw any conclusions necessarily just yet, though."

And that, from first quarter to second quarter had its final step-down. And if you were to add back AT&T and these couple of other small things to that other number this year, this quarter, I should say, it's $222 million, you get back to flat year-over-year which is, we think, on an ongoing basis kind of more representative of what we're going there. So we really is the same thing we've been talking about for over a year and I'm happy to say it's taken the last sequential step-down. So that look through this year for the year-over-year comparisons, but we're getting out of the woods there. But on Search, yes, we know it was up 7%, so that was pretty nice. It was gratifying. I think the teams are doing a great job there. The affiliates were down a couple of percent there if you're doing the math, and the biggest factor there is really again, one of these headwinds we've talked about before which is the Yahoo! Japan Search fee, so the fee rate actually. It's not expressed in dollars but in fee rate. There was one more step-down that happened to down this year so that step-down has taken its final step. If you would've exploited that, the naturally, our affiliates would've been up kind of low mid, actually mid-single digits. So things, again, seemed to be steadying out. We're getting a little bit of growth."

So in keeping with our answer's not linked strategy, if they get better, get better at getting results on that Search Page, then PVs will be much further down than queries. As I noted in my script, we were actually up slightly in queries and that's truly what the financials are kind of hooked off of. That is an exaggerated number there, not necessarily representative of either user experience or our financials are hooked off of. On that page also, just to get to this, the U.S. core Search number, that down 17%, first of all, that's comScore number but it also includes the conceptual searches and there's a huge problem with the comp against last year with the bin Laden death. I think it was in May of last year. Your second question was on Display and the TAC is really Interclick, so the Interclick acquisition, because of the way the accounting works on that drives of our Display TAC. And then the Search is really coming down as EMEA, EMEA region transitions markets from Panama monetization system to ad center, Microsoft's monetization system. And then finally, on the RPS guarantee, so we are covered under this guarantee until the end of first quarter next year, so we still have 9 months or so to go. Again, as we get closer to that time, we'll see where our GAAP looks to be, we'll see what we had Microsoft are going to be doing about it and we'll make sure that we're transparent on that. In terms of ultimately the outs for the deal in the agreement that we've made public for a while now, I think well, I know not what I think, it is after 5 years, there was an RPS actual versus the market leader that they must be at.

We continue to work hard and there are a lot of things are going very well. In Search, as I said, growth of 7% on an ROA basis with some query growth. That is encouraging, and again, I'll give credit to our internal team here who works on the other things that impact RPS outside of what's going on in the marketplace that is obviously run by Microsoft. We do a lot of things in terms of the page layout and the design in terms of getting people to click through and our sales force does a great job in helping customers maintain or optimize their campaign. So a lot of good work going on, but we need to get that marketplace RPS that really should be a big benefit to us from the combined volume of both us and Microsoft. We need to get that where it needs to be so we'll continue to work that very diligently."

In second quarter, it was a really tough comp to be frank. We had record levels in 2Q that have been in May, the Royal Wedding was in April, so there were a lot of top comps in there. Mid-single digits, not where we want to be, but in context, not overly bad. We do not think it's a harbinger of things to come because again, we're all geared on improving that engagement via both the deep rich experiences that are content-based and technology based."

One, I do know if you can answer this directly, but not asking for production of the interest income, equity income level in terms of Alibaba, but given the time frame you've laid out, it's on track assuming nothing earlier. As  we look into 2013, can you provide any summary review of how much equity income would peel off as you go through the year as a result of that on Alibaba? And then secondly, I know you've laid out pretty clearly that the bulk of the liquidation will be used for buyback. You've always been buying back, should we still assume that the bulk of that will be buyback or is there any thought to funneling some of that towards any organic or revenue investment without putting any kind of levels or targets but obviously just in terms of the approach?"

So on the equity income impact, just qualitatively, I would think about it this way. Our 40 point stake, our 27 numbers will be cut in half. Of course, a bunch of the shares that we sell back are going to be retired, so then we'll accrete up to probably 22% or 23%, somewhere in that area. So we'll gain a little bit back that we've given that and of course, have the growth the Alibaba underlying results, the operating results that help offset that come into. So where all that nets out, I don't know. But as I said earlier, most of our EPS growth year was driven by our equity investments, and within that number, the majority of it was Alibaba, so it's really on a nice trend. They're doing a great job of not only growing the markets, growing their revenue, but also growing their earnings. Secondly, the buyback, we haven't decided on a form yet of the buyback but I think again, the board is committed to returning our substantially all of those proceeds to shareholders, so a form to be determined. In terms of using it for organic purposes, we've got a good cash balance. Actually currently, we have debt capacity. We have some opportunities to do what I think we need to do organically. I don't see where we necessarily need to TAC into that $4-plus billion of proceeds do anything organically. We do have our own flexibility there."

I would say in terms of 3Q, I can tell you a few things. Again, the Fed comments today were a little bit cool and that gives me a little bit of pause. Currencies are not with us. I can see at this point about $7 million quarter-over-quarter of adverse impact from currencies. But on the upside, Interclick should still continue to move forward and we do have the Olympics. The Olympics, we feel good about. I mean that's not only an engagement driver, but also it has real revenue attached to it, we have some great big-name partners. And then the elections, I also mentioned that in the script, the elections. The spending on elections obviously starts early here in the third quarter and will go through November, obviously. And then I guess the only other thing I'd mention is, seasonally it's kind of a flattish quarter for us if you look back over the last couple of years.

Excited to have her join the team and we're just going to have to take a little bit of time to work through exactly what that means in terms of the direction. But I think it's safe to say, we need to be really good at certain technologies and we need to be great at content. And both of those are imperative to our success, so it's finding the right mix and balance and spending our money in a way that most effectively drives returns. So our new CEO, Marissa, brings strong tech background, but we also have exceptionally deep media expertise here as well. So we got to combine them and it's a powerful combination when you get it right. In terms of Facebook, what it is, is it's going to be a closer collaboration between the companies and it's going to extend and expand our distribution arrangements, settles all of the outstanding claims between the companies and we feel good to be on, again, a steady footing there. It's a good result. If you look at Social Bar that we're doing with Facebook, I said there are 90 million installation so far, that's been very successful.

In reference back in my script because they went through this in some detail, but look at Page 6 on our earnings presentation on the IR site and you can see there, especially on the bottom, we came in at 10 81 in revenue against outlook of business,",469,"Sure. In reference back in my script because they went through this in some detail, but look at Page 6 on our earnings presentation on the IR site and you can see there, especially on the bottom, we came in at 10 81 in revenue against outlook of business, business outlook midpoint, I should say of 10 85, our ongoing expenses. So this is zeroing in on the business, excluding transition cost and excluded restructuring charges, we guided about 80, 85. And therefore on the midpoint, 10 85, less 85  was $200 million of ongoing operating income. That is to be exact, 18.4% margin, so roughly 18.5% as I said in my script. We came in substantially lower on ongoing cost, $32 million lower, and that is, as I noted in my script, was really the result of the uncertainty that we've been seeing. It's the time of extraordinary change here, and given what we've been through, it's tough to get traction on spending and investments that we're trying to make that we described back on the April call. So the majority of the reason that we were able to overachieve, ending at $228 million ongoing operating income instead of $200 million, is really that cost of variability, not a great reason to beat the number, and that's why I say it's a little bit ahead of schedule. We have things that we need to invest in. Again, apart from the dollars we're spending to get to that end state where this ongoing operating model is all you'll see of Yahoo!, you don't have the transition, you don't have the restructuring, apart from the efforts to get there, there are things we need to invest in, in order to win. And we've talked about mobile on this call, we've talked about video on this call, we've talked about other engagement drivers from content and content partnerships, those are great examples. And there are other technologies when you widen the scope in terms of personalization technologies and targeting technologies for our advertisers, again, the script I mentioned Genome. So we have more that we need to do to transform this company and get it operating in the kind of robust growth range that we're looking for in terms of revenue growth. And as a reminder of the long-term model, we're trying to drive the existing business up to something like 25% operating margin to provide, call it, 5 points of operating margin to invest in the business in new areas of growth such that we have a reported number of operating margin of 20%. So we're just so early in that process that I say we're just ahead of schedule. This is just the beginning, there's a lot more pieces that play out here. But that's generally where we're going."

We were at second quarter last year, approaching kind of where we want them to be, not quite there yet, but approaching where we wanted to be.

And as we start just holding that into our whole class 2 business. So we keep track of it on both bases obviously internally here. But going forward, it's really come as we start to see our class 2 or nonguaranteed business start to grow more and especially not just in volume, but moreso monetization through targeting, that's going to be the big, big determinants of our success there. Then in terms of new front, we had great turnouts and a lot of great engagements with top advertisers. We're seeing a lot of attraction with them and a very positive response to our original programming in general. They were over 20 original video programs each month. And we're continuing to drive engagement and the more we can focus as we've said, 2  on our last call, the more we can focus on advertiser ROI and continue to go with our sales force and develop our technology in terms of having advertiser ROI, the more business that we're going to bring back and this is all in the back of the premium content experiences that drives user engagement, so all kind of clicks together nicely there."

Obviously, this is a very exciting and dynamic day to have our earnings call given yesterday's announcement of the hiring of Marissa Mayer as CEO. Since this is Marissa's first day on the job, she will not be joining us on the call today. However, she is very mindful of the importance of the investor community, and I'm sure that you'll be hearing from her soon. Suffice to say that everyone at Yahoo! is incredibly energized today and looking forward to working with our new CEO. 
While I recognize you all have a lot of questions for her about Yahoo!'s future plan, I obviously won't be able to address those questions for you today on the earnings call. I will spend some time providing an overview of our results and progress in the quarter and also give you a brief update on the status of our planned sale of part of our stake in Alibaba Group, after which we'll have a brief Q&A session. I'm happy to answer what questions I can, but I ask for your patience on those questions we can't address today. 
So let's start with the second quarter financial results. In 2Q, Yahoo!'s revenue x TAC grew slightly year-over-year with both Search and Display up. 2Q operating income on an ongoing basis was well ahead of the guidance midpoint provided on last quarter's call. 
Back in April, we initiated a restructuring plan intended to consolidate technology platforms, transition dozens of properties and free up investment dollars for growth opportunities. As a result, we guided you to think of our expenses and operating income in 3 distinct parts: ongoing operating income, transition-related expenses and restructuring charges. The sum of those parts, of course, is equal to our reported numbers in total. To help visualize this framework, please access our Investor Relations site and see Page 6 of our earnings presentation entitled, 2Q Operating Income Detail. 
With that overview format to guide us, our more detailed second quarter financial commentary is as follows. Revenue x TAC of $1,081,000,000 was fractionally under the guidance midpoint and grew about 0.5% year-over-year. On our April earnings call, we discussed the potential for a number of uncertainties in 2Q related to our reduction in force and business unit reorganization. As it turns out, there are many other dynamics that also played out over these past 3 months. And in that context, we're pleased to be so close to the midpoint. 
Turning to ongoing operating income, excluding unusual costs such as restructuring charges and transition-related expense, in the second quarter, we generated $228 million or $28 million above the guidance midpoint. On an apples-to-apples basis with last year, ongoing operating income grew 19%. 
With regard to margin rates, we guided a midpoint of roughly 18.5% on an ongoing basis and exceeded that expectation by a full 2.5 points, landing at 21%. While a low 20% margin rate is representative of our longer-term aspirations, at this time it's a bit ahead of schedule primarily as a result of lower costs related to the uncertainty we've been experiencing. 
Rounding up the income statement, earnings per diluted share were $0.18 for second quarter, up slightly from the prior year. However, that reported result included restructuring and Alibaba deal-related charges of $0.08 that were specifically unguided on our last earnings call. Excluding those charges, EPS was $0.27 this quarter or 47% above last year primarily as a result of growth in our equity investments and share repurchases. 
Finally, within the quarter, we made a substantial down payment on returning the expected proceeds from our Alibaba sale. Share repurchases for 2Q were $456 million or roughly 30 million shares at an average price of $15.34 per share. This brings the total capital return to shareholders via share repurchases since 2009 to over $4 billion at an average price of $14.81 per share.
Let's move now to a deeper discussion of second quarter x TAC revenue results. By revenue category, year-over-year Display grew 1%, reversing declines in the past 2 consecutive quarters, while Search grew 4% and other revenue declined 7% on the final material step-down in broadband fee amortization that we've previously noted. 
Within Display, this quarter, our Americas region crossed into positive growth territory, and APAC grew double digits. EMEA, on the other hand, declined 7% [ph] as demand continued to be weak as a result of the macroeconomic climate. 
As I did last quarter, let me focus on our Americas turnaround with more detail. First, media property page views grew mid-single digits. Second, total graphical supply, including Mail, declined in the high single digits, a slight improvement in year-over-year trends compared to prior quarters. Third, sell-through rates of guaranteed or premium ads improved substantially year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, a good indication that our sales force continues to become more effective. Pricing was a little softer than expected, but yield did rise slightly year-over-year as premium ad mix improved. Finally, our interclick acquisition continued to ramp with strong, double-digit year-over-year growth and a positive quarter-over-quarter contribution to our top line, albeit at a slower pace than planned. 
Moving now to Search, x TAC revenue grew by 4% year-over-year driven by 7% improvement on our Owned and Operated sites. O&O search query volume registered slight growth on a global basis, and Yahoo!-generated RPS gains represented the remainder of the improvement versus last year. Unfortunately, similar to last quarter, we're unable to report progress by Microsoft on closing the gap in marketplace RPS. The Search Alliance marketplace RPS continues to be below our goal and, therefore, we are still benefiting from the RPS guarantee from Microsoft. Both companies continue to work hard to materially improve the performance, and we plan to provide an update on our joint efforts at our next earnings call. 
Turning back out, let's spend a few moments on how transition-related expenses and restructuring charges impacted our total reported operating income. Here, I once again refer you to Page 6 of the earnings presentation on IR site. To the right of our ongoing operating income column, you'll see transition expenses of $37 million and restructuring charges of $129 million. You'll also see an additional column labeled Deal-Related. This refers to the initial expense incurred in preparation for the Alibaba sale transaction. We'll continue to break out transaction fees going forward as they're nonoperational in nature. The majority of these fees be will recognized when the initial sale is closed. 
As I explained back in April, we're providing this insight to maximize transparency and thereby facilitate your ability to track the operational performance of the company. We fully realize that the multiple views also create the potential for confusion, however. To help achieve clarity, the following is a step-by-step walk from ongoing to reported operating income. Beginning with $228 million ongoing operating income, we deduct $37 million for transition-related expense. That brings operating income down to roughly $190 million. Back in April, we did provide a guidance midpoint of $155 million on this basis, and it's also the same basis as the current $170 million consensus in Wall Street models. Therefore, we exceeded the midpoint of our own guidance by $35 million and consensus by $20 million. From that consensus basis, we deduct the 2 unguided cost elements of restructuring for $129 million and deal-related costs for $7 million to arrive at the final reported GAAP operating income of $55 million. 
With respect to the $37 million transition cost bucket, we landed $8 million below the midpoint we've communicated back in April. As a reminder, these are the costs that we've refinanced [ph] for property rationalization, data center consolidation, improved cloud infrastructure utilization and the elimination or rightsizing of support functions. Without those efforts, we wouldn't be able to operate on the lower cost basis we're targeting in our ongoing model. At the end of the transition period, therefore, those costs will obviously go away completely. 
For the sake of completeness, let me provide a bit more color on the restructuring charge this quarter. It breaks down into the following components: $88 million for severance, $23 million for facilities exits and $18 million for asset write-downs. As we continue to execute the reduction in force and operational transformation over the next year, we will incur additional restructuring charges. Given the inherent variability of these kinds of charges, however, we'll continue to report and explain actual charges but not provide explicit guidance on them. 
That's my second quarter overview for today. Typically, we'd also provide guidance for the upcoming quarter. In light of the announcement we made yesterday, however, we believe it's best to give our new CEO time to get acclimated to Yahoo! before providing any future guidance. 
With that, let me share some highlights of the recent progress we've made on content relationships and technology solutions. Starting with content, this quarter, we continued to develop and expand key relationships with premier media companies, including ABC News, CNBC, Eurosport, Spotify and Clear Channel. 
Briefly on each. In news, our ABC News deal combines their world-class television content with Yahoo!'s massive online audience and targeting capabilities. We're seeing very promising results from the partnership, particularly in online news video viewership. In June, Yahoo! News and ABC News accounted for nearly 50% of all PC-based online news videos viewed in the United States, according to comScore. 
In finance, the CNBC agreement expands the ability of Yahoo! Finance to create and deliver premium finance content and strengthens our position as the most viewed and utilized finance site in the world. 
In sports, we extended our agreement with Eurosport to allow Yahoo! to continue to bring exclusive, high-quality sports content online in key international markets. 
In music and entertainment, our recently announced deals with Spotify and Clear Channel provide us with new ways to build audiences and distribute premium music and entertainment content and experiences. 
In addition to these new and enhanced content partnerships, we've also made progress on several key technology innovations, including Social Bar, Search Axis and Genome. Social Bar was launched in September to enable users on Yahoo! and Facebook to share content with their friends and has since become one of the top overall applications on the Facebook platform, steadily increasing to approximately 90 million installations today. 
Search Axis, which launched in May, serves as a mobile browser or a desktop browser plug-in, providing instant answers using an intuitive interface that expands the display thumbnail previews as a user types in a search. 
We're not just innovating for consumers but also for our advertisers. We recently launched Genome for marketers. Genome combines an expansive audience data set, leading data analytics and a premier media footprint with Yahoo!'s unique technology at scale. 
We feel good about all these signs of progress. And I'd also like to highlight 2 important upcoming events for Yahoo! that are right around the corner: the Summer Olympics and the 2012 elections. In Olympics, we expect Yahoo! will once again be the most viewed site in the category and take a leading position for online coverage with original video programs, breaking news and expert analysis. And the upcoming U.S. elections will allow us another opportunity to demonstrate our leadership in online coverage and audience engagement for major events with help from some outstanding new talent and leadership in our Washington bureau. 
Before we proceed to Q&A, let me also provide a quick update on the progress of our Alibaba sale transaction. In May, we announced a transaction in which we intend to sell up to half of our current ownership in Alibaba Group at an attractive valuation. Alibaba management reports that the financing efforts for this transaction are well on track and the closing date should be well within the 6 months we've previously communicated. 
Thank you for your time today. And as a reminder, I appreciate your understanding that my answers to your questions may be somewhat limited on this call, but I'll be happy to address all I can. Operator, let's begin the Q&A session."

So on the first, other revenue, we had talked -- if you recall last year, we talked about this definition of our headwinds that included these broadband step-downs, primarily AT&T. A little bit of, I think, Rogers and BT in there also, but AT&T was the biggest number. And that, from first quarter to second quarter, had its final step-down. And if you were to add back AT&T and these other couple of other small things to the broad -- to the other number this year -- this quarter, I should say, of $222 million, you get back to flat year-over-year, which is, we think, on an ongoing basis kind of more, well, representative of where we're going there. So it really is the same thing we've been talking about for over a year, and I'm happy to say it's taken the last sequential step-down. So I -- we'll live through it this year for the year-over-year comparisons, but we're getting out of the woods there. Then on Search, we know it was up 7%. So that was pretty nice. It was gratifying. I think the teams are doing some great job -- a great job there. The Affiliates were down a couple of percent therefore if you're doing the math. And the biggest factor there is really, again, one of these headwinds we've talked about before, which is the Yahoo! Japan search fee. So the fee rate actually. It's not expressed in dollars but in fee rate. There was one more step-down that happened to -- down to this year. So that step-down has taken its final step. If you would have excluded that, then actually our Affiliates would have been up kind of low -- mid, actually, mid-single digits. So things, again, seem to be steadying out. We're getting a little bit of growth."

First of all, on Search PVs [ph], the actual -- each query doesn't necessarily trigger a PV [ph]. So in keeping with our answer's not linked at strategy, if you get better at getting results on that search page, then PVs [ph] will be much farther down than queries. As I noted in my script, we're actually up slightly in queries, and that's truly what the financials are kind of hooked off of. So that is an exaggerated number there, not necessarily representative of either user experience or where our financials are hooked off of. On that page also, just to get to this, the U.S. core search number, that -- down 17%, first of all that's comScore number, but it also includes the contextual searches and there's a huge problem with the comp against last year with the bin Laden death. I think it was in May of last year. Your second question was on Display. And the TAC is really interclick. So the interclick acquisition, because of the way the accounting works on that, drives up our Display TAC. And then the Search is really coming down as E-M-E-A, our EMEA region, transitions markets from Panama, our monetization system to adCenter, Microsoft's monetization system. And then finally, on the RPS guarantee, so we are covered under this guarantee until the end of first quarter next year. So we still have 9 months or so to go. Again, well, as we get closer to that time, we'll see where our GAAP looks to be. We'll see what, well, Microsoft are going to be doing about it. And we'll make sure that we're transparent on that. The -- in terms of ultimately the outs for the deals and the agreement that we've made public for a while now, I think it -- well, no, not I think. It is after 5 years, there was an RPS threshold versus the market leader that we must be at. And if we are not at that, then there is an out."

But I don't really have any more detail to provide at this point. And then on the RPS performance quarter-over-quarter, nothing material. I mean, all year, I would say, from where we were in fourth quarter to first and then first to second quarter, not an encouraging amount of progress to be reported, unfortunately. Continue to work hard, and there are a lot of things that are going very well. In Search, as I said, growth of 7% on an O&O basis with some query growth. That is encouraging. And again, I'll give credit to our internal team here who works on the other things that impact RPS outside of what's going on in the marketplace that is obviously run by Microsoft. We do a lot of things in terms of the page layout and the design in terms of getting people to click through. And our sales force does a great job in helping customers maintain or optimize their campaign. So a lot of good work going on, but we need to get that marketplace RPS. That really should be a big benefit to us from the combined volume of both us and Microsoft. We need to get that where it needs to be. So we'll continue to work that very diligently."

In second quarter, it was a really tough comp, to be frank. We had record levels in 2Q that have been lumped up, as I said, within May. The royal wedding was in April. So there were a lot of tough comps in there. So we're in mid-single digits, not really where we want to be. But in context, not overly bad.

But given the time frame you've laid out, it's on track assuming nothing earlier. As we look into 2013, can you provide any kind of summary review as to how much equity income would peel off as you go through the year as a result of that on Alibaba? And then secondly, I know you've laid out in May pretty clearly that the bulk of the liquidation would be used for buyback. You've always been buying back. Is that still -- should we still assume that the bulk of that would be buyback? Or is there any thought to funneling some of that towards any organic or M&A investment without putting any kind of levels or targets on that, obviously, just in terms of approach."

Our 30-point stake is down to 20. So the numbers would be cut in half. Of course, a bunch of the shares that we sell back are going to be retired. So then, we'll accrete up to probably 22% or 23%, somewhere in that area. So we'll gain a little bit back. Well -- and then, of course, you'll have the growth in the Alibaba underlying results, the operating results. That'll help offset that, too. So where all that nets out, I don't know. But as I said earlier, most of our EPS growth this year was driven by our equity investments. And within that number, the majority of it was Alibaba. So it's really on a nice trend. They're doing a great job of not only growing their markets, growing their revenue but also growing their earnings. Secondly, on the buyback, we haven't decided on a form yet of the buyback, but I think, again, the Board is committed to returning all --  substantially all of those proceeds to shareholders with a form to be determined. In terms of using it for organic purposes, we've got a good cash balance. Actually, currently, we have debt capacity. We have some opportunities to do what I think we need to do organically. I don't see where we necessarily need to tap into that $4-plus billion of proceeds to do anything organically. We do have our own flexibility there."

I can see at this point about $7 million quarter-over-quarter of adverse impact from currencies. But on the upside, interclick should still continue to move forward. And we do have the Olympics. The Olympics, we feel good about. I mean, that's not only an engagement driver, but also it has real revenue attached to it. We have some great big-name partners. And then the elections. I also mentioned that in the script, the elections, that the spending on elections obviously starts early here in the third quarter and will go through November, obviously.

And could you tell us about kind of what the long-term margin and what were the slide factors here that got us the extra 250 basis points in the current quarter that maybe will fall off in the next couple of quarters?"

But look at Page 6 on our earnings presentation on the IR site, and you can see there, especially on the bottom, we came in at $1.081 billion in revenue against the",481,"Sure. I mean, I'll reference back to my script because I went through this in some detail. But look at Page 6 on our earnings presentation on the IR site, and you can see there, especially on the bottom, we came in at $1.081 billion in revenue against the outlook of business -- our business outlook, midpoint, I should say, of $1.085 billion. Our ongoing expenses, so this is zeroing in on the business, excluding transition costs and excluding restructuring charges, we guided about $885 million. And therefore, on the midpoint, $1.085 billion less $885 million was $200 million of ongoing operating income. That is, to be exact, 18.4% margin. So roughly 18.5%, as I said, in my script. We came in substantially lower on ongoing costs, $32 million lower. And that, as I noted in my script, was really the result of the uncertainty that we've been seeing. It's a time of extraordinary change here. And given what we've been through, it's tough to get traction on the spending and investments that we're trying to make that we described back on the April call. So the majority of the reason that we were able to overachieve, ending at $228 million ongoing operating income instead of $200 million, is really that cost variability. Not a great reason to beat the number, and that's why I say it's a little bit ahead of schedule. We have things that we need to invest in, again, apart from the dollars we're spending to get to that end state, where this ongoing operating model is all you'll see of Yahoo!, you don't have the transition, you don't have the restructuring. Apart from the efforts to get to there, there are things we need to invest in, in order to win. And we've talked about mobile on this call, we've talked about video on this call, we've talked about other engagement drivers, from content and content partnerships. Those are great examples. And there are other technologies when you widen the scope in terms of personalization technologies and targeting technologies for our advertisers. Again, on the script, I mentioned Genome. So we have more that we need to do to transform this company and get it operating in the kind of robust growth range that we're looking for in terms of revenue growth. And as a reminder, in the long-term model, we're trying to drive the existing business up to something like 25% operating margin to provide room, call it, 5 points of operating margin to invest in the business in new areas of growth such that we have a reported number of operating margin of 20%. So we're just so early in that process that I say we're just ahead of schedule. This is just the beginning, there's a lot -- and a lot more pieces to play out here. But that's generally where we're going."

So that has all gotten better. And the front page, I've often used that as kind of a gauge of how we're improving. The front page days sold was up year-over-year substantially as well.

But going forward, it's really -- as we start to see our class 2 or non-guaranteed business start to grow more and especially not just in volume but more so in monetization through targeting, that's going to -- those are going to be the big, big determinants of our success there. Then in terms of new front, we had great turnout and a lot of great engagement with top advertisers. We're seeing a lot more traction with them and a very positive response to our original programming in general. There are over 20 original video programs each month. And we're continuing to drive engagement. And the more we can focus -- as we've said too on our last call, the more we could focus on advertiser ROI and continue to do better with our sales force and do better with our technology in terms of helping advertiser ROI, the more business that we're going to bring back.

Since this is Marissa's first day on the job, she will not be joining us on the call today. However, she is very mindful of the importance of the investor community, and I'm sure that you'll be hearing from her soon. Suffice to say that everyone at Yahoo! is incredibly energized today and looking forward to working with our new CEO. 
While I recognize you all have a lot of questions for her about Yahoo!'s future plans, I obviously won't be able to address those questions for you today on the earnings call. I will spend some time providing an overview of our results and progress in the quarter and also give you a brief update on the status of our planned sale of part of our stake in Alibaba Group, after which we'll have a brief Q&A session. I'm happy to answer what questions I can, but I ask for your patience on those questions we can't address today. 
So let's start with the second quarter financial results. In 2Q, Yahoo!'s revenue x TAC grew slightly year-over-year with both Search and Display up. 2Q operating income on an ongoing basis was well ahead of the guidance midpoint provided on last quarter's call. 
Back in April, we initiated a restructuring plan intended to consolidate technology platforms, transition dozens of properties and free up investment dollars for growth opportunities. As a result, we guided you to think of our expenses and operating income in 3 distinct parts: ongoing operating income, transition-related expenses and restructuring charges. The sum of those parts, of course, is equal to our reported numbers in total. To help visualize this framework, please access our Investor Relations site and see Page 6 of our earnings presentation entitled, 2Q Operating Income Detail. 
With that overview format to guide us, our more detailed second quarter financial commentary is as follows: Revenue x TAC of $1,081,000,000 was fractionally under the guidance midpoint and grew about 0.5% year-over-year. On our April earnings call, we discussed the potential for a number of uncertainties in 2Q related to our reduction in force and business unit reorganization. As it turns out, there are many other dynamics that also played out over these past 3 months. And in that context, we're pleased to be so close to the midpoint. 
Turning to ongoing operating income, excluding unusual costs such as restructuring charges and transition-related expense, in the second quarter, we generated $228 million or $28 million above the guidance midpoint. On an apples-to-apples basis with last year, ongoing operating income grew 19%. 
With regard to margin rates, we guided a midpoint of roughly 18.5% on an ongoing basis and exceeded that expectation by a full 2.5 points, landing at 21%. While a low 20% margin rate is representative of our longer-term aspirations, at this time it's a bit ahead of schedule primarily as a result of lower costs related to the uncertainty we've been experiencing. 
Rounding out the income statement, earnings per diluted share were $0.18 for second quarter, up slightly from the prior year. However, that reported result included restructuring and Alibaba deal-related charges of $0.08 that were specifically unguided on our last earnings call. Excluding those charges, EPS was $0.27 this quarter or 47% above last year primarily as a result of growth in our equity investments and share repurchases. 
Finally, within the quarter, we made a substantial down payment on returning the expected proceeds from our Alibaba sale. Share repurchases for 2Q were $456 million or roughly 30 million shares at an average price of $15.34 per share. This brings the total capital return to shareholders via share repurchases since 2009 to over $4 billion at an average price of $14.81 per share.
Let's move now to a deeper discussion of second quarter x TAC revenue results. By revenue category, year-over-year Display grew 1%, reversing declines in the past 2 consecutive quarters, while Search grew 4% and other revenue declined 7% on the final material step-down in broadband fee amortization that we've previously noted. 
Within Display, this quarter, our Americas region crossed into positive growth territory, and APAC grew double digits. EMEA, on the other hand, declined 7% [ph] as demand continued to be weak as a result of the macroeconomic climate. 
As I did last quarter, let me focus on our Americas turnaround with more detail. First, media property page views grew mid-single digits. Second, total graphical supply, including Mail, declined in the high single digits, a slight improvement in year-over-year trends compared to prior quarters. Third, sell-through rates of guaranteed or premium ads improved substantially year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, a good indication that our sales force continues to become more effective. Pricing was a little softer than expected, but yield did rise slightly year-over-year as premium ad mix improved. Finally, our interclick acquisition continued to ramp with strong, double-digit year-over-year growth and a positive quarter-over-quarter contribution to our top line, albeit at a slower pace than planned. 
Moving now to Search, x TAC revenue grew by 4% year-over-year driven by 7% improvement on our Owned and Operated sites. O&O search query volume registered slight growth on a global basis, and Yahoo!-generated RPS gains represented the remainder of the improvement versus last year. Unfortunately, similar to last quarter, we're unable to report progress by Microsoft on closing the gap in marketplace RPS. The Search Alliance marketplace RPS continues to be below our goal and, therefore, we are still benefiting from the RPS guarantee from Microsoft. Both companies continue to work hard to materially improve the performance, and we plan to provide an update on our joint efforts at our next earnings call. 
Panning back out, let's spend a few moments on how transition-related expenses and restructuring charges impacted our total reported operating income. Here, I once again refer you to Page 6 of the earnings presentation on our IR site. To the right of our ongoing operating income column, you'll see transition expenses of $37 million and restructuring charges of $129 million. You'll also see an additional column labeled Deal-Related. This refers to the initial expense incurred in preparation for the Alibaba sale transaction. We'll continue to break out transaction fees going forward as they're nonoperational in nature. The majority of these fees will be recognized when the initial sale is closed. 
As I explained back in April, we're providing this insight to maximize transparency and thereby facilitate your ability to track the operational performance of the company. We fully realize that the multiple views also create the potential for confusion, however. To help achieve clarity, the following is a step-by-step walk from ongoing to reported operating income. Beginning with $228 million ongoing operating income, we deduct $37 million for transition-related expense. That brings operating income down to roughly $190 million. Back in April, we did provide a guidance midpoint of $155 million on this basis, and it's also the same basis as the current $170 million consensus in Wall Street models. Therefore, we exceeded the midpoint of our own guidance by $35 million and consensus by $20 million. From that consensus basis, we deduct the 2 unguided cost elements of restructuring for $129 million and deal-related costs for $7 million to arrive at the final reported GAAP operating income of $55 million. 
With respect to the $37 million transition cost bucket, we landed $8 million below the midpoint we communicated back in April. As a reminder, these are the costs that we've refinanced [ph] for property rationalization, data center consolidation, improved cloud infrastructure utilization and the elimination or right-sourcing of support functions. Without those efforts, we wouldn't be able to operate on the lower cost basis we're targeting in our ongoing model. At the end of the transition period, therefore, those costs will obviously go away completely. 
For the sake of completeness, let me provide a bit more color on the restructuring charge this quarter. It breaks down into the following components: $88 million for severance, $23 million for facilities exits and $18 million for asset write-downs. As we continue to execute the reduction in force and operational transformation over the next year, we will incur additional restructuring charges. Given the inherent variability of these kinds of charges, however, we'll continue to report and explain actual charges but not provide explicit guidance on them. 
That's my second quarter overview for today. Typically, we'd also provide guidance for the upcoming quarter. In light of the announcement we made yesterday, however, we believe it's best to give our new CEO time to get acclimated to Yahoo! before providing any future guidance. 
With that, let me share some highlights of the recent progress we've made on content relationships and technology solutions. Starting with content, this quarter, we continued to develop and expand key relationships with premier media companies, including ABC News, CNBC, Eurosport, Spotify and Clear Channel. 
Briefly on each. In news, our ABC News deal combines their world-class television content with Yahoo!'s massive online audience and targeting capabilities. We're seeing very promising results from the partnership, particularly in online news video viewership. In June, Yahoo! News and ABC News accounted for nearly 50% of all PC-based online news videos viewed in the United States, according to comScore. 
In finance, the CNBC agreement expands the ability of Yahoo! Finance to create and deliver premium finance content and strengthens our position as the most viewed and utilized finance site in the world. 
In sports, we extended our agreement with Eurosport to allow Yahoo! to continue to bring exclusive, high-quality sports content online in key international markets. 
In music and entertainment, our recently announced deals with Spotify and Clear Channel provide us with new ways to build audiences and distribute premium music and entertainment content and experiences. 
In addition to these new and enhanced content partnerships, we've also made progress on several key technology innovations, including Social Bar, Search Axis and Genome. Social Bar was launched in September to enable users on Yahoo! and Facebook to share content with their friends and has since become one of the top overall applications on the Facebook platform, steadily increasing to approximately 90 million installations today. 
Search Axis, which launched in May, serves as a mobile browser or a desktop browser plug-in, providing instant answers using an intuitive interface that expands the display thumbnail previews as a user types in a search. 
We're not just innovating for consumers but also for our advertisers. We recently launched Genome for marketers. Genome combines an expansive audience data set, leading data analytics and a premier media footprint with Yahoo!'s unique technology at scale. 
We feel good about all these signs of progress. And I'd also like to highlight 2 important upcoming events for Yahoo! that are right around the corner: the Summer Olympics and the 2012 elections. In Olympics, we expect Yahoo! will once again be the most viewed site in the category and take a leading position for online coverage with original video programs, breaking news and expert analysis. And the upcoming U.S. elections will allow us another opportunity to demonstrate our leadership in online coverage and audience engagement for major events with help from some outstanding new talent and leadership in our Washington bureau. 
Before we proceed to Q&A, let me also provide a quick update on the progress of our Alibaba sale transaction. In May, we announced a transaction in which we intend to sell up to half of our current ownership in Alibaba Group at an attractive valuation. Alibaba management reports that the financing efforts for this transaction are well on track and the closing date should be well within the 6 months we've previously communicated. 
Thank you for your time today. And as a reminder, I appreciate your understanding that my answers to your questions may be somewhat limited on this call, but I'll be happy to address all I can. Operator, let's begin the Q&A session."

The -- actually, the macro weakness we're seeing is primarily in Europe. What we saw in the U.S. was, as you said, pricing was a little soft, volume actually was a little better, interclick was a little bit below expectations. So those were the major factors that were involved in Display this quarter. I don't know that I'd say we saw anything overwhelming in terms of demand in the U.S. I mean, obviously, the Fed's comments today were a little bit cool on the economy, and that probably colors things perhaps going into the second half. But with pricing specifically, we've had a few strong quarters of pricing in a row, so it wasn't -- again, it wasn't bad, but it was a little bit less than we expected, a little bit softer. I wouldn't draw any conclusions necessarily just yet, though."

So on the first, other revenue, we had talked -- if you recall last year, we talked about this definition of our headwinds that included these broadband step-downs, primarily AT&T. A little bit of, I think, Rogers and BT in there also, but AT&T was the biggest number. And that, from first quarter to second quarter, had its final step-down. And if you were to add back AT&T and these other couple of other small things to the broad -- to the other number this year -- this quarter, I should say, of $222 million you get back to flat year-over-year, which is, we think, on an ongoing basis kind of more representative of where we're going there. So it really is the same thing we've been talking about for over a year, and I'm happy to say it's taken the last sequential step-down. So we'll have to live through it this year for the year-over-year comparisons, but we're getting out of the woods there. Then on Search, we know it was up 7%. So that was pretty nice. It was gratifying. I think the teams are doing some great job -- a great job there. The Affiliates were down a couple of percent therefore if you're doing the math. And the biggest factor there is really, again, one of these headwinds we've talked about before, which is the Yahoo! Japan search fee. So the fee rate actually. It's not expressed in dollars but in fee rate. There was one more step-down that happened to -- down to this year. So that step-down has taken its final step. If you would have excluded that, then actually our Affiliates would have been up kind of low -- mid, actually, mid-single digits. So things, again, seem to be steadying out. We're getting a little bit of growth. Thanks for the question."

And then also, if you look at the Search TAC as a percentage of Search revenue and the Display TAC as a percentage of Display revenue, you'll see that they're trending in an opposite direction where Display was going up fairly meaningfully and Search was going down. Could you kind of explain that? And then finally, on the Microsoft RPS guarantee, can you remind us just how the contract worked?

As I noted in my script, we're actually up slightly in queries, and that's truly what the financials are kind of hooked off of. So that is an exaggerated number there, not necessarily representative of either user experience or where our financials are hooked off of. On that page also, just to get to this, the U.S. core search number, that -- down 17%, first of all that's comScore number, but it also includes the contextual searches and there's a huge problem with the comp against last year with the bin Laden death. I think it was in May of last year. Your second question was on Display. And the TAC is really interclick. So the interclick acquisition, because of the way the accounting works on that, drives up our Display TAC. And then the Search is really coming down as E-M-E-A, our EMEA region, transitions markets from Panama, our monetization system to adCenter, Microsoft's monetization system. And then finally, on the RPS guarantee, so we are covered under this guarantee until the end of first quarter next year. So we still have 9 months or so to go. Again, we'll, as we get closer to that time, we'll see where our GAAP looks to be. We'll see what, well, Microsoft are going to be doing about it. And we'll make sure that we're transparent on that. The -- in terms of ultimately the outs for the deals in the agreement that we've made public for a while now, I think it -- well, I know, not I think.

And again, I'll give credit to our internal team here who works on the other things that impact RPS outside of what's going on in the marketplace that is obviously run by Microsoft. We do a lot of things in terms of the page layout and the design in terms of getting people to click through. And our sales force does a great job in helping customers maintain or optimize their campaign. So a lot of good work going on, but we need to get that marketplace RPS.

As you look into 2013, can you provide any kind of summary view as to how much equity income would peel off as you go through the year as a result of that on Alibaba? And then secondly, I know you've laid out in May pretty clearly that the bulk of the liquidation would be used for buyback. You've obviously been buying back.

Our 30-point stake goes down to 20. So the numbers would be cut in half. Of course, a bunch of the shares that we sell back are going to be retired. So then, we'll accrete up to probably 22% or 23%, somewhere in that area. So we'll gain a little bit back that way. And then, of course, you'll have the growth in the Alibaba underlying results, the operating results. That'll help offset that, too. So where all that nets out, I don't know. But as I said earlier, most of our EPS growth here was driven by our equity investments. And within that number, the majority of it was Alibaba. So it's really on a nice trend. They're doing a great job of not only growing their markets, growing their revenue but also growing their earnings. Secondly, on the buyback, we haven't decided on a form yet of the buyback, but I think, again, the Board is committed to returning all -- or substantially all of those proceeds to shareholders with a form to be determined. In terms of using it for organic purposes, we've got a good cash balance. Actually, currently, we have debt capacity. We have some opportunities to do what I think we need to do organically.

I mean, obviously, Marissa is a high-caliber, well-respected leader. She knows the industry well. She does have strong tech and engineering and product expertise, as you noted. I mean, her resume really speaks for itself. And we are very happy to have such a top-notch CEO in place, excited to have her join the team. And we're just going to have to take a little bit of time to work through exactly what that means in terms of the direction. But I think it's safe to say we need to be really good at certain technologies and we need to be great at content. And both of those are imperative to our success. So it's finding the right mix and balance and spending our money in a way that most effectively drives returns. So our new CEO, Marissa, brings strong tech background, but we also have exceptional and deepening media expertise here as well. So we got to combine them and it's a powerful combination when you get it right. In terms of Facebook, what it is, is it's going to be a closer collaboration between the companies, and it's going to extend and expand our distribution arrangements, settles all of the outstanding claims between the companies. And we feel good to be on, again, a steady footing there. It's a big result. If you look at Social Bar that we're doing with Facebook, I said there are 90 million installations so far, that's been very successful. It's a great way to turn these engagement trends in the right direction. And we expect that this relationship, a deeper relationship, is going to be good for both companies.

I mean, I reference back to my script because I went through this in some detail. But look at Page 6 on our earnings presentation on the IR site, and you can see there, especially on the bottom, we came in at $1.081 billion in revenue against the outlook of business -- our business outlook, midpoint, I should say, of $1.085 billion. Our ongoing expenses, so this is zeroing in on the business, excluding transition costs and excluding restructuring charges, we guided about $885 million. And therefore, on the midpoint, $1.085 billion less $885 million was $200 million of ongoing operating income. That is, to be exact, 18.4% margin. So roughly 18.5%, as I said, in my script. We came in substantially lower on ongoing costs, $32 million lower. And that, as I noted in my script, was really the result of the uncertainty that we've been seeing. It's a time of extraordinary change here. And given what we've been through, it's tough to get traction on the spending and investments that we're trying to make that we described back on the April call. So the majority of the reason that we were able to overachieve, ending at $228 million ongoing operating income instead of $200 million, is really that cost variability. Not a great reason to beat the number, and that's why I say it's a little bit ahead of schedule. We have things that we need to invest in, again, apart from the dollars we're spending to get to that end state, where this ongoing operating model is all you'll see of Yahoo!, you won't have the transition, you won't have the restructuring. Apart from the efforts to get to there, there are things we need to invest in, in order to win. And we've talked about mobile on this call, we've talked about video on this call, we've talked about other engagement drivers, from content and content partnerships. Those are great examples. And there are other technologies when you widen the scope in terms of personalization technologies and targeting technologies for our advertisers. Again, on the script, I mentioned Genome. So we have more that we need to do to transform this company and get it operating in the kind of robust growth range that we're looking for in terms of revenue growth. And as a reminder, in the long-term model, we're trying to drive the existing business up to something like 25% operating margin to provide room, call it, 5 points of operating margin to invest in the business in new areas of growth such that we have a reported number of operating margin of 20%. So we're just so early in that process that I say we're just ahead of schedule. This is just the beginning, there's a lot -- and a lot more pieces to play out here. But that's generally where we're going. Thanks, Laura."

That's when we did the big [indiscernible] and replace of the sales force and embarked on this current course. And we've seen basically quarter-by-quarter the sell-through rates improve. We are now above the sell-through rates we were at second quarter last year, approaching kind of where we want them to be. Not quite there yet but approaching where we want them to be. So that has all gotten better. And the front page, I've often used that as kind of a gauge of how we're improving. The front page days sold was up year-over-year substantially as well. So that has recovered, too. So a couple of encouraging signs there. So in terms of your second question, the ad categories, I didn't really look.

So we keep track of it on both bases obviously internally here. But going forward, it's really -- as we start to see our class 2 or non-guaranteed business start to grow more and especially not just in volume but more so in monetization through targeting, that's going to -- those are going to be the big, big determinants of our success there. Then in terms of new front, we had great turnout and a lot of great engagement with top advertisers. We're seeing a lot more traction with them and a very positive response to our original programming in general. There are over 20 original video programs each month. And we're continuing to drive engagement. And the more we can focus -- as we've said too on our last call, the more we could focus on advertiser ROI and continue to do better with our sales force and do better with our technology in terms of helping advertiser ROI, the more business that we're going to bring back.

I'd like to start by saying that I'm thrilled to be here at Yahoo! and I'm happy to give all of you an update on the business today. My first nearly 100 days have been incredibly energizing and, honestly, a lot of fun. 
Yahoo! is a truly iconic company, one that I've had respect for since I first discovered it as a Stanford student back in 1994. At that time, Yahoo! was called Jerry and Dave's sky to the World Wide Web. Even then, it was obvious what an essential tool and the incredible potential. 
Beyond that potential and its storied history, some of you might ask why did I, in particular, come to Yahoo!. In short, this job is tailor-made for me. The core components of Yahoo!'s business, Search, Mail, ads, mobile, News and the Homepage are also the core products that I've built my career upon. So answer is simple. I came to Yahoo! to grow and to help redefine one of the Internet's most beloved companies. 
This afternoon, I'd like to discuss my priorities over the past quarter, including our efforts around people and products. And then, following Ken Goldman's review of the third quarter financials, I'll discuss the vision and direction for Yahoo! moving forward. 
Let's begin with our people. Companies are all about people and the companies with the best talent win. It's no secret that our team have experienced numerous changes this past year. On my very first in July, we've been zeroing in on the efficiency, well-being and accountability of our 12,000 employees. We built a culture, establishing an open dialogue with employees, as well as a commitment to transparency. We've put in place feedback tools, systems that remove bureaucracy, new performance measurements for Yahoo! and clearly laid out quarterly goals for the company. We are working to improve our execution. As of today, 93% of our employees have quarterly individual goals that map to company goals, and of course, one of our company goals is that we will soon be at 100%. 
True cultural change can't be bought, so the vast majority of what we've done has cost nothing. That said, we have made smart and thoughtful investments in new mobile phones for our employees so they can test our products and provide feedback. We've also begun to offer as a standard here in Silicon Valley at top companies and startups, for our hard-working employees. 
Our goals are simple: execute faster, return value to our shareholders, attract the best talent and make Yahoo! the absolute best place to work. In an incredibly short period of time, we have built a stellar world-class leadership team across all the core functions of the business: finance, sales, human resources, development, marketing and legal. In a moment, you'll hear from Ken Goldman, our new Chief Financial Officer, who brings more than 25 years of experience as a public company CFO to his role. Ken will help lead our financial fitness moving forward. 
Henrique de Castro will be joining as Yahoo!'s Chief Operating Officer. Henrique is one of the most respected and accomplished businesspeople in the realm of Internet. With his rigorous and analytical approach, delete our strategy and execution and enhancing our Advertising Solutions and the value that we provide to our advertisers. 
Ron Bell, a Yahoo! veteran with a rich 13-year history of the company, and an incredibly deep set of perspectives on the company's products and policies, has been promoted to be our General Counsel. 
We've also brought on Jacqueline Reses as head of people and development, with a background in private equity and reputation for doing smart and savvy deals in integration. Jackie is focused on hiring, acquiring and retaining the smartest minds in our industry. I'm already impressed with the change in talent pool of our candidates. It's increased in quality and volume. 
Finally, Kathy Savitt has brought her infectious energy and extensive consumer marketing experience as our new CMO, and she'll help us reimagine the Yahoo! brand. 
In Yahoo! fantasy sports, I will draft this exact group as my dream team. I'm positively thrilled to be working with them that we were able to attract such well-known and capable leaders and so quickly is a testimony to the Yahoo!'s potential. They join a capable and qualified management team that is already in place here at Yahoo!. 
In addition to focusing on our people and empowering them to execute, we've also focused on our products. Over the past 3 months, I dedicated significant time to product and business reviews with hundreds of our employees. We started with Search. While our search area's challenged, we're working closely with Microsoft to define the future of search. Many people are surprised to learn that our alliance with Microsoft affords Yahoo! significant control over our search user experience and the ability to innovate therein. We're also thinking aggressively about how to grow share from the market and not just trade search with each other. 
On the economics front, as we've said in the past, our alliance has fallen below our expectations, so we are benefiting from a revenue guarantee. Ken will talk more about this in a moment. 
Turning to mobile, our offerings and our usage has been growing nicely. As part of our mobile efforts this quarter, we've redesigned our mobile search page across 23 countries, resulting in increased usage. We released an updated version of Flickr for Android, which has been getting rave reviews from our end users, including thousands of 5-star ratings. And we've also launched into now 3.0, a fun way to connect with friends and get more from your TV watching. 
Looking at content, our high-quality content products differentiate Yahoo! and drive impressive user engagement. For example, in Q3, our global coverage around the 2012 London Olympic Games resulted in more traffic than we received for Vancouver and Beijing Games combined. Our users spent 3.5 billion minutes watching our Olympics programming, reading articles and viewing photos. 
Turning to advertising, in September, we announced that we will continue to own and invest in our Display ad technology, including guaranteed non-guaranteed Genome and the Right Media Display marketplace. We're deeply committed to our core technologies and platforms to ensure we continue to be leaders in this space. The advertising partners that I've talked to love the audience-based buying that Yahoo! enables. They will buy more if they could. Our opportunity in advertising is around making the ad platform and tools more efficient, but also increasing usage of our consumer products and, therefore, impressions, so we have more to sell. 
I'm very pleased with our people and product progress in Q3. It was an active and solid quarter with some nice achievement. In addition, as you know, in September, we reviewed our capital allocation strategy and we committed to return $3 billion of additional capital to our investors from the Alibaba transaction. At the current price levels, we think it's economically attractive to repurchase stock. However, we will continually to monitor the best method of returning capital to drive the most shareholder value. 
Finally, third quarter revenue was once again stable. We've now had 3 quarters of modest revenue growth and encouraging numbers in Search and Display. On that note, let me pass it over to Ken Goldman to walk through our Q3 financials in depth. Ken?"

Yahoo! is a well-respecte",1845,"Great, and thank you, Marissa. Good afternoon, all, and thank you for joining us today. I am excited to be joining Yahoo! and speaking to you all on my first official day as CFO. This is a proud company and I am proud to be here. Yahoo! is a well-respected global brand. Everyone that I have talked to want this company to succeed. Interestingly, I have received literally several hundred congratulatory messages and all of them note how they use Yahoo! Properties in their daily lives. As you will hear, I am a firm believer in Marissa's vision for the company and further Yahoo! as a great place to work. On the call today, I'll walk through the 3Q financial results and then provide detail on the impact to our financial statements from the Alibaba transaction. 
The relative 3Q highlights, I'll start off with some of our third quarter financials. As I refer to these measures, please view the slides available on our IR website to follow along, starting with Slide 5, financial and key metrics at a glance. 
Revenue x TAC of $1.89 billion grew 2% over last year and marked the third quarter in a row of modest revenue growth for the company. Global Display revenue x TAC was roughly flat in the quarter versus prior year as 4% growth in the Americas was offset by weakness in EMEA. Global search revenue x TAC grew 11% in Q3 2011 driven once again by improvements in Yahoo! sites, as well as a high guarantee payment from Microsoft in the prior year. 
Operating income, excluding restructuring charges of $25 million, was $177 million 3Q, a modest increase versus third quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP EPS, excluding restructuring charges and the impact of the Alibaba transaction, was $0.35 in the quarter, 56% higher than 3Q 2011. We've repurchased 190 million worth of stock in the quarter. And finally, we ended the quarter with approximately $9.4 billion in cash and investments. 
Now before I dive into details behind these numbers, I want to first give a brief high-level overview of the opportunity I see here and why I joined the company. Overall, I believe this company has tremendous assets through its massive, loyal audience and very promising products and properties in virtually every major category. Also clear to me that a lot of great work has been done over the last few years to strengthen the underlying fundamentals of the operating business, and real success has been achieved. We have much work to do and this will take some time, but the evidence of stabilized financial results is beginning to show in this quarter. 
Revenue is stable with 3Q representing the third quarter in a row of modest growth total revenue x TAC and second quarter in a row of Display revenue x TAC, the growth in the Americas region. Operating margins are healthy, so we also have room for upside once we're able to grow the top line and scale the business. We will also share we spend our resources with discipline, wisely and prudently, based on investing for growth and efficiency, and we have a very strong balance sheet with abundant liquidity. Our primary objective as the new management team, is to leverage our assets, competitive strengths and available resources to transition this company from financial stability to a growth business serving our customers with a distinct Yahoo! identity. We are very mindful of shareholder value creation. 
So let me walk through the financial results in more detail, and you can see these, turn to Slide 7 and 8. Display revenue x TAC was $452 million, roughly flat with the prior year. Breaking down Display by region, Americas region grew 4%, driven primarily by favorable pricing mix. Sell-through rates on Class 1 inventory improved once again, but we continue to face headwinds from declining available impressions at Class 2, particularly in Mail. Campaigns around the Olympics sold well during the quarter, will prove to be somewhat cannibalistic to other spending as few advertisers increased their overall budgets. 
In EMEA, trends were once again weak due primarily to the economy which negatively impacted Display revenue by approximately $9 million in the quarter. APAC Display x TAC was down slightly in  U.S. dollar terms, by roughly flat on a local currency basis. Going forward, we will endeavor to better understand margin contributions in each geographic region and how we can improve. Search revenue's x TAC once again performed well in the third quarter, growing 11% versus the prior year and 7% on a sequential basis, while the Yahoo!-driven RPS improvements, as well as our higher guaranteed payment, accounted for the upside in search. 
Looking at price and volume dynamics, the upside was driven by quick yield at PBC, including the RPS guarantee as total eligible searches were flat in the quarter on a global basis. From a regional perspective, similar trends prevailed in Display, with positive results in the Americas segment, offset by weakness in EMEA and a slight decline in APAC in U.S. dollar terms. 
And as it relates to Microsoft guaranteed payment, a number of factors go into calculating the amount, including variables of economic growth, which resulted in a higher year-over-year payment. Looking to the next year, as you all know, the current guarantee is set to expire in April 2013. If the revenue guarantee is not renewed, we view the total risk to our financials to be less than $100 million on an annualized basis. 
In terms of other revenue x TAC of $223 million, declined 10% versus the prior year, but it was flat sequentially. As was highlighted on the 2Q call, we will continue to feel the impact of the final broadband step-down when viewed on a year-over-year basis for 2 more quarters. But sequentially, there'll be no material additional impact. 
Also, going forward, Other revenue will be boosted by the amortization of the $550 million upfront payment related to the -- of the Alibaba Group. This payment will be amortized over 48 months and recognized in other revenue. At 3Q, this amount was just $4.5 million. However, in 4Q and beyond, we will recognize approximately $34 million of additional revenue per quarter. 
And now talk about operating expenses and operating income and you can see this on Slide 10, total operating expenses less TAC and adjusted for restructuring charges of $25 million were $912 million in the third quarter, resulting in adjusted operating margin x TAC of 16% in line with that of 3Q '11. Adjusted operating income x TAC modest increase to $177 million versus the prior year. 
Dipping down the income statement, the company was able to realize certain foreign tax risks in 3Q to improve net income by $135 million. This result is a negative effective tax rate in the quarter, excluding the Alibaba gain. 
I'm now going to turn to the balance sheet and cash flow, and you can see the key balance sheet and cash flow statement highlights on Slides 12 and 13. Capital expenditures was $140 million a quarter, up from levels experienced the prior 2 quarters, related primarily to our data center investments. Free cash flow was $920 million a quarter. The $500  million payment, free cash flow was $370 million in the quarter, which is up 50% from the prior year. As noted, our cash and investments balance of the end of the quarter was $9.4 billion. However, approximately $2.5 million of this is reserve for payment for taxes on the Alibaba transaction. In addition, we have included the $800 million of preferred equity we see from Alibaba as a separate item in the balance sheet, which is not included in the $9.4 billion figure just mentioned. 
At the end of the quarter, the market value of our stakes in Yahoo! Japan and Alibaba Group was $7.7 billion and $8.1 billion, using the quarter end closing price per share and the price pressure in the most recent transaction, respectively. 
So let me go through a few other activities and updates. Before I walk through the Alibaba and that, I am pleased to announce today we enter into an revolving credit facility with a capacity of $750 million .The facility is currently undrawn and expected to be used for general corporate purposes. As regards of the form and timing of churn of the proceeds from the Alibaba transaction as Marissa discussed in her remarks, we think it's within our best economic interest as well as shareholder interest to repurchase Yahoo! stock at these levels. 
In terms of Alibaba, let me walk through the transaction and how that had impact the financial statements this quarter as there are a number of adjustments to be made. First, as you know, we are pleased to close the first stage of previously announced transactions in September. And really, a special thank you goes out to Tim Morse for the great hard work he put to getting this deal done, but it was a sharp effort a great success for the company. He received gross proceeds in cash and preferred equity of $7.6 billion. $7.1 billion of this was from the sale of shares and $550 million related to the tippler [ph] . We received approximately $6.8 billion cash proceeds and $800 million in preferred equity. 
Top of the P&L, we recognized $4.5 million of other revenue from the amortization of the -- in the final few days of the quarter as mentioned earlier. Further down, you will see $4.6 billion in other income. This is book gain on sale net of transaction fees. Also included in this numbers is accrued interest in the preferred equity in the quarter which was just a few million dollars. And net gain realized after taxes and fees from the sale of shares was $2.8 billion during the quarter. 
On the cash flow cash flow statement, accrued expenses and liabilities related to this transaction increased by $2.5 billion. These relate to taxes owed, but not get paid on the sale of our Alibaba shares. Most of this cash will go out in Q4. On the close of the transaction, we now own approximately 24% of our Alibaba group's outstanding shares in addition to the $800 million preferred equity. Once again, the pretax value of our equity stake based on the recent transaction price per share of $15.50 is $8.1 billion, again, not including $800 million of preferred. Cost basis for tax purposes of this stake us approximately $250 million. 
So in terms of guidance, before I close, as you might expect, we are not prepared to give guidance today given my short history with the company. Between now and the next earnings call, we will evaluate what form of guidance to provide on an ongoing basis. 
Thank you for your time today. I am extremely excited to be here and look forward again to know and meet all of you. I also realize we would much rather hear from areas and your plans for the future, so I turn it back to Marissa"

I'm very pleased with our Q3 financial results. We have a very solid foundation on which now to grow. Fundamentally, Yahoo! is part of the consumer Internet, where growth",854,"Thank you, Ken, and thank you for joining the call on your very first a year Yahoo!. I'm very pleased with our Q3 financial results. We have a very solid foundation on which now to grow. Fundamentally, Yahoo! is part of the consumer Internet, where growth is expected. We'll become a growth company by inspiring and delighting our users. 
The first step is to grow at the same pace as the particular markets that we are in, which already do in a number of cases, but not all. Later, the goal will be to gain users and share disproportionately. 
Our vision and direction for Yahoo! is to make the world's daily habits inspiring and entertaining. Let's start with the daily habits part. At Yahoo!, we see users making daily use of search, Mail, the Homepage and mobile, among other offerings. Search is a core daily habit for all of us and a fundamental user behavior, the top priority for Yahoo!. We'll focus on reshaping search, driving smart distribution deals and making organic investments to grow our market share. There's a clear upside potential here as it's time now to execute against it. 
Communication is another of these daily habits and is primed to be reimagined. There's great opportunity to modernize Yahoo! Mail and Messenger come especially given the continual increase in the amount of communication we're all receiving. The Yahoo! Homepage is one of the biggest draws on the Web, including more content and being more precise in the targeting of content and advertisements to make this daily habit even more compelling for our users. Mobile represents not only a daily habit, but a fundamental and massive shift, a shift that we have to ride and participate in, in order to be relevant. Today, there are more than 1 billion smartphone users globally. As expected, that will double in the next 3 years. And while we've made progress, Yahoo! hasn't capitalized on the mobile opportunity. We haven't effectively optimized our website, we've underinvested in our mobile front-end development and we've splintered all brands. We have more than 76 applications across Android and IOS. All of this needed to change. Our top priority is a focused coherent, mobile strategy. We're accelerating our efforts to build a strong technical talent base for mobile. This includes engineers, product managers and designers. As the world becomes increasingly mobile, the way we all consume content has dramatically shifted. Interestingly we have the most frequent uses of smartphones, they include checking the weather, checking sports scores, checking stock quotes and other financial information, watching videos, sharing photos, getting the latest news and playing games. 
Does that sound like any particular company that you know? Yahoo! with its confident leadership in these key verticals, is already very well positioned here. We will continue to work with the top partners and media companies to further build and scale these opportunities. We'll strive to make a daily habit from smartphone tablets use more social, engaging, beautiful and compelling. 
Yahoo! as inspiring Daylighting our users. Much of that desperation delighted will stem from what we know and understand about our users and their needs. In that context, personalization of content and advertising is fundamental. Personalization has been part of our DNA for some time and it's key to a great user experience. Our Homepage alone serves millions of different combination of content every day. This deepest engagement that inspires our users actions, like clicking, reading and sharing. We discuss with personalization and we're going to continue to invest in shaping the future here. 
Inspiring and entertaining our users extend to our advertising partners as well. Using our solutions, advertisers can reach the audiences that want to engage with their brands. We'll continue to work with our advertising partners to create engaging, branded entertainment experiences, as well as seamless, programmatic buying opportunities. And with our renewed commitment to owning and growing our Display marketplace, our advertisers will continue to see Yahoo! as a key piece of their online strategy, with simple, targeted and effective advertising opportunities. Ultimately, we want to be the favorite partner of advertisers. 
In closing, while we have a lot to do, the future for Yahoo! is incredibly bright. Our extraordinary global reach and unique content position will allow us to build transformative products and compelling content that will be indispensable to people's daily lives. Our products will change how people learn, share and communicate. We will inspire, innovate and entertain. 
I came to Yahoo! to grow and help redefine one of the Internet's most beloved companies, but what I found is that I'm not alone in that passion. No 1 wants Yahoo! to grow more than the people who work here. We're committed to going back to our roots as a consumer Internet company, focused on user experience. The excitement and optimism that permeates Yahoo! right now is undeniable. And with the leadership and guidance of our new management team, it's time to execute. We believe that Yahoo!'s best days lie ahead. We intend to do great things and we intend to win. It now let's take some of your questions."

I don't think that this is a situation where there's a giant pivot and we're going through a completely different business. I think this is about improved execution and seeing the opportunities that are already apparent in our business, that means focusing on daily habits like Search, Mail, Homepage, Mobile. It means investing in key verticals we're already in a leadership position and we need to make the bridge to mobile, Finance, News, sports, Games, Messenger, Flickr, answers, groups, the core being properties here at Yahoo!. I also think it's really important for us to be a terrific company to partner with, not only for our advertisers, but also for other technology companies. Yahoo! occupies an interesting and unique space where we don't have as much channel conflict with other players and technology as many of our other comparable companies, which means that we can partner with different companies with their browsers, with social networks, with their mobile operating systems. And I think there's a great opportunity there. And I also think that the mobile wave is a huge way for us to ride and it's a great way for us to take our content in our current investments and make it more relevant moving forward. In terms of your second question, Search versus Display, these are already to very large, very successful businesses, so think it's difficult to say which 1 we should choose. It's a somewhat of a false dichotomy. That said, I do think that there is potentially more upside in search. We can see right now that given some of the monetization challenges we faced, that there is an opportunity, there is improved monetization. That said, the consolidation investment we've made yields so many impressions and page views and so much opportunity around brand advertisement for this very compelling. When I look at Yahoo!'s business, we, again, occupying their interesting and unique space and the market where what we see is that, because we have people who are interested in finance or interested in entertainment news, interested in sports, we fundamentally have a great segmentation of audiences already. And many of the other people who operate in terms of display advertising are either less granular and they understand less about their users or are much more granular. When we find when I talked to advertisers, what I've seen and heard from them is, that the way that audiences tend to aggregate on Yahoo! is unique and particularly advantageous for them in terms of what they ultimately want for audience-based to buying. And then for that reason, I think that I'm bullish on both Search and Display, but I really think, given the trend towards audience-based buying in the advertising space, the Display opportunity is particularly compelling."

On the international market, there are, we are really looking -- again, we're looking here to build growth. And so as we've assessed different countries, one of the things we wanted to do is we want to really bring a coherence to our offerings across different markets. So while we have some markets where our product offerings are very different and we intend -- and we are very successful and we intend to keep them in place that way, I do think there's an opportunity for us to take our very vast set of offerings, merit it to a very compelling set of offerings and really make it much more compelling a lot around the world. For example, you may -- in terms of how we made changes in the future, you may have seen, for example, our News on Friday of closing our Korean operations. The reason we chose to do that is because as much as it was a very successful market for us historically, and it's something that we're very proud of the team there, we have a great team and they worked very hard, we had a hard time finding a growth story moving forward. Well, that isn't the case with many of the other markets. So I think we're likely to stay in markets where we see an opportunity for growth, be it on the desktop or in mobile and we're likely to withdraw from markets where we don't see growth. Though, I will say that to date, Korea has been an unusual except exception in that phase. In terms of the question around local, it is something I've spent a lot of time working on and I really do love and I'm very compelled by. That said, I also have a deep respect for it, but it's very hard to do it well. It requires a deep investment, a lot of people, a lot of energy and time to build terrific listings. We have some offerings in the space already, including Yahoo!'s small and medium business offerings where we host websites and the stores. We also have Yahoo! maps where we have licenses in place to support that, so I think that our local offerings are good at the moment. I think it's hard to take that next step to provide even deeper functionality. And so while we don't intend to make significant changes there in the short term, I do think that it's probably not an area where we're going to invest heavily moving forward."

We don't have any in my that I'm going to talk to today, but we do want have the flexibility to look at acquisitions that's strategic and that do further our ability to grow in order in addition to organic growth because we fundamentally believe that growth is really key and core to basically show -- creating shareholder value over time here."

That said, there are times, like in the case of data centers, where you need to spend in order to reduce latency and overall improve user experience. So we're making some investments there. In terms of possible acquisitions, I want to echo what Ken said. We don't have critical acquisitions in mind today. We duty the flexibility where if we see something that aligns well with our business and provides terrific growth that we can make that acquisition. That said, one of the things that is lost on people is because so many of the high-profile tech acquisition are above the $1 billion mark, people tend to think that tech acquisitions are all in that space and that's just not the case. Many acquisitions and most acquisitions, a vast majority, are less than $100 million. And so what we're looking for smaller scale acquisitions that align well overall with our businesses. In my history and my career, I've done about 20 or so such acquisitions and I think that the size and scale that's comfortable for a great integration, a great product coming out of it is something that's much more in the size and scale of double-digit millions and low hundreds of millions."

The tax rate on Alibaba was probably closer to 40% so they can figure it all out. So I think there's really nothing that atypical, if you will, in thinking about how our working capital here works. And so we are going to be very focused on free cash flow, free cash flow growth, more correctly stated. We're going to be focused on EBITDA. But again, the way to really create value is growth in those metrics, not having them stay thin. Frankly, I think a lot of people have sort of assumed that those numbers are flat or stable, and yes, we are happy that we did achieve stable results this quarter, but honestly, the way to win is to grow those numbers and that's what we're focused on here."

There's a lot of excitement here at Yahoo! and recent -- I ask people how many people in the past month have had someone say, I'd really like to come work there; and two probably, the vast majority of the hands in this room went up. People tell me that's a marked change from the past. Certainly, people are excited to come work here. I think that's sure that's with the management team and how quickly we've got that. I've been hearing from various entrepreneurs and investors that people are excited at the prospect of potentially solving their companies to Yahoo!. Making this a great place for companies to lead so I think in the case of some of the smaller scales acquisitions, we can get a very good home for those people. So I think that there's actually terrific potential in terms of hiring here. And as I said, some of the cultural changes that we've made around, being much more open with employees, providing nice benefits like the free food, all of this making their productivity that much better with things like the mobile phones and also just reducing bureaucracy in terms of what it takes to get something done here is something that is ultimately getting is on the path to really making Yahoo! the absolute Best Place to Work.

In terms of winning in mobile without a mobile, actually view that one of the advantages here is that we don't have a mobile operating system because it allows us to operate and innovate and provide our products across all the different platforms. So we would like to offer our products on iOs as well as on Android. And I think that it's important to remember that, that list of items checking stocks, checking news, checking weather, sharing photos, getting all of those types of things are things that people do on the phone. And in that situation, Yahoo! has a unique set of content that we can provide our end-users, and that's something that we've invested a lot in and I think it's a something that is differentiating and a unique advantage. In terms of advertising technology, I think that, obviously, in terms of Search, we are cooperating with Microsoft on the Bing Yahoo! network in terms of selling our search inventory. In terms of Display, I'll refer back to what I talked earlier in terms of audience-based buying and the opportunity that our verticals provide in Display advertising. Our verticals already aggregate our users at a level of granularity that advertisers understand and they provide a level of engagement that is something that isn't often seen on the Web. And so I do think that the particular products we have, the way that they align with advertisers spend, be it on the sports-based content or an entertainment-based context, in autos and travel, et cetera, these are things of the line really well with advertisers spend and are large enough block to be meaningful to be purchased, but not so small, and so personalized that it's difficult actually get a meaningful number of impressions and a meaningful impact from your campaign.

In terms of mobile share, I think that there's going to be a few large players in the mobile search space and I think that Yahoo! should absolutely be one of them. And to the end that we are able to create a coherent stance, a very compelling mobile application that people view on a daily basis that also provide us an avenue not only to serve advertising in display or video and mobile format that, but also to drive search. And finally, in terms of monetization, I think that there are some elements that are going to continue to be challenging, and we're working with Microsoft very close on those. It has to do with, for example, auction dynamics, the network dynamics and some of the ways that advertisers spend on the platform. I do think that we've had a lot of success with what some might call publisher changes or user interface changes. In fact, in the past year, a lot of the upside that we have seen in search has come from changes we've made to our user interface to make our ads perform better on a click-through rate basis, and ultimately, those publisher changes have also helped us increase, not only revenue per search, but also cost per click."

The reason to do that would be, of course, in that causes you to just like the site more, traffic in theory, should rise. So it'll basically reduce the variable equation RPM, the only reason to do that is if we actually think traffic will grow because users' appreciation for the products will grow.

On the question around the automation of Display advertising, and particularly programmatic buying, I do think this is an area where Yahoo! needs to invest more. Well, ultimately there will always be advertisers where we need to do something like creating a custom-branded experience in order to create entertainment or because it's just a very important campaign or very large campaign that there will be elements of manual touch. It think it's also important for us to enable our advertisers if they have an idea for how to run a campaign and they want to log onto a system in the middle of the night and file a campaign, I think we have a system to make that really easy to do, and I think that today, we have that, but it could be better. And so that's something that we do need to ultimately change the mix of our manual versus programmatic buying, and that's a something that one of the reasons why we're investing in the ad technology platforms that we had announced in September and we enforce today."

I'd like to start by saying that I'm thrilled to be here at Yahoo!, and I'm happy to give all of you an update on the business today.

I'd like to start by saying that I'm thrilled to be here at Yahoo!, and I'm happy to give all of you an update on the business today. My first nearly 100 days have been incredibly energizing and, honestly, a lot of fun. 
Yahoo! is a truly iconic company, one that I've had great respect for since I first discovered it as a Stanford student back in 1994. At that time, Yahoo! was called Jerry and Dave's Guide to the World Wide Web. Even then, it was obvious what an essential tool it was and the incredible potential. 
Beyond that potential and its storied history, some of you might ask, ""Why did I in particular come to Yahoo!?"" In short, this job is tailor-made for me. The core components of Yahoo!'s business, Search, Mail, ads, Mobile, News and the home page are also the core products that I've built my career upon. So my answer is simple. I came to Yahoo! to grow and to help redefine one of the Internet's most beloved companies. 
This afternoon, I'd like to discuss my priorities over the past quarter, including our efforts around people and products. Then, following Ken Goldman's review of the third quarter financials, I'll discuss the vision and direction for Yahoo! moving forward. 
Let's begin with our people. Companies are all about people, and the companies with the best talent win. It's no secret that our team has experienced numerous changes the past year. From my very first day in July, we've been zeroing in on the efficiency, well-being and accountability of our 12,000 employees. We built a corporate culture, establishing an open dialogue with employees as well as a commitment to transparency. We've put in place feedback tools, systems that remove bureaucracy, new performance measurements for Yahoo! and clearly laid out quarterly goals for the company. And these systems are working to improve our execution. As of today, 93% of our employees have quarterly individual goals that map to company goals. And of course, one of our company goals is that we will soon be at 100%. 
True cultural change can't be bought, so the vast majority of what we've done has cost nothing. That said, we have made smart and thoughtful investments in new mobile phones for our employees so they can test our products and provide feedback. We've also begun to offer what is a standard here in Silicon Valley, at top companies and start-ups: free food for our hard-working employees. 
Our goals are simple: execute faster, return value to our shareholders, attract the best talent and make Yahoo! the absolute best place to work. In an incredibly short period of time, we have built a stellar, world-class leadership team across all the core functions of the business: finance, sales, human resources, development, marketing and legal. In a moment, you'll hear from Ken Goldman, our new Chief Financial Officer, who brings more than 25 years of experience as a public company CFO to his role. Ken will help lead our financial fitness moving forward. 
Henrique de Castro will be joining as Yahoo!'s Chief Operating Officer. Henrique is one of the most respected and accomplished businesspeople in the realm of Internet outsourcing [ph]. With his rigorous and analytical approach, he'll review our strategy and execution in enhancing our advertising solutions and the value that we provide to our advertisers. 
Ron Bell, a Yahoo! veteran with a rich 13-year history at the company and an incredibly deep set of perspectives on the company's products and policies, has been promoted to be our General Counsel. 
We've also brought on Jacqueline Reses as head of people and development. With a background in private equity and a reputation for doing smart and savvy deals in integration, Jackie is focused on hiring, acquiring and retaining the smartest minds in our industry. I'm already impressed with the change in talent pool of our candidates. It's increased in quality and volume. 
Finally, Kathy Savitt has brought her infectious energy and extensive consumer marketing experience as our new CMO, and she'll help us reimagine the Yahoo! brand. 
In Yahoo! fantasy sports, I will draft this exact group as my dream team. I'm positively thrilled to be working with them. That we were able to attract such well-known and capable leaders and so quickly is a testimony to the Yahoo!'s potential. They join a capable and qualified management team that is already in place here at Yahoo!. 
In addition to focusing on our people and empowering them to execute, we've also focused on our products. Over the past 3 months, I dedicated significant time to product and business reviews with hundreds of our employees. We started with Search. While our Search area's challenged, we're working closely with Microsoft to define the future of Search. Many people are surprised to learn that our alliance with Microsoft affords Yahoo! significant control over our Search user experience and the ability to innovate therein. We're also thinking aggressively about how to grow share from the market and not just trade Search share with each other. 
On the economics front, as we've said in the past, our alliance [ph] has fallen below our expectations. So we are benefiting from a revenue guarantee. Ken will talk more about this in a moment. 
Turning to Mobile, our offerings and their usage have been growing nicely. As part of our Mobile efforts this quarter, we've redesigned our Mobile search page across 23 countries, resulting in increased usage. We released an updated version of Flickr for Android, which has been getting rave reviews from our end users, including thousands of 5-star ratings. And we've also launched IntoNow 3.0, a fun way to connect with friends and get more from your TV watching. 
Looking at content, our high-quality content products differentiate Yahoo! and drive impressive user engagement. For example, in Q3, our global coverage around the 2012 London Olympic Games resulted in more traffic than we received for Vancouver and Beijing Games combined. Our users spent 3.5 billion minutes watching our Olympics programming, reading articles and viewing photos. 
Turning to advertising. In September, we announced that we will continue to own and invest in our Display ad technology, including guaranteed, non-guaranteed, Genome and the Right Media Display marketplace. We're deeply committed to our core technologies and platforms to ensure we continue to be leaders in this space. The advertising partners that I've talked to love the audience-based buying that Yahoo! enables. They will buy more if they could. Our opportunity in advertising is around making the ad platform and tools more efficient but also increasing usage of our consumer products and, therefore, impressions, so we have more to sell. 
I'm very pleased with our people and product progress in Q3. It was an active and solid quarter with some nice achievements. In addition, as you know, in September, we reviewed our capital allocation strategy, and we committed to return $3 billion of additional capital to our investors from the Alibaba transaction. At the current price levels, we think it's economically attractive to repurchase stock. However, we will continually monitor the best method of returning capital to drive the most shareholder value. 
Finally, third quarter revenue was once again stable. We've now had 3 quarters of modest revenue growth and encouraging numbers in Search and Display. On that note, let me pass it over to Ken Goldman to walk through our Q3 financials in-depth. Ken?"

I am excited to be joining Yahoo! and speaking to you all on my first official day as CFO. This is a proud company, and I am proud to be here. Yahoo! is a well-respected global brand. Everyone that I have talked to want this company to succeed. Interestingly, I have received literally several hundred congratulatory messages, and all of them note how they use Yahoo! Properties in their daily lives. As you will hear, I am a firm believer in Marissa's vision for the company and further Yahoo! as a great place to work. On the call today, I'll walk through the 3Q financial results and then provide in detail the impact to our financial statements from the Alibaba transaction. 
So relative to the 3Q highlights, we'll start off with some of the third quarter financials. As I refer to these metrics, please view the slides available on our IR website to follow along, starting along -- starting with Slide 5, financials and the key metrics at a glance. 
Revenue ex-TAC of $1.89 billion grew 2% over last year and marked the third quarter in a row of modest revenue growth for the company. Global Display revenue ex-TAC was roughly flat in the quarter versus prior year as 4% growth in the Americas was offset by weakness in EMEA. Global Search revenue ex-TAC grew 11% over 3Q 2011, driven once again by improvements on Yahoo! sites as well as a high guaranteed payment from Microsoft in the prior year. 
Operating income, excluding restructuring charges of $25 million, was $177 million in 3Q, a modest increase versus third quarter 2011. Non-GAAP EPS, excluding restructuring charges and the impact of the Alibaba transaction, was $0.35 in the quarter, 56% higher than 3Q 2011. We repurchased $190 million worth of stock in the quarter. And finally, we ended the quarter with approximately $9.4 billion in cash and investments. 
Now before I dive into details behind these numbers, I want to first give a brief, high-level overview of the opportunity I see here and why I joined the company. Overall, I believe this company has tremendous assets through its massive, loyal audience and very promising products and properties in virtually every major category. Also clear to me that a lot of great work has been done over the last few years to strengthen the underlying fundamentals of the operating business. And real success has been achieved. We have much work to do, and this will take some time, but the evidence of stabilized financial results is beginning to show in this quarter. 
Revenue was stable with 3Q representing the third quarter in a row of modest growth in total revenue ex-TAC and second quarter in a row of Display revenue ex-TAC with growth in the Americas region. Operating margins are healthy, so we also have room for upside once we're able to grow the top line and scale the business. 
We'll also share we spend our resources with discipline, wisely and prudently based on investing for growth and efficiency. And we have a very strong balance sheet with abundant liquidity. Our primary objective as the new management team is leverage our assets, competitive strengths and available resources to transition this company from financial stability to a growth business, serving our customers with a distinct Yahoo! identity. We are very mindful of shareholder value creation. 
So let me walk through the financial results in more detail, and you can see these turning to Slide 7 and 8. Display revenue ex-TAC was $452 million, roughly flat with the prior year. Breaking down Display by region, Americas region grew 4%, driven primarily by favorable pricing mix. Sell-through rates on Class 1 inventory improved once again, but we continue to face headwinds from declining available impressions at Class 2, particularly in Mail. Campaigns around the Olympics sold well in the quarter but proved to be somewhat cannibalistic to other spending as few advertisers increased their overall budgets. 
In EMEA, trends were once again weak due primarily to the economy, which negatively impacted Display revenue by approximately $9 million in the quarter. APAC Display ex-TAC was down slightly in  U.S. dollar terms but roughly flat on a local currency basis. Going forward, we will endeavor to better understand margin contributions in each geographic region and how we can improve. Search revenues ex-TAC once again performed well in the third quarter, growing 11% versus prior year and 7% on a sequential basis, while the Yahoo!-driven RPS improvements as well as our higher guaranteed payment accounted for the upside in Search. 
Looking at price and volume dynamics, the upside was driven by both [indiscernible] to PPC, including the RPS guarantee, as total eligible searches were flat in the quarter on a global basis. 
From a regional perspective, similar trends prevailed within Display with positive results in the Americas segment offset by weakness in EMEA and a slight decline in APAC in U.S. dollar terms. 
And as it relates to Microsoft guaranteed payment, a number of factors go into calculating the amount, including variables like economic growth, which resulted in a higher year-over-year payment. Looking to next year, as you all know, the current guarantee is set to expire in April 2013. If the revenue guarantee is not renewed, we view the total risk to our financials to be less than $100 million on an annualized basis. 
In terms of other revenue ex-TAC of $223 million, it declined 10% versus the prior year but was flat sequentially. As was highlighted on 2Q call, we will continue to feel the impact of the final broadband step-down when viewed on a year-over-year basis for 2 more quarters. But sequentially, there'll be no material additional impact. Also, going forward, other revenue will be boosted by amortization of the $550 million upfront payment related to the tippler [ph]  with the Alibaba Group. This payment will be amortized over 48 months and recognized in other revenue. In -- at 3Q, this amount was just $4.5 million. However, in 4Q and beyond, we will recognize approximately $34 million of additional revenue per quarter. 
And now talking about operating expenses and operating income, and you can see this on Slide 10. Total operating expenses less TAC and adjusted for restructuring charges of $25 million were $912 million in third quarter, resulting in an adjusted operating margin ex-TAC of 16%, in line with that of 3Q '11. Adjusted operating income ex-TAC modestly increased to $177 million versus the prior year. 
Stepping down to income statement, the company was able to realize certain foreign tax breaks in 3Q that improved net income by $135 million. This result is a negative effective tax rate in the quarter, excluding the Alibaba gain. 
I'm now going to turn to balance sheet and cash flow, and you can see the key balance sheet and cash flow statement highlights on Slides 12 and 13. Capital expenditures was $140 million in the quarter, up from levels experienced the prior 2 quarters. They relate primarily to our data center investments. 
Free cash flow was $920 million in the quarter. Excluding the $500 million tippler [ph] payment, free cash flow was $370 million in the quarter, which is up 50% from the prior year. As noted, our cash and investments balance at the end of the quarter was $9.4 billion. However, approximately $2.5 billion of this is reserved for payment for taxes on the Alibaba transaction. In addition, we have included the $800 million preferred equity received from Alibaba as a separate item in the balance sheet, which is not included in the $9.4 billion figure just mentioned. 
At the end of the quarter, the market value of our stakes in Yahoo! Japan and Alibaba Group was $7.7 billion and $8.1 billion, using the quarter end closing price per share and the price per share in the most recent transaction, respectively. 
So let me go through a few other activities and updates. Before I walk through the Alibaba impact, I am pleased to announce today we're entering into an revolving credit facility with capacity of $750 million .The facility is currently undrawn and is expected to be used for general corporate purposes. With regards to the form and timing of churn of the proceeds from the Alibaba transaction, as Marissa discussed in her remarks, we think it's both in our best economic interest as well as shareholder interest to repurchase Yahoo! stock at these levels. 
In terms of Alibaba, let me walk through the transaction and how it impacts the financial statements this quarter as there are a number of adjustments to be made. First, as you know, we are pleased to close the first stage of previously announced transactions in September. And really, a special thank you goes out to Tim Morse for all the great hard work he put to getting this deal done. It was a huge effort a great success for the company. 
We received gross proceeds in cash and preferred equity of $7.6 billion. $7.1 billion of this was from the sale of shares, and $550 million related to the tippler [ph] . We received approximately $6.8 billion in cash proceeds and $800 million in preferred equity. 
Starting at the top of the P&L, we recognized $4.5 million of other revenue from the amortization of the tippler [ph] in the final few days of the quarter, as mentioned earlier. Further down, you will see $4.6 billion in other income. This is our booked gain on sale, net of transaction fees. Also included in this number is accrued interest in the preferred equity in the quarter, which was just a few million dollars. And net gain realized after taxes and fees from the sale of shares was $2.8 billion during the quarter. 
On the cash flow statement, accrued expenses and liabilities related to this transaction increased by $2.5 billion. These relate to taxes owed, but not yet paid, on the sale of our Alibaba shares. Most of this cash will go out in Q4. 
On the close of the transaction, we now own approximately 24% of our Alibaba group's outstanding shares in addition to the $800 million preferred equity. Once again, the pretax value of our equity stake, based on the recent transaction price per share of $15.50, is $8.1 billion, again not including $800 million of preferred. Cost basis for tax purposes of this stake is approximately $250 million. 
So in terms of guidance before I close, as you might expect, we are not prepared to give guidance today given my short history with the company. Between now and the next earnings call, we will evaluate what form of guidance to provide on an ongoing basis. 
Thank you for your time today. I am extremely excited to be here and look forward again to know and meet all of you. I also realize we'd much rather hear from Marissa and her plans for the future, so I'll turn it back to Marissa."

I'm very pleased with our Q3 financial results. We have a solid foundation on which now to grow. Fundamentally, Yahoo! is part of the consumer Internet, where grow",871,"Thank you, Ken, and thank you for joining the call on your very first day here at Yahoo!. 
I'm very pleased with our Q3 financial results. We have a solid foundation on which now to grow. Fundamentally, Yahoo! is part of the consumer Internet, where growth is expected. We'll become a growth company by inspiring and delighting our users. The first step is to grow at the same pace as the particular markets that we are in, which we already do in a number of cases but not all. Later, the goal will be to gain users and share disproportionately. 
Our vision and direction for Yahoo! is to make the world's daily habits inspiring and entertaining. Let's start with the daily habits part. At Yahoo!, we see users making daily use of Search, Mail, the home page and Mobile, among other offerings. Search is a core daily habit for all of us and a fundamental user behavior, the top priority for Yahoo!. We'll focus on reshaping Search, driving smart distribution deals and making organic investments to grow our market share. There's a clear upside potential here, and it's time now to execute against it. 
Communication is another of these daily habits and is prime to be reimagined. There is great opportunity to modernize Yahoo! Mail and Messenger, especially given the continual increase in the amount of communication we're all receiving. The Yahoo! home page is one of the biggest draws on the Web, including more content and being more precise in the targeting of content and advertisements to make this daily habit even more compelling for our users. Mobile represents not only a daily habit, but a fundamental and massive platform shift, a platform shift that we have to ride and participate in, in order to be relevant. Today, there are more than 1 billion smartphone users globally. As expected, that will double in the next 3 years. And while we've made progress, Yahoo! hasn't capitalized on the mobile opportunity. We haven't effectively optimized our website, we've underinvested in our mobile front-end development and we've splintered our brands. We have more than 76 applications across Android and iOS. All of this need to change. Our top priority is a focused, coherent, mobile strategy. We're accelerating our efforts to build a strong technical talent base for mobile. This includes engineers, product managers and designers. 
As the world becomes increasingly mobile, the way we all consume content has dramatically shifted. Interestingly, when you look at the most frequent uses of smartphones, they include checking the weather, checking sports scores, checking stock quotes and other financial information, watching videos, sharing photos, getting the latest news and playing games. Does that sound like any particular company that you know? Yahoo!, with its content and leadership in these key verticals, is already very well positioned here. We will continue to work with top partners and media companies to further build and scale these opportunities. We'll strive to make the daily habits of smartphone and tablet use more social, engaging, beautiful and compelling. 
Yahoo! as well is inspiring and delighting our users. Much of that inspiration and delight will stem from what we know and understand about our users and their needs. In that context, personalization of content and advertising is fundamental. Personalization has been part of our DNA for some time, and it's key to a great user experience. Our home page alone serve millions of different combinations of content every day. This deepens  the engagement that inspires our users' actions, like clicking, reading and sharing. We just scratched the surface of personalization, and we're going to continue to invest in shaping the future here. 
Inspiring and entertaining our users extend to our advertising partners as well. Using our solutions, advertisers can reach the audiences that want to engage with their brands. We'll continue to work with our advertising partners to create engaging, branded entertainment experiences as well as seamless, programmatic buying opportunities. And with our renewed commitment to owning and growing our Display marketplace, our advertisers will continue to see Yahoo! as a key piece of their online strategy with simple, targeted and effective advertising opportunities. Ultimately, we want to be the favorite partner of advertisers. 
In closing, while we have a lot to do, the future for Yahoo! is incredibly bright. Our extraordinary global reach and unique content position will allow us to build transformative products and compelling content that will be indispensable to people's daily lives. Our products will change how people learn, share and communicate. We will inspire, innovate and entertain. 
I came to Yahoo! to grow and to help redefine one of the Internet's most beloved companies. But what I found is that I'm not alone in that passion. No one wants Yahoo! to grow more than the people who work here. We're committed to going back to our roots as a consumer Internet company focused on user experience. 
The excitement and optimism that permeates Yahoo! right now is undeniable. And with the leadership and guidance of our new management team, it's time to execute. We believe that Yahoo!'s best days lie ahead. We intend to do great things, and we intend to win. Now let's take some of your questions."

I don't think that this is a situation where there's a giant pivot and we're going to a completely different business. I think this is about improved execution and seeing the opportunities that already are apparent within our business. That means focusing on daily habits, like Search, Mail, home page, Mobile. It means investing in key verticals that we're already in a leadership position. And we need to make the bridge to Mobile, Finance, News, Sports, Games, Messenger, Flickr, Answers, Groups, the core being Properties here at Yahoo!. I also think it's really important for us to be a terrific company to partner with, not only for our advertisers but also for other technology companies. Yahoo! occupies an interesting and unique space where we don't have as much channel conflict with other players and technology as many of our other comparable companies, which means that we can partner with different companies: with the browsers, with social networks, with the mobile operating systems. And I think that there's a great opportunity there. And I also think that the mobile wave is a huge wave for us to ride, and it's a great way for us to take our content and our current investments and make them more relevant moving forward. In terms of your second question, Search versus Display, these are already 2 very large, very successful businesses, so think it's difficult to say which 1 we should choose. It's somewhat of a false dichotomy. That said, I do think that there is potentially more upside in Search. We can see right now that given some of the monetization challenges we've faced, that there is an opportunity there to improve monetization. That said, the content investment we've made yields so many impressions and page views and so much opportunity around brand advertisement that is very compelling. When I look at Yahoo!'s business, we again occupy a very interesting and unique space in the market, where what we -- what we see is that because we have people who are interested in finance or interested in entertainment news, interested in sports, we fundamentally have a great segmentation of audiences already. And many of the other people who operate in terms of display advertising are either less granular and they understand less about their users or are much more granular. What we find, and when I talked to advertisers, what I've seen and heard from them is that the way that audiences tend to aggregate on Yahoo! is unique and particularly advantageous for them in terms of what they ultimately want for audience-based buying. And for that reason, I think that I'm bullish on both Search and Display, but I really think, given the trend towards audience-based buying in the advertising space, the Display opportunity is particularly compelling."

On the international market, there, we are really looking -- again, we are looking here to build growth. And so, as we've assessed different countries, one of the things they want to do is they want to really bring a coherence to our offerings across different markets. So while we have some markets where our product offerings are very different and we intend -- and are very successful and we intend to keep them in place that way, I do think there's an opportunity for us to take our very vast set of offerings, merit to a very compelling set of offerings and really make it much more compelling around the world. For example, you may -- in terms of how we may change this in the future, you may have seen, for example, on News on Friday of closing our Korean operations. The reason we chose to do that is because as much as it was a very successful market for us historically and it's something that we're very proud of the team there, we have a great team, and they've worked very hard, we had a hard time finding a growth story moving forward. Well, that isn't the case with many of the other markets. So I think we're likely to stay in markets where we see an opportunity for growth, be it on the desktop or in mobile, and we're likely to withdraw from markets where we don't see growth. Though, I will say that, to date, Korea has been an unusual exception in that phase. In terms of the question around local, it is something I've spent a lot of time working on and I really do love and I'm very compelled by. With that said, I also have a deep respect for it, but it's very hard to do it well. It requires a deep investment, a lot of people, a lot of energy and time to build terrific listings. We have some offerings in the space already, including Yahoo! Small & Business offerings, where we host websites and stores. We also have Yahoo! Maps, where we have licenses in place to support that. So I think that our local offerings are good at the moment. I think it's hard to take that next step to provide even deeper functionality. And so, while we don't intend to make significant changes there in the short term, I do think that it's probably not an area where we're going to invest heavily moving forward."

Three, and maybe Marissa will add to this, but we want to have the flexibility and the ability to make acquisitions if they make sense. Historically, many in this industry have been smallish. It's probably what we're looking for -- at as well. We don't have any in mind that I'm going to talk to you today, but we do want to have the flexibility to look at acquisitions that's strategic and that do further our ability to grow in addition to organic growth because we fundamentally believe that growth is really the key and core to basically show -- creating shareholder value over time here."

With that said, there are times, like in the case of data centers, where you need to spend in order to reduce latency and overall improve user experience. So we're making some investments there. In terms of the possible acquisitions, I want to echo what Ken said. We don't have particular acquisitions in mind today. We do need the flexibility, where if we see something that aligns well with our business and provides terrific growth that we can make that acquisition. That said, I think one of the things that is lost on people is because so many of the high-profile tech acquisitions are above the $1 billion mark, people tend to think that tech acquisitions are all in that space, and that's just not the case. Many acquisitions and most acquisitions, a vast majority, are less than $100 million. And so now, we're looking for small-scale acquisitions that align well overall with our businesses. In my history and my career, I've done about 20 or so such acquisitions, and I think that the size and scale that's comfortable for a great integration, a great product coming out of it is something that's much more in the size and scale of double-digit millions and low hundreds of millions."

If you excluded that, our tax rate would have been more like it has been historically this year in the mid-35s -- or mid-30s, I should say. The tax rate on Alibaba was probably closer to 40%, so you can figure it all out. And so, yes, I think there's really nothing that atypical, if you will, in thinking about how working capital here works. And so we are going to be very focused on free cash flow, free cash flow growth. More correctly stated, we're going to be focused on EBITDA. But again, the way to really create value is growth in those metrics, not having them stay thin. And I think -- frankly, I think a lot of people have sort of assumed that those numbers are flat or stable. And, yes, we are happy that we did achieve stable results this quarter. But honestly, the way to win is to grow those numbers, and that's what we're focused on here."

In a recent all-hands, I asked people, how many people in the past month and had someone say, ""I'd really like to come work there."" And, two, it probably -- the vast majority of the hands in this room went up. People tell me that's a marked change from the past. So I think people are excited to come work here. I think that's showing what the management team and how quickly they've built that. I've been hearing some various entrepreneurs and investors that people are excited at the prospect of potentially selling their companies to Yahoo!. They think this is a great place great place for companies to land. So I think in the case of some of the smaller-scale acquisitions, we can get a very good home for those people. So I think that there's actually terrific potential in terms of hiring here. And as I said, some of the cultural changes that we've made around just being much more open with employees, providing nice benefits like the free food. I hope this is making their productivity that much better with things like the mobile phones, and also just reducing bureaucracy in terms of what it takes to get something done here is something that is ultimately getting us on the path to really making Yahoo! the absolute best place to work.

In terms of winning in mobile without a mobile OS, I actually view that one of the advantages here is that we don't have a mobile operating system because it allows us to operate and innovate and provide our products across all the different platforms. So we would like to offer our products on iOS as well as on Android. And I think that it's important to remember that, that list of the items, checking stocks, checking news, checking weather, sharing photos, getting all of the -- all of those types of things are things that people do on the phone. And in that situation, Yahoo! has a unique set of content that we can provide our end-users, and that's something we've invested a lot in and I think it's something that is differentiating and a unique advantage. In terms of advertising technology, I think that, obviously, in terms of Search, we are cooperating with Microsoft on the Bing Yahoo! network in terms of selling our Search inventory. In terms of Display, I'll circle back to what I talked about earlier in terms of audience-based buying and the opportunity that our verticals provide in Display advertising. Our verticals already aggregate our users at a level of granularity that advertisers understand, and they provide a level of engagement that is something that isn't often seen on the web. And so, I do think that the particular products we have, the way that they align with advertiser spend, be it in the sports-based context or an entertainment-based context, in autos and travel, et cetera, these are things that align really well with advertiser spend and are large enough but to be meaningful to be purchased, but not so small and so personalized that it's difficult to actually get a meaningful number of impressions and a meaningful impact from your campaign. So I do think that we occupy an interesting space inside of Display, and that's one of our advantages."

First, how do you think the company does as far as capturing queries from PC usage of the other sites or convenient searches, is there opportunity there? Second, how do you get mobile share? It seems like Google is pretty dominant with mobile share? Does it take toolbars or are there ways to, kind of, break in there? And then, third, maybe could help us with just monetization, how you feel Yahoo! plus Bing is right now, and how much opportunity is there to grow that if you get the -- just the basic algorithms right?"

I think in terms of Search, there is an opportunity to do more integration across our sites and ultimately drive more search. I think that's a clear area of opportunity. We haven't been completely consistent on that in terms of our overall site design. In terms of mobile share, I think that there is going to be a few large players in the mobile search space, and I think that Yahoo! should absolutely be one of them. And to the end that we are able to create a coherent set of very compelling mobile application that people viewed on a daily basis, that also provides an avenue. It's not only to serve advertising in display or video and mobile format there but also to drive Search. And finally, in terms of monetization, I think that there are some elements that are going to continue to be challenging, and we're working with Microsoft very closely on those. And this has to do with, for example, auction dynamics, the network dynamics and some of the ways that the advertisers spend on the platform. I do think that we've had a lot of success with what some might call publisher changes or user-interface changes. In fact, in the past year, a lot of the upside that we have seen in Search had come from changes we've made to our user interface to make our ads perform better on a click-through-rate basis. And ultimately, those publisher changes have also helped us increase, not only revenue per search, but also cost per click."

On the Display piece, I don't think that we are over-monetizing the site. That said, the way that I really look at this is, in the Display and advertising world on the Internet, basically, your revenue is a function of traffic times RPM, revenue per thousand pages. And so, one way you can look at this is there are ways where we could perhaps back off some of the ad units, especially if they're very disruptive to the end-user experience. The reason to do that would be, of course, if that causes you to select the site more, traffic, in theory, should rise. So it will basically reduce one of the variable math equation, RPM. And the only reason to do that is if we actually think traffic will grow because the users' appreciation for the products will grow. But I think that to the extent that we make changes like that, we're hoping for those kinds of trade-offs. And on the question around Search, I will hand it over to Ken."

I think that the amount of the app participation there and the page views there are compelling. That said, when we look at things like the Olympics, like the upcoming elections or even the conventions that happened at the end of August, what we're seeing is, that by putting our reporters and our editors there, we are able to create interesting unique pieces of content that do drive meaningful page views and engagement, 3.5 billion minutes, for example, on the Olympics. And without a -- an ownership of that content, and that's doing some of our own original programming, we would not be able to drive that kind of engagement.

So we're going to continue to look at that.

Basically, they are low latency. They understand the user need. They make it fast and simple and straightforward to ultimately get what you need.

So I do think that we'll be doing some continued investment there. For example, as we've discussed earlier, the Olympics, the election, a lot of our live events and some of our other original programming are very important. On the question around the automation of Display advertising and, particularly, programmatic buying, I do think this is an area where Yahoo! needs to invest more. Well, ultimately, there will always be advertisers where we need to do something like creating a custom-branded experience in order to create entertainment, or because it's just a very important campaign or a very large campaign that there will be elements of manual touch. It think it's also important for us to enable our advertisers if they have an idea for how to run a campaign, and they want to log onto a system in the middle of the night and file a campaign, I think we need to have a system to makes that really easy to do. And I think that, today, we have that, but it could be better. And so that's something that where we do need to ultimately change the mix of our manual versus programmatic buying, and that's something that -- one of the reasons why we're investing in the ad technology platforms that we had announced in September and we enforce today."

I'd like to start by saying that I'm thrilled to be here at Yahoo!, and I'm happy to give all of you an update on the business today. My first nearly 100 days have been incredibly energizing and, honestly, a lot",1240,"Thank you, Joon. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by saying that I'm thrilled to be here at Yahoo!, and I'm happy to give all of you an update on the business today. My first nearly 100 days have been incredibly energizing and, honestly, a lot of fun. 
Yahoo! is a truly iconic company, one that I've had great respect for since I first discovered it as a Stanford student back in 1994. At that time, Yahoo! was called Jerry and Dave's Guide to the World Wide Web. Even then, it was obvious what an essential tool it was and the incredible potential. 
Beyond that potential and its storied history, some of you might ask, ""Why did I in particular come to Yahoo!?"" In short, this job is tailor-made for me. The core components of Yahoo!'s business, Search, Mail, ads, Mobile, News and the home page are also the core products that I've built my career upon. So my answer is simple. I came to Yahoo! to grow and to help redefine one of the Internet's most beloved companies. 
This afternoon, I'd like to discuss my priorities over the past quarter, including our efforts around people and products. Then, following Ken Goldman's review of the third quarter financials, I'll discuss the vision and direction for Yahoo! moving forward. 
Let's begin with our people. Companies are all about people, and the companies with the best talent win. It's no secret that our team has experienced numerous changes this past year. From my very first day in July, we've been zeroing in on the efficiency, well-being and accountability of our 12,000 employees. We have a close-knit culture, establishing an open dialogue with employees as well as a commitment to transparency. We've put in place feedback tools, systems that remove bureaucracy, new performance measurements for Yahoo! and clearly laid out quarterly goals for the company. These new systems are working to improve our execution. As of today, 93% of our employees have quarterly individual goals that map to company goals. And of course, one of our company goals is that we will soon be at 100%. 
True cultural change can't be bought, so the vast majority of what we've done has cost nothing. That said, we have made smart and thoughtful investments in new mobile phones for our employees so they can test our products and provide feedback. We've also begun to offer what is a standard here in Silicon Valley at top companies and start-ups: free food for our hard-working employees. 
Our goals are simple: execute faster, return value to our shareholders, attract the best talent and make Yahoo! the absolute best place to work. In an incredibly short period of time, we have built a stellar, world-class leadership team across all the core functions of the business: finance, sales, human resources, development, marketing and legal. In a moment, you'll hear from Ken Goldman, our new Chief Financial Officer, who brings more than 25 years of experience as a public company CFO to his role. Ken will help lead our financial fitness moving forward. 
Henrique de Castro will be joining as Yahoo!'s Chief Operating Officer. Henrique is one of the most respected and accomplished businesspeople in the realm of Internet advertising. With his rigorous and analytical approach, he'll lead our strategy and execution in enhancing our advertising solutions and the value that we provide to our advertisers. 
Ron Bell, a Yahoo! veteran with a rich 13-year history at the company and an incredibly deep set of perspectives on the company's products and policies, has been promoted to be our General Counsel. 
We've also brought on Jackie Reses as head of people and development. With a background in private equity and a reputation for doing smart and savvy deals in integration, Jackie is focused on hiring, acquiring and retaining the smartest minds in our industry. I'm already impressed with the change in talent pool of our candidates. It's increased in quality and volume. 
Finally, Kathy Savitt has brought her infectious energy and extensive consumer marketing experience as our new CMO, and she'll help us reimagine the Yahoo! brand. 
In Yahoo! fantasy sports, I would draft this exact group as my dream team. I'm positively thrilled to be working with them. That we were able to attract such well-known and capable leaders and so quickly is a testimony to Yahoo!'s potential. They joined a capable and qualified management team that is already in place here at Yahoo!. 
In addition to focusing on our people and empowering them to execute, we've also focused on our products. Over the past 3 months, I dedicated significant time to product and business reviews with hundreds of our employees. We started with Search. While our Search area's challenged, we're working closely with Microsoft to define the future of Search. Many people are surprised to learn that our alliance with Microsoft affords Yahoo! significant control over our Search user experience and the ability to innovate therein. We're also thinking aggressively about how to grow share from the market and not just trade Search share with each other. 
On the economics front, as we've said in the past, our alliance has fallen below our expectations. So we are benefiting from a revenue guarantee. Ken will talk more about this in a moment. 
Turning to Mobile, our offerings and their usage have been growing nicely. As part of our Mobile efforts this quarter, we've redesigned our Mobile search page across 23 countries, resulting in increased usage. We released an updated version of Flickr for Android, which has been getting rave reviews from our end users, including thousands of 5-star ratings. And we've also launched IntoNow 3.0, a fun way to connect with friends and get more from your TV watching. 
Looking at content, our high-quality content products differentiate Yahoo! and drive impressive user engagement. For example, in Q3, our global coverage around the 2012 London Olympic Games resulted in more traffic than we received for Vancouver and Beijing Games combined. Our users spent 3.5 billion minutes watching our Olympics programming, reading articles and viewing photos. 
Turning to advertising. In September, we announced that we will continue to own and invest in our Display ad technology, including guaranteed, non-guaranteed, Genome and the Right Media Display marketplace. We're deeply committed to our core technologies and platforms to ensure we continue to be leaders in this space. The advertising partners that I've talked to love the audience-based buying that Yahoo! enables. They would buy more if they could. Our opportunity in advertising is around making the ad platform and tools more efficient but also increasing usage of our consumer products and, therefore, impressions, so we have more to sell. 
I'm very pleased with our people and product progress in Q3. It was an active and solid quarter with some nice achievements. In addition, as you know, in September, we reviewed our capital allocation strategy, and we committed to return $3 billion of additional capital to our investors from the Alibaba transaction. At the current price levels, we think it's economically attractive to repurchase stock. However, we will continually monitor the best method of returning capital to drive the most shareholder value. 
Finally, third quarter revenue was once again stable. We've now had 3 quarters of modest revenue growth and encouraging numbers in Search and Display. On that note, let me pass it over to Ken Goldman to walk through our Q3 financials in-depth. Ken?"

I am excited to be joining Yahoo! and speaking to you all on my first official day as CFO. This is a proud company, and I am proud to be here. Yahoo! is a well-respected global brand. Everyone that I have talked to wants this company to succeed. Interestingly, I have received literally several hundred congratulatory messages, and all of them note how they use Yahoo! Properties in their daily lives. As you will hear, I am a firm believer in Marissa's vision for the company and furthering Yahoo! as a great place to work. On the call today, I'll walk through the 3Q financial results and then provide detail on the impact to our financial statements from the Alibaba transaction. 
So relative to the 3Q highlights, we'll start off with some of the third quarter financials. As I refer to these metrics, please view the slides available on our IR website to follow along, starting along -- starting with Slide 5, financials and key metrics at a glance. 
Revenue ex-TAC of $1.89 billion grew 2% over last year and marked the third quarter in a row of modest revenue growth for the company. Global Display revenue ex-TAC was roughly flat in the quarter versus prior year as 4% growth in the Americas was offset by weakness in EMEA. Global Search revenue ex-TAC grew 11% over 3Q 2011, driven once again by improvements on Yahoo! sites as well as a higher guaranteed payment from Microsoft in the prior year. 
Operating income, excluding restructuring charges of $25 million, was $177 million 3Q, a modest increase versus third quarter 2011. Non-GAAP EPS, excluding restructuring charges and the impact of the Alibaba transaction, was $0.35 in the quarter, 66% higher than 3Q 2011. We repurchased $190 million worth of stock in the quarter. And finally, we ended the quarter with approximately $9.4 billion in cash and investments. 
Now before I dive into details behind these numbers, I want to first give a brief, high-level overview of the opportunity I see here and why I joined the company. Overall, I believe this company has tremendous assets through its massive loyal audience and very promising products and properties in virtually every major category. Also clear to me that a lot of great work has been done over the last few years to strengthen the underlying fundamentals of the operating business. And real success has been achieved. We have much work to do, and this will take some time, but the evidence of stabilized financial results is beginning to show in this quarter. 
Revenue was stable with 3Q representing the third quarter in a row of modest growth in total revenue ex-TAC and second quarter in a row of Display revenue ex-TAC with growth in the Americas region. Operating margins are healthy, so we also have room for upside once we're able to grow the top line and scale the business. 
We will also ensure we spend our resources with discipline, wisely and prudently based on investing for growth and efficiency. And we have a very strong balance sheet with abundant liquidity. Our primary objective as a new management team is to leverage our assets, competitive strengths and available resources to transition this company from financial stability to a growth business, serving our customers with a distinct Yahoo! identity. We are very mindful of shareholder value creation. 
So let me walk through the financial results in more detail, and you can see these turning to Slide 7 and 8. Display revenue ex-TAC was $452 million, roughly flat with the prior year. Breaking down Display by region, Americas region grew 4%, driven primarily by favorable pricing mix. Sell-through rates on Class 1 inventory improved once again, but we continue to face headwinds from declining available impressions in Class 2, particularly in Mail. Campaigns around the Olympics sold well in the quarter but proved to be somewhat cannibalistic to other spending as few advertisers increased their overall budgets. 
In EMEA, trends were once again weak due primarily to the economy, which negatively impacted Display revenue by approximately $9 million in the quarter. APAC Display ex-TAC was down slightly in  U.S. dollar terms but roughly flat on a local currency basis. Going forward, we will endeavor to better understand margin contributions in each geographic region and how we can improve. Search revenues ex-TAC once again performed well in the third quarter, growing 11% versus prior year and 7% on a sequential basis. Both Yahoo!-driven RPS improvements as well as our higher guaranteed payment accounted for the upside in Search. 
Looking at price and volume dynamics, the upside was driven by both quick yield at PPC, including the RPS guarantee, as total eligible searches were flat in the quarter on a global basis. 
From a regional perspective, similar trends prevailed within Display, with positive results in the Americas segment offset by weakness in EMEA and a slight decline at APAC in U.S. dollar terms. 
And as it relates to Microsoft guaranteed payment, a number of factors go into calculating the amount, including variables like economic growth, which resulted in a higher year-over-year payment. Looking to next year, as you all know, the current guarantee is set to expire in April of 2013. If the revenue guarantee is not renewed, we view the total risk to our financials to be less than $100 million on an annualized basis. 
In terms of other revenue ex-TAC of $223 million, it declined 10% versus the prior year but was flat sequentially. As was highlighted on 2Q call, we will continue to feel the impact of the final broadband step-down when viewed on a year-over-year basis for 2 more quarters. But sequentially, there'll be no material additional impact. Also, going forward, other revenue will be boosted by amortization of the $550 million upfront payment related to the TIPLA with the Alibaba Group. This payment will be amortized over 48 months and recognized in other revenue. In -- at 3Q, this amount was just $4.5 million. However, in 4Q and beyond, we will recognize approximately $34 million of additional revenue per quarter. 
I'm now talking about operating expenses and operating income, and you can see this on Slide 10. Total operating expenses less TAC and adjusted for restructuring charges of $25 million were $912 million in third quarter, resulting in an adjusted operating margin ex-TAC of 16%, in line with that of 3Q '11. Adjusted operating income ex-TAC modestly increased to $177 million versus the prior year. 
Stepping down the income statement, the company was able to realize certain foreign tax credits in 3Q that improved net income by $135 million. This resulted in a negative effective tax rate in the quarter, excluding the Alibaba gain. 
I'm now going to turn to balance sheet and cash flow, and you can see the key balance sheet and cash flow statement highlights on Slides 12 and 13. Capital expenditures was $140 million in the quarter, up from levels experienced the prior 2 quarters. They related primarily to our data center investments. 
Free cash flow was $920 million in the quarter. Excluding the $500 million TIPLA payment, free cash flow was $370 million in the quarter, which was up 50% from the prior year. As noted, our cash and investments balance at the end of the quarter was $9.4 billion. However, approximately $2.5 billion of this is reserved for payment for taxes on the Alibaba transaction. In addition, we have included the $800 million preferred equity received from Alibaba as a separate item in the balance sheet, which is not included in the $9.4 billion figure just mentioned. 
At the end of the quarter, the market value of our stakes in Yahoo! Japan and Alibaba Group was $7.7 billion and $8.1 billion, using the quarter end closing price per share and the price per share in the most recent transaction, respectively. 
So let me go through a few other activities and updates. Before I walk through the Alibaba impact, I am pleased to announce today we're entering into an revolving credit facility with capacity of $750 million. The facility is currently undrawn and is expected to be used for general corporate purposes. With regards to the form and timing of churn of the proceeds from the Alibaba transaction, as Marissa discussed in her remarks, we think it's both in our best economic interest as well as shareholder interest to repurchase Yahoo! stock at these levels. 
In terms of Alibaba, let me walk through the transaction and how it impacts the financial statements this quarter as there are a number of adjustments to be made. First, as you know, we are pleased to close the first stage of previously announced transactions in September. And really, a special thank you goes out to Tim Morse for all the great hard work he put into getting this deal done. It was a huge effort and a great success for the company. 
We received gross proceeds in cash and preferred equity of $7.6 billion. $7.1 billion of this was from the sale of shares, and $550 million was related to the TIPLA. We received approximately $6.8 billion in cash proceeds and $800 million in preferred equity. 
Starting at the top of the P&L, we recognized $4.5 million of other revenue from the amortization of the TIPLA in the final few days of the quarter, as mentioned earlier. Further down, you will see $4.6 billion in other income. This is our booked gain on sale, net of transaction fees. Also included in this number is accrued interest in the preferred equity in the quarter, which was just a few million dollars. And net gain realized after taxes and fees from the sale of shares was $2.8 billion during the quarter. 
On the cash flow statement, accrued expenses and liabilities related to this transaction increased by $2.5 billion. This relates to taxes owed, but not yet paid, on the sale of our Alibaba shares. Most of this cash will go out in Q4. 
On the close of the transaction, we now own approximately 24% of Alibaba group's outstanding shares in addition to the $800 million in preferred equity. Once again, the pretax value of our equity stake, based on the recent transaction price per share of $15.50, is $8.1 billion, again not including $800 million of preferred. Cost basis for tax purposes of this stake is approximately $250 million. 
So in terms of guidance before I close, as you might expect, we are not prepared to give guidance today given my short history with the company. Between now and the next earnings call, we will evaluate what form of guidance to provide on an ongoing basis. 
Thank you for your time today. I am extremely excited to be here and look forward again to know and meet all of you. I also realize we'd much rather hear from Marissa and her plans for the future, so I'll turn it back to Marissa."

I'm very pleased with our Q3 financial results. We have a solid foundation on which now to grow. Fundamentally, Yahoo! is part of the consumer Internet, where grow",870,"Thank you, Ken, and thank you for joining the call on your very first day here at Yahoo!. 
I'm very pleased with our Q3 financial results. We have a solid foundation on which now to grow. Fundamentally, Yahoo! is part of the consumer Internet, where growth is expected. We'll become a growth company by inspiring and delighting our users. The first step is to grow at the same pace as the particular market that we are in, which we already do in a number of cases but not all. Later, the goal will be to gain users and share disproportionately. 
Our vision and direction for Yahoo! is to make the world's daily habits inspiring and entertaining. Let's start with the daily habits part. At Yahoo!, we see users making daily use of Search, Mail, the home page and Mobile, among other offerings. Search is a core daily habit for all of us and a fundamental user behavior, the top priority for Yahoo!. We'll focus on reshaping Search, driving smart distribution deals and making organic investments to grow our market share. There's a clear upside potential here, and it's time now to execute against it. 
Communication is another of these daily habits and is prime to be reimagined. There is great opportunity to modernize Yahoo! Mail and Messenger, especially given the continual increase in the amount of communication we're all receiving. The Yahoo! home page is one of the biggest draws on the Web, including more content and being more precise in the targeting of content and advertisements to make this daily habit even more compelling for our users. Mobile represents not only a daily habit, but a fundamental and massive platform shift, a platform shift that we have to ride and participate in, in order to be relevant. 
Today, there are more than 1 billion smartphone users globally. As expected, that will double in the next 3 years. And while we've made progress, Yahoo! hasn't capitalized on the mobile opportunity. We haven't effectively optimized our websites, we've underinvested in our mobile front-end development and we've splintered our brands. We have more than 76 applications across Android and iOS. All of this needs to change. Our top priority is a focused, coherent, mobile strategy. We're accelerating our efforts to build a strong technical talent base for mobile. This includes engineers, product managers and designers. 
As the world becomes increasingly mobile, the way we all consume content has dramatically shifted. Interestingly, when you look at the most frequent uses of smartphones, they include checking the weather, checking sports scores, checking stock quotes and other financial information, watching videos, sharing photos, getting the latest news and playing games. Does that sound like any particular company that you know? Yahoo!, with its content and leadership in these key verticals, is already very well positioned here. We will continue to work with top partners and media companies to further build and scale these opportunities. We'll strive to make the daily habits of smartphone and tablet use more social, engaging, beautiful and compelling. 
Yahoo! is about inspiring and delighting our users. Much of that inspiration and delight will stem from what we know and understand about our users and their needs. In that context, personalization of content and advertising is fundamental. Personalization has been part of our DNA for some time, and it's key to a great user experience. Our home page alone serves millions of different combinations of content every day. This deepens the engagement that inspires our users' actions, like clicking, reading and sharing. We just scratched the surface of personalization, and we're going to continue to invest in shaping the future here. 
Inspiring and entertaining our users extends to our advertising partners as well. Using our solutions, advertisers can reach the audiences that want to engage with their brands. We'll continue to work with our advertising partners to create engaging, branded entertainment experiences as well as seamless, programmatic buying opportunities. And with our renewed commitment to owning and growing our Display marketplace, our advertisers will continue to see Yahoo! as a key piece of their online strategy with simple, targeted and effective advertising opportunities. Ultimately, we want to be the favored partner of advertisers. 
In closing, while we have a lot to do, the future for Yahoo! is incredibly bright. Our extraordinary global reach and unique content position will allow us to build transformative products and compelling content that will be indispensable to people's daily lives. Our products will change how people learn, share and communicate. We will inspire, innovate and entertain. 
I came to Yahoo! to grow and to help redefine one of the Internet's most beloved companies. But what I found is that I'm not alone in that passion. No one wants Yahoo! to grow more than the people who work here. We're committed to going back to our roots as a consumer Internet company focused on user experience. 
The excitement and optimism that permeates Yahoo! right now is undeniable. And with the leadership and guidance of our new management team, it's time to execute. We believe that Yahoo!'s best days lie ahead. We intend to do great things, and we intend to win. Now let's take some of your questions."

I don't think that this is a situation where there's a giant pivot and we're going to a completely different business. I think this is about improved execution and seeing the opportunities that already are apparent within our business. That means focusing on daily habits, like Search, Mail, home page, Mobile. It means investing in key verticals where we're already in a leadership position. And we need to make the bridge to Mobile, Finance, News, Sports, Games, Messenger, Flickr, Answers, Groups, the core big Properties here at Yahoo!. I also think it's really important for us to be a terrific company to partner with, not only for our advertisers but also for other technology companies. Yahoo! occupies an interesting and unique space where we don't have as much channel conflict with other players and technology as many of our other comparable companies, which means that we can partner with different companies with their browsers, with social networks, with their mobile operating systems. And I think that there's a great opportunity there. And I also think that the mobile wave is a huge wave for us to ride, and it's a great way for us to take our content and our current investments and make them more relevant moving forward. In terms of your second question, Search versus Display, these are already 2 very large, very successful businesses, so think it's difficult to say which one we should choose. It's somewhat of a false dichotomy. That said, I do think that there is potentially more upside in Search. We can see right now that given some of the monetization challenges we've faced, that there is an opportunity there to improve monetization. That said, the content investment that we've made yields so many impressions and page views and so much opportunity around brand advertisement that is very compelling. When I look at Yahoo!'s business, we again occupy a very interesting and unique space in the market, where what we -- what we see is that because we have people who are interested in finance or interested in entertainment news, interested in sports, we fundamentally have a great segmentation of audiences already. And many of the other people who operate in terms of display advertising are either less granular and they understand less about their users or are much more granular. What we find, and when I talked to advertisers, what I've seen and heard from them is that the way that audiences tend to aggregate on Yahoo! is unique and particularly advantageous to them in terms of what they ultimately want for audience-based buying. And for that reason, I think that I'm bullish on both Search and Display, but I really think, given the trend towards audience-based buying in the advertising space, the Display opportunity is particularly compelling."

On the international market, there, we are really looking -- again, we are looking here to build growth. And so, as we've assessed different countries, one of the things we want to do is we want to really bring a coherence to our offerings across different markets. So while we have some markets where our product offerings are very different and we intend -- and are very successful and we intend to keep them in place that way, I do think there's an opportunity for us to take our very vast set of offerings, narrow it to a very compelling set of offerings and really make it much more compelling around the world. For example, you may -- in terms of how we may change this in the future, you may have seen, for example, on News on Friday of closing our Korean operations. The reason we chose to do that is because as much as it was a very successful market for us historically and it's something that we're very proud of the team there, we have a great team, and they've worked very hard, we had a hard time finding a growth story moving forward. Well, that isn't the case with many of the other markets. So I think we're likely to stay in markets where we see an opportunity for growth, be it on the desktop or in mobile, and we're likely to withdraw from markets where we don't see growth. Though, I will say that, to date, Korea has been an unusual exception in that space. In terms of the question around local, it is something I've spent a lot of time working on and I really do love and I'm very compelled by. With that said, I also have a deep respect for it, but it's very hard to do it well. It requires a deep investment, a lot of people, a lot of energy and time to build terrific listings. We have some offerings in the space already, including Yahoo! Small to Medium Business offerings, where we host websites and stores. We also have Yahoo! Maps, where we have licenses in place to support that. So I think that our local offerings are good at the moment. I think it's hard to take that next step to provide even deeper functionality. And so, while we don't intend to make significant changes there in the short term, I do think that it's probably not an area where we're going to invest heavily moving forward."

In terms of the possible acquisitions, I want to echo what Ken said. We don't have particular acquisitions in mind today. We do need the flexibility, where if we see something that aligns well with our business and provides terrific growth that we can make that acquisition. That said, I think one of the things that is lost on people is because so many of the high-profile tech acquisitions are above the $1 billion mark, people tend to think that tech acquisitions are all in that space, and that's just not the case. Many acquisitions and most acquisitions, a vast majority, are less than $100 million. And so we're looking for smaller-scale acquisitions that align well overall with our businesses. In my history and my career, I've done about 20 or so such acquisitions, and I think that the size and scale that's comfortable for a great integration, a great product coming out of it is something that's much more in the size and scale of double-digit millions and low hundreds of millions."

The tax rate on Alibaba was probably closer to 40%, so you can figure it all out. And so, yes, I think there's really nothing that atypical, if you will, in thinking about how working capital here works. And so we are going to be very focused on free cash flow, free cash flow growth. More correctly stated, we're going to be focused on EBITDA. But again, the way to really create value is growth in those metrics, not having them stay thin.

In a recent all-hands, I asked people, how many people in the past month have had someone say, ""I'd really like to come work there."" And 2, probably, the vast majority of the hands in this room went up. People tell me that's a marked change from the past. So I think people are excited to come work here. I think that's shown with the management team and how quickly we've built that. I've been hearing from various entrepreneurs and investors that people are excited at the prospect of potentially selling their companies to Yahoo!. They think this is a great place great place for companies to land. So I think in the case of some of these smaller-scale acquisitions, we can be a very good home for those people. So I think that there's actually terrific potential in terms of hiring here. And as I said, some of the cultural changes that we've made around just being much more open with employees, providing nice benefits like the free food. I hope this is making their productivity that much better with things like the mobile phones, and also just reducing bureaucracy in terms of what it takes to get something done here is something that is ultimately getting us on the path to really making Yahoo! the absolute best place to work.

So we would like to offer our products on iOS as well as on Android. And I think that it's important to remember that, that list of items, checking stocks, checking news, checking weather, sharing photos, getting all of the -- all of those types of things are things that people do on the phone. And in that situation, Yahoo! has a unique set of content that we can provide our end-users, and that's something we've invested a lot in and I think it's something that is differentiating and a unique advantage. In terms of advertising technology, I think that, obviously, in terms of Search, we are cooperating with Microsoft on the Bing Yahoo! network in terms of selling our Search inventory. In terms of Display, I'll harken back to what I talked about earlier in terms of audience-based buying and the opportunity that our verticals provide in Display advertising. Our verticals already aggregate our users at a level of granularity that advertisers understand, and they provide a level of engagement that is something that isn't often seen on the Web. And so, I do think that the particular products we have, the way that they align with advertiser spend, be it in a sports-based context, an entertainment-based context, in autos, in travel, et cetera, these are things that align really well with advertiser spend and are a large enough block to be meaningful to be purchased, but not so small and so over-personalized that it's difficult to actually get a meaningful number of impressions and a meaningful impact from your campaign. So I do think that we occupy an interesting space inside of Display, and that's one of our advantages."

And to the end that we are able to create a coherent set of very compelling mobile applications that people viewed on a daily basis, that also provide us an avenue to not only serve advertising in display or video or mobile format there but also to drive Search. And finally, in terms of monetization, I think that there are some elements that are going to continue to be challenging, and we're working with Microsoft very closely on those. And this has to do with, for example, auction dynamics, the network dynamics and some of the ways that advertisers spend on the platform. I do think that we've had a lot of success with what some might call publisher changes or user-interface changes. In fact, in the past year, a lot of the upside that we have seen in Search had come from changes we've made to our user interface to make our ads perform better on a click-through-rate basis.

On the Display piece, I don't think that we are over-monetizing the site. That said, the way that I really look at this is, in the Display and advertising world on the Internet, basically, your revenue is a function of traffic times RPM, revenue per thousand pages. And so one way you can look at this is there are ways where we could perhaps back off some of the ad units, especially if they're very disruptive to the end user experience. The reason to do that would be, of course, if that causes you just to like the site more, traffic, in theory, should rise. So if we basically reduce one of the variables in that equation, RPM, the only reason to do that is if we actually think traffic will grow because the users' appreciation for the products will grow. But I think that to the extent that we make changes like that, we're hoping for those kinds of trade-offs. And on the question around Search, I will hand over to Ken."

That said, when we look at things like the Olympics, like the upcoming elections or even the conventions that happened at the end of August, what we're seeing is, that by putting our reporters and our editors there, we are able to create interesting unique pieces of content that do drive meaningful page views and engagement, 3.5 billion minutes, for example, on the Olympics.

I do think that there is all kinds of hallmarks of terrific products. I think they are low latency. They understand the user need. They make it fast and simple and straightforward to ultimately get what you need. As an end-user, I think all those are very important. Another piece of a great product is an element of differentiation. And I do think that, for example, omg!, some of our original videos actually are interesting and important pieces of differentiation. So I do think that we will be doing some continued investment there. For example, as we've discussed earlier, the Olympics, the election, a lot of our live events and some of our other original programming are very important. On the question around the automation of Display advertising and, particularly, programmatic buying, I do think this is an area where Yahoo! needs to invest more. Well, ultimately, there will always be advertisers where we need to do something like creating a custom branded experience in order to create entertainment, or because it's just a very important campaign or a very large campaign that there will be elements of manual touch. It think it's also important for us to enable our advertisers if they have an idea for how to run a campaign, and they want to log onto a system in the middle of the night and file a campaign, I think we need to have a system that makes that really easy to do. And I think that, today, we have that, but it could be better. And so that's something that where we do need to ultimately change the mix of our manual versus programmatic buying, and that's something that -- one of the reasons why we're investing in the ad technology platforms that we had announced in September and we enforce today."

As opposed to having 1 or 2 coherent technology platforms over our various verticals and over our various offerings, we have almost 1 system per vertical, and that's improved in recent years, but it's still, by and large, the case.

So while Yahoo! has a lot of user data, pulling together that understanding in one centralized place and having all of our different offerings access that is something that we don't have in place today and we'll need to get in place in the future.

I'd like to start by saying that I'm thrilled to be here at Yahoo!, and I'm happy to give all of you an update on the business today. My first nearly 100 days have been incredibly energizing and, honestly, a lot",1240,"Thank you, Joon. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by saying that I'm thrilled to be here at Yahoo!, and I'm happy to give all of you an update on the business today. My first nearly 100 days have been incredibly energizing and, honestly, a lot of fun. 
Yahoo! is a truly iconic company, one that I've had great respect for since I first discovered it as a Stanford student back in 1994. At that time, Yahoo! was called Jerry and Dave's Guide to the World Wide Web. Even then, it was obvious what an essential tool it was and the incredible potential. 
Beyond that potential and its storied history, some of you might ask, ""Why did I in particular come to Yahoo!?"" In short, this job is tailor-made for me. The core components of Yahoo!'s business, Search, Mail, ads, Mobile, News and the home page are also the core products that I've built my career upon. So my answer is simple. I came to Yahoo! to grow and to help redefine one of the Internet's most beloved companies. 
This afternoon, I'd like to discuss my priorities over the past quarter, including our efforts around people and products. Then, following Ken Goldman's review of the third quarter financials, I'll discuss the vision and direction for Yahoo! moving forward. 
Let's begin with our people. Companies are all about people, and the companies with the best talent win. It's no secret that our team has experienced numerous changes this past year. From my very first day in July, we've been zeroing in on the efficiency, well-being and accountability of our 12,000 employees. We have a close-knit culture, establishing an open dialogue with employees as well as a commitment to transparency. We've put in place feedback tools, systems that remove bureaucracy, new performance measurements for Yahoo! and clearly laid out quarterly goals for the company. These new systems are working to improve our execution. As of today, 93% of our employees have quarterly individual goals that map to company goals. And of course, one of our company goals is that we will soon be at 100%. 
True cultural change can't be bought, so the vast majority of what we've done has cost nothing. That said, we have made smart and thoughtful investments in new mobile phones for our employees so they can test our products and provide feedback. We've also begun to offer what is a standard here in Silicon Valley at top companies and start-ups: free food for our hard-working employees. 
Our goals are simple: execute faster, return value to our shareholders, attract the best talent and make Yahoo! the absolute best place to work. In an incredibly short period of time, we have built a stellar, world-class leadership team across all the core functions of the business: finance, sales, human resources, development, marketing and legal. In a moment, you'll hear from Ken Goldman, our new Chief Financial Officer, who brings more than 25 years of experience as a public company CFO to his role. Ken will help lead our financial fitness moving forward. 
Henrique de Castro will be joining as Yahoo!'s Chief Operating Officer. Henrique is one of the most respected and accomplished businesspeople in the realm of Internet advertising. With his rigorous and analytical approach, he'll lead our strategy and execution in enhancing our advertising solutions and the value that we provide to our advertisers. 
Ron Bell, a Yahoo! veteran with a rich 13-year history at the company and an incredibly deep set of perspectives on the company's products and policies, has been promoted to be our General Counsel. 
We've also brought on Jackie Reses as head of people and development. With a background in private equity and a reputation for doing smart and savvy deals in integration, Jackie is focused on hiring, acquiring and retaining the smartest minds in our industry. I'm already impressed with the change in talent pool of our candidates. It's increased in quality and volume. 
Finally, Kathy Savitt has brought her infectious energy and extensive consumer marketing experience as our new CMO, and she'll help us reimagine the Yahoo! brand. 
In Yahoo! fantasy sports, I would draft this exact group as my dream team. I'm positively thrilled to be working with them. That we were able to attract such well-known and capable leaders and so quickly is a testimony to Yahoo!'s potential. They joined a capable and qualified management team that is already in place here at Yahoo!. 
In addition to focusing on our people and empowering them to execute, we've also focused on our products. Over the past 3 months, I dedicated significant time to product and business reviews with hundreds of our employees. We started with Search. While our Search area's challenged, we're working closely with Microsoft to define the future of Search. Many people are surprised to learn that our alliance with Microsoft affords Yahoo! significant control over our Search user experience and the ability to innovate therein. We're also thinking aggressively about how to grow share from the market and not just trade Search share with each other. 
On the economics front, as we've said in the past, our alliance has fallen below our expectations. So we are benefiting from a revenue guarantee. Ken will talk more about this in a moment. 
Turning to Mobile, our offerings and their usage have been growing nicely. As part of our Mobile efforts this quarter, we've redesigned our Mobile search page across 23 countries, resulting in increased usage. We released an updated version of Flickr for Android, which has been getting rave reviews from our end users, including thousands of 5-star ratings. And we've also launched IntoNow 3.0, a fun way to connect with friends and get more from your TV watching. 
Looking at content, our high-quality content products differentiate Yahoo! and drive impressive user engagement. For example, in Q3, our global coverage around the 2012 London Olympic Games resulted in more traffic than we received for Vancouver and Beijing Games combined. Our users spent 3.5 billion minutes watching our Olympics programming, reading articles and viewing photos. 
Turning to advertising. In September, we announced that we will continue to own and invest in our Display ad technology, including guaranteed, non-guaranteed, Genome and the Right Media Display marketplace. We're deeply committed to our core technologies and platforms to ensure we continue to be leaders in this space. The advertising partners that I've talked to love the audience-based buying that Yahoo! enables. They would buy more if they could. Our opportunity in advertising is around making the ad platform and tools more efficient but also increasing usage of our consumer products and, therefore, impressions, so we have more to sell. 
I'm very pleased with our people and product progress in Q3. It was an active and solid quarter with some nice achievements. In addition, as you know, in September, we reviewed our capital allocation strategy, and we committed to return $3 billion of additional capital to our investors from the Alibaba transaction. At the current price levels, we think it's economically attractive to repurchase stock. However, we will continually monitor the best method of returning capital to drive the most shareholder value. 
Finally, third quarter revenue was once again stable. We've now had 3 quarters of modest revenue growth and encouraging numbers in Search and Display. On that note, let me pass it over to Ken Goldman to walk through our Q3 financials in-depth. Ken?"

Yahoo! is a well-respect",1842,"Great, and thank you, Marissa. Good afternoon, all, and thank you for joining us today. I am excited to be joining Yahoo! and speaking to you all on my first official day as CFO. This is a proud company, and I am proud to be here. Yahoo! is a well-respected global brand. Everyone that I have talked to wants this company to succeed. Interestingly, I have received literally several hundred congratulatory messages, and all of them note how they use Yahoo! Properties in their daily lives. As you will hear, I am a firm believer in Marissa's vision for the company and furthering Yahoo! as a great place to work. On the call today, I'll walk through the 3Q financial results and then provide detail on the impact to our financial statements from the Alibaba transaction. 
So relative to the 3Q highlights, we'll start off with some of the third quarter financials. As I refer to these metrics, please view the slides available on our IR website to follow along, starting along -- starting with Slide 5, financials and key metrics at a glance. 
Revenue ex-TAC of $1.89 billion grew 2% over last year and marked the third quarter in a row of modest revenue growth for the company. Global Display revenue ex-TAC was roughly flat in the quarter versus prior year as 4% growth in the Americas was offset by weakness in EMEA. Global Search revenue ex-TAC grew 11% over 3Q 2011, driven once again by improvements on Yahoo! sites as well as a higher guaranteed payment from Microsoft in the prior year. 
Operating income, excluding restructuring charges of $25 million, was $177 million 3Q, a modest increase versus third quarter 2011. Non-GAAP EPS, excluding restructuring charges and the impact of the Alibaba transaction, was $0.35 in the quarter, 66% higher than 3Q 2011. We repurchased $190 million worth of stock in the quarter. And finally, we ended the quarter with approximately $9.4 billion in cash and investments. 
Now before I dive into details behind these numbers, I want to first give a brief, high-level overview of the opportunity I see here and why I joined the company. Overall, I believe this company has tremendous assets through its massive loyal audience and very promising products and properties in virtually every major category. Also clear to me that a lot of great work has been done over the last few years to strengthen the underlying fundamentals of the operating business. And real success has been achieved. We have much work to do, and this will take some time, but the evidence of stabilized financial results is beginning to show in this quarter. 
Revenue was stable with 3Q representing the third quarter in a row of modest growth in total revenue ex-TAC and second quarter in a row of Display revenue ex-TAC with growth in the Americas region. Operating margins are healthy, so we also have room for upside once we're able to grow the top line and scale the business. 
We will also ensure we spend our resources with discipline, wisely and prudently based on investing for growth and efficiency. And we have a very strong balance sheet with abundant liquidity. Our primary objective as a new management team is to leverage our assets, competitive strengths and available resources to transition this company from financial stability to a growth business, serving our customers with a distinct Yahoo! identity. We are very mindful of shareholder value creation. 
So let me walk through the financial results in more detail, and you can see these turning to Slide 7 and 8. Display revenue ex-TAC was $452 million, roughly flat with the prior year. Breaking down Display by region, Americas region grew 4%, driven primarily by favorable pricing mix. Sell-through rates on Class 1 inventory improved once again, but we continue to face headwinds from declining available impressions in Class 2, particularly in Mail. Campaigns around the Olympics sold well in the quarter but proved to be somewhat cannibalistic to other spending as few advertisers increased their overall budgets. 
In EMEA, trends were once again weak due primarily to the economy, which negatively impacted Display revenue by approximately $9 million in the quarter. APAC Display ex-TAC was down slightly in  U.S. dollar terms but roughly flat on a local currency basis. Going forward, we will endeavor to better understand margin contributions in each geographic region and how we can improve. Search revenues ex-TAC once again performed well in the third quarter, growing 11% versus prior year and 7% on a sequential basis. Both Yahoo!-driven RPS improvements as well as our higher guaranteed payment accounted for the upside in Search. 
Looking at price and volume dynamics, the upside was driven by both quick yield at PPC, including the RPS guarantee, as total eligible searches were flat in the quarter on a global basis. 
From a regional perspective, similar trends prevailed within Display, with positive results in the Americas segment offset by weakness in EMEA and a slight decline at APAC in U.S. dollar terms. 
And as it relates to Microsoft guaranteed payment, a number of factors go into calculating the amount, including variables like economic growth, which resulted in a higher year-over-year payment. Looking to next year, as you all know, the current guarantee is set to expire in April of 2013. If the revenue guarantee is not renewed, we view the total risk to our financials to be less than $100 million on an annualized basis. 
In terms of other revenue ex-TAC of $223 million, it declined 10% versus the prior year but was flat sequentially. As was highlighted on 2Q call, we will continue to feel the impact of the final broadband step-down when viewed on a year-over-year basis for 2 more quarters. But sequentially, there'll be no material additional impact. Also, going forward, other revenue will be boosted by amortization of the $550 million upfront payment related to the TIPLA with the Alibaba Group. This payment will be amortized over 48 months and recognized in other revenue. In -- at 3Q, this amount was just $4.5 million. However, in 4Q and beyond, we will recognize approximately $34 million of additional revenue per quarter. 
I'm now talking about operating expenses and operating income, and you can see this on Slide 10. Total operating expenses less TAC and adjusted for restructuring charges of $25 million were $912 million in third quarter, resulting in an adjusted operating margin ex-TAC of 16%, in line with that of 3Q '11. Adjusted operating income ex-TAC modestly increased to $177 million versus the prior year. 
Stepping down the income statement, the company was able to realize certain foreign tax credits in 3Q that improved net income by $135 million. This resulted in a negative effective tax rate in the quarter, excluding the Alibaba gain. 
I'm now going to turn to balance sheet and cash flow, and you can see the key balance sheet and cash flow statement highlights on Slides 12 and 13. Capital expenditures was $140 million in the quarter, up from levels experienced the prior 2 quarters. They related primarily to our data center investments. 
Free cash flow was $920 million in the quarter. Excluding the $500 million TIPLA payment, free cash flow was $370 million in the quarter, which was up 50% from the prior year. As noted, our cash and investments balance at the end of the quarter was $9.4 billion. However, approximately $2.5 billion of this is reserved for payment for taxes on the Alibaba transaction. In addition, we have included the $800 million preferred equity received from Alibaba as a separate item in the balance sheet, which is not included in the $9.4 billion figure just mentioned. 
At the end of the quarter, the market value of our stakes in Yahoo! Japan and Alibaba Group was $7.7 billion and $8.1 billion, using the quarter end closing price per share and the price per share in the most recent transaction, respectively. 
So let me go through a few other activities and updates. Before I walk through the Alibaba impact, I am pleased to announce today we're entering into an revolving credit facility with capacity of $750 million. The facility is currently undrawn and is expected to be used for general corporate purposes. With regards to the form and timing of churn of the proceeds from the Alibaba transaction, as Marissa discussed in her remarks, we think it's both in our best economic interest as well as shareholder interest to repurchase Yahoo! stock at these levels. 
In terms of Alibaba, let me walk through the transaction and how it impacts the financial statements this quarter as there are a number of adjustments to be made. First, as you know, we are pleased to close the first stage of previously announced transactions in September. And really, a special thank you goes out to Tim Morse for all the great hard work he put into getting this deal done. It was a huge effort and a great success for the company. 
We received gross proceeds in cash and preferred equity of $7.6 billion. $7.1 billion of this was from the sale of shares, and $550 million was related to the TIPLA. We received approximately $6.8 billion in cash proceeds and $800 million in preferred equity. 
Starting at the top of the P&L, we recognized $4.5 million of other revenue from the amortization of the TIPLA in the final few days of the quarter, as mentioned earlier. Further down, you will see $4.6 billion in other income. This is our booked gain on sale, net of transaction fees. Also included in this number is accrued interest in the preferred equity in the quarter, which was just a few million dollars. And net gain realized after taxes and fees from the sale of shares was $2.8 billion during the quarter. 
On the cash flow statement, accrued expenses and liabilities related to this transaction increased by $2.5 billion. This relates to taxes owed, but not yet paid, on the sale of our Alibaba shares. Most of this cash will go out in Q4. 
On the close of the transaction, we now own approximately 24% of Alibaba group's outstanding shares in addition to the $800 million in preferred equity. Once again, the pretax value of our equity stake, based on the recent transaction price per share of $15.50, is $8.1 billion, again not including $800 million of preferred. Cost basis for tax purposes of this stake is approximately $250 million. 
So in terms of guidance before I close, as you might expect, we are not prepared to give guidance today given my short history with the company. Between now and the next earnings call, we will evaluate what form of guidance to provide on an ongoing basis. 
Thank you for your time today. I am extremely excited to be here and look forward again to know and meet all of you. I also realize we'd much rather hear from Marissa and her plans for the future, so I'll turn it back to Marissa."

I'm very pleased with our Q3 financial results. We have a solid foundation on which now to grow. Fundamentally, Yahoo! is part of the consumer Internet, where growth is expected. We'll become a growth company by inspiring and delighting our users. The first step is to grow at the same pace as the particular market that we are in, which we already do in a number of cases but not all. Later, the goal will be to gain users and share disproportionately. 
Our vision and direction for Yahoo! is to make the world's daily habits inspiring and entertaining. Let's start with the daily habits part. At Yahoo!, we see users making daily use of Search, Mail, the home page and Mobile, among other offerings. Search is a core daily habit for all of us and a fundamental user behavior, the top priority for Yahoo!. We'll focus on reshaping Search, driving smart distribution deals and making organic investments to grow our market share. There's a clear upside potential here, and it's time now to execute against it. 
Communication is another of these daily habits and is prime to be reimagined. There is great opportunity to modernize Yahoo! Mail and Messenger, especially given the continual increase in the amount of communication we're all receiving. The Yahoo! home page is one of the biggest draws on the Web, including more content and being more precise in the targeting of content and advertisements to make this daily habit even more compelling for our users. Mobile represents not only a daily habit, but a fundamental and massive platform shift, a platform shift that we have to ride and participate in, in order to be relevant. 
Today, there are more than 1 billion smartphone users globally. As expected, that will double in the next 3 years. And while we've made progress, Yahoo! hasn't capitalized on the mobile opportunity. We haven't effectively optimized our websites, we've underinvested in our mobile front-end development and we've splintered our brands. We have more than 76 applications across Android and iOS. All of this needs to change. Our top priority is a focused, coherent, mobile strategy. We're accelerating our efforts to build a strong technical talent base for mobile. This includes engineers, product managers and designers. 
As the world becomes increasingly mobile, the way we all consume content has dramatically shifted. Interestingly, when you look at the most frequent uses of smartphones, they include checking the weather, checking sports scores, checking stock quotes and other financial information, watching videos, sharing photos, getting the latest news and playing games. Does that sound like any particular company that you know? Yahoo!, with its content and leadership in these key verticals, is already very well positioned here. We will continue to work with top partners and media companies to further build and scale these opportunities. We'll strive to make the daily habits of smartphone and tablet use more social, engaging, beautiful and compelling. 
Yahoo! is about inspiring and delighting our users. Much of that inspiration and delight will stem from what we know and understand about our users and their needs. In that context, personalization of content and advertising is fundamental. Personalization has been part of our DNA for some time, and it's key to a great user experience. Our home page alone serves millions of different combinations of content every day. This deepens the engagement that inspires our users' actions, like clicking, reading and sharing. We just scratched the surface of personalization, and we're going to continue to invest in shaping the future here. 
Inspiring and entertaining our users extends to our advertising partners as well. Using our solutions, advertisers can reach the audiences that want to engage with their brands. We'll continue to work with our advertising partners to create engaging, branded entertainment experiences as well as seamless, programmatic buying opportunities. And with our renewed commitment to owning and growing our Display marketplace, our advertisers will continue to see Yahoo! as a key piece of their online strategy with simple, targeted and effective advertising opportunities. Ultimately, we want to be the favored partner of advertisers. 
In closing, while we have a lot to do, the future for Yahoo! is incredibly bright. Our extraordinary global reach and unique content position will allow us to build transformative products and compelling content that will be indispensable to people's daily lives. Our products will change how people learn, share and communicate. We will inspire, innovate and entertain. 
I came to Yahoo! to grow and to help redefine one of the Internet's most beloved companies. But what I found is that I'm not alone in that passion. No one wants Yahoo! to grow more than the people who work here. We're committed to going back to our roots as a consumer Internet company focused on user experience. 
The excitement and optimism that permeates Yahoo! right now is undeniable. And with the leadership and guidance of our new management team, it's time to execute. We believe that Yahoo!'s best days lie ahead. We intend to do great things, and we intend to win. Now let's take some of your questions."

I don't think that this is a situation where there's a giant pivot and we're going to a completely different business. I think this is about improved execution and seeing the opportunities that already are apparent within our business. That means focusing on daily habits, like Search, Mail, home page, Mobile. It means investing in key verticals where we're already in a leadership position. And we need to make the bridge to Mobile, Finance, News, Sports, Games, Messenger, Flickr, Answers, Groups, the core big Properties here at Yahoo!. I also think it's really important for us to be a terrific company to partner with, not only for our advertisers but also for other technology companies. Yahoo! occupies an interesting and unique space where we don't have as much channel conflict with other players and technology as many of our other comparable companies, which means that we can partner with different companies with their browsers, with social networks, with their mobile operating systems. And I think that there's a great opportunity there. And I also think that the mobile wave is a huge wave for us to ride, and it's a great way for us to take our content and our current investments and make them more relevant moving forward. In terms of your second question, Search versus Display, these are already 2 very large, very successful businesses, so think it's difficult to say which 1 we should choose. It's somewhat of a false dichotomy. That said, I do think that there is potentially more upside in Search. We can see right now that given some of the monetization challenges we've faced, that there is an opportunity there to improve monetization. That said, the content investment that we've made yields so many impressions and page views and so much opportunity around brand advertisement that is very compelling. When I look at Yahoo!'s business, we again occupy a very interesting and unique space in the market, where what we -- what we see is that because we have people who are interested in finance or interested in entertainment news, interested in sports, we fundamentally have a great segmentation of audiences already. And many of the other people who operate in terms of display advertising are either less granular and they understand less about their users or are much more granular. What we find, and when I talked to advertisers, what I've seen and heard from them is that the way that audiences tend to aggregate on Yahoo! is unique and particularly advantageous to them in terms of what they ultimately want for audience-based buying. And for that reason, I think that I'm bullish on both Search and Display, but I really think, given the trend towards audience-based buying in the advertising space, the Display opportunity is particularly compelling."

On the international market, there, we are really looking -- again, we are looking here to build growth. And so, as we've assessed different countries, one of the things we want to do is we want to really bring a coherence to our offerings across different markets. So while we have some markets where our product offerings are very different and we intend -- and are very successful and we intend to keep them in place that way, I do think there's an opportunity for us to take our very vast set of offerings, narrow it to a very compelling set of offerings and really make it much more compelling around the world. For example, you may -- in terms of how we may change this in the future, you may have seen, for example, on News on Friday of closing our Korean operations. The reason we chose to do that is because as much as it was a very successful market for us historically and it's something that we're very proud of the team there, we have a great team, and they've worked very hard, we had a hard time finding a growth story moving forward. Well, that isn't the case with many of the other markets. So I think we're likely to stay in markets where we see an opportunity for growth, be it on the desktop or in mobile, and we're likely to withdraw from markets where we don't see growth. Though, I will say that, to date, Korea has been an unusual exception in that space. In terms of the question around local, it is something I've spent a lot of time working on and I really do love and I'm very compelled by. With that said, I also have a deep respect for it, but it's very hard to do it well. It requires a deep investment, a lot of people, a lot of energy and time to build terrific listings. We have some offerings in the space already, including Yahoo! Small to Medium Business offerings, where we host websites and stores. We also have Yahoo! Maps, where we have licenses in place to support that. So I think that our local offerings are good at the moment. I think it's hard to take that next step to provide even deeper functionality. And so, while we don't intend to make significant changes there in the short term, I do think that it's probably not an area where we're going to invest heavily moving forward."

In terms of the possible acquisitions, I want to echo what Ken said. We don't have particular acquisitions in mind today. We do need the flexibility, where if we see something that aligns well with our business and provides terrific growth that we can make that acquisition. That said, I think one of the things that is lost on people is because so many of the high-profile tech acquisitions are above the $1 billion mark, people tend to think that tech acquisitions are all in that space, and that's just not the case. Many acquisitions and most acquisitions, a vast majority, are less than $100 million. And so we're looking for smaller-scale acquisitions that align well overall with our businesses. In my history and my career, I've done about 20 or so such acquisitions, and I think that the size and scale that's comfortable for a great integration, a great product coming out of it is something that's much more in the size and scale of double-digit millions and low hundreds of millions."

If you excluded that, our tax rate would have been more like it has been historically this year in the mid-35s -- or mid-30s, I should say. The tax rate on Alibaba was probably closer to 40%, so you can figure it all out. And so, yes, I think there's really nothing that atypical, if you will, in thinking about how working capital here works. And so we are going to be very focused on free cash flow, free cash flow growth. More correctly stated, we're going to be focused on EBITDA. But again, the way to really create value is growth in those metrics, not having them stay thin. And I think, frankly, I think a lot of people have sort of assumed that those numbers are flat or stable. And, yes, we are happy that we did achieve stable results this quarter. But honestly, the way to win is to grow those numbers, and that's what we're focused on here."

So we do need to grow that, and we also need to help the people who are already here develop the skills around building out mobile applications. So I think that, that is something that's really key. I will say and echo what I said earlier is I'm already impressed with the change in our applicant pool. There's a lot of excitement here at Yahoo! In a recent all-hands, I asked people, how many people in the past month have had someone say, ""I'd really like to come work there."" And two, probably, the vast majority of the hands in this room went up. People tell me that's a marked change from the past. So I think people are excited to come work here. I think that's shown with the management team and how quickly we've built that. I've been hearing from various entrepreneurs and investors that people are excited at the prospect of potentially selling their companies to Yahoo!. They think this is a great place great place for companies to land. So I think in the case of some of these smaller-scale acquisitions, we can be a very good home for those people. So I think that there's actually terrific potential in terms of hiring here. And as I said, some of the cultural changes that we've made around just being much more open with employees, providing nice benefits like the free food. I hope this is making their productivity that much better with things like the mobile phones, and also just reducing bureaucracy in terms of what it takes to get something done here is something that is ultimately getting us on the path to really making Yahoo! the absolute best place to work.

In terms of winning in mobile without a mobile OS, I actually view that one of the advantages here is that we don't have a mobile operating system because it allows us to operate and innovate and provide our products across all the different platforms. So we would like to offer our products on iOS as well as on Android. And I think that it's important to remember that, that list of items, checking stocks, checking news, checking weather, sharing photos, getting all of the -- all of those types of things are things that people do on the phone. And in that situation, Yahoo! has a unique set of content that we can provide our end-users, and that's something we've invested a lot in and I think it's something that is differentiating and a unique advantage. In terms of advertising technology, I think that, obviously, in terms of Search, we are cooperating with Microsoft on the Bing Yahoo! network in terms of selling our Search inventory. In terms of Display, I'll harken back to what I talked about earlier in terms of audience-based buying and the opportunity that our verticals provide in Display advertising. Our verticals already aggregate our users at a level of granularity that advertisers understand, and they provide a level of engagement that is something that isn't often seen on the Web. And so, I do think that the particular products we have, the way that they align with advertiser spend, be it in a sports-based context, an entertainment-based context, in autos, in travel, et cetera, these are things that align really well with advertiser spend and are a large enough block to be meaningful to be purchased, but not so small and so over-personalized that it's difficult to actually get a meaningful number of impressions and a meaningful impact from your campaign. So I do think that we occupy an interesting space inside of Display, and that's one of our advantages."

In terms of mobile share, I think that there is going to be a few large players in the mobile search space, and I think that Yahoo! should absolutely be one of them. And to the end that we are able to create a coherent set of very compelling mobile applications that people viewed on a daily basis, that also provide us an avenue to not only serve advertising in display or video or mobile format there but also to drive Search. And finally, in terms of monetization, I think that there are some elements that are going to continue to be challenging, and we're working with Microsoft very closely on those. And this has to do with, for example, auction dynamics, the network dynamics and some of the ways that advertisers spend on the platform. I do think that we've had a lot of success with what some might call publisher changes or user-interface changes. In fact, in the past year, a lot of the upside that we have seen in Search had come from changes we've made to our user interface to make our ads perform better on a click-through-rate basis. And ultimately, those publisher changes have also helped us increase, not only revenue per search, but also cost per click."

That said, the way that I really look at this is, in the Display and advertising world on the Internet, basically, your revenue is a function of traffic times RPM, revenue per thousand pages. And so one way you can look at this is there are ways where we could perhaps back off some of the ad units, especially if they're very disruptive to the end user experience. The reason to do that would be, of course, if that causes you just to like the site more, traffic, in theory, should rise. So if we basically reduce one of the variables in that equation, RPM, the only reason to do that is if we actually think traffic will grow because the users' appreciation for the products will grow. But I think that to the extent that we make changes like that, we're hoping for those kinds of trade-offs. And on the question around Search, I will hand over to Ken."

For example, as we've discussed earlier, the Olympics, the election, a lot of our live events and some of our other original programming are very important. On the question around the automation of Display advertising and, particularly, programmatic buying, I do think this is an area where Yahoo! needs to invest more. Well, ultimately, there will always be advertisers where we need to do something like creating a custom branded experience in order to create entertainment, or because it's just a very important campaign or a very large campaign that there will be elements of manual touch. It think it's also important for us to enable our advertisers if they have an idea for how to run a campaign, and they want to log onto a system in the middle of the night and file a campaign, I think we need to have a system that makes that really easy to do. And I think that, today, we have that, but it could be better.

That said, I do think growing at industry rates is the first step. I think it will take multiple years to get to where I want the company to be, which is above market growth. That said, I do think that there will be measurable progress, such that shareholders will be able to see growth at the industry level or above in the meantime. Today, we already have some areas where we are growing at an industry level. We just have a few areas where we're not that really have some potential upside even if we can just get to growing at the industry rate."

Relative to repurchasing stock, yes, we're looking right now at very simply OMR, other market repurchase -- so open market repurchase. So we're going to do that for now. At least that's the way we're thinking about it. We may change over time. We'll look at it. We'll evaluate the stock. And again, saying what I said before and I'll just repeat it because we feel strongly that we just think buying back stock at these levels is extremely attractive. Great use of cash, good for our shareholders, good for our future dilution, if you will, of our stock or less dilution, if you will. So we think it's just a great use of that $3 billion of cash that we've previously committed in terms of how to use it for now. So we'll do open market repurchase for now and -- but again, I don't want to be -- I don't want me to forever do it that way. We may change over time."

By and large, I think that we aren't necessarily looking at large-scale restructurings. What we're looking at is bringing the company into alignment with the new strategy. So again, that strategy is focusing on the daily habits of Mail, Search, Homepage, Mobile; continuing to invest and really rejuvenating our investment in the key verticals where we already have a leadership position: Finance, Sports, News, Flickr, many of those; and really getting very focused on the shift to mobile. And so we will be doing some realignments to make sure that we have people in all of those key areas where we need to increase our investment. But at this point, it's really about getting aligned with our strategy and getting goals for the company aligned with that, so we can ultimately execute in a really excellent way."

You've also talked about differentiation and personalization. To me, that all adds up to data. And really dating back to the launch of My Yahoo!, Yahoo! has been sitting on a tremendous amount of user data. What's been lacking in your view in terms of taking that data and making it actionable for advertisers in really driving some pricing power in the market? And are there steps that you can take going forward to make that data more valuable? Oh, and then, Ken, a quick follow-up, if I could. Could you give us a sense of FX impact on EMEA revenues?"

As opposed to having 1 or 2 coherent technology platforms over our various verticals and over our various offerings, we have almost 1 system per vertical, and that's improved in recent years, but it's still, by and large, the case. And what that means is that it's actually hard to have a coherent view of a user, what they like, who they are, where they are, what they've responded to in the past, what they haven't responded to and to have that as a coherent view across all of our services. So while Yahoo! has a lot of user data, pulling together that understanding in one centralized place and having all of our different offerings access that is something that we don't have in place today and we'll need to get in place in the future. With that said, there is no question that there is tremendous potential here, and we need to improve our overall technology platforms in order to really improve how we use that user data to ultimately meet our users' needs better."
