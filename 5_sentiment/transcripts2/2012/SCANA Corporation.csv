During today’s call, we will discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full-year of 2011, and provide an update on our outlook for 2012.

During today’s call, we will discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full-year of 2011, and provide an update on our outlook for 2012. Additionally, Steve will provide an update on our nuclear project. 
Let’s start on Slide 3, which reflects SCANA’s 2011 full-year basic earnings per share of 3.01 compared to $2.99 per share in 2010. Increases in electric margin from rate increases under the Base Load Review Act, and lower operating and maintenance expenses were partially offset by lower gas margins, higher interest, property tax and depreciation expense and share dilution. 
Our results were within our 2011 guidance of 2.95 to 3.10 per share, and only $0.01 below our internal target of 3.02. The mild weather in Georgia cost us approximately $0.01 in December. 
I’ll remind you that 2010 includes $0.07 of weather prior to the implementation of electric weather normalization, resulting in weather normalized earnings of $2.92. You can reference the appendix on Slide 18 for a reconciliation from GAAP to weather normalized earnings.
Slide 4 shows the basic earnings in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $0.76 per share compared to $0.74 per share in the same quarter of 2010. While operation and maintenance expenses were lower in the current quarter, those benefits were offset by the anticipated cost of our capital program, higher interest, property tax, and depreciation expense along with related share dilution.
Now on Slide 5, I’d like to review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric and Gas Company’s full-year 2011 earnings, denoted in blue, were up $0.04 compared to 2010. Improved margins from increases under the Base Load Review Act offset the increased capital related cost.
For the fourth quarter, SCE&G earnings were $0.02 lower than the same period last year, reflecting the aforementioned increased capital related cost. PSNC Energy’s earnings for 2011, shown in red, were $0.37 per share compared to $0.36 per share in 2010.
Fourth quarter 2011 earnings were flat over the same period in 2010. Increases in customer growth along with lower operating and maintenance expenses were partially offset by higher depreciation and property tax expense.
SCANA Energy, in green, reported lower earnings for the full year 2011, due principally to milder weather. 
I’m pleased to report that SCANA Energy has again been selected to serve as the regulated provider for the state for the upcoming two-year term, covering September 2012 through August 2014. SCANA Energy has served as a regulated provider since the program’s inception in 2002.
SCANA’s corporate and other businesses reported a 2011 loss for the year of $0.01 per share and earnings for the quarter of $0.01 per share compared to losses of $0.03 and $0.02 per share respectively for 2010. The improvement is due to improved results in our communications business during 2011.
Slide 6 shows customer growth at our major subsidiaries. We experienced customer growth in our North and South Carolina regulated business, while Georgia, while the Georgia market saw a decrease in customer count over the prior year. We are pleased that our regulated businesses continue to yield organic growth. The reduction in Georgia is due to a loss of customers in our Regulated Provider program, which was partially offset by increased customer count in our deregulated sector.
Several marketers now have offerings such as a prepay service as an alternative to the regulated provider structure. Additionally, our analysis also shows that customers have been slower to connect their gas service this winter, due to the unseasonably mild temperatures. 
Our Electric and Gas sales statistics can be found in the press release we filed earlier today and are available on our website. 
On our weather normalize basis, electric residential sales are up approximately 1%. Industrial sales also saw improvement with an increase of a little more than 1%. Commercial sales continued to lag behind last year with a decrease of approximately 2% when weather normalized. 
As we’ve mentioned previously, industrial growth typically leads, followed by residential, and then commercial. So it appears that some of the industrial activity in our area over the last couple of years has translated into residential consumption, but we’ve yet to see that in the commercial sector. These results were anticipated in our 2011 plan, and we’ve forecast similar patterns in 2012.
While we continue to see customer growth, we expect that customer usage will be slightly lower in 2012 as a result of demand side management programs, new lightbulb standards that are being phased in, more energy efficient air conditioners, and general conservation.
For the year, retail sales of natural gas were lower by 1.6% because of milder weather. The residential and commercial sectors were down approximately 18% and 9% respectively, while industrial sales, which are not significantly impacted by weather increased more than 7%. 
Of course weather is contemplated in our rate mechanisms in both regulated jurisdictions, so there is no margin impact in the residential and commercial sectors. 
Fourth quarter brought more industrial announcements in our service territory. On Slide 7, you can see a update of economic expansion plans in South Carolina. During the fourth quarter alone, announced investment exceeded $500 million with the largest coming from a pharmaceutical company that will be located near our corporate campus here in Central South Carolina. These announcements during the quarter suggest the ultimate creation of over 1,900 additional jobs.
For the full year, total announced investment was over $3.2 billion and more than 7,700 expected jobs. This was the best year for industrial economic announcements in South Carolina in the last decade.
Unemployment continued to show improvement in the areas we serve. As you can see on Slide 8, we continue to see improvement at the national, state, and local level. At December 31, the unemployment rate in South Carolina was the lowest since 2008, and is now lower than that of North Carolina and Georgia, as a surge of economic development activities begin to take hold.
Our service territory of South Carolina is heavily concentrated in the Charleston and Columbia Metro areas where unemployment is lower than the national average as denoted in the green box. 
Please turn to Slide 9, which sets forth our regulated returns in South Carolina, regulatory calendar for 2012. The chart at the top shows the earned returns as of September 30, the date of our most recent filings. 
Our Electric operations earned 8.74% a slight improvement over our June filing, due to margin improvement and cost containment. This figure is exclusive of any new nuclear equip or associated rate increases as those amounts are handled separately under the Base Load Review Act and earned an 11% ROE.
As noted on the second line, we have $1.1 billion of new nuclear equip currently in rates. This amount covers spending through June 2011. Subsequent to June, we incurred incremental quip of $156 million that will be considered in our next revised rates filing later this year.
Many of you have asked if we expect to follow the base electric case in the near-term. While we have not made a decision of when we would file our next case, we typically file on a two-to-three year cycle. One of the stipulations from our last case was that we could not have another increase in base rates for 24 months, or until after the middle of 2012. 
As we have mentioned previously, our 2012 guidance does not include additional revenue from a base rate increase. We recognize the importance of earning our allowed return, and we will evaluate our position regularly.
As of September 30, our Gas Business at SCE&G was earning approximately 9.5% after annualizing the impact from the most recent $8.5 million rate increase under the Rate Stabilization Act, effective in November. 
Our North Carolina Gas Business continues to perform well and is earning it’s allowed return, principally due to the growth in the business and cost control. 
The bottom of the slide includes two time lines depicting our regulatory filings schedule for 2012. Consistent with prior years, we anticipate making our annual gas RSA filing in June, and our annual nuclear BLRA revised rate application in May.
Yesterday, we filed our most recent BLRA status report with the Commission and Office of Regulatory Staff for the fourth quarter. Steve will address the project fully in a few minutes.
Slide 10 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast assumes receipt of our COL in early 2012, and incorporates new nuclear spending as reported in our latest BLRA filing. We have also provided a preliminary estimate of additional owner’s cost related to our nuclear project which Steve will discuss. As you can see, new nuclear spending accounts for more than half of our projected CapEx over the next three years.
Please turn to Slide 11. This slide presents our estimated financing plan through 2014. In January, we completed two of our three planned debt offerings for the year. We issued $250 million in medium term notes at SCANA for a refinancing and $250 million of first mortgage bonds at SCE&G to fund CapEx. We were pleased with the market’s reception to these offerings, with substantial over subscriptions and historically low interest rates, and we remain confident in our ability to raise the funds necessary to complete construction of our nuclear project from public sources.
We expect an additional issuance of approximately $200 million at SCE&G later in the year. 
We continue to anticipate to draw the remaining funds from our equity floor during the fourth quarter of 2012. From the beginning, our strategy has been to finance our nuclear project from public sources with 50% debt and 50% equity, and nothing has changed.
I would also like to touch briefly on our pension assets. I’m pleased to report that our pension plan is adequately funded. We have not had to make a cash contribution to the plan since 1997, and do not anticipate any until at least 2013. Our plan was recognized as one of the best funded among our peers in a recent study by UBS.
Now I would like to discuss our 2012 earnings guidance and related assumptions as shown on slide 12. We reaffirm our 2012 guidance of $3.05 to $3.25 per share with an internal target of $3.17, and our long-term outlook to deliver 3 to 5% earnings growth over the three-to-five year period, based on the 2010 weather normalize base of $2.92 per share. We are pleased that our 2011 earnings per share of $3.01 were within - were in line with our guidance, and essentially at our announced target of $3.02.
I want to point out that our guidance is based on basic earnings per share. As you have probably noticed, we focus on basic earnings in our discussions with you. In May of 2011, we entered in to an equity forward contract. And to comply with accounting requirements, we present basic and diluted earnings in our financial statements. Basic earnings per share reflect the shares we’ve actually issued during the year. In contrast, diluted earnings per share include the effect of theoretical shares that would have been outstanding if we had issued the shares under the forward contracts, which we didn’t. If our stock price stays above the contract forward price, we expect similar amounts of potential dilution through the fourth quarter of 2012, when we anticipate drawing the remaining funds under the forward.
At that time, those shares will begin to affect our basic earnings, and are considered in our forecasted share price count and earnings guidance. The diluted commutation is required but is a little consequent in this particular situation as the shares were not issued and can only dilute earnings when issued.
We continue to forecast 2012 residential customer growth to be in line with 2011, while we believe average customer usage will be slightly lower as a result of continued efficiency efforts. We plan to keep O&M expenses relatively flat over 2011, with modest growth in CapEx-related cost of property taxes, depreciation, interest and share dilution.
We anticipate weather normalized earnings from our Georgia business will be in the range of $0.22 to $0.24 per share. Our effective tax rate for 2011 was 30.28% and we estimate the rate for 2012 will be approximately 31%. 
Additionally, we have included the impact of base rate increases from our new nuclear filings under the BLRA and the 2011 gas RSA filing, as well as the effects of additional cash flow from our tax strategies. These tax strategies will enable us to delay drawing the remainder of our equity forward until the fourth quarter of 2012, and should postpone a supplemental equity offering until 2013, thus minimizing the effects of dilution.
I’d now like to turn the call over to Steve, to provide a update on our nuclear project.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing proceedings continue to progress towards a successful conclusion. At the end of the third quarter, we needed a completion of three items in order for the commission to be able to approve our COL. 
The first, was completion of a mandatory hearing before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission commissioners. This was completed in October. The hearing was uncontested and we believe went well.
We also needed a 401 Water Quality permit, and this was received in December. Finally, we needed the NRC’s approval of the AP1000 certified design. As you can see in the green section of the chart, the NRC has approved the AP1000 certified design. This approval came on December 22, and the rule was published in the federal register on December 30. The rule became effective immediately upon it being published in the federal register.
At this point, there are not any remaining steps for us to take in order to receive our license. We were pleased to see the commissions recent affirmation vote to issue southern companies COL. We believe the commission will follow the same process in regards to our license. After the session, the license will be signed and we can proceed with full nuclear construction. We continue to have confidence that our license will be issued early this year. 
Please turn now to Slide 14, which gives you an overview of some of the activity that is underway at the site. Construction of the heavy lift derrick continues and the attachment of the boom and the back mass to the carriage has been completed. Our control room simulators are being installed, and welding of the containment vessel lower bowl continues to progress well. Construction of the cooling towers continues to move forward as plan; we continue to make progress on construction of the switchyard, as you can see by the picture at the bottom of the slide. The switchyard is scheduled to be energized in March of 2013, which fully supports the nuclear project schedule.
On Slide 15, you can see an aerial shot of the site from late 2011, which highlights several of the items I discussed. As Jimmy mentioned early, we filed our quarterly status report with the South Carolina Public Service Commission yesterday. This report provided an overview of our project and a discussion of project cost.
Construction work on the site is proceeding safely and efficiently. The project has met the goal of completing the work necessary to allow the first nuclear safety-related construction to commence onsite, when the COL is issued. The project has compiled a safety record that is unprecedented for a heavy construction site of its size, totalling well over 5 million safe work hours, with only two lost-time instances since construction began over three years ago.
In the quarterly BLRA filing, we also discussed additional costs that are included in our current estimates, which are described at the top of Slide 16. These cost include increased cost being passed on to SCE&G by Shawn Westinghouse, as a result of the new Federal Healthcare Laws, increased cost for cyber security regulation, incremental cost associated with the design modifications of the water discharge system, and additional forecasted transmission costs.
In addition to these cost, currently reflected in the recent BLRA filing, we anticipate an increase in perspective owner’s cost of approximately $150 million, related to accelerated hiring and training of staff, along with the cost of facilities, equipment, and information technology to support the nuclear units and associated personnel.
A portion of these cost expected in 2012 through 2014 was included as a line item on the CapEx forecast Jimmy discussed previously. It is important to note that these cost are preliminary and may change as we refine the estimates by year and cost category. 
In the coming months, we plan to make a updated cost filing with the public service commission to include these cost in our budget. 
As you might recall, this filing’s necessary due to the decision by the South Carolina Supreme Court in 2010, which found that previously-approved general contingency cost could not be included in the forecasts approved for the Basic Review Act. Instead, as the proposed use of contingency funds is identified and itemized to specific cost categories, we must file with the PSC for approval.
I would now like to talk about the COL delay study. When we signed our EPC contract in 2008, it was anticipated that the COL would be issued by the NRC in July of 2011, due primarily to delays in approval of Revision 19 to the certified design, it should now be issued early this year.
As we have previously discussed, in 2011 we asked Shaw and Westinghouse to perform a COL delay impact study, which would provide various cost and timing alternatives arising from this delay in issuance of the COL. 
The first scenario compresses the construction schedule for Unit 2, the first new unit, to retain the original commercial operation date set forth in the EPC contract. The second scenario pushes out commercial operation date for Unit 2 to account for the COL delay, while maintaining the commercial operation date for Unit 3 unchanged.
The third scenario considers delaying the commercial operation date of Unit 2, and accelerating the date for Unit 3, in order to take advantage of economies and efficiencies in the construction schedule. While negotiations are not complete, we have indicated to the consortium that we intend to pursue scenario three.
Included in negotiations of the COL delay study are all the commercial issues currently on the table.  As mentioned in our February 14 BLRA filing, the consortium has asserted the right to addition cost to recovery under the EPC contract for cost associated with design modifications to the shield building and structural modules, delay in NRC licensing and unanticipated rock conditions. We have not accepted the volatility of those claims. 
While the parties have not reached an agreement, the upper bond of our portion of the claims is estimated to be approximately $188 million, valued in 2007 dollars. These cost have not been billed to the project. We are still hopeful these claims will be resolved through negotiations. We know that you are interested in the results of our negotiations and we will certainly communicate that information to you, once it is available.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.

His vote really was based on the Fukushima lessons learned and their incorporation and he would like to see a licensed condition.  The other commissioners did not see it that way, and in reality, from my perspective, there is really very little difference whether there was a licensed condition or whether we have to comply with all of the Fukushima-related orders that the NRC will put out once we become a licensee.  So we’re going to have to comply with them anyway whether there was a licensed condition or not, I think really is not really that relevant.

Now we have a schedule for receipt of those and as is typical of startup type facilities, they're struggling a little bit with getting their quality assurance and quality control up to nuclear standards.  That is something that we're trying to help them with.  They did have one Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspection in 2011 that was suspended basically because they didn't have enough work going for the NRC to evaluate.  They've subsequently finished that inspection in November of last year.  So they're getting their act together at Shaw Modular Solutions, but as we point out in that BLRA a quarterly filing, it is an area of focus for us, and we SCE&G, are spending a lot of time at that facility.

In addition to that, we’ve got customers that are calling us now that do not operate on natural gas that are interested in getting natural gas supply in the future because of the low price compared to their current fuels.  So I just think you’re seeing that really driven off the price of natural gas, you’re just seeing much more driven off that.

During today’s call, we will discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full-year of 2011, and provide an update on our outlook for 2012. Additionally, Steve will provide an update on our nuclear project. 
Let’s start on Slide 3, which reflects SCANA’s 2011 full-year basic earnings per share of $3.01 compared to $2.99 per share in 2010. Increases in electric margin from rate increases under the Base Load Review Act, and lower operating and maintenance expenses were partially offset by lower gas margins, higher interest, property tax and depreciation expense and share dilution. 
Our results were within our 2011 guidance of$2.95 to $3.10 per share, and only $0.01 below our internal target of $3.02. The mild weather in Georgia cost us approximately $0.01 in December. 
I’ll remind you that 2010 includes $0.07 of weather prior to the implementation of electric weather normalization, resulting in weather normalized earnings of $2.92. You can reference the appendix on Slide 18 for a reconciliation from GAAP to weather normalized earnings.
Slide 4 shows the basic earnings in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $0.76 per share compared to $0.74 per share in the same quarter of 2010. While operation and maintenance expenses were lower in the current quarter, those benefits were offset by the anticipated costs of our capital program, higher interest, property tax, and depreciation expense along with related share dilution.
Now on Slide 5, I’d like to review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric and Gas Company’s full-year 2011 earnings, denoted in blue, were up $0.04 compared to 2010. Improved margins from increases under the Base Load Review Act offset the increased capital related cost.
For the fourth quarter, SCE&G’s earnings were $0.02 lower than the same period last year, reflecting the aforementioned increased capital related cost. PSNC Energy’s earnings for 2011, shown in red, were $0.37 per share compared to $0.36 per share in 2010.
Fourth quarter 2011 earnings were flat over the same period in 2010. Increases in customer growth along with lower operating and maintenance expenses were partially offset by higher depreciation and property tax expense.
SCANA Energy, in green, reported lower earnings for the full year 2011, due principally to milder weather. 
I’m pleased to report that SCANA Energy has again been selected to serve as the regulated provider for the state for the upcoming 2-year term, covering September 2012 through August 2014. SCANA Energy has served as a regulated provider since the program’s inception in 2002.
SCANA’s corporate and other businesses reported a 2011 loss for the year of $0.01 per share and earnings for the quarter of $0.01 per share compared to losses of $0.03 and $0.02 per share, respectively for 2010. The improvement is due to improved results in our communications business during 2011.
Slide 6 shows customer growth at our major subsidiaries. We experienced customer growth in our North and South Carolina regulated business, while Georgia, while the Georgia market saw a decrease in customer count over the prior year. We are pleased that our regulated businesses continue to yield organic growth. The reduction in Georgia is due to a loss of customers in our Regulated Provider program, which was partially offset by increased customer count in our deregulated sector.
Several marketers now have offerings, such as a prepay service as an alternative to the regulated provider structure. Additionally, our analysis also shows that customers have been slower to connect their gas service this winter, due to the unseasonably mild temperatures. 
Our Electric and Gas sales statistics can be found in the press release we filed earlier today and are available on our website. 
On our weather normalize basis, electric residential sales are up approximately 1%. Industrial sales also saw improvement with an increase of a little more than 1%. Commercial sales continued to lag behind last year with a decrease of approximately 2% when weather normalized. 
As we’ve mentioned previously, industrial growth typically leads, followed by residential, and then commercial. So it appears that some of the industrial activity in our area over the last couple of years has translated into residential consumption, but we’ve yet to see that in the commercial sector. These results were anticipated in our 2011 plan, and we’ve forecast similar patterns in 2012.
While we continue to see customer growth, we expect that customer usage will be slightly lower in 2012 as a result of demand side management programs, new lightbulb standards that are being phased in, more energy efficient air conditioners, and general conservation.
For the year, retail sales of natural gas were lower by 1.6% because of milder weather. The residential and commercial sectors were down approximately 18% and 9% respectively, while industrial sales, which are not significantly impacted by weather, increased more than 7%. 
Of course weather is contemplated in our rate mechanisms in both regulated jurisdictions, so there is no margin impact in the residential and commercial sectors. 
Fourth quarter brought more industrial announcements in our service territory. On Slide 7, you can see an update of economic expansion plans in South Carolina. During the fourth quarter alone, announced investment exceeded $500 million with the largest coming from a pharmaceutical company that will be located near our corporate campus here in Central South Carolina. These announcements during the quarter suggest the ultimate creation of over 1,900 additional jobs.
For the full year, total announced investment was over $3.2 billion and more than 7,700 expected jobs. This was the best year for industrial economic announcements in South Carolina in the last decade.
Unemployment continued to show improvement in the areas we serve. As you can see on Slide 8, we continue to see improvement at the national, state, and local level. At December 31, the unemployment rate in South Carolina was the lowest since 2008, and is now lower than that of North Carolina and Georgia, as a surge of economic development activities begin to take hold.
Our service territory of South Carolina is heavily concentrated in the Charleston and Columbia Metro areas where unemployment is lower than the national average as denoted in the green box. 
Please turn to Slide 9, which sets forth our regulated returns in South Carolina, regulatory calendar for 2012. The chart at the top shows the earned returns as of September 30, the date of our most recent filings. 
Our Electric operations earned 8.74%, a slight improvement over our June filing, due to margin improvement and cost containment. This figure is exclusive of any new nuclear quip or associated rate increases as those amounts are handled separately under the Base Load Review Act and earned an 11% ROE.
As noted on the second line, we have $1.1 billion of new nuclear quip currently in rates. This amount covers spending through June 2011. Subsequent to June, we incurred incremental quip of $156 million that will be considered in our next revised rates filing later this year.
Many of you have asked if we expect to follow the base electric case in the near-term. While we have not made a decision of when we would file our next case, we typically file on a 2-to-3 year cycle. One of the stipulations from our last case was that we could not have another increase in base rates for 24 months, or until after the middle of 2012. 
As we have mentioned previously, our 2012 guidance does not include additional revenue from a base rate increase. We recognize the importance of earning our allowed return, and we will evaluate our position regularly.
As of September 30, our Gas Business at SCE&G was earning approximately 9.5% after annualizing the impact from the most recent $8.5 million rate increase under the Rate Stabilization Act, effective in November. 
Our North Carolina Gas Business continues to perform well and is earning its allowed return, principally due to the growth in the business and cost control. 
The bottom of the slide includes 2 timelines depicting our regulatory filings schedule for 2012. Consistent with prior years, we anticipate making our annual gas RSA filing in June, and our annual nuclear BLRA revised rate application in May.
Yesterday, we filed our most recent BLRA status report with the Commission and Office of Regulatory Staff for the fourth quarter. Steve will address the project fully in a few minutes.
Slide 10 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast assumes receipt of our COL in early 2012, and incorporates new nuclear spending as reported in our latest BLRA filing. We have also provided a preliminary estimate of additional owner’s cost related to our nuclear project which Steve will discuss. As you can see, new nuclear spending accounts for more than half of our projected CapEx over the next 3 years.
Please turn to Slide 11. This slide presents our estimated financing plan through 2014. In January, we completed 2 of our 3 planned debt offerings for the year. We issued $250 million in medium term notes at SCANA for a refinancing and $250 million of first mortgage bonds at SCE&G to fund CapEx. We were pleased with the market’s reception to these offerings, with substantial over subscriptions and historically low interest rates, and we remain confident in our ability to raise the funds necessary to complete construction of our nuclear project from public sources.
We expect an additional issuance of approximately $200 million at SCE&G later in the year. 
We continue to anticipate drawing the remaining funds from our equity floor during the fourth quarter of 2012. From the beginning, our strategy has been to finance our nuclear project from public sources with 50% debt and 50% equity, and nothing has changed.
I would also like to touch briefly on our pension assets. I’m pleased to report that our pension plan is adequately funded. We have not had to make a cash contribution to the plan since 1997, and do not anticipate any until at least 2013. Our plan was recognized as one of the best funded among our peers in a recent study by UBS.
Now I would like to discuss our 2012 earnings guidance and related assumptions as shown on Slide 12. We reaffirm our 2012 guidance of $3.05 to $3.25 per share with an internal target of $3.17, and our long-term outlook to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the 3-to-5 year period, based on the 2010 weather normalize base of $2.92 per share. We are pleased that our 2011 earnings per share of $3.01 were within - were in line with our guidance, and essentially at our announced target of $3.02.
I want to point out that our guidance is based on basic earnings per share. As you have probably noticed, we focus on basic earnings in our discussions with you. In May of 2011, we entered into an equity forward contract. And to comply with accounting requirements, we present basic and diluted earnings in our financial statements. Basic earnings per share reflect the shares we’ve actually issued during the year. In contrast, diluted earnings per share include the effect of theoretical shares that would have been outstanding if we had issued the shares under the forward contracts, which we didn’t. If our stock price stays above the contract forward price, we expect similar amounts of potential dilution through the fourth quarter of 2012, when we anticipate drawing the remaining funds under the forward.
At that time, those shares will begin to affect our basic earnings, and are considered in our forecasted share price count and earnings guidance. The diluted computation is required but is a little consequent in this particular situation as the shares were not issued and can only dilute earnings when issued.
We continue to forecast 2012 residential customer growth to be in line with 2011, while we believe average customer usage will be slightly lower as a result of continued efficiency efforts. We plan to keep O&M expenses relatively flat over 2011, with modest growth in CapEx-related cost of property taxes, depreciation, interest and share dilution.
We anticipate weather normalized earnings from our Georgia business will be in the range of $0.22 to $0.24 per share. Our effective tax rate for 2011 was 30.28% and we estimate the rate for 2012 will be approximately 31%. 
Additionally, we have included the impact of base rate increases from our new nuclear filings under the BLRA and the 2011 gas RSA filing, as well as the effects of additional cash flow from our tax strategies. These tax strategies will enable us to delay drawing the remainder of our equity forward until the fourth quarter of 2012, and should postpone a supplemental equity offering until 2013, thus minimizing the effects of dilution.
I’d now like to turn the call over to Steve, to provide an update on our nuclear project."

So we continue a good trend of industrial announcements.  You know, I don't have specifics, couldn't disclose them if I could, but there are more in the hopper here.  So we really see good long-term platform there for restoration.  We've got a good distribution in industrial around our service territory.  The largest of any segment is chemicals, which is about a quarter of our base.  But then it's well distributed among metals, paper, rubber, plastics, et cetera.  The fourth quarter was a little down.  I'm not too concerned about that now because of all the other announcements we've had.  And as those come on, the short of it is our largest 20 or 25 customers continue to grow as a group and it has been some of the smaller industrials that have been more erratic.  And I think we're showing up there in the fourth quarter kind of year of year.  But if you think back to 2010, there was a rapid buildup in industrial sales compared to 2009 coming out of the depth of the recession.  And I think a lot of inventories were beginning to be rebuilt and now some of these smaller industrial customers are kind of finding their point of equilibrium.  And I'm not too concerned about that in the fourth quarter on the electric side.  On the gas side, you're just continuing to see a lot of folks that can convert from alternative fuels run on gas just because of the low price of natural gas compared to other petroleum products is very competitive."

To me, the kind of wild card in this, we saw this impact several years ago, I think for our industry is what happens to gasoline prices this summer.  I heard a report this morning that gasoline prices could hit an all-time high this summer.  And if they do, that’s money straight off of the discretionary income of every household.

During today’s call, we will discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full-year of 2011, and provide an update on our outlook for 2012. Additionally, Steve will provide an update on our nuclear project. 
Let’s start on Slide 3, which reflects SCANA’s 2011 full-year basic earnings per share of $3.01 compared to $2.99 per share in 2010. Increases in electric margin from rate increases under the Base Load Review Act, and lower operating and maintenance expenses were partially offset by lower gas margins, higher interest, property tax and depreciation expense and share dilution. 
Our results were within our 2011 guidance of$2.95 to $3.10 per share, and only $0.01 below our internal target of $3.02. The mild weather in Georgia cost us approximately $0.01 in December. 
I’ll remind you that 2010 includes $0.07 of weather prior to the implementation of electric weather normalization, resulting in weather normalized earnings of $2.92. You can reference the appendix on Slide 18 for a reconciliation from GAAP to weather normalized earnings.
Slide 4 shows the basic earnings in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $0.76 per share compared to $0.74 per share in the same quarter of 2010. While operation and maintenance expenses were lower in the current quarter, those benefits were offset by the anticipated costs of our capital program, higher interest, property tax, and depreciation expense along with related share dilution.
Now on Slide 5, I’d like to review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric and Gas Company’s full-year 2011 earnings, denoted in blue, were up $0.04 compared to 2010. Improved margins from increases under the Base Load Review Act offset the increased capital related cost.
For the fourth quarter, SCE&G’s earnings were $0.02 lower than the same period last year, reflecting the aforementioned increased capital related cost. PSNC Energy’s earnings for 2011, shown in red, were $0.37 per share compared to $0.36 per share in 2010.
Fourth quarter 2011 earnings were flat over the same period in 2010. Increases in customer growth along with lower operating and maintenance expenses were partially offset by higher depreciation and property tax expense.
SCANA Energy, in green, reported lower earnings for the full year 2011, due principally to milder weather. 
I’m pleased to report that SCANA Energy has again been selected to serve as the regulated provider for the state for the upcoming 2-year term, covering September 2012 through August 2014. SCANA Energy has served as a regulated provider since the program’s inception in 2002.
SCANA’s corporate and other businesses reported a 2011 loss for the year of $0.01 per share and earnings for the quarter of $0.01 per share compared to losses of $0.03 and $0.02 per share, respectively for 2010. The improvement is due to improved results in our communications business during 2011.
Slide 6 shows customer growth at our major subsidiaries. We experienced customer growth in our North and South Carolina regulated business, while Georgia, while the Georgia market saw a decrease in customer count over the prior year. We are pleased that our regulated businesses continue to yield organic growth. The reduction in Georgia is due to a loss of customers in our Regulated Provider program, which was partially offset by increased customer count in our deregulated sector.
Several marketers now have offerings, such as a prepay service as an alternative to the regulated provider structure. Additionally, our analysis also shows that customers have been slower to connect their gas service this winter, due to the unseasonably mild temperatures. 
Our Electric and Gas sales statistics can be found in the press release we filed earlier today and are available on our website. 
On our weather normalize basis, electric residential sales are up approximately 1%. Industrial sales also saw improvement with an increase of a little more than 1%. Commercial sales continued to lag behind last year with a decrease of approximately 2% when weather normalized. 
As we’ve mentioned previously, industrial growth typically leads, followed by residential, and then commercial. So it appears that some of the industrial activity in our area over the last couple of years has translated into residential consumption, but we’ve yet to see that in the commercial sector. These results were anticipated in our 2011 plan, and we’ve forecast similar patterns in 2012.
While we continue to see customer growth, we expect that customer usage will be slightly lower in 2012 as a result of demand side management programs, new light bulb standards that are being phased in, more energy efficient air conditioners, and general conservation.
For the year, retail sales of natural gas were lower by 1.6% because of milder weather. The residential and commercial sectors were down approximately 18% and 9% respectively, while industrial sales, which are not significantly impacted by weather, increased more than 7%. 
Of course weather is contemplated in our rate mechanisms in both regulated jurisdictions, so there is no margin impact in the residential and commercial sectors. 
Fourth quarter brought more industrial announcements in our service territory. On Slide 7, you can see an update of economic expansion plans in South Carolina. During the fourth quarter alone, announced investment exceeded $500 million with the largest coming from a pharmaceutical company that will be located near our corporate campus here in Central South Carolina. These announcements during the quarter suggest the ultimate creation of over 1,900 additional jobs.
For the full year, total announced investment was over $3.2 billion and more than 7,700 expected jobs. This was the best year for industrial economic announcements in South Carolina in the last decade.
Unemployment continued to show improvement in the areas we serve. As you can see on Slide 8, we continue to see improvement at the national, state, and local level. At December 31, the unemployment rate in South Carolina was the lowest since 2008, and is now lower than that of North Carolina and Georgia, as a surge of economic development activities begin to take hold.
Our service territory of South Carolina is heavily concentrated in the Charleston and Columbia Metro areas where unemployment is lower than the national average as denoted in the green box. 
Please turn to Slide 9, which sets forth our regulated returns in South Carolina, regulatory calendar for 2012. The chart at the top shows the earned returns as of September 30, the date of our most recent filings. 
Our Electric operations earned 8.74%, a slight improvement over our June filing, due to margin improvement and cost containment. This figure is exclusive of any new nuclear quip or associated rate increases as those amounts are handled separately under the Base Load Review Act and earned an 11% ROE.
As noted on the second line, we have $1.1 billion of new nuclear quip currently in rates. This amount covers spending through June 2011. Subsequent to June, we incurred incremental quip of $156 million that will be considered in our next revised rates filing later this year.
Many of you have asked if we expect to follow the base electric case in the near-term. While we have not made a decision of when we would file our next case, we typically file on a 2- to 3-year cycle. One of the stipulations from our last case was that we could not have another increase in base rates for 24 months, or until after the middle of 2012. 
As we have mentioned previously, our 2012 guidance does not include additional revenue from a base rate increase. We recognize the importance of earning our allowed return, and we will evaluate our position regularly.
As of September 30, our Gas Business at SCE&G was earning approximately 9.5% after annualizing the impact from the most recent $8.5 million rate increase under the Rate Stabilization Act, effective in November. 
Our North Carolina Gas Business continues to perform well and is earning its allowed return, principally due to the growth in the business and cost control. 
The bottom of the slide includes 2 timelines depicting our regulatory filings schedule for 2012. Consistent with prior years, we anticipate making our annual gas RSA filing in June, and our annual nuclear BLRA revised rate application in May.
Yesterday, we filed our most recent BLRA status report with the Commission and Office of Regulatory Staff for the fourth quarter. Steve will address the project fully in a few minutes.
Slide 10 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast assumes receipt of our COL in early 2012, and incorporates new nuclear spending as reported in our latest BLRA filing. We have also provided a preliminary estimate of additional owner’s cost related to our nuclear project which Steve will discuss. As you can see, new nuclear spending accounts for more than half of our projected CapEx over the next 3 years.
Please turn to Slide 11. This slide presents our estimated financing plan through 2014. In January, we completed 2 of our 3 planned debt offerings for the year. We issued $250 million in medium term notes at SCANA for a refinancing and $250 million of first mortgage bonds at SCE&G to fund CapEx. We were pleased with the market’s reception to these offerings, with substantial over subscriptions and historically low interest rates, and we remain confident in our ability to raise the funds necessary to complete construction of our nuclear project from public sources.
We expect an additional issuance of approximately $200 million at SCE&G later in the year. 
We continue to anticipate drawing the remaining funds from our equity floor during the fourth quarter of 2012. From the beginning, our strategy has been to finance our nuclear project from public sources with 50% debt and 50% equity, and nothing has changed.
I would also like to touch briefly on our pension assets. I’m pleased to report that our pension plan is adequately funded. We have not had to make a cash contribution to the plan since 1997, and do not anticipate any until at least 2013. Our plan was recognized as one of the best funded among our peers in a recent study by UBS.
Now I would like to discuss our 2012 earnings guidance and related assumptions as shown on Slide 12. We reaffirm our 2012 guidance of $3.05 to $3.25 per share with an internal target of $3.17, and our long-term outlook to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the 3-to-5 year period, based on the 2010 weather normalize base of $2.92 per share. We are pleased that our 2011 earnings per share of $3.01 were within -- were in line with our guidance, and essentially at our announced target of $3.02.
I want to point out that our guidance is based on basic earnings per share. As you have probably noticed, we focus on basic earnings in our discussions with you. In May of 2011, we entered into an equity forward contract. And to comply with accounting requirements, we present basic and diluted earnings in our financial statements. Basic earnings per share reflect the shares we’ve actually issued during the year. In contrast, diluted earnings per share include the effect of theoretical shares that would have been outstanding if we had issued the shares under the forward contracts, which we didn’t. If our stock price stays above the contract forward price, we expect similar amounts of potential dilution through the fourth quarter of 2012, when we anticipate drawing the remaining funds under the forward.
At that time, those shares will begin to affect our basic earnings, and are considered in our forecasted share price count and earnings guidance. The diluted computation is required but is a little consequent in this particular situation as the shares were not issued and can only dilute earnings when issued.
We continue to forecast 2012 residential customer growth to be in line with 2011, while we believe average customer usage will be slightly lower as a result of continued efficiency efforts. We plan to keep O&M expenses relatively flat over 2011, with modest growth in CapEx-related cost of property taxes, depreciation, interest and share dilution.
We anticipate weather normalized earnings from our Georgia business will be in the range of $0.22 to $0.24 per share. Our effective tax rate for 2011 was 30.28% and we estimate the rate for 2012 will be approximately 31%. 
Additionally, we have included the impact of base rate increases from our new nuclear filings under the BLRA and the 2011 gas RSA filing, as well as the effects of additional cash flow from our tax strategies. These tax strategies will enable us to delay drawing the remainder of our equity forward until the fourth quarter of 2012, and should postpone a supplemental equity offering until 2013, thus minimizing the effects of dilution.
I’d now like to turn the call over to Steve, to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I would now like to direct your attention to Slide 13. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing proceedings continue to progress towards a successful conclusion. At the end of the third quarter, we needed a completion of 3 items in order",1088,"Thanks, Jimmy. I would now like to direct your attention to Slide 13. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing proceedings continue to progress towards a successful conclusion. At the end of the third quarter, we needed a completion of 3 items in order for the commission to be able to approve our COL. 
The first, was completion of a mandatory hearing before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission commissioners. This was completed in October. The hearing was uncontested and we believe went well.
We also needed a 401 Water Quality permit, and this was received in December. Finally, we needed the NRC’s approval of the AP1000 certified design. As you can see in the green section of the chart, the NRC has approved the AP1000 certified design. This approval came on December 22, and the rule was published in the federal register on December 30. The rule became effective immediately upon it being published in the federal register.
At this point, there are not any remaining steps for us to take in order to receive our license. We were pleased to see the commission’s recent affirmation vote to issue southern companies COL. We believe the commission will follow the same process in regards to our license. After that session, the license will be signed and we can proceed with full nuclear construction. We continue to have confidence that our license will be issued early this year. 
Please turn now to Slide 14, which gives you an overview of some of the activity that is underway at the site. Construction of the heavy lift derrick continues and the attachment of the boom and the back mass to the carriage has been completed. Our control room simulators are being installed, and welding of the containment vessel lower bowl continues to progress well. Construction of the cooling towers continues to move forward as planned; we continue to make progress on construction of the switchyard, as you can see by the picture at the bottom of the slide. The switchyard is scheduled to be energized in March of 2013, which fully supports the nuclear project schedule.
On Slide 15, you can see an aerial shot of the site from late 2011, which highlights several of the items I discussed. As Jimmy mentioned earlier, we filed our quarterly status report with the South Carolina Public Service Commission yesterday. This report provided an overview of our project and a discussion of project costs.
Construction work on the site is proceeding safely and efficiently. The project has met the goal of completing the work necessary to allow the first nuclear safety-related construction to commence onsite, when the COL is issued. The project has compiled a safety record that is unprecedented for a heavy construction site of its size, totaling well over 5 million safe work hours, with only 2 lost-time instances since construction began over 3 years ago.
In the quarterly BLRA filing, we also discussed additional costs that are included in our current estimates, which are described at the top of Slide 16. These costs include increased cost being passed on to SCE&G by Shawn Westinghouse, as a result of the new Federal Healthcare Laws, increased cost for cyber security regulation, incremental cost associated with the design modifications of the water discharge system, and additional forecasted transmission costs.
In addition to these costs, currently reflected in the recent BLRA filing, we anticipate an increase in perspective owner’s costs of approximately $150 million, related to accelerated hiring and training of staff, along with the costs of facilities, equipment, and information technology to support the nuclear units and associated personnel.
A portion of these cost expected in 2012 through 2014 was included as a line item on the CapEx forecast Jimmy discussed previously. It is important to note that these costs are preliminary and may change as we refine the estimates by year and cost category. 
In the coming months, we plan to make an updated cost filing with the public service commission to include these costs in our budget. 
As you might recall, this filing’s necessary due to the decision by the South Carolina Supreme Court in 2010, which found that previously-approved general contingency costs could not be included in the forecasts approved for the Basic Review Act. Instead, as the proposed use of contingency funds is identified and itemized to specific cost categories, we must file with the PSC for approval.
I would now like to talk about the COL delay study. When we signed our EPC contract in 2008, it was anticipated that the COL would be issued by the NRC in July of 2011, due primarily to delays in approval of Revision 19 to the certified design, it should now be issued early this year.
As we have previously discussed, in 2011 we asked Shaw and Westinghouse to perform a COL delay impact study, which would provide various cost and timing alternatives arising from this delay in issuance of the COL. 
The first scenario compresses the construction schedule for Unit 2, the first new unit, to retain the original commercial operation date set forth in the EPC contract. The second scenario pushes out commercial operation date for Unit 2 to account for the COL delay, while maintaining the commercial operation date for Unit 3 unchanged.
The third scenario considers delaying the commercial operation date of Unit 2, and accelerating the date for Unit 3, in order to take advantage of economies and efficiencies in the construction schedule. While negotiations are not complete, we have indicated to the consortium that we intend to pursue scenario 3.
Included in negotiations of the COL delay study are all the commercial issues currently on the table. As mentioned in our February 14 BLRA filing, the consortium has asserted the right to additional cost recovery under the EPC contract for costs associated with design modifications to the shield building and structural modules, delay in NRC licensing and unanticipated rot conditions. We have not accepted the validity of those claims. 
While the parties have not reached an agreement, the upper bond of our portion of the claims is estimated to be approximately $188 million, valued in 2007 dollars. These costs have not been billed to the project. We are still hopeful these claims will be resolved through negotiations. We know that you are interested in the results of our negotiations and we will certainly communicate that information to you, once it is available.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

We're going to keep them informed of where we are. We're going to be considerate of the timing of increases under the Base Load Review Act. We're going to be considerate of items surrounding our potential fuel hearing and adjustments like that. So we're really going to try to do anything we can to keep from really pancaking those increases in rates. And so that's a lot of what goes into the strategy. And we'd like to get a little more feel for what's coming, how the recovery is economically and how much of a potential margin need, that 200 basis points we're looking at there, how much that might be filled from growth in customers and expansion of the economy as opposed to having to raise the rates on the customers to provide it.

To me, the kind of wild card in this, we saw this impact several years ago, I think for our industry is what happens to gasoline prices this summer. I heard a report this morning that gasoline prices could hit an all-time high this summer. And if they do, that’s money straight off of the discretionary income of every household.

We believe 2012 will be an exciting year, as we anticipate receiving the COL and we look forward to further economic recovery in our service territory. And we thank you for your interest in SCANA."

As shown on slide three, basic earnings per share were $0.93 for the first quarter of 2012 versus $1 in 2011. Increases in electric margin from rate increases under the Base Load Review Act were more than offset by lower gas margins in Georgia due to significantly milder weather, higher operating and maintenance expenses and the costs of our capital program, interest expense, depreciation, and share dilution.
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this winter was one of the warmest in over 100 years. Our gas margins in Georgia were impacted by $0.06 due to milder than normal weather and an additional $0.02 compared to the colder than normal quarter in 2011 for $0.08 total. Additionally, although the electric WNA mechanism largely mitigates the impact of weather on electric margins, certain weather-sensitive load is not subject to the mechanism, churches and schools as an examples. So, there can be some earnings impact during extreme weather periods such as this quarter. As a result, SCE&G's electric margin was negatively impacted by $0.01 of abnormal weather this quarter. As an aside, it would have been down $0.14 without the WNA mechanism.
Now, on slide four, I would like to review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's 2012 first quarter earnings per share denoted in blue were flat compared to the first quarter of 2011. Electric margin was $0.07 higher due to increases under the Base Load Review Act, net of the $0.01 weather decline. This increase in margin was offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses, interest expense and depreciation, as well as share dilution. Total weather-normalized electric sales to residential and commercial customers were relatively flat over the first quarter.
Industrial sales were down approximately 2% due to reduced production at one of our largest customers as a result of a fire. We understand this customer's production will likely be limited for the majority of the year. PSNC Energy's earnings for the first quarter of 2012 shown in red were $0.24 per share compared to $0.25 per share in 2011. Increases in customer growth were slightly more than offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses and share dilution.
SCANA Energy in green reported lower earnings for the first quarter of 2012 due to the aforementioned milder weather. In the first quarter of 2011, weather increased SCANA Energy's margins by $0.02. However, the extremely mild weather in the first quarter of 2012 resulted in an $0.08 swing in margins.
Next, I would like to touch on economic trends in our service area as shown on slide five. We continue to see business growth and expansion. In the first quarter, companies announced plans to invest $124 million with expectations of creating over 200 jobs in our South Carolina territory. Our gas businesses in North Carolina also saw a promising quarter of economic announcements with companies projecting investment of $194 million and over 2,900 jobs. These announcements covered a variety of industries such as plastics, metals, and food and beverage. As I have mentioned previously, 2011 was an excellent year in terms of economic announcements and we are pleased that this trend appears to be continuing. Another measure - container volume at the Port of Charleston also continues to improve.
Volume during March of this year was the highest since October 2008. First quarter of 2012 volume was 7% higher than the first quarter of 2011. We continue to be encouraged by the trend in unemployment rates particularly in the areas we serve as all three states along with the national rate decreased in December - since December. Our service territory in South Carolina is heavily concentrated in the Charleston and Columbia metro area where the average rate has fallen to 7.3%, 90 basis points below the national average.
This recent industrial expansion has obviously translated into jobs. The chart in the bottom left of the slide shows customer growth at our major subsidiaries. We continue to experience customer growth in all of our regulated businesses while our Georgia market saw slight decrease in customer count over the prior year likely due to the mild weather. We are pleased that all of our regulated businesses continue to yield organic growth.
Please turn to slide six which set forth our regulated rate base, returns, and South Carolina regulatory calendar. The data on the slide represents information as of December 31, 2011, the date of our most recent regulatory filings. As you can see in the pie chart on the left side, our regulated rate base of $7.1 billion is composed largely of SCE&G Electric with closed to $6 billion in total electric investment denoted in blue. The chart to the right shows our actual and allowed regulatory returns for the period.
Our earned return at the electric business continues to lag behind our lab return despite our cost containment efforts, although, it improved slightly over the last two quarters. Many of you have asked about the potential base rate electric filing to address this deficit. While we have not made any final decisions we are considering filing a Notice of Intent later this month to initiated the regulatory process timeline. We are requiring to file the notice at least 30 days prior to the filing of a case.
Again the decision around the timing and amount of this filing is not yet named. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina continue to earn steady returns as you can see from the chart. Of course, the South Carolina gas business will adjust under the RSA mechanism if it falls more than 50 basis points below the allowed return. The bottom of the slide includes the two timelines depicting our regulatory filing schedule for 2012, which we shared with you previously.
Since our last earnings call, we've completed our electric fuel cost preview and we expect to file our integrated resource plan at the end of May. Later this month, we will file the quarterly status report and annual revised rates request related to the new nuclear project. In addition to these regular BLRA filings, we will be withdrawing our petition to update costs and schedules dated February 29. Simultaneously, we will be filing a new petition updating costs and schedules we previously filed as well as updating the filing for the impact of the issuance of our sea well and to incorporate the $138 million resulting from our preliminary agreement with Shaw and Westinghouse, which Steve will discuss in a few minutes. This will align all of our known nuclear costs in one petition. All of these nuclear filings will be made available on the Investor Relations section of our website.
Slide seven presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reported in our latest BLRA filing in February, which included amounts as of the fourth quarter of 2011 along with the additional cost we disclosed in February. This slide does not include the additional amounts related to our negotiations with Shaw and Westinghouse, which Steve will discuss in more detail. It also does not include any revisions to the schedule from the shifts and timing of the planned dates the plants will come online. The consortium is updating the forecast now and we expect to present the updated data in our BLRA filing later this month and in our Analyst Day on June 5.
Please turn to slide eight, this slide presents our estimated financing plan through 2014 and has not changed since our last earnings call. We continue to anticipate an additional debt issuance later in the year and expect to draw the remaining funds from our equity forward in fourth quarter of 2012.
Please turn to slide nine, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $3.05 to $3.25 per share. Our long-term outlook is unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the three to five-year period based on the 2010 weather normalized base of $2.92 per share. We have adjusted our expectation of earnings from our Georgia business to consider the impact of weather during this quarter. Additionally, we've considered with our guidance the impact of base rate increases from our new nuclear filings under the BLRA and gas RSA adjustment. Our effective tax rate for 2011 was just over 30% and we estimate the rate for 2012, will be approximately 31%.
I will now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.

I'd now like to direct your attention to slide 10. We are pleased as Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued the combined construction and operating licenses for our two new nuclear units bringing the licensing proceedings at the NRC to conclusion. We have given the consortium of full notice to proceed and are moving forward with nuclear safety-related construction.
As you can see on slide 11, we have been making significant progress at the site even prior to the issuance of our COL and this picture is from February of 2012. Switchyard shown at the bottom of the slide continues toward completion and is scheduled to be energized in the first half of 2013. Foundations for the cooling towers are progressing as planned, welding of the containment vessel lower bowl continues, the Unit 2 excavation sites for both the nuclear island and the turbine island are ready for concrete to be poured. In the center of the picture, you can see the heavy lift derrick. This derrick has a 560 foot long boom and rotates 360 degrees on rails.
It will be used to lift assembled modules and other heavy components and place them in the excavation sites of both units. Since this photo was taken and after the receipt of our COL, we have begun pouring concrete in the excavation for Unit 2. Over the next few months, we will complete placing leveling concrete, install the waterproof membrane, pour the mud map and lift and set the nuclear island rebar cage.
Rebar cage was made in several sections with lifting process installed to allow fabrication before the COL issuance. After that, we will pour the nuclear island base map, which will be approximately six-feet thick. At this point, we'll be ready to set module CR10 on the base map. CR10 is a steel frame support used to hold the lower though above the base map until the foundation concrete is completed.
Once that concrete is complete, we will set the lower containment bowl. Please turn now to slide 12. As we announced at the end of March, we have signed a preliminary agreement with Shaw and Westinghouse related to challenged cost for the construction of our new nuclear units. As you might recall, these costs related to four items. The first was on unanticipated raw conditions.
During the excavation for Unit 2 an unanticipated crevice was discovered. This will be filled in with additional concrete. The second challenged cost related to a delay in receipt of the COL. When we signed our EPC contracts in 2008, it was anticipated that the COL would be issued by the NRC in July of 2011. Due primarily to delays in approval of Rev 19 to the certified design and became evident that the COL would not be issued until early 2012.
In anticipation of this, we asked Shaw and Westinghouse to perform a COL delay impact study, which provided various cost and timing alternatives arising from this delay in issuance of the COL. After reviewing the results of their study, we opted to delay the commercial operation date of Unit 2 to 2017 and accelerate the date for Unit 3 to 2018 in order to take advantage of economies and efficiencies in the construction schedule and thereby mitigate some of the cost of the initial COL delay.
Originally, the commercial operation dates were scheduled for 2016 and 2019. The other two channels cost related to design modifications, to the shield building and structural modules. On our last earnings call, we communicated that we believe the upper bound of SCE&Gs portion of the cost would be approximately $188 million valued in 2007 dollars. After negotiations, we agreed to an amount of $138 million.
As Jimmy mentioned previously, these amounts will be reflected in the cost schedules presented in our upcoming filing with the South Carolina Public Service Commission and discuss in detail at our Analyst Day in early June. We will also continue to provide updates on the progress of construction at the site to our quarterly mining reports with the commission.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond any questions you might have.

I think our keys to achieving that are to continue our aggressive cost control that we’ve had in place now for several years. We see the possibility of a small rate stabilization increase this fall, that’s not final yet, but that looks like there is some possibility of that, that would impact SCE&G gas business.
You might remember our original assumptions we didn’t have anything in the plan for that. It looks like we may be able to likely differ the first mortgage bond financing that we have - we had scheduled for in the middle or so, the second quarter. We may be able to push that out a few more months just because of the original delay from the NRC. We also had planned to do the original issuance that we did in January, a little earlier in the month, that occurred later in the month. And also the rates on those various financings that we had in our plan are higher than we realized in January and higher than we project now on the one later this year. So, those are some of the keys to how we think will make up what we realized there as a loss in the first quarter in the weather margins.

Well, we still remain firmly committed to managing the O&M for the year to a level that's similar to 2011, some of the timing of expenses they have to occur when the operations obviously drive them. In Q1 of this year, couple of examples like you've asked for, we had a combustion inspection at one of our combined cycle gas units that was not in the comparable quarter from the year before, so that occurred in Q1. We are running those plants a great deal now. So, you've got to do the inspections. That's not something that occurs each quarter. So, that's more cyclical, if you will.
We have moved - changing gears on you moved into healthcare plans, high deductible plans. We have encouraged employees to consider those. Last year, 2011 was the first year. We had about 20% of the employees to adopt the plan last year voluntarily, I was one of those. This year, about 50% have adopted it. As part of that transition, we, the corporation puts seed money into their HSA accounts to help encourage them to move to this to carry the cash flow in the early part of the plan. So, we obviously funded all of the seed money upfront.
Later, as we move through the year, we think we will see that level out. So, healthcare was up about $0.01 per share. And then, you may remember last year, I commented that due to two items, one, us lowering our long-term earnings guidance to 3% to 5%, and two, Fukushima, our stock took quite a hit in the early part of the year. And as a result, we were substantially below several of our equity based incentive comp plans. So, the stock has performance much better this year, so there's about a $0.01 due to that. So, some of those things are kind of our timing type matters that we don't expect are really linear throughout the year. We are comfortable with saying we're going to manage hard to get towards a flat O&M year-over-year.

It looks like early announce looks like residential was down close to 3%, but that's just one quarter and it just doesn't make a lot of sense to try to analyze it on a long-term basis.
Year-over-year 2011 compared to '10 it was up slightly over 1% for residential. So, we still see good industrial growth on the system. We see good unemployment numbers coming down fairly significantly with our electric territory falling well below the national unemployment rate, almost one full percent. So, we think the long-term trend is good, but trying to look at these usage rates on a quarterly basis is pretty difficult, draw any conclusions.

But I would say, to answer your question, within historical test year, when we implement the rates in the base electric business now this is not new nuclear, that’s as you understand a different mechanism. But on the base electric business, once you implemented, you’re probably going to be 50 basis points behind the allowed return. And then now, you see from the slide in the presentation here, we’re a couple of hundred, a little less than a couple of hundred basis points under that allowed return. So, you’re generally starting off a little lower than that allowed return, 50 basis points or so, and I think that some of the consideration that the commission allows in setting the ROEs is they understand with this historical test year. And with the six month, seven month with the notice period minimum process, I mean there is going to be some attrition, if you will.

As shown on Slide 3, basic earnings per share were $0.93 for the first quarter of 2012 versus $1 in 2011. Increases in electric margin from rate increases under the Base Load Review Act were more than offset by lower gas margins in Georgia due to significantly milder weather, higher operating and maintenance expenses and the costs of our capital program, interest expense, depreciation, and share dilution.
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this winter was one of the warmest in over 100 years. Our gas margins in Georgia were impacted by $0.06 due to milder than normal weather and an additional $0.02 compared to the colder than normal quarter in 2011 for $0.08 total. Additionally, although the electric WNA mechanism largely mitigates the impact of weather on electric margins, certain weather-sensitive load is not subject to the mechanism, churches and schools as an examples. So, there can be some earnings impact during extreme weather periods such as this quarter. As a result, SCE&G's electric margin was negatively impacted by $0.01 of abnormal weather this quarter. As an aside, it would have been down $0.14 without the WNA mechanism.
Now, on Slide 4, I would like to review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's 2012 first quarter earnings per share denoted in blue were flat compared to the first quarter of 2011. Electric margin was $0.07 higher due to increases under the Base Load Review Act, net of the $0.01 weather decline. This increase in margin was offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses, interest expense and depreciation, as well as share dilution. Total weather-normalized electric sales to residential and commercial customers were relatively flat over the first quarter.
Industrial sales were down approximately 2% due to reduced production at one of our largest customers as a result of a fire. We understand this customer's production will likely be limited for the majority of the year. PSNC Energy's earnings for the first quarter of 2012 shown in red were $0.24 per share compared to $0.25 per share in 2011. Increases in customer growth were slightly more than offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses and share dilution.
SCANA Energy in green reported lower earnings for the first quarter of 2012 due to the aforementioned milder weather. In the first quarter of 2011, weather increased SCANA Energy's margins by $0.02. However, the extremely mild weather in the first quarter of 2012 resulted in an $0.08 swing in margins.
Next, I would like to touch on economic trends in our service area as shown on Slide 5. We continue to see business growth and expansion. In the first quarter, companies announced plans to invest $124 million with expectations of creating over 200 jobs in our South Carolina territory. Our gas businesses in North Carolina also saw a promising quarter of economic announcements with companies projecting investment of $194 million and over 2,900 jobs. These announcements covered a variety of industries such as plastics, metals, and food and beverage. As I have mentioned previously, 2011 was an excellent year in terms of economic announcements and we are pleased that this trend appears to be continuing. Another measure -- container volume at the Port of Charleston also continues to improve.
Volume during March of this year was the highest since October 2008. First quarter of 2012 volume was 7% higher than the first quarter of 2011. We continue to be encouraged by the trend in unemployment rates particularly in the areas we serve as all 3 states along with the national rate decreased in December -- since December. Our service territory in South Carolina is heavily concentrated in the Charleston and Columbia metro areas where the average rate has fallen to 7.3%, 90 basis points below the national average.
This recent industrial expansion has obviously translated into jobs. The chart in the bottom left of the slide shows customer growth at our major subsidiaries. We continue to experience customer growth in all of our regulated businesses while our Georgia market saw slight decrease in customer count over the prior year likely due to the mild weather. We are pleased that all of our regulated businesses continue to yield organic growth.
Please turn to Slide 6 which sets forth our regulated rate base, returns, and South Carolina regulatory calendar. The data on the slide represents information as of December 31, 2011, the date of our most recent regulatory filings. As you can see in the pie chart on the left side, our regulated rate base of $7.1 billion is composed largely of SCE&G Electric with close to $6 billion in total electric investment denoted in blue. The chart to the right shows our actual and allowed regulatory returns for the period.
Our earned return at the electric business continues to lag behind our allowed return despite our cost containment efforts, although, it has improved slightly over the last 2 quarters. Many of you have asked about the potential base rate electric filing to address this deficit. While we have not made any final decisions we are considering filing a Notice of Intent later this month to initiate the regulatory process timeline. We are requiring to file the notice at least 30 days prior to the filing of a case.
Again the decision around the timing and amount of this filing is not yet known. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina continue to earn steady returns as you can see from the chart. Of course, the South Carolina gas business will adjust under the RSA mechanism if it falls more than 50 basis points below the allowed return. The bottom of the slide includes the 2 timelines depicting our regulatory filing schedule for 2012, which we shared with you previously.
Since our last earnings call, we've completed our electric fuel cost preview and we expect to file our integrated resource plan at the end of May. Later this month, we will file the quarterly status report and annual revised rates request related to the new nuclear project. In addition to these regular BLRA filings, we will be withdrawing our petition to update costs and schedules dated February 29. Simultaneously, we will be filing a new petition updating costs and schedules we previously filed as well as updating the filing for the impact of the issuance of our sea well and to incorporate the $138 million resulting from our preliminary agreement with Shaw and Westinghouse, which Steve will discuss in a few minutes. This will align all of our known nuclear costs in one petition. All of these nuclear filings will be made available on the Investor Relations section of our website.
Slide 7 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reported in our latest BLRA filing in February, which included amounts as of the fourth quarter of 2011 along with the additional cost we disclosed in February. This slide does not include the additional amounts related to our negotiations with Shaw and Westinghouse, which Steve will discuss in more detail. It also does not include any revisions to the schedule from the shifts and timing of the planned dates the plants will come online. The consortium is updating the forecast now and we expect to present the updated data in our BLRA filing later this month and in our Analyst Day on June 5.
Please turn to Slide 8, this slide presents our estimated financing plan through 2014 and has not changed since our last earnings call. We continue to anticipate an additional debt issuance later in the year and expect to draw the remaining funds from our equity forward in fourth quarter of 2012.
Please turn to Slide 9, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $3.05 to $3.25 per share. Our long-term outlook is unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the 3 to five-year period based on the 2010 weather normalized base of $2.92 per share. We have adjusted our expectation of earnings from our Georgia business to consider the impact of weather during this quarter. Additionally, we've considered with our guidance the impact of base rate increases from our new nuclear filings under the BLRA and gas RSA adjustment. Our effective tax rate for 2011 was just over 30% and we estimate the rate for 2012, will be approximately 31%.
I will now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I'd now like to direct your attention to Slide 10. We are pleased as Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued the combined construction and operating licenses for our 2 new nuclear units bringing the licensing proceedings at the NRC to conclusion. We have given the consortium full notice to proceed and are moving forward with nuclear safety-related construction.
As you can see on Slide 11, we have been making significant progress at the site even prior to the issuance of our COL and this picture is from February of 2012. Switchyard shown at the bottom of the slide continues toward completion and is scheduled to be energized in the first half of 2013. Foundations for the cooling towers are progressing as planned, welding of the containment vessel lower bowl continues, the Unit 2 excavation sites for both the nuclear island and the turbine island are ready for concrete to be poured. In the center of the picture, you can see the heavy lift derrick. This derrick has a 560 foot long boom and rotates 360 degrees on rails.
It will be used to lift assembled modules and other heavy components and place them in the excavation sites of both units. Since this photo was taken and after the receipt of our COL, we have begun pouring concrete in the excavation for Unit 2. Over the next few months, we will complete placing leveling concrete, install the waterproof membrane, pour the mud mat and lift and set the nuclear island rebar cage.
Rebar cage was made in several sections with lifting trusses installed to allow fabrication before the COL issuance. After that, we will pour the nuclear island base mat, which will be approximately six-feet thick. At this point, we'll be ready to set module CR10 on the base mat. CR10 is a steel frame support used to hold the lower bowl above the base mat until the foundation concrete is completed.
Once that concrete is complete, we will set the lower containment bowl. Please turn now to Slide 12. As we announced at the end of March, we have signed a preliminary agreement with Shaw and Westinghouse related to challenged cost for the construction of our new nuclear units. As you might recall, these costs related to 4 items. The first was on unanticipated rot conditions.
During the excavation for Unit 2 an unanticipated crevice was discovered. This will be filled in with additional concrete. The second challenged cost related to a delay in receipt of the COL. When we signed our EPC contracts in 2008, it was anticipated that the COL would be issued by the NRC in July of 2011. Due primarily to delays in approval of Rev 19 to the certified design it became evident that the COL would not be issued until early 2012.
In anticipation of this, we asked Shaw and Westinghouse to perform a COL delay impact study, which provided various cost and timing alternatives arising from this delay in issuance of the COL. After reviewing the results of their study, we opted to delay the commercial operation date of Unit 2 to 2017 and accelerate the date for Unit 3 to 2018 in order to take advantage of economies and efficiencies in the construction schedule and thereby mitigate some of the cost of the initial COL delay.
Originally, the commercial operation dates were scheduled for 2016 and 2019. The other 2 channels cost related to design modifications, to the shield building and structural modules. On our last earnings call, we communicated that we believe the upper bound of SCE&Gs portion of the cost would be approximately $188 million valued in 2007 dollars. After negotiations, we agreed to an amount of $138 million.
As Jimmy mentioned previously, these amounts will be reflected in the cost schedules presented in our upcoming filing with the South Carolina Public Service Commission and discussed in detail at our Analyst Day in early June. We will also continue to provide updates on the progress of construction at the site to our quarterly mining reports with the commission.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond any questions you might have."

I think our keys to achieving that are to continue our aggressive cost control that we’ve had in place now for several years. We see the possibility of a small rate stabilization increase this fall, that’s not final yet, but that looks like there is some possibility of that, that would impact SCE&G gas business. You might remember our original assumptions we didn’t have anything in the plan for that. It looks like we may be able to likely defer the first mortgage bond financing that we have -- we had scheduled for in the middle or so, the second quarter. We may be able to push that out a few more months just because of the original delay from the NRC. We also had planned to do the original issuance that we did in January, a little earlier in the month, that occurred later in the month. And also the rates on those various financings that we had in our plan are higher than we realized in January and higher than we project now on the one later this year. So, those are some of the keys to how we think will make up what we realized there as a loss in the first quarter in the weather margins."

In Q1 of this year, couple of examples like you've asked for, we had a combustion inspection at one of our combined cycle gas units that was not in the comparable quarter from the year before, so that occurred in Q1. We are running those plants a great deal now. So, you've got to do the inspections. That's not something that occurs each quarter. So, that's more cyclical, if you will. We have moved -- changing gears on you, moved into healthcare plans, high deductible plans. We have encouraged employees to consider those. Last year, 2011 was the first year. We had about 20% of the employees to adopt the plan last year voluntarily, I was one of those. This year, about 50% have adopted it. As part of that transition, we, the corporation puts seed money into their HSA accounts to help encourage them to move to this to carry the cash flow in the early part of the plan. So, we obviously funded all of the seed money upfront. Later, as we move through the year, we think we will see that level out. So, healthcare was up about $0.01 per share. And then, you may remember last year, I commented that due to 2 items, one, us lowering our long-term earnings guidance to 3% to 5%, and 2, Fukushima, our stock took quite a hit in the early part of the year. And as a result, we were substantially below several of our equity based incentive comp plans. So, the stock has performance much better this year, so there's about a $0.01 due to that. So, some of those things are kind of our timing type matters that we don't expect are really linear throughout the year.

My short answer to it is just choppy and I've commented on that last year that we've seen a couple of good quarters but that doesn't trend make this year in the first quarter commercial was up close to 3%. It looks like early announce looks like residential was down close to 3%, but that's just one quarter and it just doesn't make a lot of sense to try to analyze it on a long-term basis. Year-over-year 2011 compared to '10 it was up slightly over 1% for residential. So, we still see good industrial growth on the system. We see good unemployment numbers coming down fairly significantly with our electric territory falling well below the national unemployment rate, almost one full percent. So, we think the long-term trend is good, but trying to look at these usage rates on a quarterly basis is pretty difficult, draw any conclusions."

It's not an installation issue within, with no problem with the installation. The issue came out with the design certification document identified specifications for how the rebar cage would be constructed. During our constructability reviews the constructor said this is going to be difficult and went back to the designer and said could we do it a different way. The designer looked at it and said yes those drawings were amended and went to the field. So, within the field was constructed in accordance with the drawings. However, the drawings were not as the original design certification drawing was. And you have options with changing some of the designs, but it's what the DCD would call a Tier 1 or Tier 2 star kind of a detail. You need to get pre-approval to make those kinds of changes and the position of the vendor was, this was a Tier 2 issue, which means that they could have made those changes, the position of the regulators was, no, it's a Tier 2 star issues, so you need to get pre-approval, and that's where the rub comes in. That slight differences between the Vogel project and our project, that Vogel got a limited work authorization, so they actually are ahead of us on the work in the excavation. So, they were at the point where they had poured all their preliminary concrete, if you will, down concrete to leveling that, the mud mat, vapor barrier, and they were installing the rebar cage. In our situation, we are just starting on that dental concrete in the Unit 2 excavation and we're moving on to the leveling concrete, and we're building the rebar cage outside of the excavation in order to sayvesome time. And then, we've our intention was to lift the rebar cage with the big derrick, so we've installed lifting lugs in ours. So, we're doing it outside, they were doing it inside the excavation. So, we don't actually need that rebar cage until we're finished with all of that preliminary concrete work, which is going to be a couple of months yet.

But I would say, to answer your question, within historical test year, when we implement the rates in the base electric business now this is not new nuclear, that’s as you understand a different mechanism. But on the base electric business, once you implemented, you’re probably going to be 50 basis points behind the allowed return. And then now, you see from the Slide in the presentation here, we’re a couple of hundred, a little less than a couple of hundred basis points under that allowed return. So, you’re generally starting off a little lower than that allowed return, 50 basis points or so, and I think that some of the consideration that the commission allows in setting the ROEs is they understand with this historical test year.

As shown on Slide 3, basic earnings per share were $0.93 for the first quarter of 2012 versus $1 in 2011. Increases in electric margin from rate increases under the Base Load Review Act were more than offset by lower gas margins in Georgia due to significantly milder weather, higher operating and maintenance expenses and the costs of our capital program, interest expense, depreciation, and share dilution.
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this winter was one of the warmest in over 100 years. Our gas margins in Georgia were impacted by $0.06 due to milder than normal weather and an additional $0.02 compared to the colder than normal quarter in 2011 for $0.08 total. Additionally, although the electric WNA mechanism largely mitigates the impact of weather on electric margins, certain weather-sensitive load is not subject to the mechanism, churches and schools as an examples. So, there can be some earnings impact during extreme weather periods such as this quarter. As a result, SCE&G's electric margin was negatively impacted by $0.01 of abnormal weather this quarter. As an aside, it would have been down $0.14 without the WNA mechanism.
Now, on Slide 4, I would like to review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's 2012 first quarter earnings per share denoted in blue were flat compared to the first quarter of 2011. Electric margin was $0.07 higher due to increases under the Base Load Review Act, net of the $0.01 weather decline. This increase in margin was offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses, interest expense and depreciation, as well as share dilution. Total weather-normalized electric sales to residential and commercial customers were relatively flat over the first quarter.
Industrial sales were down approximately 2% due to reduced production at one of our largest customers as a result of a fire. We understand this customer's production will likely be limited for the majority of the year. PSNC Energy's earnings for the first quarter of 2012 shown in red were $0.24 per share compared to $0.25 per share in 2011. Increases in customer growth were slightly more than offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses and share dilution.
SCANA Energy in green reported lower earnings for the first quarter of 2012 due to the aforementioned milder weather. In the first quarter of 2011, weather increased SCANA Energy's margins by $0.02. However, the extremely mild weather in the first quarter of 2012 resulted in an $0.08 swing in margins.
Next, I would like to touch on economic trends in our service area as shown on Slide 5. We continue to see business growth and expansion. In the first quarter, companies announced plans to invest $124 million with expectations of creating over 200 jobs in our South Carolina territory. Our gas businesses in North Carolina also saw a promising quarter of economic announcements with companies projecting investment of $194 million and over 2,900 jobs. These announcements covered a variety of industries such as plastics, metals, and food and beverage. As I have mentioned previously, 2011 was an excellent year in terms of economic announcements and we are pleased that this trend appears to be continuing. Another measure -- container volume at the Port of Charleston also continues to improve.
Volume during March of this year was the highest since October 2008. First quarter of 2012 volume was 7% higher than the first quarter of 2011. We continue to be encouraged by the trend in unemployment rates particularly in the areas we serve as all 3 states along with the national rate decreased in December -- since December. Our service territory in South Carolina is heavily concentrated in the Charleston and Columbia metro areas where the average rate has fallen to 7.3%, 90 basis points below the national average.
This recent industrial expansion has obviously translated into jobs. The chart in the bottom left of the slide shows customer growth at our major subsidiaries. We continue to experience customer growth in all of our regulated businesses while our Georgia market saw slight decrease in customer count over the prior year likely due to the mild weather. We are pleased that all of our regulated businesses continue to yield organic growth.
Please turn to Slide 6 which sets forth our regulated rate base, returns, and South Carolina regulatory calendar. The data on the slide represents information as of December 31, 2011, the date of our most recent regulatory filings. As you can see in the pie chart on the left side, our regulated rate base of $7.1 billion is composed largely of SCE&G Electric with close to $6 billion in total electric investment denoted in blue. The chart to the right shows our actual and allowed regulatory returns for the period.
Our earned return at the electric business continues to lag behind our allowed return despite our cost containment efforts, although, it has improved slightly over the last 2 quarters. Many of you have asked about the potential base rate electric filing to address this deficit. While we have not made any final decisions we are considering filing a Notice of Intent later this month to initiate the regulatory process timeline. We are requiring to file the notice at least 30 days prior to the filing of a case.
Again the decision around the timing and amount of this filing is not yet known. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina continue to earn steady returns as you can see from the chart. Of course, the South Carolina gas business will adjust under the RSA mechanism if it falls more than 50 basis points below the allowed return. The bottom of the slide includes the 2 timelines depicting our regulatory filing schedule for 2012, which we shared with you previously.
Since our last earnings call, we've completed our electric fuel cost preview and we expect to file our integrated resource plan at the end of May. Later this month, we will file the quarterly status report and annual revised rates request related to the new nuclear project. In addition to these regular BLRA filings, we will be withdrawing our petition to update costs and schedules dated February 29. Simultaneously, we will be filing a new petition updating costs and schedules we previously filed as well as updating the filing for the impact of the issuance of our sea well and to incorporate the $138 million resulting from our preliminary agreement with Shaw and Westinghouse, which Steve will discuss in a few minutes. This will align all of our known nuclear costs in one petition. All of these nuclear filings will be made available on the Investor Relations section of our website.
Slide 7 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reported in our latest BLRA filing in February, which included amounts as of the fourth quarter of 2011 along with the additional cost we disclosed in February. This slide does not include the additional amounts related to our negotiations with Shaw and Westinghouse, which Steve will discuss in more detail. It also does not include any revisions to the schedule from the shifts and timing of the planned dates the plants will come online. The consortium is updating the forecast now and we expect to present the updated data in our BLRA filing later this month and in our Analyst Day on June 5.
Please turn to Slide 8, this slide presents our estimated financing plan through 2014 and has not changed since our last earnings call. We continue to anticipate an additional debt issuance later in the year and expect to draw the remaining funds from our equity forward in fourth quarter of 2012.
Please turn to Slide 9, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $3.05 to $3.25 per share. Our long-term outlook is unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the 3 to five-year period based on the 2010 weather normalized base of $2.92 per share. We have adjusted our expectation of earnings from our Georgia business to consider the impact of weather during this quarter. Additionally, we've considered with our guidance the impact of base rate increases from our new nuclear filings under the BLRA and gas RSA adjustment. Our effective tax rate for 2011 was just over 30% and we estimate the rate for 2012, will be approximately 31%.
I will now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I'd now like to direct your attention to Slide 10. We are pleased as Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued the combined construction and operating licenses for our 2 new nuclear units bringing the licensing proceedings at the NRC to conclusion. We have given the consortium full notice to proceed and are moving forward with nuclear safety-related construction.
As you can see on Slide 11, we have been making significant progress at the site even prior to the issuance of our COL and this picture is from February of 2012. Switchyard shown at the bottom of the slide continues toward completion and is scheduled to be energized in the first half of 2013. Foundations for the cooling towers are progressing as planned, welding of the containment vessel lower bowl continues, the Unit 2 excavation sites for both the nuclear island and the turbine island are ready for concrete to be poured. In the center of the picture, you can see the heavy lift derrick. This derrick has a 560 foot long boom and rotates 360 degrees on rails.
It will be used to lift assembled modules and other heavy components and place them in the excavation sites of both units. Since this photo was taken and after the receipt of our COL, we have begun pouring concrete in the excavation for Unit 2. Over the next few months, we will complete placing leveling concrete, install the waterproof membrane, pour the mud mat and lift and set the nuclear island rebar cage.
Rebar cage was made in several sections with lifting trusses installed to allow fabrication before the COL issuance. After that, we will pour the nuclear island base mat, which will be approximately six-feet thick. At this point, we'll be ready to set module CR10 on the base mat. CR10 is a steel frame support used to hold the lower bowl above the base mat until the foundation concrete is completed.
Once that concrete is complete, we will set the lower containment bowl. Please turn now to Slide 12. As we announced at the end of March, we have signed a preliminary agreement with Shaw and Westinghouse related to challenged cost for the construction of our new nuclear units. As you might recall, these costs related to 4 items. The first was on unanticipated rot conditions.
During the excavation for Unit 2 an unanticipated crevice was discovered. This will be filled in with additional concrete. The second challenged cost related to a delay in receipt of the COL. When we signed our EPC contracts in 2008, it was anticipated that the COL would be issued by the NRC in July of 2011. Due primarily to delays in approval of Rev 19 to the certified design it became evident that the COL would not be issued until early 2012.
In anticipation of this, we asked Shaw and Westinghouse to perform a COL delay impact study, which provided various cost and timing alternatives arising from this delay in issuance of the COL. After reviewing the results of their study, we opted to delay the commercial operation date of Unit 2 to 2017 and accelerate the date for Unit 3 to 2018 in order to take advantage of economies and efficiencies in the construction schedule and thereby mitigate some of the cost of the initial COL delay.
Originally, the commercial operation dates were scheduled for 2016 and 2019. The other 2 channels cost related to design modifications, to the shield building and structural modules. On our last earnings call, we communicated that we believe the upper bound of SCE&Gs portion of the cost would be approximately $188 million valued in 2007 dollars. After negotiations, we agreed to an amount of $138 million.
As Jimmy mentioned previously, these amounts will be reflected in the cost schedules presented in our upcoming filing with the South Carolina Public Service Commission and discussed in detail at our Analyst Day in early June. We will also continue to provide updates on the progress of construction at the site to our quarterly mining reports with the commission.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond any questions you might have."

I think our keys to achieving that are to continue our aggressive cost control that we’ve had in place now for several years. We see the possibility of a small rate stabilization increase this fall, that’s not final yet, but that looks like there is some possibility of that, that would impact SCE&G gas business. You might remember our original assumptions we didn’t have anything in the plan for that. It looks like we may be able to likely defer the first mortgage bond financing that we have -- we had scheduled for in the middle or so, the second quarter. We may be able to push that out a few more months just because of the original delay from the NRC. We also had planned to do the original issuance that we did in January, a little earlier in the month, that occurred later in the month. And also the rates on those various financings that we had in our plan are higher than we realized in January and higher than we project now on the one later this year. So, those are some of the keys to how we think will make up what we realized there as a loss in the first quarter in the weather margins."

Well, we still remain firmly committed to managing the O&M for the year to a level that's similar to 2011, some of the timing of expenses they have to occur when the operations obviously drive them. In Q1 of this year, couple of examples like you've asked for, we had a combustion inspection at one of our combined cycle gas units that was not in the comparable quarter from the year before, so that occurred in Q1. We are running those plants a great deal now. So, you've got to do the inspections. That's not something that occurs each quarter. So, that's more cyclical, if you will. We have moved -- changing gears on you, moved into healthcare plans, high deductible plans. We have encouraged employees to consider those. Last year, 2011 was the first year. We had about 20% of the employees to adopt the plan last year voluntarily, I was one of those. This year, about 50% have adopted it. As part of that transition, we, the corporation puts seed money into their HSA accounts to help encourage them to move to this to carry the cash flow in the early part of the plan. So, we obviously funded all of the seed money upfront. Later, as we move through the year, we think we will see that level out. So, healthcare was up about $0.01 per share. And then, you may remember last year, I commented that due to 2 items, one, us lowering our long-term earnings guidance to 3% to 5%, and 2, Fukushima, our stock took quite a hit in the early part of the year. And as a result, we were substantially below several of our equity based incentive comp plans. So, the stock has performance much better this year, so there's about a $0.01 due to that. So, some of those things are kind of our timing type matters that we don't expect are really linear throughout the year. We are comfortable with saying we're going to manage hard to get towards a flat O&M year-over-year."

Year-over-year 2011 compared to '10 it was up slightly over 1% for residential. So, we still see good industrial growth on the system.

However, the drawings were not as the original design certification drawing was. And you have options with changing some of the designs, but it's what the DCD would call a Tier 1 or Tier 2 star kind of a detail. You need to get pre-approval to make those kinds of changes and the position of the vendor was, this was a Tier 2 issue, which means that they could have made those changes, the position of the regulators was, no, it's a Tier 2 star issues, so you need to get pre-approval, and that's where the rub comes in.

I think many of you guys understandably start from the top and look at our earned return and back into that way. We build it a different way. But I would say, to answer your question, within historical test year, when we implement the rates in the base electric business now this is not new nuclear, that’s as you understand a different mechanism. But on the base electric business, once you implemented, you’re probably going to be 50 basis points behind the allowed return. And then now, you see from the Slide in the presentation here, we’re a couple of hundred, a little less than a couple of hundred basis points under that allowed return. So, you’re generally starting off a little lower than that allowed return, 50 basis points or so, and I think that some of the consideration that the commission allows in setting the ROEs is they understand with this historical test year. And with the six month, seven month with the notice period minimum process, I mean there is going to be some attrition, if you will.
So, we don’t really start on in that way and say, what’s the estimated allowed return. We look at the plant rate base CapEx, etcetera, and build it from bottom-up."

So anyone that can take gas industrially is so there is some certainly driven by $2 or so of gas but not a huge amount."

As shown on Slide 3, basic earnings per share were $0.55 for the second quarter of 2012 versus $0.44 in 2011. Higher electric margin from increased consumption and rate increases under the Base Load Review Act was partially offset by the cost of our capital program, interest expense, depreciation, property taxes and share dilution.
Gas margins were also higher due to the rate increase under the Rate Stabilization Act. Operating and maintenance expenses grew slightly over the second quarter of 2011, largely due to the timing of plant expenses, healthcare cost and incentive compensation.
Please turn to Slide 4. As you can see, basic earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2012 were $1.48 versus $1.44 in 2011. Increases in electric margin were partially offset by lower gas margins in Georgia, due to the mild weather in the first quarter along with higher operating and maintenance expenses and higher expenses related to our capital program, specifically depreciation, property taxes, interest and share dilution.
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to review results for our principal lines of business. Healthcare, and electric and gas companies 2012 second quarter basic earnings per share denoted in blue, were $0.59, an increase of $0.11 over the second quarter of 2011. Electric margin was higher due primarily to increases under the Base Load Review Act.
Additionally, we experienced increased non-weather related consumption during the quarter. This increase in margin was offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses, interest expense and depreciation as well as share dilution. Year-to-date basic earnings were higher by $0.11 due primarily to higher electric margin.
PSNC energy shown in red, reported flat earnings per share for the second quarter of 2012 versus the seasonal loss of $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2011, increases in margin due to customer growth contributed to the improvement. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, basic earnings were $0.24 per share in line with the prior year.
SCANA energy in green reported the seasonal loss of $0.02 per share for the second quarter of 2012, consistent with last year. Year-to-date earnings are down $0.08 due to the impact of mild winter weather in the first quarter.
Our corporate and other businesses reported their loss for the quarter of $0.02 per share compared to a loss of $0.01 per share in 2011. For the six-month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $0.04 compared to $0.03 in the same period last year.
Next, I'd like to touch on economic trends in our service area, as shown on Slide 6. We continue to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. In the second quarter, company's announced plans to invest $289 million with expectations of creating over 350 jobs in our South Carolina territory.
Our gas businesses in North Carolina also saw a promising quarter of economic announcements, with companies projecting investment of $325 million and over 1,400 jobs. We are pleased that this year is shaping out to be another solid year in terms of economic development in our territories.
On the heels of these major economic announcements, unemployment rates remain stable. Major businesses such as Boeing and Amazon that have located in our territory hiring employees quickly, and we're pleased to see these recent industrial expansions translating into jobs.
We're also pleased with two recent developments related to the project to deepen the Port of Charleston. The Army Corps of Engineers originally anticipated the project would take up to eight years to complete. But a year into the project, they have announced it could finish in five years.
In addition, President Obama chose the Charleston Harbor deepening project as one of seven priority infrastructure projects nationwide. This project will enable larger cargo ships to enter the harbor and is expected to faster economic growth. This is key once the Panama Canal is deepened in 2014.
For the 12-month period ended June 30, 2012, total weather normalized electric sales to residential customer were up approximately 0.6%. Our commercial sales were relatively flat. Industrial sales were down 1.4%, primarily due to reduced production at one of our largest customers as a result of the fire, we discussed last quarter.
We understand this customer's production will likely be limited for the majority of the year. Were this customer's operations consistent with 2011, we estimate industrial sales would have increased approximately 3%.
As you can see on Slide 7, we continue to see improvement in customer growth at our major regulated subsidiaries. For the last three quarters, customer growth has trended higher in our electric businesses as well as our regulating gas businesses in South and North Carolina. For June, those rates were 0.8%, 1.5% and 1.9% respectively. We're encouraged by this trend.
Please turn to Slide 8, which sort our regulated rate base, returns in South Carolina regulatory calendar. The data on this slide represents information as of the date of our most recent regulatory filings.
The pie chart on the upper left represents the components of regulated rate base of $7.1 billion. This is composed largely of SCE&G electric with close to $6 billion in total electric investment, as denoted in blue.
The chart to the right shows our actual and allowed regulatory returns for the period. Our regulated gas business in North Carolina continues to earn a steady return due to customer growth in their territory and stable margins under the customer utilization tracker.
Return on our regularly gas business in South Carolina dropped slightly after the winter season. In June, we requested an increase of $8.8 million under the Annual Rate Stabilization Act adjustment. This increase would bring the earned ROE for that business more closely in line with the allowed return of 10.25%.
As you are aware, we recently found an application for our rate increase for our retail electric business, which I will discuss more fully on the next slide. That application reflected an earned return of 7.26%. This reflects the full pro forma return considering all known and measurable adjustments as required when the case is filed.
Accordingly, it is lower than our actual return to reflect annualized costs, which aren't fully incorporated yet in the financials. For example, in the case, we propose an adjustment to annualized depreciation expense. As we've begun depreciating property at various points of the year, our test year must be adjusted to capture a full year depreciation expense for those items.
The bottom of the slide includes the two timelines depicting our regulatory filing schedule for 2012. As you can see in the first timeline we've completed all but one of our planned regulatory filings outside of the new nuclear project. In November, we will undergo the annual review of our gas, fuel cost and SCE&G.
The second timeline provides you with scheduled planned filings related to the new nuclear project. In May, we filed our quarterly status report and annual revised rates request related to the project. The Regulatory Staff has audited our request for revised rates and we expect an order from the commission around the end of September.
When we make our filing for revised rates, we do so on May 30. But the period under review requires us to project our construction expenditures through the end of June. So we have a portion of the filing that is actually a forecast.
When ORS does their audit, they look at actual expenditures and the actual capital structure at June 30. Generally that true-up result in a minor adjustment to our request to reflect the actual cost. ORS submitted their report this week and recommended a final revenue increase of approximately $52 million.
In addition to these regular BLRA filings, we filed a petition to update our nuclear budget and schedule, which Steve will discuss in a few minutes. We will file our next quarterly status report in mid-August.
Please now turn to Slide 9. On June 29, we filed an application with the South Carolina PSC requesting an increase in our retail electric rates. In this application, we requested an allowed ROE of 10.95% and additional revenue of $151.5 million. A significant portion of this increase is simply an extension of the previous rate case.
Out of this additional revenue, we anticipate approximately $50 million would impact net income as the balance offsets new cost that will also be reflected in the financials. For example, in the last case we agreed not to include in rates. Operating expenses is associated with the scrubber at Wateree station, as it was not yet in service. Instead, those costs were deferred. A portion of this case seeks recovery of that deferral prospectively.
Additionally, we deferred increase pension cost related to the decline in market value of the related assets after the financial crises. The remainder of the increase will offset expenses such as depreciation and property taxes.
In our application, we asked that the new rates become effective on January 1, 2013. A hearing is scheduled for November, and we anticipate receiving an order from the commission by the end of December.
Slide 10, presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast is identical to the one we shared with you at our June Analyst Day events and reflects new nuclear spending, as reported in our latest BLRA filing in May.
Please turn to Slide 11. We have successfully completed all of our planned debt financings for 2012. The remainder of this slide presents our estimated financing plan through 2017, and has not changed since our Analyst Day event. We continue to anticipate drawing the remaining funds from our equity forward during the first quarter of 2013.
Now, please turn to Slide 12. We are affirming our earnings guidance of $3.05 to $3.25 per share. The long-term outlook is unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the three to five year period, based on the 2010 weather normalized base of $2.92 per share.
Our guidance encompasses the impact of whether on our Georgia operations during the first quarter, the impact of higher operating and maintenance expenses, and base rate increases for our new nuclear filings under the BLRA and Gas RSA adjustments. Our effective tax rate for 2011 was just over 30%, and we estimate the rate for 2012 will be approximately 31%.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.

We are pleased that our construction continues to move forward on our nuclear project. The schedule continues to support commercial operation dates of March of 2017 for Unit 2 and May of 2018 for Unit 3.
We have made progress on several areas during the past quarter. We continue to pour concrete in the Unit 2 excavation site. Making progress on the switchyard and cooling towers. The heavy lift derrick has been assembled, tested and is ready for use. Large component manufacture is progressing at sites around the world. And Slide 14 shows two of those components at a facility in South Korea.
Parts continue to arrive at the Port Charleston, before being transported to the site. We have made extensive progress on the turbine island for Unit 2, the first new unit, as you can see it on Slide number 15.
You can also see a portion of the heavy lift derrick, which is the blue arm across the top of the picture. The derrick is located between the excavation sites for the two new units. This will allow it to be used to lift assembled modules and other heavy components, and place them in the excavation site for either unit.
Circulating water pipe is in place, as shown in the center of the page. Slide also shows the containment vessel lower bowl. Chicago Bridge & Iron has completed welding of the lower bowl, and is now welding the first ring section for that containment vessel, which is shown on Slide number 16.
Slide 17, shows 230,000 volt transmission lines being connected to the switchyard, which is nearing completion. The construction is on scheduled to allow the switchyard to be energized in the first half of 2013. This will allow us to back feed the project with power from the grid.
A final hearing for signing of transmission lines related to the new nuclear project will be held on August 22. We were fortunate to be able to use existing rights-of-way for the vast majority of transmission lines from the new units.
Please turn now to Slide 18, which shows the nuclear island for Unit 2. Over the last few months, we have poured dental and leveling concrete using our on-site concrete batch plants. This process has done well even while incurring record high temperatures. We had anticipated the challenge of high temperatures and we're able to ship to schedules to allow the pours to be done in the evening, when temperatures are not as extreme.
We have also begun installation of the waterproof membrane in the nuclear island. After that is complete, more high-strength concrete called mud mat is poured prior to installing the nuclear island rebar cage. As of yesterday, we installed the waterproof membrane and mud mat for about 75% of the nuclear island and placed about 40% of the rebar cage.
I know many of you have been interested on our rebar cage. I will let you know that we are constructing our rebar cage to conform to the applicable concrete code and design certification document requirements. And do not anticipate any additional delays to the rebar cage.
Once the rebar cage is fully in place, we'll pour the six-foot thick nuclear island base mat and then set module CR10 on the base mat. The CR10 module is currently being fabricated on site, so that it will be ready when needed.
CR10 is a steel-frame support used to hold the lower bowl above the base mat until the foundation concrete is completed. We anticipate setting the lower containment bowl later this year. In summary, the construction is progressing well and on track to achieve the amended completion dates.
Please turn now to Slide 19. As you may remember, in May we filed an application with the South Carolina Public Service Commission seeking to update our budget and schedule. A new schedule sets the substantial completion dates for the units at March of 2017 and May of 2018.
The updated costs totaled $283 million and were primarily the result of delays in receipt of our license and agreement with Shawn Westinghouse related to challenge cost for the construction of our new nuclear units, and additional owners cost or non-EPC costs for which we were responsible, such as staffing, information technology and facilities.
The hearing on our updated cost filing will be held in September. We anticipate receiving an order from the commission on these items in mid-November.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.

First of all, we've taken a fairly unusual step of offering a field decrease simultaneous with this rate increase that would offset roughly a third or more of the cost of it to the customer. So we're trying to create a situation where we earn a reasonable return for investors to continue to attract the capital that we need to continue the development of the nuclear, while at the same time appreciating the condition of customers and trying to keep their bill down.
After that reduction you've got an overall average increase of 3.5%, 3.75%, and that's after two years. So that's pretty close to the rate of inflation we experienced over the last couple of years. And having said that, we're very aware that we continue to have the increases under the Base Load Review Act for the nuclear development and we have worked very hard to mitigate this increase and will work very hard to stay away as long as we can in the future.

And that's why we offered this additional chart on Page 7 in the slides to show the kind of consistent trend over the last three quarters in customer growth. So I am encouraged by this, it's just been so erratic over the last couple of years and it has continued even into the first six months.
To be more specific, out of the six months this year, three months sales have increased on a weather normal basis and three months they've been slightly lower. Now, net overall the increases have been larger, but there has just been some variability and that is just too early to say there is a real definitive linear trend.
One thing that we have noticed lately though is that, go back to a year ago and our overall growth rate in the electric business was about 0.5%. And the growth in commercial customers was less than half of that, which wouldn't surprise you in the recession.
The industrials led the way out, residentials have started to follow behind. And I have commented for a few quarters now that the commercials have lagged. So they were about half the growth of residential. But if you look at the same numbers today, where our overall growth rate is about 0.8% on Page 7, the commercials are well in excess of that over 1%. So that's a really interesting sign.
Now, you'll notice in our overall commercial sales were relatively flat to last year. So the analysis of that I'd take is that, all the commercial customers are being very frugal in this difficult economy. But more coming online and I'm encouraged by that, continue to be encouragement by the industrial announcements we've focused on over the past year. But I really liked it, the middle market starting to come back some.

And I have mentioned those in my comments a few minutes ago, but just to expand upon it a little bit. We had some small increase in planned expenses at some of the generating plants.
Healthcare has trended up. We've been very effective the last four or five years through the end of 2011, in holding healthcare cost much lower than national averages, but we've seen a bump this year. We're hopeful that that's going to moderate for the balance of the year based upon some of the very recent data.
And then finally, the main driver is really more of, last year was lower than a normal period would have been. And let me explain that, and that's really driven by coming out of Fukushima issue last year and thus lowering our long-term earnings guidance from 4% to 6% to 3% to 5%. Our stock took quite a hit. And as a result, all of our incentive comp plans that are equity based, we didn't hit any of those targets.
So those two actions I just described happened in or near the end of the Q1, and all of that impact was in those plans by the end of Q2. So we were hitting none of those targets and accruing none of that cost related to those benefit plans.
On the contrary, this year you're well aware our stocks performed very well compared to the peers, and we're getting some of that bounce back effect. So last year we were accruing none of that cost. This year we're slightly above our 100% targets, because of the bounce back. So it's kind of going in opposite directions.

First, the 7.26 is not our actual earned return, as I have attempted to really give some examples in my prepared comments earlier.
7.26 is the pro forma return at the end of the test year. So what we've done at the end of the test year is take all known and measurable cost that are there at the end of the year. For example, if we began depreciating a large piece of equipment in the twelfth month, we only have one-twelfth of the cost in that test year, so when the pro forma at end we will include the other 11 months, and that will drop the return down.

As shown on Slide 3, basic earnings per share were $0.55 for the second quarter of 2012 versus $0.44 in 2011. Higher electric margin from increased consumption and rate increases under the Base Load Review Act was partially offset by the cost of our capital program, interest expense, depreciation, property taxes and share dilution.
Gas margins were also higher due to the rate increase under the Rate Stabilization Act. Operating and maintenance expenses grew slightly over the second quarter of 2011, largely due to the timing of plant expenses, healthcare cost and incentive compensation.
Please turn to Slide 4. As you can see, basic earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2012 were $1.48 versus $1.44 in 2011. Increases in electric margin were partially offset by lower gas margins in Georgia, due to the mild weather in the first quarter along with higher operating and maintenance expenses and higher expenses related to our capital program, specifically depreciation, property taxes, interest and share dilution.
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to review results for our principal lines of business. Health care, and electric and gas companies 2012 second quarter basic earnings per share denoted in blue, were $0.59, an increase of $0.11 over the second quarter of 2011. Electric margin was higher due primarily to increases under the Base Load Review Act.
Additionally, we experienced increased non-weather related consumption during the quarter. This increase in margin was offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses, interest expense and depreciation as well as share dilution. Year-to-date basic earnings were higher by $0.11 due primarily to higher electric margin.
PSNC energy shown in red, reported flat earnings per share for the second quarter of 2012 versus the seasonal loss of $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2011, increases in margin due to customer growth contributed to the improvement. For the 6-month period ended June 30, 2012, basic earnings were $0.24 per share in line with the prior year.
SCANA energy in green reported the seasonal loss of $0.02 per share for the second quarter of 2012, consistent with last year. Year-to-date earnings are down $0.08 due to the impact of mild winter weather in the first quarter.
Our corporate and other businesses reported their loss for the quarter of $0.02 per share compared to a loss of $0.01 per share in 2011. For the 6-month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $0.04 compared to $0.03 in the same period last year.
Next, I'd like to touch on economic trends in our service area, as shown on Slide 6. We continue to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. In the second quarter, company's announced plans to invest $289 million with expectations of creating over 350 jobs in our South Carolina territory.
Our gas businesses in North Carolina also saw a promising quarter of economic announcements, with companies projecting an investment of $325 million and over 1,400 jobs. We are pleased that this year is shaping out to be another solid year in terms of economic development in our territories.
On the heels of these major economic announcements, unemployment rates remain stable. Major businesses such as Boeing and Amazon that have located in our territory are hiring employees quickly, and we're pleased to see these recent industrial expansions translating into jobs.
We're also pleased with 2 recent developments related to the project to deepen the Port of Charleston. The Army Corps of Engineers originally anticipated the project would take up to 8 years to complete. But a year into the project, they have announced it could finish in 5 years.
In addition, President Obama chose the Charleston Harbor deepening project as one of 7 priority infrastructure projects nationwide. This project will enable larger cargo ships to enter the harbor and is expected to faster economic growth. This is key once the Panama Canal is deepened in 2014.
For the 12-month period ended June 30, 2012, total weather normalized electric sales to residential customer were up approximately 0.6%. Our commercial sales were relatively flat. Industrial sales were down 1.4%, primarily due to reduced production at one of our largest customers as a result of the fire, we discussed last quarter.
We understand this customer's production will likely be limited for the majority of the year. Were this customer's operations consistent with 2011, we estimate industrial sales would have increased approximately 3%.
As you can see on Slide 7, we continue to see improvement in customer growth at our major regulated subsidiaries. For the last 3 quarters, customer growth has trended higher in our electric businesses as well as our regulating gas businesses in South and North Carolina. For June, those rates were 0.8%, 1.5% and 1.9% respectively. We're encouraged by this trend.
Please turn to Slide 8, which sort our regulated rate base, returns in South Carolina regulatory calendar. The data on this slide represents information as of the date of our most recent regulatory filings.
The pie chart on the upper left represents the components of regulated rate base of $7.1 billion. This is composed largely of SCE&G electric with close to $6 billion in total electric investment, as denoted in blue.
The chart to the right shows our actual and allowed regulatory returns for the period. Our regulated gas business in North Carolina continues to earn a steady return due to customer growth in their territory and stable margins under the customer utilization tracker.
Return on our regularly gas business in South Carolina dropped slightly after the winter season. In June, we requested an increase of $8.8 million under the Annual Rate Stabilization Act adjustment. This increase would bring the earned ROE for that business more closely in line with the allowed return of 10.25%.
As you are aware, we recently found an application for our rate increase for our retail electric business, which I will discuss more fully on the next slide. That application reflected an earned return of 7.26%. This reflects the full pro forma return considering all known and measurable adjustments as required when the case is filed.
Accordingly, it is lower than our actual return to reflect annualized costs, which aren't fully incorporated yet in the financials. For example, in the case, we propose an adjustment to annualized depreciation expense. As we've begun depreciating property at various points of the year, our test year must be adjusted to capture a full year depreciation expense for those items.
The bottom of the slide includes the 2 timelines depicting our regulatory filing schedule for 2012. As you can see in the first timeline we've completed all but one of our planned regulatory filings outside of the new nuclear project. In November, we will undergo the annual review of our gas, fuel cost at SCE&G.
The second timeline provides you with scheduled planned filings related to the new nuclear project. In May, we filed a quarterly status report and annual revised rates request related to the project. The Office of Regulatory Staff has audited our request for revised rates and we expect an order from the commission around the end of September.
When we make our filing for revised rates, we do so on May 30. But the period under review requires us to project our construction expenditures through the end of June. So we have a portion of the filing that is actually a forecast.
When ORS does their audit, they look at actual expenditures and the actual capital structure at June 30. Generally that true-up result in a minor adjustment to our request to reflect the actual cost. ORS submitted their report this week and recommended a final revenue increase of approximately $52 million.
In addition to these regular BLRA filings, we filed a petition to update our nuclear budget and schedule, which Steve will discuss in a few minutes. We will file our next quarterly status report in mid-August.
Please now turn to Slide 9. On June 29, we filed an application with the South Carolina PSC requesting an increase in our retail electric rates. In this application, we requested an allowed ROE of 10.95% and additional revenue of $151.5 million. A significant portion of this increase is simply an extension of the previous rate case.
Out of this additional revenue, we anticipate approximately $50 million would impact net income as the balance offsets new cost that will also be reflected in the financials. For example, in the last case we agreed not to include in rates. Operating expenses is associated with the scrubber at Wateree station, as it was not yet in service. Instead, those costs were deferred. A portion of this case seeks recovery of that deferral prospectively.
Additionally, we deferred increase pension cost related to the decline in market value of the related assets after the financial crises. The remainder of the increase will offset expenses such as depreciation and property taxes.
In our application, we asked that the new rates become effective on January 1, 2013. A hearing is scheduled for November, and we anticipate receiving an order from the commission by the end of December.
Slide 10, presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast is identical to the one we shared with you at our June Analyst Day events and reflects new nuclear spending, as reported in our latest BLRA filing in May.
Please turn to Slide 11. We have successfully completed all of our planned debt financings for 2012. The remainder of this slide presents our estimated financing plan through 2017, and has not changed since our Analyst Day event. We continue to anticipate drawing the remaining funds from our equity forward during the first quarter of 2013.
Now, please turn to Slide 12. We are affirming our earnings guidance of $3.05 to $3.25 per share. The long-term outlook is unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the 3- to 5-year period, based on the 2010 weather normalized base of $2.92 per share.
Our guidance encompasses the impact of whether on our Georgia operations during the first quarter, the impact of higher operating and maintenance expenses, and base rate increases for our new nuclear filings under the BLRA and Gas RSA adjustments. Our effective tax rate for 2011 was just over 30%, and we estimate the rate for 2012 will be approximately 31%.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

We have made progress on several areas during the past quarter. We continue to pour concrete in the Unit 2 excavation site. Making progress on the switchyard and cooling towers. The heavy lift derrick has been assembled, tested and is ready for use. Large component manufacture is progressing at sites around the world. And Slide 14 shows 2 of those components at a facility in South Korea.
Parts continue to arrive at the Port Charleston, before being transported to the site. We have made extensive progress on the turbine island for Unit 2, the first new unit, as you can see it on Slide number 15.
You can also see a portion of the heavy lift derrick, which is the blue arm across the top of the picture. The derrick is located between the excavation sites for the 2 new units. This will allow it to be used to lift assembled modules and other heavy components, and place them in the excavation site for either unit.
Circulating water pipe is in place, as shown in the center of the page. Slide also shows the containment vessel lower bowl. Chicago Bridge & Iron has completed welding of the lower bowl, and is now welding the first ring section for that containment vessel, which is shown on Slide 16.
Slide 17, shows 230,000 volt transmission lines being connected to the switchyard, which is nearing completion. The construction is on scheduled to allow the switchyard to be energized in the first half of 2013. This will allow us to back feed the project with power from the grid.
A final hearing for signing of transmission lines related to the new nuclear project will be held on August 22. We were fortunate to be able to use existing rights-of-way for the vast majority of transmission lines from the new units.
Please turn now to Slide 18, which shows the nuclear island for Unit 2. Over the last few months, we have poured dental and leveling concrete using our on-site concrete batch plants. This process has done well even while incurring record high temperatures. We had anticipated the challenge of high temperatures and we're able to ship to schedules to allow the pours to be done in the evening, when temperatures are not as extreme.
We have also begun installation of the waterproof membrane in the nuclear island. After that is complete, more high-strength concrete called mud mat is poured prior to installing the nuclear island rebar cage. As of yesterday, we installed the waterproof membrane and mud mat for about 75% of the nuclear island and placed about 40% of the rebar cage.
I know many of you have been interested in our rebar cage. I will let you know that we are constructing our rebar cage to conform to the applicable concrete code and design certification document requirements. And do not anticipate any additional delays to the rebar cage.
Once the rebar cage is fully in place, we'll pour the 6-foot thick nuclear island base mat and then set module CR10 on the base mat. The CR10 module is currently being fabricated on site, so that it will be ready when needed.
CR10 is a steel-frame support used to hold the lower bowl above the base mat until the foundation concrete is completed. We anticipate setting the lower containment bowl later this year. In summary, the construction is progressing well and on track to achieve the amended completion dates.
Please turn now to Slide 19. As you may remember, in May we filed an application with the South Carolina Public Service Commission seeking to update our budget and schedule. A new schedule sets the substantial completion dates for the units at March of 2017 and May of 2018.
The updated costs totaled $283 million and were primarily the result of delays in receipt of our license and agreement with Shawn Westinghouse related to challenge cost for the construction of our new nuclear units, and additional owners cost or non-EPC costs for which we were responsible, such as staffing, information technology and facilities.
The hearing on our updated cost filing will be held in September. We anticipate receiving an order from the commission on these items in mid-November.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

And that's why we offered this additional chart on Page 7 in the slides to show the kind of consistent trend over the last 3 quarters in customer growth. So I am encouraged by this, it's just been so erratic over the last couple of years and it has continued even into the first six months.
To be more specific, out of the 6 months this year, 3 months sales have increased on a weather normal basis and 3 months they've been slightly lower. Now, net overall the increases have been larger, but there has just been some variability and that is just too early to say there is a real definitive linear trend.
One thing that we have noticed lately though is that, go back to a year ago and our overall growth rate in the electric business was about 0.5%. And the growth in commercial customers was less than half of that, which wouldn't surprise you in the recession.
The industrials led the way out, residentials have started to follow behind. And I have commented for a few quarters now that the commercials have lagged. So they were about 1/2 the growth of residential. But if you look at the same numbers today, where our overall growth rate is about 0.8% on Page 7, the commercials are well in excess of that over 1%. So that's a really interesting sign.
Now, you'll notice in our overall commercial sales were relatively flat to last year. So the analysis of that I'd take is that, all the commercial customers are being very frugal in this difficult economy. But more coming online and I'm encouraged by that, continue to be encouragement by the industrial announcements we've focused on over the past year.

Healthcare has trended up. We've been very effective the last four or five years through the end of 2011, in holding healthcare cost much lower than national averages, but we've seen a bump this year. We're hopeful that that's going to moderate for the balance of the year based upon some of the very recent data.
And then finally, the main driver is really more of, last year was lower than a normal period would have been. And let me explain that, and that's really driven by coming out of Fukushima issue last year and thus lowering our long-term earnings guidance from 4% to 6% to 3% to 5%. Our stock took quite a hit. And as a result, all of our incentive comp plans that are equity based, we didn't hit any of those targets.
So those 2 actions I just described happened in or near the end of the Q1, and all of that impact was in those plans by the end of Q2. So we were hitting none of those targets and accruing none of that cost related to those benefit plans.
On the contrary, this year you're well aware our stocks performed very well compared to the peers, and we're getting some of that bounce back effect. So last year we were accruing none of that cost. This year we're slightly above our 100% targets, because of the bounce back. So it's kind of going in opposite directions."

As shown on Slide 3, basic earnings per share were $0.55 for the second quarter of 2012 versus $0.44 in 2011. Higher electric margin from increased consumption and rate increases under the Base Load Review Act was partially offset by the cost of our capital program, interest expense, depreciation, property taxes and share dilution.
Gas margins were also higher due to the rate increase under the Rate Stabilization Act. Operating and maintenance expenses grew slightly over the second quarter of 2011, largely due to the timing of plant expenses, healthcare cost and incentive compensation.
Please turn to Slide 4. As you can see, basic earnings per share for the 6 months ended June 30, 2012 were $1.48 versus $1.44 in 2011. Increases in electric margin were partially offset by lower gas margins in Georgia, due to the mild weather in the first quarter along with higher operating and maintenance expenses and higher expenses related to our capital program, specifically depreciation, property taxes, interest and share dilution.
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to review results for our principal lines of business. Health care, and electric and gas companies 2012 second quarter basic earnings per share denoted in blue, were $0.59, an increase of $0.11 over the second quarter of 2011. Electric margin was higher due primarily to increases under the Base Load Review Act.
Additionally, we experienced increased non-weather related consumption during the quarter. This increase in margin was offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses, interest expense and depreciation as well as share dilution. Year-to-date basic earnings were higher by $0.11 due primarily to higher electric margin.
PSNC energy shown in red, reported flat earnings per share for the second quarter of 2012 versus the seasonal loss of $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2011, increases in margin due to customer growth contributed to the improvement. For the 6-month period ended June 30, 2012, basic earnings were $0.24 per share in line with the prior year.
SCANA energy in green reported the seasonal loss of $0.02 per share for the second quarter of 2012, consistent with last year. Year-to-date earnings are down $0.08 due to the impact of mild winter weather in the first quarter.
Our corporate and other businesses reported their loss for the quarter of $0.02 per share compared to a loss of $0.01 per share in 2011. For the 6-month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $0.04 compared to $0.03 in the same period last year.
Next, I'd like to touch on economic trends in our service area, as shown on Slide 6. We continue to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. In the second quarter, company's announced plans to invest $289 million with expectations of creating over 350 jobs in our South Carolina territory.
Our gas businesses in North Carolina also saw a promising quarter of economic announcements, with companies projecting an investment of $325 million and over 1,400 jobs. We are pleased that this year is shaping out to be another solid year in terms of economic development in our territories.
On the heels of these major economic announcements, unemployment rates remain stable. Major businesses such as Boeing and Amazon that have located in our territory are hiring employees quickly, and we're pleased to see these recent industrial expansions translating into jobs.
We're also pleased with 2 recent developments related to the project to deepen the Port of Charleston. The Army Corps of Engineers originally anticipated the project would take up to 8 years to complete. But a year into the project, they have announced it could finish in 5 years.
In addition, President Obama chose the Charleston Harbor deepening project as one of 7 priority infrastructure projects nationwide. This project will enable larger cargo ships to enter the harbor and is expected to faster economic growth. This is key once the Panama Canal is deepened in 2014.
For the 12-month period ended June 30, 2012, total weather normalized electric sales to residential customer were up approximately 0.6%. Our commercial sales were relatively flat. Industrial sales were down 1.4%, primarily due to reduced production at one of our largest customers as a result of the fire, we discussed last quarter.
We understand this customer's production will likely be limited for the majority of the year. Were this customer's operations consistent with 2011, we estimate industrial sales would have increased approximately 3%.
As you can see on Slide 7, we continue to see improvement in customer growth at our major regulated subsidiaries. For the last 3 quarters, customer growth has trended higher in our electric businesses as well as our regulating gas businesses in South and North Carolina. For June, those rates were 0.8%, 1.5% and 1.9% respectively. We're encouraged by this trend.
Please turn to Slide 8, which sort our regulated rate base, returns in South Carolina regulatory calendar. The data on this slide represents information as of the date of our most recent regulatory filings.
The pie chart on the upper left represents the components of regulated rate base of $7.1 billion. This is composed largely of SCE&G electric with close to $6 billion in total electric investment, as denoted in blue.
The chart to the right shows our actual and allowed regulatory returns for the period. Our regulated gas business in North Carolina continues to earn a steady return due to customer growth in their territory and stable margins under the customer utilization tracker.
Return on our regularly gas business in South Carolina dropped slightly after the winter season. In June, we requested an increase of $8.8 million under the Annual Rate Stabilization Act adjustment. This increase would bring the earned ROE for that business more closely in line with the allowed return of 10.25%.
As you are aware, we recently found an application for our rate increase for our retail electric business, which I will discuss more fully on the next slide. That application reflected an earned return of 7.26%. This reflects the full pro forma return considering all known and measurable adjustments as required when the case is filed.
Accordingly, it is lower than our actual return to reflect annualized costs, which aren't fully incorporated yet in the financials. For example, in the case, we propose an adjustment to annualized depreciation expense. As we've begun depreciating property at various points of the year, our test year must be adjusted to capture a full year depreciation expense for those items.
The bottom of the slide includes the 2 timelines depicting our regulatory filing schedule for 2012. As you can see in the first timeline we've completed all but one of our planned regulatory filings outside of the new nuclear project. In November, we will undergo the annual review of our gas, fuel cost at SCE&G.
The second timeline provides you with scheduled planned filings related to the new nuclear project. In May, we filed a quarterly status report and annual revised rates request related to the project. The Office of Regulatory Staff has audited our request for revised rates and we expect an order from the commission around the end of September.
When we make our filing for revised rates, we do so on May 30. But the period under review requires us to project our construction expenditures through the end of June. So we have a portion of the filing that is actually a forecast.
When ORS does their audit, they look at actual expenditures and the actual capital structure at June 30. Generally that true-up result in a minor adjustment to our request to reflect the actual cost. ORS submitted their report this week and recommended a final revenue increase of approximately $52 million.
In addition to these regular BLRA filings, we filed a petition to update our nuclear budget and schedule, which Steve will discuss in a few minutes. We will file our next quarterly status report in mid-August.
Please now turn to Slide 9. On June 29, we filed an application with the South Carolina PSC requesting an increase in our retail electric rates. In this application, we requested an allowed ROE of 10.95% and additional revenue of $151.5 million. A significant portion of this increase is simply an extension of the previous rate case.
Out of this additional revenue, we anticipate approximately $50 million would impact net income as the balance offsets new cost that will also be reflected in the financials. For example, in the last case we agreed not to include in rates. Operating expenses is associated with the scrubber at Wateree station, as it was not yet in service. Instead, those costs were deferred. A portion of this case seeks recovery of that deferral prospectively.
Additionally, we deferred increase pension cost related to the decline in market value of the related assets after the financial crises. The remainder of the increase will offset expenses such as depreciation and property taxes.
In our application, we asked that the new rates become effective on January 1, 2013. A hearing is scheduled for November, and we anticipate receiving an order from the commission by the end of December.
Slide 10, presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast is identical to the one we shared with you at our June Analyst Day events and reflects new nuclear spending, as reported in our latest BLRA filing in May.
Please turn to Slide 11. We have successfully completed all of our planned debt financings for 2012. The remainder of this slide presents our estimated financing plan through 2017, and has not changed since our Analyst Day event. We continue to anticipate drawing the remaining funds from our equity forward during the first quarter of 2013.
Now, please turn to Slide 12. We are affirming our earnings guidance of $3.05 to $3.25 per share. The long-term outlook is unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the 3- to 5-year period, based on the 2010 weather normalized base of $2.92 per share.
Our guidance encompasses the impact of whether on our Georgia operations during the first quarter, the impact of higher operating and maintenance expenses, and base rate increases for our new nuclear filings under the BLRA and Gas RSA adjustments. Our effective tax rate for 2011 was just over 30%, and we estimate the rate for 2012 will be approximately 31%.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I'd now like to direct your attention to Slide 13. We are pleased that our construction continues to move forward on our nuclear project. The schedule continues to support commercial operation dates of March of 2017 for Unit 2 and May of 20",769,"Thanks, Jimmy. I'd now like to direct your attention to Slide 13. We are pleased that our construction continues to move forward on our nuclear project. The schedule continues to support commercial operation dates of March of 2017 for Unit 2 and May of 2018 for Unit 3.
We have made progress on several areas during the past quarter. We continue to pour concrete in the Unit 2 excavation site. Making progress on the switchyard and cooling towers. The heavy lift derrick has been assembled, tested and is ready for use. Large component manufacture is progressing at sites around the world. And Slide 14 shows 2 of those components at a facility in South Korea.
Parts continue to arrive at the Port Charleston, before being transported to the site. We have made extensive progress on the turbine island for Unit 2, the first new unit, as you can see it on Slide number 15.
You can also see a portion of the heavy lift derrick, which is the blue arm across the top of the picture. The derrick is located between the excavation sites for the 2 new units. This will allow it to be used to lift assembled modules and other heavy components, and place them in the excavation site for either unit.
Circulating water pipe is in place, as shown in the center of the page. Slide also shows the containment vessel lower bowl. Chicago Bridge & Iron has completed welding of the lower bowl, and is now welding the first ring section for that containment vessel, which is shown on Slide 16.
Slide 17, shows 230,000 volt transmission lines being connected to the switchyard, which is nearing completion. The construction is on scheduled to allow the switchyard to be energized in the first half of 2013. This will allow us to back feed the project with power from the grid.
A final hearing for signing of transmission lines related to the new nuclear project will be held on August 22. We were fortunate to be able to use existing rights-of-way for the vast majority of transmission lines from the new units.
Please turn now to Slide 18, which shows the nuclear island for Unit 2. Over the last few months, we have poured dental and leveling concrete using our on-site concrete batch plants. This process has done well even while incurring record high temperatures. We had anticipated the challenge of high temperatures and we're able to ship to schedules to allow the pours to be done in the evening, when temperatures are not as extreme.
We have also begun installation of the waterproof membrane in the nuclear island. After that is complete, more high-strength concrete called mud mat is poured prior to installing the nuclear island rebar cage. As of yesterday, we installed the waterproof membrane and mud mat for about 75% of the nuclear island and placed about 40% of the rebar cage.
I know many of you have been interested in our rebar cage. I will let you know that we are constructing our rebar cage to conform to the applicable concrete code and design certification document requirements. And do not anticipate any additional delays to the rebar cage.
Once the rebar cage is fully in place, we'll pour the 6-foot thick nuclear island base mat and then set module CR10 on the base mat. The CR10 module is currently being fabricated on site, so that it will be ready when needed.
CR10 is a steel-frame support used to hold the lower bowl above the base mat until the foundation concrete is completed. We anticipate setting the lower containment bowl later this year. In summary, the construction is progressing well and on track to achieve the amended completion dates.
Please turn now to Slide 19. As you may remember, in May we filed an application with the South Carolina Public Service Commission seeking to update our budget and schedule. A new schedule sets the substantial completion dates for the units at March of 2017 and May of 2018.
The updated costs totaled $283 million and were primarily the result of delays in receipt of our license and agreement with Shawn Westinghouse related to challenge cost for the construction of our new nuclear units, and additional owners cost or non-EPC costs for which we were responsible, such as staffing, information technology and facilities.
The hearing on our updated cost filing will be held in September. We anticipate receiving an order from the commission on these items in mid-November.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

So we're trying to create a situation where we earn a reasonable return for investors to continue to attract the capital that we need to continue the development of the nuclear, while at the same time appreciating the condition of customers and trying to keep their bill down. After that reduction you've got an overall average increase of 3.5%, 3.75%, and that's after 2 years. So that's pretty close to the rate of inflation we experienced over the last couple of years.

And that's why we offered this additional chart on Page 7 in the slides to show the kind of consistent trend over the last 3 quarters in customer growth. So I am encouraged by this, it's just been so erratic over the last couple of years and it has continued even into the first 6 months. To be more specific, out of the 6 months this year, 3 months sales have increased on a weather normal basis and 3 months they've been slightly lower. Now, net overall the increases have been larger, but there has just been some variability and that is just too early to say there is a real definitive linear trend. One thing that we have noticed lately though is that, go back to a year ago and our overall growth rate in the electric business was about 0.5%. And the growth in commercial customers was less than half of that, which wouldn't surprise you in the recession. The industrials led the way out, residentials have started to follow behind. And I have commented for a few quarters now that the commercials have lagged. So they were about 1/2 the growth of residential. But if you look at the same numbers today, where our overall growth rate is about 0.8% on Page 7, the commercials are well in excess of that over 1%. So that's a really interesting sign. Now you'll notice in our overall commercial sales were relatively flat to last year. So the analysis of that I'd take is that, all the commercial customers are being very frugal in this difficult economy. But more coming online and I'm encouraged by that, continue to be encouragement by the industrial announcements we've focused on over the past year.

We're hopeful that that's going to moderate for the balance of the year based upon some of the very recent data. And then finally, the main driver is really more of, last year was lower than a normal period would have been. And let me explain that, and that's really driven by coming out of Fukushima issue last year and thus lowering our long-term earnings guidance from 4% to 6% to 3% to 5%. Our stock took quite a hit. And as a result, all of our incentive comp plans that are equity based, we didn't hit any of those targets. So those 2 actions I just described happened in or near the end of the Q1, and all of that impact was in those plans by the end of Q2. So we were hitting none of those targets and accruing none of that cost related to those benefit plans. On the contrary, this year you're well aware our stocks performed very well compared to the peers, and we're getting some of that bounce back effect. So last year we were accruing none of that cost.

I will begin our earnings discussion on slide three. Basics earnings per share were $0.93 for the third quarter of 2012 versus $0.81 in 2011. Electric margins were higher due to customer growth and base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act. These margins were partially offset by the cost of our capital program depreciation, interest expense as well as share dilution. Gas margins were also higher due to customer growth and the rate increase under the Rate Stabilization Act. Operating and maintenance expenses were slightly lower during the third quarter of 2012 than in the same period of 2011. We still forecast operating and maintenance expenses to be slightly higher for the full year compared to 2011. We also expect a modest trend to continue into 2013 as we continue to see increases in the costs to operate our systems safely and reliably.
Please turn to slide four. As you can see, basic earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 were $2.41 versus $2.25 in 2011. Increases in electric margin were partially offset by lower gas margins in Georgia due to the mild weather in the first quarter along with higher operating and maintenance expenses and higher expenses related to our capital program, specifically depreciation, property taxes, interest and share dilution.
And now on slide five, I’d like to review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company’s 2012 third quarter basic earnings per share denoted in blue were $1.1, an increase of $0.09 over the third quarter of 2011. Electric and gas margins were higher due primarily to increases under the Base Load Review Act and the Rate Stabilization Act coupled with customer growth. This increase in margin was offset by higher interest expense, depreciation as well as share dilution. Year-to-date, basic earnings were higher about $0.20 due primarily to higher electric and gas margins.
PSNC Energy shown in red reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share for the third quarter of 2012, consistent with 2011. Increases in margin due to customer growth were offset by higher depreciation and interest expense. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2012, basic earnings were $0.21 per share, again consistent with the prior year. SCANA Energy in green reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share for the third quarter of 2012, also consistent with 2011. Year-to-date earnings were down approximately $0.09 due to the impact of mild weather in the first quarter.
Our corporate and other businesses reported a loss for the quarter of $0.02 per share compared to a loss of $0.05 per share in 2011. For the nine month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $0.03 compared to a loss of $0.02 in the same period in the prior year. The results for 2011 reflect a slightly higher quarterly effective income tax rate at the holding company, while 2012 results also reflect revenue growth at our interstate pipeline business due to lower natural gas cost.
Next, I would like to touch on economic trends in our service area as shown on slide six. We continued to be encouraged by the level of economic development in our territories with approximately $1 billion invested in the Carolinas this year. Housing is also encouraging. While we still have not returned to pre-recession levels, we are seeing improvement in each of the areas we serve as you see in the chart at the bottom left. Additionally, SCE&G’s territory, which is heavily concentrated in the Charleston and Columbia metro areas has not been as volatile as the rest of the Southeast. In the bottom right you can find our current - customer growth percentages. We continued to be encouraged by the growth in our customer base. Customer growth has slowed slightly in our electric business during the quarter as it’s typical. We tend to see slower electric customer growth during the third and fourth quarters of the year.
For the 12-month period ended September 30, 2012, total weather normalized electric sales to residential and commercial customers were up approximately 1% and 0.4% respectively. Industrial sales were down approximately 2.6% primarily due to reduced production at one of our largest customers as a result of a fire as we have discussed in prior quarters. This customer was brought back on line earlier this month. Where the customer’s operation is consistent with 2011, we estimate overall industrial sales would have increased approximately 1.4%. In addition the Port of Charleston continues to see increased traffic with customer volume up 12% this quarter over the prior year. As I mentioned before it is estimated that one in every five jobs in South Carolina is related to Port volume.
Please turn now to slide seven, which sets forth our regulated rate base returns in South Carolina regulatory calendar. The data on the slide represents information as of the date of our most recent regulatory filings. The pie chart on the upper left presents the components of our regulated rate base of over $7.5 billion as of June 30. This is composed largely of SCE&G electric with approximately $6.4 billion and total electric investment as denoted in two shades of blue.
As Steve will discuss the Public Service Commission of South Carolina recently approved the fifth consecutive rate increase under the Base Load Review Act. The chart to the right shows our actual and allowed regulatory returns for the period, not much has changed here. Our regulated gas business in North Carolina continues to earn a steady return due to customer growth in their territory and stable margins under the customer utilization tracker. The return on our regulated gas business in South Carolina dropped slightly after the winter season. However, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina recently issued an order or a rate increase of $7.5 million under the Annual Rate Stabilization Act. This increase should bring the earned ROE for that business more closely in line with the allowed return of 10.25%.
As you are aware in June of 2012, we filed an application for rate increase for our retail electric business, which I will discuss to a greater extent on the next slide. That application reflected a return of 7.26%. This reflects the full pro forma return considering all known and measurable adjustments as required when the case is filed. The bottom of the slide includes the timeline depicting our regulatory filing schedule for 2012 outside of the new nuclear project. As you can see in the timeline, we have completed all, but one of our planned regulatory filings. In November, we will undergo the annual review of our gas, fuel cost at SCE&G.
Please turn now to slide eight. On June 29, we filed an application with the Public Service Commission requesting an increase in our retail electric rates. In this application, we requested an allowed ROE of 10.95% and additional revenue of $151.5 million. We filed our testimony on October 2 in the Office of Regulatory Staff and other interveners filed their testimony last Friday. We are constructively engaged with ORS and the other interveners in hopes of reaching a settlement by hearing a schedule for November 27 and we anticipate receiving an order from the commission in late December as new rates are effective January 2013.
Slide nine presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reported in our latest BLRA quarterly report from August, which includes amounts as of the second quarter of 2012. We will update these amounts with our next quarterly filing in mid-November to include changes in AFC, escalation and construction activities. Otherwise, this slide is identical to the CapEx forecast we shared during our second quarter earnings call. Also, as you can see along the bottom of the slide and due to your request, we have included our anticipated incremental nuclear CWIP as of June 30 of each year. This represents the incremental CWIP from July 1 through June 30 for each period on which the BLRA increases are calculated. As you will note, the amounts are nearly the same as the calendar period CWIP that we have previously provided.
Please turn to slide 10 to review our financing plan, which is consistent with our last earnings call. We have successfully completed all of our planned debt financings for 2012 and our estimated financing plan through 2017 remains unchanged. We continued to anticipate drawing the remaining funds from our equity forward during the first quarter of 2013, resulting in the issuance of approximately 6.6 million shares.
As presented on slide 11, we are tightening our guidance for the year to $3.10 to $3.25 in basic earnings per share. We estimate our effective tax rate for 2012 will be approximately 30%. Our long-term outlook remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the 3- to 5-year period based on 2010 weather normalized base of $2.92 per share. While we have seen positive economic signs in our territory, we remain conservative about customer growth and usage. While weather normalized sales are up over the last 12 months, the monthly change versus the prior year has been inconsistent.
Finally, on slide 12, we are very pleased to report earlier this month we successfully completed the syndication of an expanded and extended credit facility. The additional liquidity is important to our nuclear construction and the tenure spans substantially all of the planned peak construction period of the new units. The committed lines of credit now total $1.8 billion, with $1.6 billion covering the entire five years and an additional $200 million over the three years for added peak construction liquidity. I would like to thank our banks for their enthusiastic support of our liquidity needs and support of our nuclear expansion plants. We are pleased that we have received an excellent response for our nuclear construction from our equity and debt investors as well as our banks.
I will now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.

I would now like to direct your attention to slide 13. We are pleased the construction continues to move forward on our nuclear project. The schedule continues to support commercial operation dates of March of 2017 for Unit 2 and May of 2018",1023,"Thanks Jimmy. I would now like to direct your attention to slide 13. We are pleased the construction continues to move forward on our nuclear project. The schedule continues to support commercial operation dates of March of 2017 for Unit 2 and May of 2018 for Unit 3. We have made progress in several years during the past quarter. We completed the installation of the Unit 2 rebar cage assembly, poured 30,000 cubic yards of nuclear concrete and begun fabricating the walls of the turbine building. We also continue to make progress on the switchyard and cooling towers and have begun training operators for the two new nuclear facilities. The heavy lift derrick has been assembled, tested and is currently in use. Large component manufacture continues to progress at sites around the world.
And slide 14 shows two of those components at our facility in South Korea. The reactor vessel has completed testing and is expected to be received on-site early in 2013. The steam generators for Unit 2 are scheduled to be tested around year-end and expected to be delivered early next year.
Please turn now to slide 15 which shows the progress of the nuclear island for Unit 2 throughout the year. Over the past months, we have completed the installation of leveling concrete and the waterproof membrane which is same as between a lower mud-mat and higher strength upper mud-mat. We also completed the installation of our rebar cage on top of the mud-mats. Our next step will be to pour base mat which will be the foundation of the nuclear island. On this six-foot thick nuclear island base mat, we will the CR-10 module as pictured on slide 16. CR-10 module is nearing completion and has been fabricated on-site. As you might recall, the CR-10 has a steel frame support used to hold the lower bowl above the base mat until the foundation concrete is completed. We anticipate setting the lower containment bowl later this year or early next year. So, in summary, the construction is progressing well and on track to achieve the amended completion date.
On slide 17, we review our new nuclear and Base Load Review Act filings as related - and related rate increases. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we filed our annual request for revised rates under the Base Load Review Act in May. In response of that request in September, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved an increase of $52.1 million. The new rates were effective for bills rendered on and after October 30th. This is the fifth rate increase under the BLRA. We continued to be pleased that the mechanism is working as designed.
Our BLRA filings for 2012 are shown in the bottom of the slide. And as you can see on August 14th, we filed our quarterly status report on our new nuclear project with the Commission and the Office of Regulatory Staff for the second quarter of 2012. This report provided a detailed update of capital cost incurred and updated milestones for our new nuclear project, and is available on our website. We intend to file our quarterly status report for the third quarter of 2012 in November.
As you may remember, in May, we filed an application with the Public Service Commission seeking to update our budget and schedule. A new schedule set the substantial completion dates for the units at March of 2017 and May of 2018. The updated costs totaled $283 million and were primarily the result of delays in receipt of our license, and agreement with Shaw and Westinghouse related to challenged costs for the construction of our two new nuclear units, transmission costs and additional owners costs or a non-EPC cost for which we are responsible, such as staffing, information technology and facilities. The hearing for this filing was held on October the 2nd and 3rd. During the hearing, we provided the Commission with an update on the project and presented evidence that our decision to pursue nuclear generation remains prudent. We anticipate receiving an order from the Commission on these items in mid-November.
On slide 18, you’ll see a picture of Unit 1 at V.C. Summer Nuclear Station. On October the 12th, we took Unit 1 offline to begin a scheduled refueling outage. The outage follows an 18-month operating cycle and is the 20th for V.C. Summer since the station began commercial operation in 1984. The outage allows us to replace one-third of V.C. Summer’s 157 uranium fuel assemblies and to perform preventive maintenance work that cannot be performed when the reactor is operating. During this outage, we performed a planned inspection of the reactor vessel head.
This inspection is designed to find minor defects which allowed timely repairs and prevents an actual problem. The reactor vessel head contains a total of 66 penetrations which are mostly used to maneuver control rods in the reactor. As a result of this inspection we identified welds for four of those penetrations that need repair. An extensive robotic inspection of the reactor vessel showed there was no leakage from these areas as a result of the condition of the welds. We notified the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as required and developed a strategy to repair the welds. These repairs have been made successfully at other nuclear facilities. As part of the planning for this inspection V.C. Summer and Westinghouse personnel developed a detailed contingency plan if repairs were needed. We will now execute this plan. Our focus is on completing the repair safely during the outage before returning the reactor to service.
We are pleased to announce that the beginning of this scheduled outage marks the end of the first breaker-to-breaker cycle in the history of V.C. Summer. A breaker-to-breaker run is an industry term recognizing a plant that operates continuously between refueling outages and only occurs when the plant reliability is very high. V.C. Summer was connected to the grid for 501 continuous days, which also set energy production records for the station.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.

Some of our peers have prospective forward-looking test years. We have a historical test year. So, as I have said before by the time we start off with new rates, it’s very difficult to get within 50 basis points of the ROE just because of the historical nature of the test year and the attrition that occurs. Some of the other peers have more mechanisms, if you will, around environmental matters and things like that than we do. So, you really got to be careful when you just compare numbers from across the country, because I think ours are more pure. And I think those are the kinds of factors that the commissions here in the Southeast have taken into consideration when they have granted ROEs in the past. And of course, very few of our peers in fact one is building new nuclear at the same time we do which brings increased risk as well. So, those would be the primary factors that I would suggest differentiate us.

Let me just frame it by saying that the commission has a practice that they like to have any settlements presented to them at least a week before the beginning of the hearing. So, they have got ample time to consider this settlement when they are hearing the testimony from the various parties. So, that essentially means we have got the next two weeks, this week, next week to try to work something out and we are trying. And I am encouraged by the party’s participation and I think everyone is serious about it.
I don’t know that there are any other significant items that would have as large of an impact, particularly on earnings as would ROE. So, that’s certainly a significant item, but there are other items too. For example, we have got some deferred costs related to the scrubber that we installed at the Wateree Station, that was not completely in service at the time of our last increase about 2.5 years ago. So, we agreed to defer that until this time. So, one of the items that will be up for discussion is what amortization period do you collect that deferral over. So, there is differences in opinions over that and that will go into the judgment. That’s just an example.

I would like to start by saying to all of you in the path of Sandy that you are in our thoughts and prayers. And continuing with our tradition of providing resources through our mutual assistance arrangements coordinated through the Southeastern Electric Exchange, we have already sent both utility, construction, and tree crews to the affected areas. And we are prepared to send additional resources as directed as part of this coordinated effort to assist those in need.
I will begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Basics earnings per share were $0.93 for the third quarter of 2012 versus $0.81 in 2011. Electric margins were higher due to customer growth and base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act. These margins were partially offset by the cost of our capital program depreciation, interest expense, as well as share dilution. Gas margins were also higher due to customer growth and the rate increase under the Rate Stabilization Act. Operating and maintenance expenses were slightly lower during the third quarter of 2012 than in the same period of 2011. We still forecast operating and maintenance expenses to be slightly higher for the full year compared to 2011. We also expect that modest trend to continue into 2013 as we continue to see increases in the costs to operate our systems safely and reliably.
Please turn to Slide 4. As you can see, basic earnings per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2012 were $2.41 versus $2.25 in 2011. Increases in electric margin were partially offset by lower gas margins in Georgia due to the mild weather in the first quarter along with higher operating and maintenance expenses and higher expenses related to our capital program, specifically depreciation, property taxes, interest and share dilution.
And now on Slide 5, I’d like to review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company’s 2012 third quarter basic earnings per share, denoted in blue, were $1.01, an increase of $0.09 over the third quarter of 2011. Electric and gas margins were higher due primarily to increases under the Base Load Review Act and the Rate Stabilization Act coupled with customer growth. This increase in margin was offset by higher interest expense, depreciation as well as share dilution. Year-to-date, basic earnings were higher by $0.20 due primarily to higher electric and gas margins.
PSNC Energy, shown in red, reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share for the third quarter of 2012, consistent with 2011. Increases in margin due to customer growth were offset by higher depreciation and interest expenses. For the 9 month period ended September 30, 2012, basic earnings were $0.21 per share, again consistent with the prior year. SCANA Energy in green reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share for the third quarter of 2012, also consistent with 2011. Year-to-date earnings were down approximately $0.09 due to the impact of mild weather in the first quarter.
Our corporate and other businesses reported a loss for the quarter of $0.02 per share compared to a loss of $0.05 per share in 2011. For the 9 month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $0.03 compared to a loss of $0.02 in the same period in the prior year. The results for 2011 reflect a slightly higher quarterly effective income tax rate at the holding company, while 2012 results also reflect revenue growth at our interstate pipeline business due to lower natural gas cost.
Next, I would like to touch on economic trends in our service area as shown on Slide 6. We continued to be encouraged by the level of economic development in our territories with approximately $1 billion invested in the Carolinas this year. Housing is also encouraging. While we still have not returned to pre-recession levels, we are seeing improvement in each of the areas we serve as you see in the chart at the bottom left. Additionally, SCE&G’s territory, which is heavily concentrated in the Charleston and Columbia metro areas, has not been as volatile as the rest of the Southeast. In the bottom right you can find our customer growth percentages. We continued to be encouraged by the growth in our customer base. Customer growth has slowed slightly in our electric business during the quarter as is typical. We tend to see slower electric customer growth during the third and fourth quarters of the year.
For the 12-month period ended September 30, 2012, total weather normalized electric sales to residential and commercial customers were up approximately 1% and 0.4% respectively. Industrial sales were down approximately 2.6% primarily due to reduced production at one of our largest customers as a result of a fire as we have discussed in prior quarters. This customer was brought back on line earlier this month. Where the customer’s operation is consistent with 2011, we estimate overall industrial sales would have increased approximately 1.4%. In addition, the Port of Charleston continues to see increased traffic with customer volume up 12% this quarter over the prior year. As I mentioned before it is estimated that one 1 every 5 jobs in South Carolina is related to Port volume.
Please turn now to Slide 7, which sets forth our regulated rate base returns in South Carolina regulatory calendar. The data on the slide represents information as of the date of our most recent regulatory filings. The pie chart on the upper left presents the components of our regulated rate base of over $7.5 billion as of June 30. This is composed largely of SCE&G electric with approximately $6.4 billion and total electric investment as denoted in the two shades of blue.
As Steve will discuss the Public Service Commission of South Carolina recently approved the fifth consecutive rate increase under the Base Load Review Act. The chart to the right shows our actual and allowed regulatory returns for the period, not much has changed here. Our regulated gas business in North Carolina continues to earn a steady return due to customer growth in their territory and stable margins under the customer utilization tracker. The return on our regulated gas business in South Carolina dropped slightly after the winter season. However, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina recently issued an order for a rate increase of $7.5 million under the Annual Rate Stabilization Act. This increase should bring the earned ROE for that business more closely in line with the allowed return of 10.25%.
As you are aware, in June of 2012, we filed an application for rate increase for our retail electric business, which I will discuss to a greater extent on the next slide. That application reflected a return of 7.26%. This reflects the full pro forma return considering all known and measurable adjustments as required when the case is filed. The bottom of the slide includes the timeline depicting our regulatory filing schedule for 2012 outside of the new nuclear project. As you can see in the timeline, we have completed all but one of our planned regulatory filings. In November, we will undergo the annual review of our gas, fuel cost at SCE&G.
Please turn now to Slide 8. On June 29, we filed an application with the Public Service Commission requesting an increase in our retail electric rates. In this application, we requested an allowed ROE of 10.95% and additional revenue of $151.5 million. We filed our testimony on October 2 and the Office of Regulatory Staff and other interveners filed their testimony last Friday. We are constructively engaged with ORS and the other interveners in hopes of reaching a settlement by hearing a schedule for November 27 and we anticipate receiving an order from the commission in late December as new rates are effective January 2013.
Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reported in our latest BLRA quarterly report from August, which includes amounts as of the second quarter of 2012. We will update these amounts with our next quarterly filing in mid-November to include changes in AFC, escalation and construction activities. Otherwise, this slide is identical to the CapEx forecast we shared during our second quarter earnings call. Also, as you can see along the bottom of the slide and due to your request, we have included our anticipated incremental nuclear CWIP as of June 30 of each year. This represents the incremental CWIP from July 1 through June 30 for each period on which the BLRA increases are calculated. As you will note, the amounts are nearly the same as the calendar period CWIP that we have previously provided.
Please turn to Slide 10 to review our financing plan, which is consistent with our last earnings call. We have successfully completed all of our planned debt financings for 2012 and our estimated financing plan through 2017 remains unchanged. We continued to anticipate drawing the remaining funds from our equity floor during the first quarter of 2013, resulting in the issuance of approximately 6.6 million shares.
As presented on Slide 11, we are tightening our guidance for the year to $3.10 to $3.25 in basic earnings per share. We estimate our effective tax rate for 2012 will be approximately 30%. Our long-term outlook remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the 3- to 5-year period based on 2010 weather normalized base of $2.92 per share. While we have seen positive economic signs in our territory, we remain conservative about customer growth and usage. While weather normalized sales are up over the last 12 months, the monthly change versus the prior year has been inconsistent.
Finally, on Slide 12, we are very pleased to report earlier this month we successfully completed the syndication of an expanded and extended credit facility. The additional liquidity is important to our nuclear construction and the tenure spans substantially all of the planned peak construction period of the new units. The committed lines of credit now total $1.8 billion, with $1.6 billion covering the entire 5 years and an additional $200 million over the 3 years for added peak construction liquidity. I would like to thank our banks for their enthusiastic support of our liquidity needs and support of our nuclear expansion plants. We are pleased that we have received an excellent response for our nuclear construction from our equity and debt investors as well as our banks.
I will now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I would now like to direct your attention to Slide 13. We are pleased the construction continues to move forward on our nuclear project. The schedule continues to support commercial operation dates of March of 2017 for Unit 2 and May of 2018",1021,"Thanks Jimmy. I would now like to direct your attention to Slide 13. We are pleased the construction continues to move forward on our nuclear project. The schedule continues to support commercial operation dates of March of 2017 for Unit 2 and May of 2018 for Unit 3. We have made progress in several areas during the past quarter. We completed the installation of the Unit 2 rebar cage assembly, poured 30,000 cubic yards of nuclear concrete and begun fabricating the walls of the turbine building. We also continue to make progress on the switchyard and cooling towers and have begun training operators for the 2 new nuclear facilities. The heavy lift derrick has been assembled, tested and is currently in use. Large component manufacture continues to progress at sites around the world.
And Slide 14 shows 2 of those components at our facility in South Korea. The reactor vessel has completed testing and is expected to be received on-site early in 2013. The steam generators for Unit 2 are scheduled to be tested around year-end and expected to be delivered early next year.
Please turn now to Slide 15 which shows the progress of the nuclear island for Unit 2 throughout the year. Over the past months, we have completed the installation of leveling concrete and the waterproof membrane which is sandwiched between a lower mud-mat and higher strength upper mud-mat. We also completed the installation of our rebar cage on top of the mud-mats. Our next step will be to pour base mat which will be the foundation of the nuclear island. On this 6-foot thick nuclear island base mat, we will the CR-10 module as pictured on Slide 16. CR-10 module is nearing completion and has been fabricated on-site. As you might recall, the CR-10 has a steel frame support used to hold the lower bowl above the base mat until the foundation concrete is completed. We anticipate setting the lower containment bowl later this year or early next year. So, in summary, the construction is progressing well and on track to achieve the amended completion date.
On Slide 17, we review our new nuclear Base Load Review Act filings as related -- and related rate increases. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we filed our annual request for revised rates under the Base Load Review Act in May. In response of that request, in September, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved an increase of $52.1 million. The new rates were effective for bills rendered on and after October 30th. This is the fifth rate increase under the BLRA. We continued to be pleased that the mechanism is working as designed.
Our BLRA filings for 2012 are shown at the bottom of the slide. And as you can see on August 14th, we filed our quarterly status report on our new nuclear project with the Commission and the Office of Regulatory Staff for the second quarter of 2012. This report provided a detailed update of capital cost incurred and updated milestones for our new nuclear project, and is available on our website. We intend to file our quarterly status report for the third quarter of 2012 in November.
As you may remember, in May, we filed an application with the Public Service Commission seeking to update our budget and schedule. A new schedule set the substantial completion dates for the units at March of 2017 and May of 2018. The updated costs totaled $283 million and were primarily the result of delays in receipt of our license, and agreement with Shaw and Westinghouse related to challenged costs for the construction of our 2 new nuclear units, transmission costs and additional owners costs or a non-EPC cost for which we are responsible, such as staffing, information technology and facilities. The hearing for this filing was held on October the 2nd and 3rd. During the hearing, we provided the Commission with an update on the project and presented evidence that our decision to pursue nuclear generation remains prudent. We anticipate receiving an order from the Commission on these items in mid-November.
On Slide 18, you’ll see a picture of Unit 1 at V.C. Summer Nuclear Station. On October the 12th, we took Unit 1 offline to begin a scheduled refueling outage. The outage follows an 18-month operating cycle and is the 20th for V.C. Summer since the station began commercial operation in 1984. The outage allows us to replace 1/3 of V.C. Summer’s 157 uranium fuel assemblies and to perform preventive maintenance work that cannot be performed when the reactor is operating. During this outage, we performed a planned inspection of the reactor vessel head.
This inspection is designed to find minor defects which allowed timely repairs and prevents an actual problem. The reactor vessel head contains a total of 66 penetrations which are mostly used to maneuver control rods in the reactor. As a result of this inspection, we identified welds for 4 of those penetrations that need repair. An extensive robotic inspection of the reactor vessel showed there was no leakage from these areas as a result of the condition of the welds. We notified the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as required and developed a strategy to repair the welds. These repairs have been made successfully at other nuclear facilities. As part of the planning for this inspection, V.C. Summer and Westinghouse personnel developed a detailed contingency plan if repairs were needed. We will now execute this plan. Our focus is on completing the repair safely during the outage before returning the reactor to service.
We are pleased to announce that the beginning of this scheduled outage marks the end of the first breaker-to-breaker cycle in the history of V.C. Summer. A breaker-to-breaker run is an industry term recognizing a plant that operates continuously between refueling outages and only occurs when the plant reliability is very high. V.C. Summer was connected to the grid for 501 continuous days, which also set energy production records for the station.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

Some of our peers have prospective forward-looking test years. We have a historical test year. So, as I have said before, by the time we start off with new rates, it’s very difficult to get within 50 basis points of the ROE just because of the historical nature of the test year and the attrition that occurs. Some of the other peers have more mechanisms, if you will, around environmental matters and things like that than we do. So, you really got to be careful when you just compare numbers from across the country, because I think ours are more pure. And I think those are the kinds of factors that the commissions here in the Southeast have taken into consideration when they have granted ROEs in the past. And of course, very few of our peers in fact one is building new nuclear at the same time we do which brings increased risk as well.

For example, we have got some deferred costs related to the scrubber that we installed at the Wateree Station, it was not completely in service at the time of our last increase about 2.5 years ago. So, we agreed to defer that until this time. So, one of the items that will be up for discussion is what amortization period do you collect that deferral over. So, there is differences in opinions over that and that will go into the judgment. That’s just an example."

I would like to start by saying to all of you in the path of Sandy that you are in our thoughts and prayers. And continuing with our tradition of providing resources through our mutual assistance arrangements coordinated through the Southeastern Electric Exchange, we have already sent both utility, construction, and tree crews to the affected areas. And we are prepared to send additional resources as directed as part of this coordinated effort to assist those in need.
I will begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Basics earnings per share were $0.93 for the third quarter of 2012 versus $0.81 in 2011. Electric margins were higher due to customer growth and base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act. These margins were partially offset by the cost of our capital program depreciation, interest expense, as well as share dilution. Gas margins were also higher due to customer growth and the rate increase under the Rate Stabilization Act. Operating and maintenance expenses were slightly lower during the third quarter of 2012 than in the same period of 2011. We still forecast operating and maintenance expenses to be slightly higher for the full year compared to 2011. We also expect that modest trend to continue into 2013 as we continue to see increases in the costs to operate our systems safely and reliably.
Please turn to Slide 4. As you can see, basic earnings per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2012 were $2.41 versus $2.25 in 2011. Increases in electric margin were partially offset by lower gas margins in Georgia due to the mild weather in the first quarter along with higher operating and maintenance expenses and higher expenses related to our capital program, specifically depreciation, property taxes, interest and share dilution.
And now on Slide 5, I’d like to review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company’s 2012 third quarter basic earnings per share, denoted in blue, were $1.01, an increase of $0.09 over the third quarter of 2011. Electric and gas margins were higher due primarily to increases under the Base Load Review Act and the Rate Stabilization Act coupled with customer growth. This increase in margin was offset by higher interest expense, depreciation as well as share dilution. Year-to-date, basic earnings were higher by $0.20 due primarily to higher electric and gas margins.
PSNC Energy, shown in red, reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share for the third quarter of 2012, consistent with 2011. Increases in margin due to customer growth were offset by higher depreciation and interest expenses. For the 9 month period ended September 30, 2012, basic earnings were $0.21 per share, again consistent with the prior year. SCANA Energy in green reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share for the third quarter of 2012, also consistent with 2011. Year-to-date earnings were down approximately $0.09 due to the impact of mild weather in the first quarter.
Our corporate and other businesses reported a loss for the quarter of $0.02 per share compared to a loss of $0.05 per share in 2011. For the 9 month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $0.03 compared to a loss of $0.02 in the same period in the prior year. The results for 2011 reflect a slightly higher quarterly effective income tax rate at the holding company, while 2012 results also reflect revenue growth at our interstate pipeline business due to lower natural gas cost.
Next, I would like to touch on economic trends in our service area as shown on Slide 6. We continued to be encouraged by the level of economic development in our territories with approximately $1 billion invested in the Carolinas this year. Housing is also encouraging. While we still have not returned to pre-recession levels, we are seeing improvement in each of the areas we serve as you see in the chart at the bottom left. Additionally, SCE&G’s territory, which is heavily concentrated in the Charleston and Columbia metro areas, has not been as volatile as the rest of the Southeast. In the bottom right you can find our customer growth percentages. We continued to be encouraged by the growth in our customer base. Customer growth has slowed slightly in our electric business during the quarter as is typical. We tend to see slower electric customer growth during the third and fourth quarters of the year.
For the 12-month period ended September 30, 2012, total weather normalized electric sales to residential and commercial customers were up approximately 1% and 0.4% respectively. Industrial sales were down approximately 2.6% primarily due to reduced production at one of our largest customers as a result of a fire as we have discussed in prior quarters. This customer was brought back on line earlier this month. Where the customer’s operation is consistent with 2011, we estimate overall industrial sales would have increased approximately 1.4%. In addition, the Port of Charleston continues to see increased traffic with customer volume up 12% this quarter over the prior year. As I mentioned before it is estimated that 1 in every 5 jobs in South Carolina is related to Port volume.
Please turn now to Slide 7, which sets forth our regulated rate base returns in South Carolina regulatory calendar. The data on the slide represents information as of the date of our most recent regulatory filings. The pie chart on the upper left presents the components of our regulated rate base of over $7.5 billion as of June 30. This is composed largely of SCE&G electric with approximately $6.4 billion and total electric investment as denoted in the 2 shades of blue.
As Steve will discuss the Public Service Commission of South Carolina recently approved the fifth consecutive rate increase under the Base Load Review Act. The chart to the right shows our actual and allowed regulatory returns for the period, not much has changed here. Our regulated gas business in North Carolina continues to earn a steady return due to customer growth in their territory and stable margins under the customer utilization tracker. The return on our regulated gas business in South Carolina dropped slightly after the winter season. However, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina recently issued an order for a rate increase of $7.5 million under the Annual Rate Stabilization Act. This increase should bring the earned ROE for that business more closely in line with the allowed return of 10.25%.
As you are aware, in June of 2012, we filed an application for rate increase for our retail electric business, which I will discuss to a greater extent on the next slide. That application reflected a return of 7.26%. This reflects the full pro forma return considering all known and measurable adjustments as required when the case is filed. The bottom of the slide includes the timeline depicting our regulatory filing schedule for 2012 outside of the new nuclear project. As you can see in the timeline, we have completed all but one of our planned regulatory filings. In November, we will undergo the annual review of our gas, fuel cost at SCE&G.
Please turn now to Slide 8. On June 29, we filed an application with the Public Service Commission requesting an increase in our retail electric rates. In this application, we requested an allowed ROE of 10.95% and additional revenue of $151.5 million. We filed our testimony on October 2 and the Office of Regulatory Staff and other interveners filed their testimony last Friday. We are constructively engaged with ORS and the other interveners in hopes of reaching a settlement by hearing a schedule for November 27 and we anticipate receiving an order from the commission in late December as new rates are effective January 2013.
Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reported in our latest BLRA quarterly report from August, which includes amounts as of the second quarter of 2012. We will update these amounts with our next quarterly filing in mid-November to include changes in AFC, escalation and construction activities. Otherwise, this slide is identical to the CapEx forecast we shared during our second quarter earnings call. Also, as you can see along the bottom of the slide and due to your request, we have included our anticipated incremental nuclear CWIP as of June 30 of each year. This represents the incremental CWIP from July 1 through June 30 for each period on which the BLRA increases are calculated. As you will note, the amounts are nearly the same as the calendar period CWIP that we have previously provided.
Please turn to Slide 10 to review our financing plan, which is consistent with our last earnings call. We have successfully completed all of our planned debt financings for 2012 and our estimated financing plan through 2017 remains unchanged. We continued to anticipate drawing the remaining funds from our equity floor during the first quarter of 2013, resulting in the issuance of approximately 6.6 million shares.
As presented on Slide 11, we are tightening our guidance for the year to $3.10 to $3.25 in basic earnings per share. We estimate our effective tax rate for 2012 will be approximately 30%. Our long-term outlook remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the 3- to 5-year period based on 2010 weather normalized base of $2.92 per share. While we have seen positive economic signs in our territory, we remain conservative about customer growth and usage. While weather normalized sales are up over the last 12 months, the monthly change versus the prior year has been inconsistent.
Finally, on Slide 12, we are very pleased to report earlier this month we successfully completed the syndication of an expanded and extended credit facility. The additional liquidity is important to our nuclear construction and the tenure spans substantially all of the planned peak construction period of the new units. The committed lines of credit now total $1.8 billion, with $1.6 billion covering the entire 5 years and an additional $200 million over the 3 years for added peak construction liquidity. I would like to thank our banks for their enthusiastic support of our liquidity needs and support of our nuclear expansion plants. We are pleased that we have received an excellent response for our nuclear construction from our equity and debt investors as well as our banks.
I will now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I would now like to direct your attention to Slide 13. We are pleased the construction continues to move forward on our nuclear project. The schedule continues to support commercial operation dates of March of 2017 for Unit 2 and May of 201",1021,"Thanks, Jimmy. I would now like to direct your attention to Slide 13. We are pleased the construction continues to move forward on our nuclear project. The schedule continues to support commercial operation dates of March of 2017 for Unit 2 and May of 2018 for Unit 3. We have made progress in several areas during the past quarter. We completed the installation of the Unit 2 rebar cage assembly, poured 30,000 cubic yards of nuclear concrete and begun fabricating the walls of the turbine building. We also continue to make progress on the switchyard and cooling towers and have begun training operators for the 2 new nuclear facilities. The heavy lift derrick has been assembled, tested and is currently in use. Large component manufacture continues to progress at sites around the world.
And Slide 14 shows 2 of those components at our facility in South Korea. The reactor vessel has completed testing and is expected to be received on-site early in 2013. The steam generators for Unit 2 are scheduled to be tested around year-end and expected to be delivered early next year.
Please turn now to Slide 15 which shows the progress of the nuclear island for Unit 2 throughout the year. Over the past months, we have completed the installation of leveling concrete and the waterproof membrane which is sandwiched between a lower mud-mat and higher strength upper mud-mat. We also completed the installation of our rebar cage on top of the mud-mats. Our next step will be to pour base mat which will be the foundation of the nuclear island. On this 6-foot thick nuclear island base mat, we will the CR-10 module as pictured on Slide 16. CR-10 module is nearing completion and has been fabricated on-site. As you might recall, the CR-10 has a steel frame support used to hold the lower bowl above the base mat until the foundation concrete is completed. We anticipate setting the lower containment bowl later this year or early next year. So, in summary, the construction is progressing well and on track to achieve the amended completion date.
On Slide 17, we review our new nuclear Base Load Review Act filings as related -- and related rate increases. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we filed our annual request for revised rates under the Base Load Review Act in May. In response of that request, in September, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved an increase of $52.1 million. The new rates were effective for bills rendered on and after October 30th. This is the fifth rate increase under the BLRA. We continued to be pleased that the mechanism is working as designed.
Our BLRA filings for 2012 are shown at the bottom of the slide. And as you can see on August 14th, we filed our quarterly status report on our new nuclear project with the Commission and the Office of Regulatory Staff for the second quarter of 2012. This report provided a detailed update of capital cost incurred and updated milestones for our new nuclear project, and is available on our website. We intend to file our quarterly status report for the third quarter of 2012 in November.
As you may remember, in May, we filed an application with the Public Service Commission seeking to update our budget and schedule. A new schedule set the substantial completion dates for the units at March of 2017 and May of 2018. The updated costs totaled $283 million and were primarily the result of delays in receipt of our license, and agreement with Shaw and Westinghouse related to challenged costs for the construction of our 2 new nuclear units, transmission costs and additional owners costs or a non-EPC cost for which we are responsible, such as staffing, information technology and facilities. The hearing for this filing was held on October the 2nd and 3rd. During the hearing, we provided the Commission with an update on the project and presented evidence that our decision to pursue nuclear generation remains prudent. We anticipate receiving an order from the Commission on these items in mid-November.
On Slide 18, you’ll see a picture of Unit 1 at V.C. Summer Nuclear Station. On October the 12th, we took Unit 1 offline to begin a scheduled refueling outage. The outage follows an 18-month operating cycle and is the 20th for V.C. Summer since the station began commercial operation in 1984. The outage allows us to replace 1/3 of V.C. Summer’s 157 uranium fuel assemblies and to perform preventive maintenance work that cannot be performed when the reactor is operating. During this outage, we performed a planned inspection of the reactor vessel head.
This inspection is designed to find minor defects which allowed timely repairs and prevents an actual problem. The reactor vessel head contains a total of 66 penetrations which are mostly used to maneuver control rods in the reactor. As a result of this inspection, we identified welds for 4 of those penetrations that need repair. An extensive robotic inspection of the reactor vessel showed there was no leakage from these areas as a result of the condition of the welds. We notified the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as required and developed a strategy to repair the welds. These repairs have been made successfully at other nuclear facilities. As part of the planning for this inspection, V.C. Summer and Westinghouse personnel developed a detailed contingency plan if repairs were needed. We will now execute this plan. Our focus is on completing the repair safely during the outage before returning the reactor to service.
We are pleased to announce that the beginning of this scheduled outage marks the end of the first breaker-to-breaker cycle in the history of V.C. Summer. A breaker-to-breaker run is an industry term recognizing a plant that operates continuously between refueling outages and only occurs when the plant reliability is very high. V.C. Summer was connected to the grid for 501 continuous days, which also set energy production records for the station.

What are the sticking points? What are the pros and cons that you’ve heard and obviously with interest rates where they are in some other allowed ROEs we have seen over the couple months that 10.95% appears quite high relative to peers and other financial metrics? Can you just discuss kind of again the pros and cons, what the other people involved in the case are thinking along those lines?"

Some of our peers have prospective forward-looking test years. We have a historical test year. So, as I have said before, by the time we start off with new rates, it’s very difficult to get within 50 basis points of the ROE just because of the historical nature of the test year and the attrition that occurs. Some of the other peers have more mechanisms, if you will, around environmental matters and things like that than we do. So, you really got to be careful when you just compare numbers from across the country, because I think ours are more pure. And I think those are the kinds of factors that the commissions here in the Southeast have taken into consideration when they have granted ROEs in the past. And of course, very few of our peers in fact one is building new nuclear at the same time we do which brings increased risk as well. So, those would be the primary factors that I would suggest differentiate us."

Let me just frame it by saying that the commission has a practice that they like to have any settlements presented to them at least a week before the beginning of the hearing. So that they have got ample time to consider this settlement when they are hearing the testimony from the various parties. So that essentially means we have got the next 2 weeks, this week, next week to try to work something out and we are trying. And I am encouraged by the party’s participation and I think everyone is serious about it. I don’t know that there are any other significant items that would have as large of an impact, particularly on earnings as would ROE. So, that’s certainly a significant item, but there are other items too. For example, we have got some deferred costs related to the scrubber that we installed at the Wateree Station, it was not completely in service at the time of our last increase about 2.5 years ago. So, we agreed to defer that until this time. So, one of the items that will be up for discussion is what amortization period do you collect that deferral over. So, there is differences in opinions over that and that will go into the judgment. That’s just an example."
