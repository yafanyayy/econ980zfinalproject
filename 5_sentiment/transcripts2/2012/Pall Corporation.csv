I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller.We'll review the quarter and our outlook. But before I'd with that, I'll provide my assessment of the company, generally",2987,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us. I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller.
We'll review the quarter and our outlook. But before I'd with that, I'll provide my assessment of the company, generally where we are and what we need to do after a couple of quarters of experience. I came to Pall to build a company that's among the most respected in the world. And we have the potential to achieve that level of performance and the respect that comes with it. I visited most of our facilities around the world and met with many employees of all levels and positions within the company. I've also got a lot of feedback from customers and suppliers. These meetings have reaffirmed my impressions of the company's opportunity. I see a very strong long-term value creation opportunity and I stress, I'd like you to think about it that way as well. We have a lot of organizations and operations, foundation work to do over the next couple of years, but we'll get there. We also are focusing on taking waste out of the system and improving our cost structure now, particularly given some of the market softness that we're seeing. The big picture, we serve highly attractive end markets, many with high barrier entry, 2/3 of the sales our consumables that are largely nondiscretionary purchases. Our applications expertise is second to none, as is our global sales channel, and we have a great balance sheet to fuel growth. Pall employees are highly committed to our success and hungry for change. All of these provides a great platform to build on. 
We're beginning to execute a more focused company-wide agenda around people, process and technology, and so a little bit on each of those 4 components. We changed our executive compensation plan, new metrics and key goals to align the top of the house with growing the company, improving our free cash generation, executing our focused agenda and driving total shareholder return. So better pay-per-performance system that we will cascade to the organization. We continue to deploy resources into higher growth markets, the increase in SG&A spend reflects this as we have the transitional overhang from making these investments, while we continue to execute on cost reduction efforts in lower growth markets. We've begun to implement organization and operational changes intended to improve our fixed cost structure and drive operational effectiveness. One that you may have seen in the release last night that impacts our external reporting is the alignment of Machinery & Equipment with Energy & Water under common management. These Pall markets with their connection to their infrastructure are among the early beneficiaries of economic developments around the world. A lot of their growth and market potential is in emerging markets. Also these businesses are all similar and that they are the most capital incentive product profiles that we sell. We believe that the combination will enhance our ability to accelerate our efforts to strengthen contract management, strategic pricing and to ensure that the consumable [indiscernible] pull-through potential does exist. So in other words, it's to improve our ability to sell and design systems that we can make money on and ensure that the follow-on consumable opportunity is real. 
In general, we have a lot of work to do to drive consistent operational execution, particularly in supply chain and manufacturing operations. We begun to add seasoned executives to the team to lead operations, strategic sourcing and IT. 
And now, moving on to process. We are very pleased that we have successfully, fully deployed our ERP system. The Americas, the last phase of our global initiative is now operational. It has been a major endeavor, and I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the tireless dedication that the core group has exhibited over the past several months to prepare and execute this critical step toward a global enterprises system. And we now have a global transactional system in place that can provide end-to-end visibility into the business. It will be a key enabler for moving forward with process improvements to achieve our Pall enterprise objectives. 
In technology, our team is making real strides toward improving product developments and the time-to-market new products. We still have a lot of work to do to improve our total product vitality but we are now on our way and you will hear more about this over time. And we closed on an acquisition last week at a small company that we have previously announced. ForteBio is a good strategic fit with technology that accelerates development and validation processes associated with biotech research. We welcome the ForteBio team to the Pall family. And we are implementing a corporate business development team with acquisition integration capability, which will enable future acquisitive growth. Our investments will be disciplined and thoughtful to enhance our organic profile. 
So the beginning of a focused corporate agenda is taking shape and we're making progress. As far that timeline to implement, we have with the number that in you or I would like. My thinking at this time, though is that we'll have our executive team fully in place 12 months from now, enabled by our global ERP system, our operations should be substantially better a year from now. We'll be able to lean out our operations and drive sustainable working capital improvement between now and then, but we should be able to accelerate from that point forward. We'll have our innovation capability to the point of improving the rate of new product vitality by the end of next year, that's the end of our fiscal year '13. And some high-level metrics that our senior team has now aligned to achieve, we should be able to significantly reduce our fixed cost structure based on the strategies that we're currently developing and implementing, and that's now. 
Once we've done this, we can leverage our new P&L profile. So assuming we grow 5% or better organically, we'll generate at least 35% incremental operating margin on that incremental revenue. That's the go-forward accretion. Our aspirational goal is 40% incremental margin. Within that equation, we will continue to invest to grow with our primary focus on technology and customer-facing resources. We're targeting the end of next year, that's 18 months from now, as a very major milestone for most all of the heavy structural action lifting to be behind us. 
So changing topics here and as far as other key items, before we move on to reviewing the performance of the quarter, we settled the outstanding class-action litigation from 2007 and with minimal future out-of-pocket expense and I refer you to the release for details. 
Now, let's look at the quarter, we'll talk about the business. Second quarter sales, and I'm on Slide 7, came in just under $700 million, good growth overall. Total sales grew just over 8%, with minimal impact from FX. Just like last quarter, business was 50-50 between Life Sciences and Industrial, and Life Science's sales increased 7%, excluding FX and Industrial grew more than 9%. 
Now if you flip to 8, [indiscernible] Slide 8 increased just over 3% in the quarter. Some of this is a difficult comp to 15% orders growth in the prior-year period. Some is also current timing but to be clear, some is the softening order environment in emerging markets and across Europe. And we saw the same trend in February. Life Science orders were up 2% in the quarter, Biopharm grew by 13%. However, Food & Beverage orders were down by almost 15%. Industrial orders were up 5%. The backlog, which is up 9% over last year, coupled with the moderating order patterns still supports our mid-single digit sales outlook for the full year. 
Now I'm moving on to Slide 9, and I'll walk through the markets, first with the ones that Life Sciences serves. And as I walk through these, I'll comment on both sales and orders. Biopharm at almost 29% of second quarter total sales continues to be the growth driver of our Life Science business. Although the business is not immune to economic conditions, we believe it will grow through a flat economy. Again, the equipment market is driven by global patient demand as the societies around the world adapt Western medicine, including drugs that are produced by way of the genetically engineered processes. And our filtration technology in associated systems enabled the industry for how it develops and produces a broader variety of biopharmaceuticals. Sales in Biopharm increased about 12%, excluding FX in the quarter. Sales in Europe, the largest part of the market for Pall where the drugs are produced for global consumption increased about 18%. Asia also grew by about 18%, as the industry takes root there. Consumables sales increased about 10% and represented over 90% of total Biopharm and system sales increased 47%. Second quarter orders remains strong as well, increasing 13%. 
Onto Slide 10 for Medical sales in Medical were down slightly, while orders decreased about 6%. Excellent sales growth in the blood markets, was offset by weak results in other key Medical markets, and hospital spend is under pressure in both North America and in Europe. We're especially feeling this in Europe where our Hospital business is larger, hospital sales were down over 10% in there. OEM sales were also down globally. There were several reasons for this. Some of the customers are working down inventory levels and we have at least one OEM that is still recovering from the Thai flood. And we had also some supplies challenges of our own that contributed to the sales results for the quarter. 
And switching to Slide 11, for Food & Bev, despite strong growth in the Americas, Food & Bev sales were up just 2%. This excludes FX. The result was impacted by divestiture of a non-strategic asset in Italy earlier this year. The effect on full year sales is $20 million and the impact to the second quarter was about 6% on the top line. We take out the divestiture, the underlying growth rate would have been almost 9%. Orders were down 15%. This reflects a large decrease in systems orders compared to last year when we saw an unusually high order commitment in the same period. And consumable orders were down 3% on an apples-to-apples basis. Orders were up 4.5% on that apples-to-apples basis. While the European economy isn't helping, Food & Beverage is holding up pretty well actually, largely with innovative products that increase output and lower production costs. Orders and sales both grew in February incidentally. In Process Technologies, sales for Process Technologies increased over 13% in the quarter. This was driven by double-digit growth in the Energy and the Machinery & Equipment markets. Municipal Water was down. Overall, orders in Process Technologies increased 4%, with the strongest growth in the water markets. Energy sales grew almost 21% and saw a good growth across the various markets we serve and that really drove the result were the natural gas and the refining markets. Sales were up sharply to these markets obviously reflecting the ongoing investments there in that space. 
And while Pall plays in all of the Energy applications that require filtration, we see growth slowing in the clean energy markets. Big new projects in the nuclear industry has slowed substantially following the Fukushima incident. But despite this, China, Russia and India, which represents half of all plant new capacity are now expected to proceed with their plans to build nuclear plants. And in the U.S., the NRC recently approved 2 new plants. 
Wind turbine production is down this year, with the loss of the federal subsidies and programs and that's similar case globally. China, in particular has cut production of wind turbines and there's also some consolidation among the turbine OEMs in the industry that's underway. 
Energy orders were up just over 2% with strong growth in MENA, offset by a double-digit in the Americas, including an unusually high order volume of systems last year in the quarter. So a tough comp in the Americas in Energy. Municipal Water sales were down almost 19%, while orders though were up 20%. With this growth, driven by the Americas, where it appears as though the capital spend cycle for water may have bottomed out and in fact, our backlog grew sequentially by about $8 million in the quarter. 
And finally, Machinery & Equipment, which accounts for over 20% of total sales had sales growth of 18%. The global mining industry has been a steady contributor to these results. Our filters are used in a variety of applications, including the mining equipment, as well as the in-water mine systems. Orders were up about 2% in the quarter, as we think we're beginning to see some push-outs from the European companies on capital projects. In Asia, our primary metals business is slowing consistent with what we're all reading. 
So turning now to Microelectronics, I'm at Slide 13. We're down 5% and sales reflect continued weakness in various parts of the market. Fab utilization rates remain low for most of the chip producers and the display market is operating under capacity. The capital equipment and tool producers are forecast to earnings slow for at least the several months. And Thailand, the source of about 1/4 of the global hard drive output as you know. Full recovery of production there is still anticipated to be at least a few months from now. 
Despite all of the above, general conditions included Q2 orders grew about 2%. This was driven by a several week burst in demand from U.S. OEMs for tools at the end of the calendar year, and we don't see this as a sustainable trend for the rest of our fiscal year. 
I'm on the 14th for Aerospace. Our Aerospace business is split evenly between commercial and Military. In total, sales were up 16%, excluding FX. Commercial Aerospace sales were flat, while Military Aerospace sales increased over 31%. Commercial Aerospace was impacted by program delays and additionally, we continue to put some low-margin business there. However, commercial jet orders were strong for both aftermarket and the regional jet new equipment market. 
The Military orders and sales were driven by our Centrisep air cleaners for helicopters and our backlog remains very healthy at over $100 million. So that's a run through of our markets and how they stack up. I'm now going to take a look at it regionally. If you turn to Slide 15. I embedded some of the geographic comments in the segment performances that I just walk through, but there are some counterintuitive components as how we performed by geography worth noting. Some of them are again quarter comp issues, others are though more indicative of anticipated trends. 
Sales in the Americas were up slightly compared to more than 27% growth in the comparable quarter last year. Results were mixed by markets, Food & Bev fueled had a great markets, fueled by new accounts and Latin American growth. Muni Water shipments were weighed down on the quarter, again this is largely an issue of timing and again our Military sales in the U.S. have been strong this year as I just mentioned. Worth noting, all in, sales in Latin America, while still relatively small increased 40%. Europe grew almost 50%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth there. And sales in mature European countries grew over 10%, while the emerging markets at Eastern Europe and MENA grew about 37%. Performance in Northern Europe was reasonably strong and again, driven by Biopharm, which accounts for about 1/3 of our European sales. Southern Europe was weak with hospital and just about all forms of capital spending down. And we expect that the broader economic impact throughout the Eurozone will provide a tougher growth environment though going forward. The instability of Europe presents another challenge and Lisa is going to address this in her remarks here in a minute. 
Sales in Asia increased almost 8%, but we're seeing signs of slowing at China, with delays in expected orders and talk of changing Central government priorities associated with the infrastructure investment. Demand for steel is decreasing. Both Thailand and Japan are still recovering, but sales in Australia and Korea were very robust. Australia is experiencing ongoing demand in the mining industry and Korea is investing to expand domestic refinery output. In addition, it's [indiscernible] you know that many of the global engineering firms that are strong participants in the oil and gas expansion across the world. 
So we said from the outset of the year that we would be counting on emerging regions to drive much of our growth this year and we are living up to that expectations. Sales into emerging Asia and Europe, MENA and Latin America increased over 20% in the quarter and for a broader prospective, sales for the 6 months are up 29%. Emerging markets now represent about 20% of the company sales, up from 17% last year. And mature markets sales grew about 5.5% in the quarter and about 6% for the year. 
In a given quarter, our organic orders resulted typically impacted by lumpy large programs as you know and that's the case for comps this quarter, as I said. I think that, that bigger picture theme for us for the first half of the year is what we anticipate to play out through the remainder of the year. The better global growth opportunities will be in Energy, production and in the Energy distribution, the continued infrastructure buildout but less so in China. And from the large molecule that is the biopharmaceutical drug production and we also expect that some of the process technology markets will remain strong, too. 
So that's it for my introductory remarks. I'm now going to turn it over to Lisa, and I'll pick up there again."
185333,171107495,272222,"Pall Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Mar 08, 2012",2012-03-08,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Larry. Good morning, everyone. I'm starting on slide 17. So Larry has talked about top line performance. I'm going to review the performance of each business segment and 3 key areas: Gross margin, SG&A spend and operating margin. And I'm starting",1532,"Thanks, Larry. Good morning, everyone. I'm starting on slide 17. So Larry has talked about top line performance. I'm going to review the performance of each business segment and 3 key areas: Gross margin, SG&A spend and operating margin. And I'm starting with Pall Industrial. So when we look at Industrial top line performance, we would have expected an improvement of at least 150 bps, with incremental gross margin in this business of just under 60%. Versus the decline of 40 bps, this is almost a 200-basis point delta. The 3 key bridge items are one, unfavorable mix reduced margins by about 170 bps, namely from the decreased sales in Microelectronics, similar to what we saw in the first quarter; second, overhead absorption reduced margin by about another 70 bps, again mainly from volume decline in Microelectronics, as well as inventory reductions reflected in an improvement in Industrial's days and inventories, which improved about 13%, 123 days from 139 days in second quarter of last year; and third, there were a number of other factors that contributed to partly offset some of this headwind but the most notable was an uptick in price, as well as continuous improvement savings which overcame inflation. Despite the 2.5% sequential decline in sales, we did see gross margins in the quarter improved sequentially by 210 basis points to 47.1% and this was due to better mix, pricing and execution. 
Turning to SG&A. This increased about $8.7 million or 9.5%, excluding FX in the quarter. Selling expenses, which were 17.6% of sales increased about 4.5%. And this increase was driven by, as Larry mentioned earlier, by resource deployment into emerging regions. Now G&A, which was about 12% of sales increased about 19%. This also reflect related infrastructure build for emerging countries, and this includes our Brazilian acquisition, as well as cost to bring Pall Industrial into our European and Asian hub structure. In addition, this reflects project-related costs that both Life Sciences and Industrial share in such as our IT and project in our regional back-office consolidation. 
So as Larry mentioned, we completed the America's ERP conversion, essentially the last leg of the core implementation. Earlier in the year, we moved from the build phase, which is considered CapEx now to data conversion, migration, training and local support, all of which is reflected in the P&L as period costs. This costs will continue to put pressure on incremental margin in the third quarter however, the incremental costs have already been considered in our EPS. So that said, in addition to the benefits this investment has enabled by way of our regional hubs, this tool is that key enabler for many of our operating efficiency plans and PES. The post-implementation phase is where we will begin to see operating benefits reflected in our back-office function and this begins largely in fiscal year 2013. 
Segment profit was $52 million and generated margin of 15.4%, flat to last year. And this translated to incremental margins of 13%, excluding FX. Not the operating leverage we want, but it reflects the earnings we just discussed. As we mentioned last quarter, we are executing several restructuring initiatives to improve the Industrial segments leverage, the most significant of them include realigning sales and marketing management in Aeropower and Energy & Water as Larry mentioned, reorganizing the global management structure that supports the company's systems product line and shipping resources from mature to emerging regions. And we do expect to see improved incremental margins in the second half as the cost reduction, which will be principally in SG&A from these Industrial restructuring activities to take hold. 
I'm going to switch now from Life Sciences and I'm on Slide 18. Life Sciences gross margins increased 60 basis points to 55.9%. And this reflects what we see as an appropriate entitlement given the businesses 60-plus percent incremental gross margins. However, the benefits [indiscernible] and cost saves were partly offset by some mixed headwinds. SG&A increased about $8.7 million or 10%, excluding FX in the quarter. Selling expenses, which were 16.1% of sales increased about 5%, as with Industrial, this increase was driven by resource deployment into emerging regions, as well as some increased staffing in Life Sciences in the second half of last year. And G&A, which represents 11% of sales, was up 18% and this reflects the items I discussed a moment ago in the Industrial review, as well as some costs related to the acquisition of ForteBio. 
The segment profit came in at close to $89 million or a 5% increase again, excluding FX. Segment margin declined 20 basis points to 24.8%. We achieved 19% incremental margin in the quarter on top line growth of 7%, again both excluding FX, well below where we should and will get to with Life Sciences. 
So recapping, operating margin was 17.7%, slightly below the second quarter of last year with pressure from the heavy lifting and spending activities I just described. We achieved overall incremental margin of about 15%, excluding FX. And our minimum target for incremental margin in our current state is 25%, and we do expect to achieve a range of 25% to 30% for the full year as the euro remains in its current range of 131 to 133 to a dollar. 
Let's talk about our P&L risk relative do fluctuations in the euro, and I'm on slide 20. In addition to the impact to reported results from the translation of foreign currency denominated financial results from our foreign subsidiaries or what we call, translational impact and what I've been referring when it talk about excluding FX so far this morning, we also have risks from the impacts to gross margins as the cost of product fluctuates from sourcing them outside of one global currency, what we call transactional impact. So as we all know, the euro is blazing its own trail given the sovereign debt crisis even related to the neighboring European countries. And much of our manufacturing footprint rationalization has been in the Eurozone. So as the euro weakens, it puts pressure on gross margins as the economic cost of that inventory [indiscernible]. So at the bid of their, we have seen the euro to the dollar go from 127 or about a 6% reduction and about 0.83 to the British pound. And sales into the Eurozone comprise about 25% of total Pall sales as many of you know. About 80% of that has denominated in British pounds or U.S. dollars. And with this math, we estimate that a 5% movement of the euro, positive or negative, represents a change in gross margin of about 50 basis points on average. 
Our initial full year outlook contemplated that the euro would be at about 135 to the U.S. dollar and about 0.86 for the British pound. Assuming that the euro now stays in its current range i.e. 131 to 133 to the dollar and about 0.83 to the pound and that pound and dollar move somewhat in tandem, we estimate that we have second half gross profit headwind of about $3.5 million to $6.5 million compared to our original outlook. Year-over-year, this created delta in the second half gross profit of about $5 million or $0.03 in earnings per share. So to be clear, this would represent $0.02 to $0.04 of transactional impact against our original outlook for the second half. In addition, we estimate that translational impact to be about another $0.02 headwind in the second half against the original outlook for a combined impact of $0.04 to $0.06. 
Now looking at income taxes. The effective tax rate was 24.6% for the quarter compared 27.2% last year. This reflects the tax benefits associated with the establishment of our Asian hub this year and the expansion, particularly with respect to Pall Industrial of our European hub. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 0122 to be consistent with our original outlook. 
And wrapping up the discussion about our P&L, net earnings were $84.7 million of $0.72 per share. And this compares to $75.7 million or $0.64 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share, as defined in the Appendix slides, were $0.76 compared to $0.68 last year, an increase of almost 12%. Now bridging this increase, foreign currency translation increased EPS by about $0.01 in the quarter, the tax rate contributed about $0.02 and underlying growth added about $0.05 or 7.5%. 
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the 6 months was $204 million. This 31% increase or about $48 million was primarily, driven by continued improvement in working capital management. Committed capital has continued to dampen free cash flow generation improvement in capital management as an ongoing priority. We increased our quarterly dividend by 20% from $0.175 to $0.21 per share effective with the dividend declared on January 19, 2012. And our buyback authorization remains at $453 million. Now our cash position stood at $528 million at the end of the quarter and our net debt-to-net debt equity was 6.3% compared to 9.1% at year-end, as we have used excess cash to pay down debt. 
That concludes my report this morning. I will now turn this back to Larry."

Clearly the macro situation presents some risk to the top line. We expect second half sales growth to slow, reflecting slower macro trends in Europe and some in emerging Asia. We also anticipate tough mix in Industrial for the remainder of the year. The instability of the euro could further impact results as well, as Lisa just walked through. We're stepping up our costs in productivity initiatives. We should be able to offset known market softening in the mix impact to deliver continued reasonable earnings performance. And with the assumptions of a macro market, particularly the European economy and the currency impact, we believe that the bottom end of our guided range is achievable and that our task is to deliver the previously stated midpoint of 320 or better. 
So with that in mind, we'll turn it over to the operator and take your questions."

And if that business continues to show remarkable growth, just there was a bit lumpy but you guys have been putting out really good gross for a while. So can you just maybe described the your comfort with the sustainability of that growth or the visibility of that growth? And maybe are there share dynamics going on there?"

We are very close to the customer base and the rate of which they consume filters one a drug is in production is reasonably reasonable. What [indiscernible] rate at which is there rate at, which the redeployed the new drug and that can vary versus our expectations. And given some of the lab activity upstream, which is influenced by a variety of other associated spend dynamics, that can vary a fair amount. But the bottom line is once it gets to biological production, as long as we understand their relative inventory position and something like an FDA issue doesn't get in their way, we can reasonably predict how well they're going to do. Given all that, I think we feel pretty good about the market. It is going to moderate a bit from where it's been over the last 12 months, and we've got that factored into our thinking. Relative to what's going on in terms of share comment and I assume you may now or share versus customers share, we're pretty good shape. We have a couple of pretty decent competitors, but we think that we're growing with the market at this point, and our opportunity is to grow better than the market. And that comes back to the equation that you've heard us before about the get it systems installed and to realize that consumable pull-through. One of the things that maybe beyond our share that does pertain to this market dynamic, is where our customers either gain or lose share and given product areas. And that can have a fairly large impact as you can guess in terms of where their capability may either date route into a new country as planned or not or where they may run into a regulatory hiccup at points along the way or not. And there have that has impacted us over time and that probably will is will. There's not much we can to control that. So all I guess in summary, that the market is healthy for sure.

So as I was listening to myself and talk and Lisa talk slightly confusing in how we portray the incremental margin comments. The bottom line is this, the company has not generated consistent profitable growth, appropriately operationally leveraged growth, for a very long period of time. And Lisa and I and the senior team in total are working to get to a P&L structure that is appropriately profiled, that means the right fixed cost structure with the right management organizational structure such that when we grow at least at a reasonable organic rate that we could leverage that us P&L the appropriate profile should right up the bottom line. So the 35% to 40% incremental margin range that we talked about is a pretax number. That's the incremental operating margin on the incremental organic sales. And just to be clear, what Lisa was talking about and expanding in the quarter was talking first about the gross margin dynamics for the quarter year-over-year and her 60% incremental margin comments where it pertains to the gross margin line. So as we all know, the objective here is to leverage primarily the fixed cost structure in SG&A, but we also believe we've got an opportunity to leverage our indirect fixed cost structure in operations. As an example, as I've now been around the world, we have a very different ratio of indirect to direct costs in our various manufacturing operations. Some of that driven by a profile of individual operation but some of it's also because we have got into a level of operating proficiencies in some facilities versus others through lean organization gets to an aggressive direct versus indirect labor ratio. So we got work to do there and that's all within the equation of how we get to 35% and 40% incremental margins and generate those on a pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter certainly full year basis. Now back to your question about how long it would take. The reality is to get our P&L to the right profile, to get at the cost structure and to do it in a way that we can then live with and grow from and frankly still invest to grow within. That full process, all that have lifting, I think is going to take 18 months and that means we look a little different 18 months from now. In that period of time, we're already incrementally taking appropriate waste reduction actions, if you will, cost actions that we talked about earlier in the year, which we're starting to see some of the benefits this year from some of the restructuring actions that we announced at the beginning of the fiscal year. And so on the back half of this year, albeit on a little bit lower organic growth, you'll start to see evidence of the fact that we can get it done. And I think we'll be able to talk in the back half of the year about the fact that we're starting to see the light, frankly, towards good incremental operating margins based on the performance. And again, I may be muted from a total bottom line performance by the things that we talked without about, FX and mix and things of the sort. But in terms of true operating leverage, certainly with our ability to get to the kind of equation that I described."

We want to make sure that the consumable profile is appropriate, as I said in my prepared remarks. So number one, it's the right people who understand how to sell and design systems and how to make sure that the we're capturing all the value that we should on the front end of the system sale. And two, frankly only participating where there's a good consumable ratio going forward. And so we're underway with that. We still got work to do. And the announcement that was on the release that we talk a little bit about last night is a piece of that. There's some more work to do. And we don't expect that all system sales are going to be certainly neutral, certainly not accretive to the rates but we want to make sure that they're the appropriate profile for us to generate that downstream consumables stream. In terms of bigger picture though, with regards to how we go-to-market, I think we've got a great, sales organization. I think we've got an outstanding applications capability around the world. I think that we have, while it be it an expensive one 1, one that no one out there can replicate and many have tried, we've got an organization that's got the local capability to validate existing installations of filters to test new products, to work directly with customers by way of local lab expertise. We've got the people around the world already, and including much of the investment we need in the emerging markets to get this done. So I think that's frankly going to continue to serve as well, and there's not a major structural change that's required. As far as the direct versus distribution thinking, we have been moving frankly to more direct model globally. We will continue to partner with those people in the North American market, being selectively [indiscernible] who really we need to add value, moving both technical and commercial capability, as well as consumers relationship value. But generally speaking, globally, the direct organization structure that we've been underway with for some time is the one that we'll continue to execute. We, I think, have a business model that serves a particular business profile and market profile, if you will, really well. We are different than just about all of the Industrial peers. And that's good because we like to go after the relatively low volume really high mix, really tough to do stuff. I think the challenge is going to be to apply some of the almost lean-like thinking to how we do it more cost-effectively and really measure our ability to do it over time, particularly in the very high mix portion of the Industrial market segments set that we serve. But anyway. Bottom line, I think we've got the front end of the company. We've got a great technical skill set in place to serve the difficult applications that exists in the world we play. And the reality is that we aren't in anyway going to radically change that. We're just going to figure out how we can get more effective and efficient within the general strategy."

So we're not in a position yet and frankly, we're in a less of a position now than I thought we were a quarter or go to go out and bring in acquisitions. Now all that said, just like ForteBio, which we think is going to be a fantastic addition to the company bolt-on, as you describe them, good leadership, which we think we absolutely does the case in ForteBio, that are capable of actually assisting us with our ability to tackle some of our core challenges, we'll continue to look at this, and we are. And those need to be somewhat self-sufficient. We do not have the operations or integration skill set in-house at this point. And we need to build it in. And that's going to take that 12-month period of time kind in the kind of timeline comment that I made. So the balance sheet question really pertains more to our ability to acquire and integrate versus desire. And at this point, I think over the next 12 months, you'll see us continuing to improve our free cash capability. Obviously, we'll get to a reasonably rich balance sheet position and it'll set us up nicely for then what will be our ability to, I think, get more aggressive in terms of acquisitive activity.

I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller.We'll review the quarter and our outlook, but before I do that, I'll provide my assessment of the company, generally wher",3006,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us. I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller.
We'll review the quarter and our outlook, but before I do that, I'll provide my assessment of the company, generally where we are and what we need to do after a couple of quarters of experience. I came to Pall to build a company that's among the most respected in the world, and we have the potential to achieve that level of performance and the respect that comes with it. I visited most of our facilities around the world and met with many employees at all levels and positions within the company. I've also gotten lots of feedback from customers and suppliers. These meetings have reaffirmed my impressions of the company's opportunity. I see a very strong long-term value creation opportunity, and I stress, I'd like you to think about it that way as well. We have a lot of organization and operations foundation work to do over the next couple of years, but we'll get there. We also are focusing on taking waste out of the system and improving our cost structure now, particularly given some of the market softness that we're seeing. The big picture, we serve highly attractive end markets, many with high barriers to entry. 2/3 of the sales are consumables that are largely nondiscretionary purchases. Our applications expertise is second to none, as is our global sales channel, and we have a great balance sheet to fuel growth. Pall employees are highly committed to our success and hungry for change. All of these provides a great platform to build on.
We're beginning to execute a more focused company-wide agenda around people, process and technology. And so a little bit on each of those core components. We've changed our executive compensation plan, new metrics and key goals to align the top of the house with growing the company, improving our free cash generation, executing our focused agenda and driving total shareholder return. So a better pay-per-performance system that we will cascade to the organization. We continue to deploy resources into higher growth markets. The increase in SG&A spend reflects this, as we have the transitional overhang from making these investments, while we continue to execute on cost reduction efforts in lower growth markets. We've begun to implement organization and operational changes intended to improve our fixed cost structure and drive operational effectiveness. One that you may have seen in the release last night that impacts our external reporting is the alignment of Machinery & Equipment with Energy & Water under common management. These Pall markets with their connection to their infrastructure are among the early beneficiaries of economic developments around the world. A lot of their growth and market potential is in emerging markets. Also, these businesses are all similar and that they are the most capital-intensive product profiles that we sell. We believe that the combination will enhance our ability to accelerate our efforts to strengthen contract management, strategic pricing and to ensure that the consumable annuity pull-through potential does exist. So in other words, it's to improve our ability to sell and design systems that we can make money on and ensure that the follow-on consumable opportunity is real.
In general, we have a lot of work to do to drive consistent operational execution, particularly in supply chain and manufacturing operations. We've begun to add seasoned executives to the team to lead operations, strategic sourcing and IT.
And now moving on to process. We are very pleased that we have successfully fully deployed our ERP system. The Americas, the last phase of our global initiative, is now operational. It has been a major endeavor, and I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the tireless dedication that the core group has exhibited over the past several months to prepare and execute this critical step toward a global enterprise system. And we now have a global transactional system in place that can provide end-to-end visibility into the business. It will be a key enabler for moving forward with process improvements to achieve our Pall enterprise objectives.
In technology, our team is making real strides toward improving product developments and the time to market for new products. We still have a lot of work to do to improve our total product vitality, but we are now on our way, and you will hear more about this over time. And we closed on an acquisition last week of a small company that we have previously announced. ForteBio is a good strategic fit with technology that accelerates development and validation processes associated with biotech research. We welcome the ForteBio team to the Pall family. And we are implementing a corporate business development team with acquisition-integration capability, which will enable future acquisitive growth. Our investments will be disciplined and thoughtful to enhance our organic profile.
So the beginning of a focused corporate agenda is taking shape,, and we're making progress. As far that timeline to implement, the somewhat flipping answer would be longer than you or I would like. My thinking at this time, though, is that we'll have our executive team fully in place 12 months from now. Enabled by our global ERP system, our operations should be substantially better a year from now. We'll be able to lean out our operations and drive sustainable working capital improvement between now and then, but we should be able to accelerate from that point forward. We'll have our innovation capability to the point of improving the rate of new product vitality by the end of next year. That's the end of our fiscal year '13. And some high-level metrics that our senior team has now aligned to achieve, we should be able to significantly reduce our fixed cost structure based on the strategies that we're currently developing and implementing, and that's now.
Once we've done this, we can leverage our new P&L profile. So assuming we grow 5% or better organically, we'll generate at least 35% incremental operating margin on that incremental revenue. That's the go-forward equation. And our aspirational goal is 40% incremental margin. Within that equation, we will continue to invest to grow, with our primary focus on technology and customer-facing resources. We're targeting the end of next year -- that's 18 months from now -- as a very major milestone for most all of the heavy structural action lifting to be behind us.
So changing topics here and as far as other key items, before we move on to reviewing the performance in the quarter, we settled the outstanding class-action litigation from 2007 and with minimal future out-of-pocket expense, and I'd refer you to the release for details.
Now let's look at the quarter, and we'll talk about the business. Second quarter sales -- and I'm on Slide 7 -- came in just under $700 million, good growth overall. Total sales grew just over 8%, with minimal impact from FX. Just like last quarter, business was split about 50-50 between Life Science and Industrial. And Life Sciences sales increased 7% excluding FX, and Industrial grew more than 9%.
Now if you flip to 8, there on Slide 8, increased just over 3% in the quarter. Some of this is a difficult comp to 15% orders growth in the prior year period. Some is also current timing but to be clear, some is the softening order environment in emerging markets and across Europe. And then we saw the same trend in February. Life Science orders were up 2% in the quarter. BioPharm grew by 13%. However, Food & Beverage orders were down by almost 15%. Industrial orders were up 5%. The backlog, which is up 9% over last year, coupled with the moderating orders patterns still supports our mid-single-digit sales outlook for the full year.
Now I'm moving on to Slide 9, and I'll walk through the markets, first, with the ones that Life Sciences serves. And as I walk through these, I'll comment on both sales and orders. BioPharm at almost 29% of second quarter total sales continues to be the growth driver of our Life Science business. Although the business is not immune to economic conditions, we believe it will grow through a flat economy. Again, the equipment market is driven by global patient demand, as the societies around the world adapt western medicine, including drugs that are produced by way of the genetically engineered processes. And our filtration technology and associated systems enable the industry for how it develops and produces a broader variety of biopharmaceuticals. Sales in BioPharm increased about 12%, excluding FX in the quarter. Sales in Europe, the largest part of the market for Pall where the drugs are produced for global consumption, increased about 18%. Asia also grew by about 18%, as the industry takes root there. Consumables sales increased about 10% and represented over 90% of total BioPharm, and system sales increased 47%. Second quarter orders remain strong as well, increasing 13%.
Onto Slide 10 for medical sales in Medical were down slightly, while orders decreased about 6%. Excellent sales growth in the blood markets was offset by weak results in other key medical markets. Hospital spend is under pressure in both North America and in Europe. We're especially feeling this in Europe where our hospital business is larger. Hospital sales were down over 10% there. OEM sales were also down globally. There were several reasons for this. Some of the customers are working down inventory levels, and we have at least one OEM that is still recovering from the Thai flood. And we had also some supply challenges of our own that contributed to the sales results for the quarter.
And switching to Slide 11. For Food & Bev, despite strong growth in the Americas, Food & Bev sales were up just 2%. This excludes FX. The result was impacted by a divestiture of a nonstrategic asset in Italy earlier this year. The effect on full year sales is $20 million, and the impact to the second quarter was about 6% on the top line. If we take out the divestiture, the underlying growth rate would have been almost 9%. Orders were down 15%. This reflects a large decrease in systems orders compared to last year when we saw an unusually high order commitment in the same period. Consumable orders were down 3% on an apples-to-apples basis. Orders were up 4.5% on that apples-to-apples basis. While the European economy isn't helping, Food & Beverage is holding up pretty well actually, largely with innovative products that increase output and lower production costs. Orders and sales both grew in February incidentally.
In Process Technologies, sales for Process Technologies increased over 13% in the quarter. This was driven by double-digit growth in the Energy and the Machinery & Equipment markets. Municipal Water was down. Overall orders in Process Technologies increased 4%, with the strongest growth in the water markets. Energy sales grew almost 21%. We saw a good growth across the various markets we serve, and the 2 that really drove the result were the natural gas and the refining markets. Sales were up sharply to these markets, obviously, reflecting the ongoing investments there in the space.
And while Pall plays in all of the Energy applications that require filtration, we see growth slowing in the clean energy markets. Big new projects in the nuclear industry has slowed substantially following the Fukushima incident. But despite this, China, Russia and India, which represent half of all plant new capacity, are now expected to proceed with their plans to build nuclear plants. And in the U.S., the NRC recently approved 2 new plants.
Wind turbine production is down this year, with the loss of the federal subsidies and programs and that's the similar case globally. China, in particular, has cut production of wind turbines, and there's also some consolidation among the turbine OEMs in the industry that's underway.
Energy orders were up just over 2%, with strong growth in MENA offset by a double-digit decline in the Americas, including an unusually high order volume of systems last year in the quarter, so a tough comp in the Americas in Energy. Municipal Water sales were down almost 19%, while orders, though, were up 20%. With this growth, driven by the Americas, where it appears as though the capital spend cycle for water may have bottomed out and in fact, our backlog grew sequentially by about $8 million in the quarter.
And finally, Machinery & Equipment, which accounts for over 20% of total sales, had sales growth of 18%. The global mining industry has been a steady contributor to these results. Our filters are used in a variety of the applications, including the mining equipment as well as the in-water mine systems. Orders were up about 2% in the quarter, as we think we're beginning to see some pushouts from the European companies on capital projects. In Asia, our primary metals business is slowing, consistent with what we're all reading.
So turning now to Microelectronics. I'm at Slide 13. We're down 5%, and sales reflect continued weakness in various parts of the market. Fab utilization rates remain low for most of the chip producers, and the display market is operating under capacity. The capital equipment and tool producers are forecast to running slow for at least the next several months. And Thailand is the source of about 1/4 of the global hard drive output as you know. Full recovery of production there is still anticipated to be at least a few months from now.
Despite all the above, general conditions included, Q2 orders grew about 2%. This was driven by a several week burst in demand from U.S. OEMs for tools at the end of the calendar year, and we don't see this as a sustainable trend for the rest of our fiscal year.
I'm on the 14 for Aerospace. Our Aerospace business is split evenly between Commercial and Military. In total, sales were up 16%, excluding FX. Commercial Aerospace sales were flat, while Military Aerospace sales increased over 31%. Commercial Aerospace was impacted by program delays, and additionally, we continue to prune some low-margin business there. However, commercial jet orders were strong for both aftermarket and the regional jet new equipment market.
The Military orders and sales were driven by our Centrisep air cleaners for helicopters, and our backlog remains very healthy at over $100 million. So that's a run-through of our markets and how they stacked up. I'm now going to take a look at it regionally. If you turn to Slide 15. I embedded some of the geographic comments in the segment performance that I've just walked through, but there are some counterintuitive components to how we performed by geography, worth noting. Some of them are, again, quarter comp issues. Others are though more indicative of anticipated trends.
Sales in the Americas were up slightly compared to more than 27% growth in the comparable quarter last year. Results were mixed by markets. Food & Bev had a great quarter fueled by new accounts, new products and Latin American growth. Muni Water shipments were way down on the quarter. Again, this is largely an issue of timing. And again, our Military sales in the U.S. have been strong this year as I just mentioned. Worth noting, all in, sales in Latin America, while still relatively small, increased 40%. Europe grew almost 50%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth there, and sales in mature European countries grew over 10%, while the emerging markets at Eastern Europe and MENA grew about 37%. Performance in Northern Europe was reasonably strong and again, driven by BioPharm, which accounts for about 1/3 of our European sales. Southern Europe was weak with hospital and just about all forms of capital spending down. And we expect that the broader economic impact throughout the Eurozone will provide a tougher growth environment though going forward. The instability of the euro presents another challenge, and Lisa is going to address this in her remarks here in a minute.
Sales in Asia increased almost 8%, but we're seeing signs of slowing in China, with delays in expected orders and talk of changing central government priorities associated with the infrastructure investment. Demand for steel is decreasing. Both Thailand and Japan are still recovering, but sales in Australia and Korea were very robust. Australia is experiencing ongoing demand in the mining industry, and Korea is investing to expand domestic refinery output. In addition, it's home, as you know, to many of the global engineering firms that are strong participants in the oil and gas expansion across the world.
So we said from the outset of the year that we would be counting on emerging regions to drive much of our growth this year, and they're living up to that expectation. Sales into emerging Asia and Europe, MENA and Latin America increased over 20% in the quarter, and for a broader prospective, sales for the 6 months are up 29%. Emerging markets now represent about 20% of the company sales, up from 17% last year. Mature markets sales grew about 5.5% in the quarter and about 6% for the year.
In a given quarter, our organic orders result is typically impacted by lumpy large programs as you know, and that's the case for comps this quarter as I said. I think that the bigger picture theme for us for the first half of the year is what we anticipate to play out through the remainder of the year. The better global growth opportunities will be in energy production and in the energy distribution, the continued infrastructure buildout but less so in China and from the large molecule that is the biopharmaceutical drug production. And we also expect that some of the process technology markets will remain strong, too.
So that's it for my introductory remarks. I'm now going to turn it over to Lisa, and I'll pick up there again."
185333,171107495,272462,"Pall Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Mar 08, 2012",2012-03-08,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Larry. Good morning, everyone. I'm starting on Slide 17. So Larry has talked about top line performance. I'm going to review the performance of each business segment and 3 key areas: gross margin, SG&A spend and operating margin. And I'm starting",1540,"Thanks, Larry. Good morning, everyone. I'm starting on Slide 17. So Larry has talked about top line performance. I'm going to review the performance of each business segment and 3 key areas: gross margin, SG&A spend and operating margin. And I'm starting with Pall Industrial. So when we look at Industrial top line performance, we would have expected an improvement of at least 150 bps, with incremental gross margin in this business of just under 60%. Versus the decline of 40 bps, this is almost a 200-basis-point delta. The 3 key bridge items are one, unfavorable mix reduced margins by about 170 bps, mainly from the decreased sales in Microelectronics, similar to what we saw in the first quarter. Second, overhead absorption reduced margins by about another 70 bps, again, mainly from volume decline in Microelectronics, as well as inventory reductions reflected in an improvement in Industrial's days and inventories, which improved about 13%, 123 days from 139 days in second quarter of last year; and third, there were a number of other factors that contributed to partly offset some of this headwind, but the most notable was an uptick in price as well as continuous improvement savings, which overcame inflation. So despite a 2.5% sequential decline in sales, we did see gross margins in the quarter improve sequentially by 210 basis points to 47.1%. This was due to better mix, pricing and execution.
Turning to SG&A. This increased about $8.7 million or 9.5%, excluding FX in the quarter. Selling expenses, which were 17.6% of sales, increased about 4.5%. And this increase was driven, as Larry mentioned earlier, by resource deployment into emerging regions. G&A, which was about 12% of sales, increased about 19%, so this also reflects related infrastructure builds for emerging countries, and this includes our Brazilian acquisition, as well as cost to bring Pall Industrial into our European and Asian hub structure. In addition, this reflects project-related costs that both Life Sciences and Industrial share in such as our IT and projects and our regional back-office consolidation.
So as Larry mentioned, we completed the Americas ERP conversion, essentially the last leg of the core implementation. Earlier in the year, we moved from the build phase, which is considered CapEx, now to data conversion, migration, training and local support, all of which is reflected in the P&L as period costs. These costs will continue to put pressure on incremental margin through the third quarter. However, the incremental costs have already been considered in our EPS. So that said, in addition to the benefits this investment has enabled by way of our regional hubs, this tool is a key enabler for many of our operating efficiency plans and PES. The post-implementation phase is where we will begin to see operating benefits reflected in our back-office function, and this begins largely in fiscal year 2013.
Segment profit was $52 million and generated margin of 15.4%, flat to last year. And this translated to incremental margins of 13%, excluding FX. Not the operating leverage we want, but it reflects the items we just discussed.
As we mentioned last quarter, we are executing several restructuring initiatives to improve the Industrial segment's leverage. The most significant of them include realigning sales and marketing management in Aeropower and Energy & Water as Larry mentioned, reorganizing the global management structure that supports the company's systems product line and shifting resources from mature to emerging regions. And we do expect to see improved incremental margins in the second half as the cost reduction, which will be principally in SG&A from these industrial restructuring activities, take hold.
I'm going to switch now from Life Sciences, and I'm on Slide 18. Life Sciences gross margins increased 60 basis points to 55.9%, and this reflects what we see as an appropriate entitlement given the business' 60-plus percent incremental gross margins. However, the benefits of pricing and manufacturing cost saves were partly offset by some mixed headwinds. SG&A increased about $8.7 million or 10%, excluding FX in the quarter. Selling expenses, which were 16.1% of sales increased about 5%. As with Industrial, this increase was driven by resource deployment into emerging regions, as well as some increased staffing in Life Sciences in the second half of last year. And G&A, which represents 11% of sales, was up 18%, and this reflects the items I discussed a moment ago in the Industrial review, as well as some costs related to the acquisition of ForteBio.
So segment profit came in at close to $89 million or a 5% increase, again, excluding FX. Segment margin declined 20 basis points to 24.8%. We achieved 19% incremental margin in the quarter on top line growth of 7%, again, both excluding FX, well below where we should and will get to with Life Sciences.
So recapping, operating margin was 17.7%, slightly below the second quarter of last year with pressure from the heavy lifting and spending activities I just described. We achieved overall incremental margin of about 15%, excluding FX. And our minimum target for incremental margin in our current state is 25%, and we do expect to achieve a range of 25% to 30% for the full year, as the euro remains in its current range of $1.31 to $1.33 to dollar.
So let's talk about our P&L risk relative to fluctuations in the euro, and I'm on slide 20. In addition to the impact to reported results from the translation of foreign currency denominated financial results from our foreign subsidiaries or what we call translational impact and what I've been referring when I talk about excluding FX so far this morning, we also have risks from the impact to gross margin as the cost of products fluctuate from sourcing them outside of one global currency, what we call transactional impact. So as we all know, the euro is blazing its own trail given the sovereign debt crisis even relative to the neighboring European countries. And much of our manufacturing footprint rationalization has been in the Eurozone. So as the euro weakens, this puts pressure on gross margins, as the economic cost of that inventory inflates. So as the beginning of the year, we have seen the euro to the dollar go as low as 1.27 or about a 6% reduction and about 0.83 to the British pound. And our sales into the Eurozone comprise about 25% of total Pall sales as many of you know. About 80% of that is denominated in British pounds or U.S. dollars. And with this math, we estimate that a 5% movement of the euro, positive or negative, represents a change in gross margin of about 50 basis points on average.
Our initial full year outlook contemplated that the euro would be at about $1.35 to the U.S. dollar and about 0.86 for the British pound. Assuming that the euro now stays in its current range, i.e. $1.31 to $1.33 to the dollar and about 0.83 to the pound and that the pound and dollar move somewhat in tandem, we estimate that we have second half gross profit headwind of about $3.5 million to $6.5 million compared to our original outlook. Year-over-year, this creates a delta in second half gross profit of about $5 million or $0.03 in earnings per share. So to be clear, this would represent $0.02 to $0.04 of transactional impact against our original outlook for the second half. In addition, we estimate that translational impact to be about another $0.02 headwind in the second half against the original outlook for a combined impact of $0.04 to $0.06.
So now looking at income taxes. The effective tax rate was 24.6% for the quarter compared 27.3% last year. This reflects the tax benefits associated with the establishment of our Asian hub this year and the expansion, particularly with respect to Pall Industrial, of our European hub. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be consistent with our original outlook.
In wrapping up the discussion about our P&L, net earnings were $84.7 million or $0.72 per share, and this compares to $75.7 million or $0.64 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share, as defined in the Appendix slides, were $0.76 compared to $0.68 last year, an increase of almost 12%. Now bridging this increase, foreign currency translation increased EPS by about $0.01 in the quarter. The tax rate contributed about $0.02, and underlying growth added about $0.05 or 7.5%.
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow on the 6 months was $204 million. This 31% increase or about $48 million was primarily driven by continued improvement in working capital management. Committed capital has continued to dampen free cash flow generation improvement in capital management as an ongoing priority. We increased our quarterly dividend by 20% from $0.175 to $0.21 per share, effective with the dividend declared on January 19, 2012. And our buyback authorization remains at $453 million. Now our cash position stood at $528 million at the end of the quarter, and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 6.3% compared to 9.1% at year-end, as we have used excess cash to pay down debt.
That concludes my report this morning. I will now turn this back to Larry."

We are very close to the customer base, and the rate of which they consume filters once a drug is in production is reasonably predictable. What can fluctuate is the rate of which they may deploy a new drug. And that can vary versus our expectations. And given some of the lab activity upstream, which is influenced by a variety of other associated spend dynamics, that can vary a fair amount. But the bottom line is once it gets to biological production, as long as we understand their relative inventory position and something like an FDA issue doesn't get in their way, we can reasonably predict how well they're going to do. Given all that, I think we feel pretty good about the market. It is going to moderate a bit from where it's been over the last 12 months, and we've got that factored into our thinking. Relative to what's going on in terms of share -- and I assume you mean our share versus customers' share -- we're in pretty good shape. We've got a couple of pretty decent competitors, but we think that we're growing with the market at this point, and our opportunity is to grow better than the market. And that comes back to the equation that you've heard us talk before about, about getting systems installed and then to realize that consumable pull-through. One of the things that may be beyond our share that does pertain to this market dynamic though is where our customers either gain or lose share in given product areas, and that can have a fairly large impact, as you could guess, in terms of where their capability may either take route in a new country as planned or not or where they may run into a regulatory hiccup at points along the way or not. And that has impacted us over time, and that probably always will. There's not much we can do to control that. So all, I guess, I'd tell you in summary that the market's healthy for sure. It's -- again, it's driven by those dynamics I talked about in the prepared remarks. That is it's people around the world adopting Western treatments and fighting disease, and that's a big element of fighting poverty, and we're doing really well moving into all the emerging markets, both the European as you see in the European numbers but also in Asia, as you see both in the European numbers and in the Asian numbers."

So as I was listening to myself talk and Lisa talk, I thought maybe we were slightly confusing in how we portray the incremental margin comments. The bottom line is this. The company has not generated consistent profitable growth, appropriately operationally leveraged growth for a very long period of time. And Lisa and I and the senior team in total are working to get to a P&L structure that is appropriately profiled. That means the right fixed cost structure with the right management organizational structure, such that when we grow at least a reasonable organic rate that we can leverage that as a P&L of the appropriate profile should right to the bottom line. So the 35% to 40% incremental margin range that we talked about is a pretax number. That's the incremental operating margin on the incremental organic sales. And just to be clear, what Lisa was talking about and explaining in the quarter was talking first about the gross margin dynamics for the quarter year-over-year and her 60% incremental margin comments, whereas they pertain to the gross margin line. So as we all know, the objective here is to leverage primarily the fixed cost structure in SG&A, but we also believe we've got an opportunity to leverage our indirect fixed cost structure in operations. As an example, as I've now been kind of around the world, we have a very different ratio of indirect to direct costs in our various manufacturing operations. Some of that driven by a profile of the individual operation, but some of it also because we've gotten to a better level of operating proficiencies in some facilities versus others. A true lean organization gets to a -- an aggressive direct versus indirect labor ratio. So we got work to do there, and that's all within the equation of how we get to 35% to 40% incremental margins and generate those on a pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter and certainly full year basis. Now back to your question about how long does it take. The reality is to get our P&L to the right profile, to get at the cost structure and to do it in a way that we can then live with and grow from and frankly, still invest to grow within. That full process, all that heavy lifting, I think, is going to take 18 months, and that means we look a little different 18 months from now. In that period of time, we're already incrementally taking appropriate waste reduction actions, if you will, cost actions that we talked about earlier in the year, which we're starting to see some of the benefits this year from some of the restructuring actions that we announced at the beginning of the fiscal year. And so on the back half of this year, albeit on a little bit lower organic growth, you'll start to see evidence of the fact that we can get it done. And I think we'll be able to talk in the back half of the year about the fact that we're starting to see the light, frankly, toward good incremental operating margins based on the performance. And again, I may be muted from a total bottom line performance by the things that we talked about, FX and mix and things of the sort but in terms of true operating leverage, certainly within our ability to get to the kind of equation that I described."

We, as you all remember, had a kind of a tough fourth quarter last year because we didn't understand the systems impact to mix, and we're trying by way of our organizational structural thinking and frankly, pruning lower margin business opportunities within the total set could get much more effective at how we understand and desire to participate in more specific systems opportunities, programs going forward. We want to make sure that the consumable profile is appropriate as I said in my prepared remarks. So number one, it's the right people who understand how to sell and design systems and how to make sure that the we're capturing all the value that we should on the front end of a system sale and two, frankly only participating where there's a good consumable ratio going forward. We're underway with that. We still got work to do. The org announcement that was on the release that we talked a little bit about last night is a piece of that. There are some more work to do. And we don't expect that all system sales are going to be certainly neutral, certainly not accretive to the rate, but we want to make sure that they are the appropriate profile for us to generate that downstream consumables stream. In terms of bigger picture though, Hamzah, with regard to how we go to market, I think we've got a great sales organization. I think we've got an outstanding applications capability around the world. I think that we have a, while be it expensive one, one that no one out there can replicate and many have tried. We've got an organization that's got the local capability to validate existing installations of filters to test new products, to work directly with customers by way of local lab expertise. We've got the people around the world already and including much of the investment we need in the emerging markets to get this done. So I think that's, frankly, going to continue to serve as well, and there's not a major structural change that's required. As far as the direct versus distribution thinking, we've been moving, frankly, to a more direct model globally. We'll continue to partner with those people in the North American market and being selectively globally otherwise who really do add value will bring both technical and commercial capability as well as costumer relationship value. But generally speaking, globally, the direct organization structure that we've been underway with for some time is the one that we'll continue to execute. We, I think, have a business model that serves a particular business profile, our market profile, if you will, really well. We are different than just about all of the industrial peers, and that's good because we like to go after the relatively low volume, really high mix, really tough to do stuff. I think the challenge is going to be to apply some of the almost lean-like thinking to how we do it more cost effectively and really measure our ability to do it over time, particularly in the very high mix portion of the industrial market segment set that we serve.

Maybe one thing that's changed a little bit in my mind since the last quarter call after I've now had the chance to visit many more of our operations and understand kind of the task at hand in front of us. Our senior team is going to be pretty well consumed with some of the foundation work that I'd talked about on my prepared remarks, getting operations fixed, supply chain fixed, getting the ERP up and operational, fully operational. That is frankly going to be the primary use of kind of my bandwidth and of the senior team's bandwidth for the next 12 months. So we're not in a position yet and frankly, we're in a less of a position now than I thought we were a quarter or go to go out and bring in acquisitions. Now all that said, just like ForteBio, which we think is going to be a fantastic addition to the company, bolt-on, as you describe them, they come with good leadership, which we think we've absolutely got the case in ForteBio, that are capable of actually assisting us with our ability to tackle some of our core challenges, we'll continue to look at this, and we are. And those need to be somewhat self-sufficient. We do not have the operations or integration skill set in-house at this point, and we need to build it in. And that's going to take that 12-month period of time in the -- in kind of a timeline comment that I made. So the balance sheet question really pertains more to our ability to acquire and integrate versus desire. And at this point, I think over the next 12 months, you'll see a -- us continuing to improve our free cash capability. Obviously, we'll get to a reasonably rich balance sheet position, and it'll set us up nicely for, then, what will be our ability to, I think, get more aggressive in terms of acquisitive activity.

I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller.
We'll review the quarter and our outlook, but before I do that, I'll provide my assessment of the company, generally where we are and what we need to do after a couple quarters of experience. I came to Pall to build a company that's among the most respected in the world, and we have the potential to achieve that level of performance and the respect that comes with it. I visited most of our facilities around the world and met with many employees at all levels and positions within the company. I've also gotten lots of feedback from customers and suppliers. These meetings have reaffirmed my impressions of the company's opportunity. I see a very strong long-term value creation opportunity, and I stress, I'd like you to think about it that way as well. We have a lot of organization and operations foundation work to do over the next couple of years, but we'll get there. We also are focusing on taking waste out of the system and improving our cost structure now, particularly given some of the market softness that we're seeing. The big picture, we serve highly attractive end markets, many with high barriers to entry. 2/3 of the sales are consumables that are largely nondiscretionary purchases. Our applications expertise is second to none, as is our global sales channel, and we have a great balance sheet to fuel growth. Pall employees are highly committed to our success and hungry for change. All of this provides a great platform to build on.
We're beginning to execute a more focused company-wide agenda around people, process and technology. And so a little bit on each of those core components. We've changed our executive compensation plan, new metrics and key goals to align the top of the house with growing the company, improving our free cash generation, executing our focused agenda and driving total shareholder return. So a better pay-per-performance system that we will cascade to the organization. We continue to deploy resources into higher growth markets. The increase in SG&A spend reflects this, as we have the transitional overhang from making these investments, while we continue to execute on cost reduction efforts in lower growth markets. We've begun to implement organization and operational changes intended to improve our fixed cost structure and drive operational effectiveness. One that you may have seen in the release last night that impacts our external reporting is the alignment of Machinery & Equipment with Energy & Water under common management. These Pall markets with their connection to infrastructure are among the early beneficiaries of economic development around the world. A lot of their growth and market potential is in emerging markets. Also, these businesses are all similar in that they are the most capital-intensive product profiles that we sell. We believe that the combination will enhance our ability to accelerate our efforts to strengthen contract management, strategic pricing and to ensure that the consumable annuity pull-through potential does exist. So in other words, it's to improve our ability to sell and design systems that we can make money on and ensure that the follow-on consumable opportunity is real.
In general, we have a lot of work to do to drive consistent operational execution, particularly in supply chain and manufacturing operations. We've begun to add seasoned executives to the team to lead operations, strategic sourcing and IT.
And now moving on to process. We are very pleased that we have successfully fully deployed our ERP system. The Americas, the last phase of our global initiative, is now operational. It has been a major endeavor, and I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the tireless dedication that the core group has exhibited over the past several months to prepare and execute this critical step toward a global enterprise system. And we now have a global transactional system in place that can provide end-to-end visibility into the business. It will be a key enabler for moving forward with process improvements to achieve our Pall enterprise objectives.
In technology, our team is making real strides toward improving product developments and the time to market for new products. We still have a lot of work to do to improve our total product vitality, but we are now on our way, and you will hear more about this over time. And we closed on an acquisition last week of a small company that we had previously announced. ForteBio is a good strategic fit with technology that accelerates development and validation processes associated with biotech research. We welcome the ForteBio team to the Pall family. And we are implementing a corporate business development team with acquisition-integration capability, which will enable future acquisitive growth. Our investments will be disciplined and thoughtful to enhance our organic profile.
So the beginning of a focused corporate agenda is taking shape, and we're making progress. As far that time line to implement, the somewhat flippant answer would be longer than you or I would like. My thinking at this time, though, is that we'll have our executive team fully in place 12 months from now. Enabled by our global ERP system, our operations should be substantially better a year from now. We'll be able to lean out our operations and drive sustainable working capital improvement between now and then, but we should be able to accelerate from that point forward. We'll have our innovation capability to the point of improving the rate of new product vitality by the end of next year. That's the end of our fiscal year '13. And some high-level metrics that our senior team has now aligned to achieve, we should be able to significantly reduce our fixed cost structure based on the strategies that we're currently developing and implementing, and that's now.
Once we've done this, we can leverage our new P&L profile. So assuming we grow 5% or better organically, we'll generate at least 35% incremental operating margin on that incremental revenue. That's the go-forward equation. And our aspirational goal is 40% incremental margin. Within that equation, we will continue to invest to grow, with our primary focus on technology and customer-facing resources. We're targeting the end of next year -- that's 18 months from now -- as a very major milestone for most all of the heavy structural action lifting to be behind us.
So changing topics here and as far as other key items, before we move on to reviewing the performance in the quarter, we settled the outstanding class-action litigation from 2007 and with minimal future out-of-pocket expense, and I'd refer you to the release for details.
Now let's look at the quarter, and we'll talk about the business. Second quarter sales -- and I'm on Slide 7 -- came in just under $700 million, good growth overall. Total sales grew just over 8%, with minimal impact from FX. Just like last quarter, business was split about 50-50 between Life Science and Industrial. And Life Sciences sales increased 7% excluding FX, and Industrial grew more than 9%.
Now if you flip to 8, there on Slide 8, increased just over 3% in the quarter. Some of this is a difficult comp to 15% orders growth in the prior year period. Some is also current timing but to be clear, some is the softening order environment in emerging markets and across Europe. And then we saw the same trend in February. Life Science orders were up 2% in the quarter. BioPharm grew by 13%. However, Food & Beverage orders were down by almost 15%. Industrial orders were up 5%. The backlog, which is up 9% over last year, coupled with the moderating orders patterns still supports our mid-single-digit sales outlook for the full year.
Now I'm moving on to Slide 9, and I'll walk through the markets, first, with the ones that Life Sciences serves. And as I walk through these, I'll comment on both sales and orders. BioPharm at almost 29% of second quarter total sales continues to be the growth driver of our Life Science business. Although the business is not immune to economic conditions, we believe it will grow through a flat economy. Again, the equipment market is driven by global patient demand, as the societies around the world adapt Western medicine, including drugs that are produced by way of the genetically engineered processes. And our filtration technology and associated systems enable the industry for how it develops and produces a broader variety of biopharmaceuticals. Sales in BioPharm increased about 12%, excluding FX in the quarter. Sales in Europe, the largest part of the market for Pall where the drugs are produced for global consumption, increased about 18%. Asia also grew by about 18%, as the industry takes root there. Consumables sales increased about 10% and represented over 90% of total BioPharm, and system sales increased 47%. Second quarter orders remain strong as well, increasing 13%.
Onto Slide 10 for Medical. Sales in Medical were down slightly, while orders decreased about 6%. Excellent sales growth in the blood markets was offset by weak results in the other key medical markets. Hospital spend is under pressure in both North America and in Europe. We're especially feeling this in Europe where our hospital business is larger. Hospital sales were down over 10% there. OEM sales were also down globally. There were several reasons for this. Some of the customers are working down inventory levels, and we have at least one OEM that is still recovering from the Thai flood. And we had also some supply challenges of our own that contributed to the sales results for the quarter.
And switching to Slide 11. For Food & Bev, despite strong growth in the Americas, Food & Bev sales were up just 2%. This excludes FX. The result was impacted by a divestiture of a nonstrategic asset in Italy earlier this year. The effect on full year sales is $20 million, and the impact to the second quarter was about 6% on the top line. If we take out the divestiture, the underlying growth rate would have been almost 9%. Orders were down 15%. This reflects a large decrease in systems orders compared to last year when we saw an unusually high order commitment in the same period. Consumable orders were down 3% on an apples-to-apples basis. Orders were up 4.5% on that apples-to-apples basis. While the European economy isn't helping, Food & Beverage is holding up pretty well actually, largely with innovative products that increase output and lower production costs. Orders and sales both grew in February, incidentally.
In Process Technologies, sales for Process Technologies increased over 13% in the quarter. This was driven by double-digit growth in the Energy and the Machinery & Equipment markets. Municipal Water was down. Overall orders in Process Technologies increased 4%, with the strongest growth in the water markets. Energy sales grew almost 21%. We saw a good growth across the various markets we serve, and the 2 that really drove the result were the natural gas and the refining markets. Sales were up sharply to these markets, obviously, reflecting the ongoing investments there in the space.
And while Pall plays in all of the Energy applications that require filtration, we see growth slowing in the clean energy markets. Big new projects in the nuclear industry have slowed substantially following the Fukushima incident. But despite this, China, Russia and India, which represent half of all planned new capacity, are now expected to proceed with their plans to build nuclear plants. And in the U.S., the NRC recently approved 2 new plants.
Wind turbine production is down this year, with the loss of the federal subsidies and programs, and that's the similar case globally. China, in particular, has cut production of wind turbines, and there's also some consolidation among the turbine OEMs in the industry that's underway.
Energy orders were up just over 2%, with strong growth in MENA offset by a double-digit decline in the Americas, including an unusually high order volume of systems last year in the quarter, so a tough comp in the Americas in Energy. Municipal Water sales were down almost 19%, while orders, though, were up 20%. With this growth, driven by the Americas, where it appears as though the capital spend cycle for water may have bottomed out and in fact, our backlog grew sequentially by about $8 million in the quarter.
And finally, Machinery & Equipment, which accounts for over 20% of total sales, had sales growth of 18%. The global mining industry has been a steady contributor to these results. Our filters are used in a variety of the applications, including the mining equipment as well as the in-water mine systems. Orders were up about 2% in the quarter, as we think we're beginning to see some pushouts from the European companies on capital projects. In Asia, our primary metals business is slowing, consistent with what we're all reading.
So turning now to Microelectronics. I'm at Slide 13. We're down 5%, and sales reflect continued weakness in various parts of the market. Fab utilization rates remain low for most of the chip producers, and the display market is operating under capacity. The capital equipment and tool producers are forecast to remain slow for at least the next several months. And Thailand is the source of about 1/4 of the global hard drive output, as you know. Full recovery of production there is still anticipated to be at least a few months from now.
Despite all the above, general conditions included, Q2 orders grew about 2%. This was driven by a several-week burst in demand from U.S. OEMs for tools at the end of the calendar year, and we don't see this as a sustainable trend for the rest of our fiscal year.
I'm onto 14 for Aerospace. Our Aerospace business is split evenly between Commercial and Military. In total, sales were up 16%, excluding FX. Commercial Aerospace sales were flat, while Military Aerospace sales increased over 31%. Commercial Aerospace was impacted by program delays, and additionally, we continue to prune some low-margin business there. However, commercial jet orders were strong for both aftermarket and the regional jet new equipment market.
The Military orders and sales were driven by our Centrisep air cleaners for helicopters, and our backlog remains very healthy at over $100 million. So that's a run-through of our markets and how they stacked up. I'm now going to take a look at it regionally. If you turn to Slide 15. I embedded some of the geographic comments in the segment performance that I've just walked through, but there are some counterintuitive components to how we performed by geography, worth noting. Some of them are, again, quarter comp issues. Others are though more indicative of anticipated trends.
Sales in the Americas were up slightly compared to more than 27% growth in the comparable quarter last year. Results were mixed by markets. Food & Bev had a great quarter fueled by new accounts, new products and Latin American growth. Muni Water shipments were way down in the quarter. Again, this is largely an issue of timing. And again, our Military sales in the U.S. have been strong this year, as I just mentioned. Worth noting, all in, sales in Latin America, while still relatively small, increased 40%. Europe grew almost 50%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth there, and sales in mature European countries grew over 10%, while the emerging markets of Eastern Europe and MENA grew about 37%. Performance in Northern Europe was reasonably strong and again, driven by BioPharm, which accounts for about 1/3 of our European sales. Southern Europe was weak with hospital and just about all forms of capital spending down. And we expect that the broader economic impact throughout the Eurozone will provide a tougher growth environment though going forward. The instability of the euro presents another challenge, and Lisa is going to address this in her remarks here in a minute.
Sales in Asia increased almost 8%, but we're seeing signs of slowing in China, with delays in expected orders and talk of changing central government priorities associated with the infrastructure investment. Demand for steel is decreasing. Both Thailand and Japan are still recovering, but sales in Australia and Korea were very robust. Australia is experiencing ongoing demand in the mining industry, and Korea is investing to expand domestic refinery output. In addition, it's home, as you know, to many of the global engineering firms that are strong participants in the oil and gas expansion across the world.
So we said from the outset of the year that we would be counting on emerging regions to drive much of our growth this year, and they're living up to that expectation. Sales into emerging Asia and Europe, MENA and Latin America increased over 20% in the quarter, and for a broader prospective, sales for the 6 months are up 29%. Emerging markets now represent about 20% of the company sales, up from 17% last year. Mature market sales grew about 5.5% in the quarter and about 6% for the year.
In a given quarter, our organic orders result is typically impacted by lumpy large programs as you know, and that's the case for comps this quarter, as I've said. I think that the bigger picture theme for us for the first half of the year is what we anticipate to play out through the remainder of the year. The better global growth opportunities will be in energy production and in the energy distribution, the continued infrastructure buildout but less so in China and from the large molecule that is the biopharmaceutical drug production. And we also expect that some of the process technology markets will remain strong, too.
So that's it for my introductory remarks. I'm now going to turn it over to Lisa, and I'll pick up there again."

So Larry has talked about top line performance. I'm going to review the performance of each business segment and 3 key areas: gross margin, SG&A spend and operating margin. And I'm starting",1540,"Thanks, Larry. Good morning, everyone. I'm starting on Slide 17. So Larry has talked about top line performance. I'm going to review the performance of each business segment and 3 key areas: gross margin, SG&A spend and operating margin. And I'm starting with Pall Industrial. So when we look at Industrial top line performance, we would have expected an improvement of at least 150 bps, with incremental gross margin in this business of just under 60%. Versus the decline of 40 bps, this is almost a 200-basis-point delta. The 3 key bridge items are: One, unfavorable mix reduced margins by about 170 bps, mainly from the decreased sales in Microelectronics, similar to what we saw in the first quarter. Second, overhead absorption challenges reduced margins by about another 70 bps, again, mainly from volume decline in Microelectronics, as well as inventory reductions reflected in an improvement in Industrial's days and inventories, which improved about 13%, 123 days from 139 days in second quarter of last year; and third, there were a number of other factors that contributed to partly offset some of this headwind, but the most notable was an uptick in price as well as continuous improvement savings, which overcame inflation. So despite a 2.5% sequential decline in sales, we did see gross margins in the quarter improve sequentially by 210 basis points to 47.1%. This was due to better mix, pricing and execution.
Turning to SG&A. This increased about $8.7 million or 9.5%, excluding FX in the quarter. Selling expenses, which were 17.6% of sales, increased about 4.5%. And this increase was driven, as Larry mentioned earlier, by resource deployment into emerging regions. G&A, which was about 12% of sales, increased about 19%, so this also reflects related infrastructure builds for emerging countries, and this includes our Brazilian acquisition, as well as cost to bring Pall Industrial into our European and Asian hub structure. In addition, this reflects project-related costs that both Life Sciences and Industrial share in such as our IT project and our regional back-office consolidation.
So as Larry mentioned, we completed the Americas ERP conversion, essentially the last leg of the core implementation. Earlier in the year, we moved from the build phase, which is considered CapEx, now to data conversion, migration, training and local support, all of which is reflected in the P&L as period costs. These costs will continue to put pressure on incremental margin through the third quarter. However, the incremental cost has already been considered in our EPS. So that said, in addition to the benefits this investment has enabled by way of our regional hubs, this tool is a key enabler for many of our operating efficiency plans and PES. The post-implementation phase is where we will begin to see operating benefits reflected in our back-office function, and this begins largely in fiscal year 2013.
Segment profit was $52 million and generated margin of 15.4%, flat to last year. And this translated to incremental margins of 13%, excluding FX. Not the operating leverage we want, but it reflects the items we just discussed.
As we mentioned last quarter, we are executing several restructuring initiatives to improve the Industrial segment's leverage. The most significant of them include realigning sales and marketing management in Aeropower and Energy & Water as Larry mentioned, reorganizing the global management structure that supports the company's systems product line and shifting resources from mature to emerging regions. And we do expect to see improved incremental margins in the second half as the cost reduction, which will be principally in SG&A from these industrial restructuring activities, take hold.
I'm going to switch now to Life Sciences, and I'm on Slide 18. Life Sciences gross margins increased 60 basis points to 55.9%, and this reflects what we see as an appropriate entitlement given the business' 60-plus percent incremental gross margins. However, the benefits of pricing and manufacturing cost saves were partly offset by some mixed headwinds. SG&A increased about $8.7 million or 10%, excluding FX in the quarter. Selling expenses, which were 16.1% of sales increased about 5%. As with Industrial, this increase was driven by resource deployment into emerging regions, as well as some increased staffing in Life Sciences in the second half of last year. And G&A, which represents 11% of sales, was up 18%, and this reflects the items I discussed a moment ago in the Industrial review, as well as some costs related to the acquisition of ForteBio.
So segment profit came in at close to $89 million or a 5% increase, again, excluding FX. Segment margin declined 20 basis points to 24.8%. We achieved 19% incremental margin in the quarter on top line growth of 7%, again, both excluding FX, well below where we should and will get to with Life Sciences.
So recapping, operating margin was 17.7%, slightly below the second quarter of last year with pressure from the heavy lifting and spending activities I just described. We achieved overall incremental margin of about 15%, excluding FX. And our minimum target for incremental margin in our current state is 25%, and we do expect to achieve a range of 25% to 30% for the full year, as the euro remains in its current range of $1.31 to $1.33 to the dollar.
So let's talk about our P&L risk relative to fluctuations in the euro, and I'm on slide 20. In addition to the impact to reported results from the translation of foreign currency denominated financial results from our foreign subsidiaries or what we call translational impact and what I've been referring to when I talk about excluding FX so far this morning, we also have risks from the impact to gross margin as the cost of products fluctuate from sourcing them outside of one global currency, what we call transactional impact. So as we all know, the euro is blazing its own trail given the sovereign debt crisis even relative to neighboring European countries. And much of our manufacturing footprint rationalization has been in the Eurozone. So as the euro weakens, this puts pressure on gross margins, as the economic cost of that inventory inflates. Since the beginning of the year, we have seen the euro to the dollar go as low as $1.27 or about a 6% reduction and about 0.83 to the British pound. And our sales into the Eurozone comprise about 25% of total Pall sales as many of you know. About 80% of that is denominated in British pounds or U.S. dollars. And with this math, we estimate that a 5% movement of the euro, positive or negative, represents a change in gross margin of about 50 basis points on average.
Our initial full year outlook contemplated that the euro would be at about $1.35 to the U.S. dollar and about 0.86 to the British pound. Assuming that the euro now stays in its current range, i.e. $1.31 to $1.33 to the dollar and about 0.83 to the pound and that the pound and dollar move somewhat in tandem, we estimate that we have second half gross profit headwind of about $3.5 million to $6.5 million compared to our original outlook. Year-over-year, this creates a delta in second half gross profit of about $5 million or $0.03 in earnings per share. So to be clear, this would represent $0.02 to $0.04 of transactional impact against our original outlook for the second half. In addition, we estimate that translational impact to be about another $0.02 headwind in the second half against the original outlook for a combined impact of $0.04 to $0.06.
So now looking at income taxes. The effective tax rate was 24.6% for the quarter compared 27.3% last year. This reflects the tax benefits associated with the establishment of our Asian hub this year and the expansion, particularly with respect to Pall Industrial, of our European hub. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be consistent with our original outlook.
In wrapping up the discussion about our P&L, net earnings were $84.7 million or $0.72 per share, and this compares to $75.7 million or $0.64 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share, as defined in the Appendix slides, were $0.76 compared to $0.68 last year, an increase of almost 12%. Now bridging this increase, foreign currency translation increased EPS by about $0.01 in the quarter. The tax rate contributed about $0.02, and underlying growth added about $0.05 or 7.5%.
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the 6 months was $204 million. This 31% increase or about $48 million was primarily driven by continued improvement in working capital management. Committed capital has continued to dampen free cash flow generation improvement in capital management as an ongoing priority. We increased our quarterly dividend by 20% from $0.175 to $0.21 per share, effective with the dividend declared on January 19, 2012. And our buyback authorization remains at $453 million. Now our cash position stood at $528 million at the end of the quarter, and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 6.3% compared to 9.1% at year-end, as we have used excess cash to pay down debt.
That concludes my report this morning. I will now turn this back to Larry."

We are very close to the customer base, and the rate of which they consume filters once a drug is in production is reasonably predictable. What can fluctuate is the rate of which they may deploy a new drug. And that can vary versus our expectations. And given some of the lab activity upstream, which is influenced by a variety of other associated spend dynamics, that can vary a fair amount. But the bottom line is once it gets to biological production, as long as we understand their relative inventory position and something like an FDA issue doesn't get in their way, we can reasonably predict how well they're going to do. Given all that, I think we feel pretty good about the market. It is going to moderate a bit from where it's been over the last 12 months, and we've got that factored into our thinking. Relative to what's going on in terms of share -- and I assume you mean our share versus customers' share -- we're in pretty good shape. We've got a couple pretty decent competitors, but we think that we're growing with the market at this point, and our opportunity is to grow better than the market. And that comes back to the equation that you've heard us talk before about, about getting systems installed and then to realize that consumable pull-through. One of the things that may be beyond our share that does pertain to this market dynamic though is where our customers either gain or lose share in given product areas, and that can have a fairly large impact, as you could guess, in terms of where their capability may either take route in a new country as planned or not or where they may run into a regulatory hiccup at points along the way or not. And that has impacted us over time, and that probably always will. There's not much we can do to control that. So all, I guess, I'd tell you in summary that the market's healthy for sure. It's -- again, it's driven by those dynamics I talked about in the prepared remarks. That is it's people around the world adopting Western treatments and fighting disease, and that's a big element of fighting poverty, and we're doing really well moving into all the emerging markets, both European as you see in the European numbers but also in Asia, as you see both in the European numbers and in the Asian numbers."

So as I was listening to myself talk and Lisa talk, I thought maybe we were slightly confusing in how we portray the incremental margin comments. The bottom line is this: The company has not generated consistent profitable growth, appropriately operationally leveraged growth for a very long period of time. And Lisa and I and the senior team in total are working to get to a P&L structure that is appropriately profiled. That means the right fixed cost structure with the right management organizational structure, such that when we grow at least a reasonable organic rate that we can leverage that as a P&L of the appropriate profile should right to the bottom line. So the 35% to 40% incremental margin range that we talked about is a pretax number. That's the incremental operating margin on the incremental organic sales. And just to be clear, what Lisa was talking about and explaining in the quarter was talking first about the gross margin dynamics for the quarter year-over-year and her 60% incremental margin comments, whereas they pertain to the gross margin line. So as we all know, the objective here is to leverage primarily the fixed cost structure in SG&A, but we also believe we've got an opportunity to leverage our indirect fixed cost structure in operations. As an example, as I've now been kind of around the world, we have a very different ratio of indirect to direct costs in our various manufacturing operations. Some of that driven by the profile of the individual operation, but some of it also just because we've gotten to a better level of operating proficiencies in some facilities versus others. A true lean organization gets to a -- an aggressive direct versus indirect labor ratio. So we got work to do there, and that's all within the equation of how we get to 35% to 40% incremental margins and generate those on a pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter and certainly full year basis. Now, back to your question about how long does it take. The reality is to get our P&L to the right profile, to get at the cost structure and to do it in a way that we can then live with and grow from and frankly, still invest to grow within. That full process, all that heavy lifting, I think, is going to take 18 months, and that means we look a little different 18 months from now. In that period of time, we're already incrementally taking appropriate waste reduction actions, if you will, cost actions that we talked about earlier in the year, which we're starting to see some of the benefits this year from some of the restructuring actions that we announced at the beginning of the fiscal year. And so in the back half of this year, albeit on a little bit lower organic growth, you'll start to see evidence of the fact that we can get it done. And I think we'll be able to talk in the back half of the year about the fact that we're starting to see the light, frankly, toward good incremental operating margins based on the performance. And again, it may be muted from a total bottom line performance by the things that we talked about, FX and mix and things of the sort, but in terms of true operating leverage, certainly within our ability to get to the kind of equation that I described."

We, as you all remember, had a kind of a tough fourth quarter last year because we didn't understand the systems impact to mix, and we're trying by way of our organizational structural thinking and frankly, pruning lower margin business opportunities within the total set to get much more effective at how we understand and desire to participate in more specific systems opportunities, programs going forward. We want to make sure that the consumable profile is appropriate, as I said in the prepared remarks. So number one, it's the right people who understand how to sell and design systems and how to make sure that we're capturing all the value that we should on the front end of a system sale and two, frankly only participating where there's a good consumable ratio going forward. We're underway with that. We still got work to do. The org announcement that was in the release that we talked a little bit about last night is a piece of that. There's some more work to do. And we don't expect that all system sales are going to be certainly neutral, certainly not accretive to the rate, but we want to make sure that they are the appropriate profile for us to generate that downstream consumables stream. In terms of bigger picture though, Hamzah, with regard to how we go to market, I think we've got a great sales organization. I think we've got an outstanding applications capability around the world. I think that we have a, while be it expensive one, one that no one out there can replicate, and many have tried. We've got an organization that's got the local capability to validate existing installations of filters to test new products, to work directly with customers by way of local lab expertise. We've got the people around the world already and including much of the investment we need in the emerging markets to get this done. So I think that's, frankly, going to continue to serve us well, and there's not a major structural change that's required. As far as the direct versus distribution thinking, we've been moving, frankly, to a more direct model globally. We'll continue to partner with those people in the North American market and selectively globally otherwise who really do add value will bring both technical and commercial capability as well as customer relationship value. But generally speaking, globally, the direct organization structure that we've been underway with for some time is the one that we'll continue to execute. We, I think, have a business model that serves a particular business profile, our market profile, if you will, really well. We are different than just about all of the industrial peers, and that's good because we like to go after the relatively low volume, really high mix, really tough-to-do stuff. I think the challenge is going to be to apply some of the almost lean-like thinking to how we do it more cost effectively and really measure our ability to do it over time, particularly in the very high mix portion of the industrial market segment set that we serve.

That is, frankly, going to be the primary use of kind of my bandwidth and of the senior team's bandwidth for the next 12 months. So we're not in a position yet and frankly, we're in a less of a position now than I thought we were a quarter or go to go out and bring in acquisitions. Now all that said, just like ForteBio, which we think is going to be a fantastic addition to the company, bolt-on, as you describe them, they come with good leadership, which we think we've absolutely got the case in ForteBio, that are capable of actually assisting us with our ability to tackle some of our core challenges, we'll continue to look at those, and we are. And those need to be somewhat self-sufficient. We do not have the operations or integration skill set in-house at this point, and we need to build it in. And that's going to take that 12-month period of time in the -- in kind of the time line comment that I made. So the balance sheet question really pertains more to our ability to acquire and integrate versus desire. And at this point, I think over the next 12 months, you'll see us continuing to improve our free cash capability. Obviously, we'll get to a reasonably rich balance sheet position, and it'll set us up nicely for, then, what will be our ability to, I think, get more aggressive in terms of acquisitive activity.

I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller.
We'll review the quarter and our outlook, but before I do that, I'll provide my assessment of the company, generally where we are and what we need to do after a couple quarters of experience. I came to Pall to build a company that's among the most respected in the world, and we have the potential to achieve that level of performance and the respect that comes with it. I visited most of our facilities around the world and met with many employees at all levels and positions within the company. I've also gotten lots of feedback from customers and suppliers. These meetings have reaffirmed my impressions of the company's opportunity. I see a very strong long-term value creation opportunity, and I stress, I'd like you to think about it that way as well. We have a lot of organization and operations foundation work to do over the next couple of years, but we'll get there. We also are focusing on taking waste out of the system and improving our cost structure now, particularly given some of the market softness that we're seeing. The big picture, we serve highly attractive end markets, many with high barriers to entry. 2/3 of the sales are consumables that are largely nondiscretionary purchases. Our applications expertise is second to none, as is our global sales channel, and we have a great balance sheet to fuel growth. Pall employees are highly committed to our success and hungry for change. All of this provides a great platform to build on.
We're beginning to execute a more focused company-wide agenda around people, process and technology. And so a little bit on each of those core components. We've changed our executive compensation plan, new metrics and key goals to align the top of the house with growing the company, improving our free cash generation, executing our focused agenda and driving total shareholder return. So a better pay-per-performance system that we will cascade to the organization. We continue to deploy resources into higher growth markets. The increase in SG&A spend reflects this, as we have the transitional overhang from making these investments, while we continue to execute on cost reduction efforts in lower growth markets. We've begun to implement organization and operational changes intended to improve our fixed cost structure and drive operational effectiveness. One that you may have seen in the release last night that impacts our external reporting is the alignment of Machinery & Equipment with Energy & Water under common management. These Pall markets with their connection to infrastructure are among the early beneficiaries of economic development around the world. A lot of their growth and market potential is in emerging markets. Also, these businesses are all similar in that they are the most capital-intensive product profiles that we sell. We believe that the combination will enhance our ability to accelerate our efforts to strengthen contract management, strategic pricing and to ensure that the consumable annuity pull-through potential does exist. So in other words, it's to improve our ability to sell and design systems that we can make money on and ensure that the follow-on consumable opportunity is real.
In general, we have a lot of work to do to drive consistent operational execution, particularly in supply chain and manufacturing operations. We've begun to add seasoned executives to the team to lead operations, strategic sourcing and IT.
And now moving on to process. We are very pleased that we have successfully fully deployed our ERP system. The Americas, the last phase of our global initiative, is now operational. It has been a major endeavor, and I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the tireless dedication that the core group has exhibited over the past several months to prepare and execute this critical step toward a global enterprise system. And we now have a global transactional system in place that can provide end-to-end visibility into the business. It will be a key enabler for moving forward with process improvements to achieve our Pall enterprise objectives.
In technology, our team is making real strides toward improving product developments and the time to market for new products. We still have a lot of work to do to improve our total product vitality, but we are now on our way, and you will hear more about this over time. And we closed on an acquisition last week of a small company that we had previously announced. ForteBio is a good strategic fit with technology that accelerates development and validation processes associated with biotech research. We welcome the ForteBio team to the Pall family. And we are implementing a corporate business development team with acquisition-integration capability, which will enable future acquisitive growth. Our investments will be disciplined and thoughtful to enhance our organic profile.
So the beginning of a focused corporate agenda is taking shape, and we're making progress. As far that time line to implement, the somewhat flippant answer would be longer than you or I would like. My thinking at this time, though, is that we'll have our executive team fully in place 12 months from now. Enabled by our global ERP system, our operations should be substantially better a year from now. We'll be able to lean out our operations and drive sustainable working capital improvement between now and then, but we should be able to accelerate from that point forward. We'll have our innovation capability to the point of improving the rate of new product vitality by the end of next year. That's the end of our fiscal year '13. And some high-level metrics that our senior team has now aligned to achieve, we should be able to significantly reduce our fixed cost structure based on the strategies that we're currently developing and implementing, and that's now.
Once we've done this, we can leverage our new P&L profile. So assuming we grow 5% or better organically, we'll generate at least 35% incremental operating margin on that incremental revenue. That's the go-forward equation. And our aspirational goal is 40% incremental margin. Within that equation, we will continue to invest to grow, with our primary focus on technology and customer-facing resources. We're targeting the end of next year -- that's 18 months from now -- as a very major milestone for most all of the heavy structural action lifting to be behind us.
So changing topics here and as far as other key items, before we move on to reviewing the performance in the quarter, we settled the outstanding class-action litigation from 2007 and with minimal future out-of-pocket expense, and I'd refer you to the release for details.
Now let's look at the quarter, and we'll talk about the business. Second quarter sales -- and I'm on Slide 7 -- came in just under $700 million, good growth overall. Total sales grew just over 8%, with minimal impact from FX. Just like last quarter, business was split about 50-50 between Life Science and Industrial. And Life Sciences sales increased 7% excluding FX, and Industrial grew more than 9%.
Now if you flip to 8, there on Slide 8, increased just over 3% in the quarter. Some of this is a difficult comp to 15% orders growth in the prior year period. Some is also current timing but to be clear, some is the softening order environment in emerging markets and across Europe. And then we saw the same trend in February. Life Science orders were up 2% in the quarter. BioPharm grew by 13%. However, Food & Beverage orders were down by almost 15%. Industrial orders were up 5%. The backlog, which is up 9% over last year, coupled with the moderating orders patterns still supports our mid-single-digit sales outlook for the full year.
Now I'm moving on to Slide 9, and I'll walk through the markets, first, with the ones that Life Sciences serves. And as I walk through these, I'll comment on both sales and orders. BioPharm at almost 29% of second quarter total sales continues to be the growth driver of our Life Science business. Although the business is not immune to economic conditions, we believe it will grow through a flat economy. Again, the equipment market is driven by global patient demand, as the societies around the world adapt Western medicine, including drugs that are produced by way of the genetically engineered processes. And our filtration technology and associated systems enable the industry for how it develops and produces a broader variety of biopharmaceuticals. Sales in BioPharm increased about 12%, excluding FX in the quarter. Sales in Europe, the largest part of the market for Pall where the drugs are produced for global consumption, increased about 18%. Asia also grew by about 18%, as the industry takes root there. Consumables sales increased about 10% and represented over 90% of total BioPharm, and system sales increased 47%. Second quarter orders remain strong as well, increasing 13%.
Onto Slide 10 for Medical. Sales in Medical were down slightly, while orders decreased about 6%. Excellent sales growth in the blood markets was offset by weak results in the other key medical markets. Hospital spend is under pressure in both North America and in Europe. We're especially feeling this in Europe where our hospital business is larger. Hospital sales were down over 10% there. OEM sales were also down globally. There were several reasons for this. Some of the customers are working down inventory levels, and we have at least one OEM that is still recovering from the Thai flood. And we had also some supply challenges of our own that contributed to the sales results for the quarter.
And switching to Slide 11. For Food & Bev, despite strong growth in the Americas, Food & Bev sales were up just 2%. This excludes FX. The result was impacted by a divestiture of a nonstrategic asset in Italy earlier this year. The effect on full year sales is $20 million, and the impact to the second quarter was about 6% on the top line. If we take out the divestiture, the underlying growth rate would have been almost 9%. Orders were down 15%. This reflects a large decrease in systems orders compared to last year when we saw an unusually high order commitment in the same period. Consumable orders were down 3% on an apples-to-apples basis. Orders were up 4.5% on that apples-to-apples basis. While the European economy isn't helping, Food & Beverage is holding up pretty well actually, largely with innovative products that increase output and lower production costs. Orders and sales both grew in February, incidentally.
In Process Technologies, sales for Process Technologies increased over 13% in the quarter. This was driven by double-digit growth in the Energy and the Machinery & Equipment markets. Municipal Water was down. Overall orders in Process Technologies increased 4%, with the strongest growth in the water markets. Energy sales grew almost 21%. We saw a good growth across the various markets we serve, and the 2 that really drove the result were the natural gas and the refining markets. Sales were up sharply to these markets, obviously, reflecting the ongoing investments there in the space.
And while Pall plays in all of the Energy applications that require filtration, we see growth slowing in the clean energy markets. Big new projects in the nuclear industry have slowed substantially following the Fukushima incident. But despite this, China, Russia and India, which represent half of all planned new capacity, are now expected to proceed with their plans to build nuclear plants. And in the U.S., the NRC recently approved 2 new plants.
Wind turbine production is down this year, with the loss of the federal subsidies and programs, and that's the similar case globally. China, in particular, has cut production of wind turbines, and there's also some consolidation among the turbine OEMs in the industry that's underway.
Energy orders were up just over 2%, with strong growth in MENA offset by a double-digit decline in the Americas, including an unusually high order volume of systems last year in the quarter, so a tough comp in the Americas in Energy. Municipal Water sales were down almost 19%, while orders, though, were up 20%. With this growth, driven by the Americas, where it appears as though the capital spend cycle for water may have bottomed out and in fact, our backlog grew sequentially by about $8 million in the quarter.
And finally, Machinery & Equipment, which accounts for over 20% of total sales, had sales growth of 18%. The global mining industry has been a steady contributor to these results. Our filters are used in a variety of the applications, including the mining equipment as well as the in-water mine systems. Orders were up about 2% in the quarter, as we think we're beginning to see some pushouts from the European companies on capital projects. In Asia, our primary metals business is slowing, consistent with what we're all reading.
So turning now to Microelectronics. I'm at Slide 13. We're down 5%, and sales reflect continued weakness in various parts of the market. Fab utilization rates remain low for most of the chip producers, and the display market is operating under capacity. The capital equipment and tool producers are forecast to remain slow for at least the next several months. And Thailand is the source of about 1/4 of the global hard drive output, as you know. Full recovery of production there is still anticipated to be at least a few months from now.
Despite all the above, general conditions included, Q2 orders grew about 2%. This was driven by a several-week burst in demand from U.S. OEMs for tools at the end of the calendar year, and we don't see this as a sustainable trend for the rest of our fiscal year.
I'm onto 14 for Aerospace. Our Aerospace business is split evenly between Commercial and Military. In total, sales were up 16%, excluding FX. Commercial Aerospace sales were flat, while Military Aerospace sales increased over 31%. Commercial Aerospace was impacted by program delays, and additionally, we continue to prune some low-margin business there. However, commercial jet orders were strong for both aftermarket and the regional jet new equipment market.
The Military orders and sales were driven by our Centrisep air cleaners for helicopters, and our backlog remains very healthy at over $100 million. So that's a run-through of our markets and how they stacked up. I'm now going to take a look at it regionally. If you turn to Slide 15. I embedded some of the geographic comments in the segment performance that I've just walked through, but there are some counterintuitive components to how we performed by geography, worth noting. Some of them are, again, quarter comp issues. Others are though more indicative of anticipated trends.
Sales in the Americas were up slightly compared to more than 27% growth in the comparable quarter last year. Results were mixed by markets. Food & Bev had a great quarter fueled by new accounts, new products and Latin American growth. Muni Water shipments were way down in the quarter. Again, this is largely an issue of timing. And again, our Military sales in the U.S. have been strong this year, as I just mentioned. Worth noting, all in, sales in Latin America, while still relatively small, increased 40%. Europe grew almost 50%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth there, and sales in mature European countries grew over 10%, while the emerging markets of Eastern Europe and MENA grew about 37%. Performance in Northern Europe was reasonably strong and again, driven by BioPharm, which accounts for about 1/3 of our European sales. Southern Europe was weak with hospital and just about all forms of capital spending down. And we expect that the broader economic impact throughout the Eurozone will provide a tougher growth environment though going forward. The instability of the euro presents another challenge, and Lisa is going to address this in her remarks here in a minute.
Sales in Asia increased almost 8%, but we're seeing signs of slowing in China, with delays in expected orders and talk of changing central government priorities associated with the infrastructure investment. Demand for steel is decreasing. Both Thailand and Japan are still recovering, but sales in Australia and Korea were very robust. Australia is experiencing ongoing demand in the mining industry, and Korea is investing to expand domestic refinery output. In addition, it's home, as you know, to many of the global engineering firms that are strong participants in the oil and gas expansion across the world.
So we said from the outset of the year that we would be counting on emerging regions to drive much of our growth this year, and they're living up to that expectation. Sales into emerging Asia and Europe, MENA and Latin America increased over 20% in the quarter, and for a broader prospective, sales for the 6 months are up 29%. Emerging markets now represent about 20% of the company sales, up from 17% last year. Mature market sales grew about 5.5% in the quarter and about 6% for the year.
In a given quarter, our organic orders result is typically impacted by lumpy large programs as you know, and that's the case for comps this quarter, as I've said. I think that the bigger picture theme for us for the first half of the year is what we anticipate to play out through the remainder of the year. The better global growth opportunities will be in energy production and in the energy distribution, the continued infrastructure buildout but less so in China and from the large molecule that is the biopharmaceutical drug production. And we also expect that some of the process technology markets will remain strong, too.
So that's it for my introductory remarks. I'm now going to turn it over to Lisa, and I'll pick up there again."

So Larry has talked about top line performance. I'm going to review the performance of each business segment and 3 key areas: gross margin, SG&A spend and operating margin. And I'm starting",1540,"Thanks, Larry. Good morning, everyone. I'm starting on Slide 17. So Larry has talked about top line performance. I'm going to review the performance of each business segment and 3 key areas: gross margin, SG&A spend and operating margin. And I'm starting with Pall Industrial. So when we look at Industrial top line performance, we would have expected an improvement of at least 150 bps, with incremental gross margin in this business of just under 60%. Versus the decline of 40 bps, this is almost a 200-basis-point delta. The 3 key bridge items are: One, unfavorable mix reduced margins by about 170 bps, mainly from the decreased sales in Microelectronics, similar to what we saw in the first quarter. Second, overhead absorption challenges reduced margins by about another 70 bps, again, mainly from volume decline in Microelectronics, as well as inventory reductions reflected in an improvement in Industrial's days and inventories, which improved about 13%, 123 days from 139 days in second quarter of last year; and third, there were a number of other factors that contributed to partly offset some of this headwind, but the most notable was an uptick in price as well as continuous improvement savings, which overcame inflation. So despite a 2.5% sequential decline in sales, we did see gross margins in the quarter improve sequentially by 210 basis points to 47.1%. This was due to better mix, pricing and execution.
Turning to SG&A. This increased about $8.7 million or 9.5%, excluding FX in the quarter. Selling expenses, which were 17.6% of sales, increased about 4.5%. And this increase was driven, as Larry mentioned earlier, by resource deployment into emerging regions. G&A, which was about 12% of sales, increased about 19%, so this also reflects related infrastructure builds for emerging countries, and this includes our Brazilian acquisition, as well as cost to bring Pall Industrial into our European and Asian hub structure. In addition, this reflects project-related costs that both Life Sciences and Industrial share in such as our IT project and our regional back-office consolidation.
So as Larry mentioned, we completed the Americas ERP conversion, essentially the last leg of the core implementation. Earlier in the year, we moved from the build phase, which is considered CapEx, now to data conversion, migration, training and local support, all of which is reflected in the P&L as period costs. These costs will continue to put pressure on incremental margin through the third quarter. However, the incremental cost has already been considered in our EPS. So that said, in addition to the benefits this investment has enabled by way of our regional hubs, this tool is a key enabler for many of our operating efficiency plans and PES. The post-implementation phase is where we will begin to see operating benefits reflected in our back-office function, and this begins largely in fiscal year 2013.
Segment profit was $52 million and generated margin of 15.4%, flat to last year. And this translated to incremental margins of 13%, excluding FX. Not the operating leverage we want, but it reflects the items we just discussed.
As we mentioned last quarter, we are executing several restructuring initiatives to improve the Industrial segment's leverage. The most significant of them include realigning sales and marketing management in Aeropower and Energy & Water as Larry mentioned, reorganizing the global management structure that supports the company's systems product line and shifting resources from mature to emerging regions. And we do expect to see improved incremental margins in the second half as the cost reduction, which will be principally in SG&A from these industrial restructuring activities, take hold.
I'm going to switch now to Life Sciences, and I'm on Slide 18. Life Sciences gross margins increased 60 basis points to 55.9%, and this reflects what we see as an appropriate entitlement given the business' 60-plus percent incremental gross margins. However, the benefits of pricing and manufacturing cost saves were partly offset by some mixed headwinds. SG&A increased about $8.7 million or 10%, excluding FX in the quarter. Selling expenses, which were 16.1% of sales increased about 5%. As with Industrial, this increase was driven by resource deployment into emerging regions, as well as some increased staffing in Life Sciences in the second half of last year. And G&A, which represents 11% of sales, was up 18%, and this reflects the items I discussed a moment ago in the Industrial review, as well as some costs related to the acquisition of ForteBio.
So segment profit came in at close to $89 million or a 5% increase, again, excluding FX. Segment margin declined 20 basis points to 24.8%. We achieved 19% incremental margin in the quarter on top line growth of 7%, again, both excluding FX, well below where we should and will get to with Life Sciences.
So recapping, operating margin was 17.7%, slightly below the second quarter of last year with pressure from the heavy lifting and spending activities I just described. We achieved overall incremental margin of about 15%, excluding FX. And our minimum target for incremental margin in our current state is 25%, and we do expect to achieve a range of 25% to 30% for the full year, as the euro remains in its current range of $1.31 to $1.33 to the dollar.
So let's talk about our P&L risk relative to fluctuations in the euro, and I'm on slide 20. In addition to the impact to reported results from the translation of foreign currency denominated financial results from our foreign subsidiaries or what we call translational impact and what I've been referring to when I talk about excluding FX so far this morning, we also have risks from the impact to gross margin as the cost of products fluctuate from sourcing them outside of one global currency, what we call transactional impact. So as we all know, the euro is blazing its own trail given the sovereign debt crisis even relative to neighboring European countries. And much of our manufacturing footprint rationalization has been in the Eurozone. So as the euro weakens, this puts pressure on gross margins, as the economic cost of that inventory inflates. Since the beginning of the year, we have seen the euro to the dollar go as low as $1.27 or about a 6% reduction and about 0.83 to the British pound. And our sales into the Eurozone comprise about 25% of total Pall sales as many of you know. About 80% of that is denominated in British pounds or U.S. dollars. And with this math, we estimate that a 5% movement of the euro, positive or negative, represents a change in gross margin of about 50 basis points on average.
Our initial full year outlook contemplated that the euro would be at about $1.35 to the U.S. dollar and about 0.86 to the British pound. Assuming that the euro now stays in its current range, i.e. $1.31 to $1.33 to the dollar and about 0.83 to the pound and that the pound and dollar move somewhat in tandem, we estimate that we have second half gross profit headwind of about $3.5 million to $6.5 million compared to our original outlook. Year-over-year, this creates a delta in second half gross profit of about $5 million or $0.03 in earnings per share. So to be clear, this would represent $0.02 to $0.04 of transactional impact against our original outlook for the second half. In addition, we estimate that translational impact to be about another $0.02 headwind in the second half against the original outlook for a combined impact of $0.04 to $0.06.
So now looking at income taxes. The effective tax rate was 24.6% for the quarter compared 27.3% last year. This reflects the tax benefits associated with the establishment of our Asian hub this year and the expansion, particularly with respect to Pall Industrial, of our European hub. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be consistent with our original outlook.
In wrapping up the discussion about our P&L, net earnings were $84.7 million or $0.72 per share, and this compares to $75.7 million or $0.64 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share, as defined in the Appendix slides, were $0.76 compared to $0.68 last year, an increase of almost 12%. Now bridging this increase, foreign currency translation increased EPS by about $0.01 in the quarter. The tax rate contributed about $0.02, and underlying growth added about $0.05 or 7.5%.
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the 6 months was $204 million. This 31% increase or about $48 million was primarily driven by continued improvement in working capital management. Committed capital has continued to dampen free cash flow generation improvement in capital management as an ongoing priority. We increased our quarterly dividend by 20% from $0.175 to $0.21 per share, effective with the dividend declared on January 19, 2012. And our buyback authorization remains at $453 million. Now our cash position stood at $528 million at the end of the quarter, and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 6.3% compared to 9.1% at year-end, as we have used excess cash to pay down debt.
That concludes my report this morning. I will now turn this back to Larry."

Clearly, the macro situation presents some risk to the top line. We expect second half sales growth to slow, reflecting slower macro trends in Europe and some in emerging Asia. We also anticipate tough mix in Industrial for the remainder of the year. The instability of the euro could further impact results as well as Lisa just walked through. We're stepping up our costs in productivity initiatives. We should be able to offset known market softening and the mix impact to deliver continued reasonable earnings performance. And with the assumptions of a macro market, particularly the European economy and the currency impact, we believe that the bottom end of our guided range is achievable and that our task is to deliver the previously stated midpoint of 320 or better.
So with that in mind, we'll turn it over to the operator and take your questions."

We are very close to the customer base, and the rate of which they consume filters once a drug is in production is reasonably predictable. What can fluctuate is the rate of which they may deploy a new drug. And that can vary versus our expectations. And given some of the lab activity upstream, which is influenced by a variety of other associated spend dynamics, that can vary a fair amount. But the bottom line is once it gets to biological production, as long as we understand their relative inventory position and something like an FDA issue doesn't get in their way, we can reasonably predict how well they're going to do. Given all that, I think we feel pretty good about the market. It is going to moderate a bit from where it's been over the last 12 months, and we've got that factored into our thinking. Relative to what's going on in terms of share -- and I assume you mean our share versus customers' share -- we're in pretty good shape. We've got a couple pretty decent competitors, but we think that we're growing with the market at this point, and our opportunity is to grow better than the market. And that comes back to the equation that you've heard us talk before about, about getting systems installed and then to realize that consumable pull-through. One of the things that may be beyond our share that does pertain to this market dynamic though is where our customers either gain or lose share in given product areas, and that can have a fairly large impact, as you could guess, in terms of where their capability may either take route in a new country as planned or not or where they may run into a regulatory hiccup at points along the way or not. And that has impacted us over time, and that probably always will. There's not much we can do to control that. So all, I guess, I'd tell you in summary that the market's healthy for sure. It's -- again, it's driven by those dynamics I talked about in the prepared remarks. That is it's people around the world adopting Western treatments and fighting disease, and that's a big element of fighting poverty, and we're doing really well moving into all the emerging markets, both European as you see in the European numbers but also in Asia, as you see both in the European numbers and in the Asian numbers."

So as I was listening to myself talk and Lisa talk, I thought maybe we were slightly confusing in how we portray the incremental margin comments. The bottom line is this: The company has not generated consistent profitable growth, appropriately operationally leveraged growth for a very long period of time. And Lisa and I and the senior team in total are working to get to a P&L structure that is appropriately profiled. That means the right fixed cost structure with the right management organizational structure, such that when we grow at least a reasonable organic rate that we can leverage that as a P&L of the appropriate profile should right to the bottom line. So the 35% to 40% incremental margin range that we talked about is a pretax number. That's the incremental operating margin on the incremental organic sales. And just to be clear, what Lisa was talking about and explaining in the quarter was talking first about the gross margin dynamics for the quarter year-over-year and her 60% incremental margin comments, whereas they pertain to the gross margin line. So as we all know, the objective here is to leverage primarily the fixed cost structure in SG&A, but we also believe we've got an opportunity to leverage our indirect fixed cost structure in operations. As an example, as I've now been kind of around the world, we have a very different ratio of indirect to direct costs in our various manufacturing operations. Some of that driven by the profile of the individual operation, but some of it also just because we've gotten to a better level of operating proficiencies in some facilities versus others. A true lean organization gets to a -- an aggressive direct versus indirect labor ratio. So we got work to do there, and that's all within the equation of how we get to 35% to 40% incremental margins and generate those on a pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter and certainly full year basis. Now, back to your question about how long does it take. The reality is to get our P&L to the right profile, to get at the cost structure and to do it in a way that we can then live with and grow from and frankly, still invest to grow within. That full process, all that heavy lifting, I think, is going to take 18 months, and that means we look a little different 18 months from now. In that period of time, we're already incrementally taking appropriate waste reduction actions, if you will, cost actions that we talked about earlier in the year, which we're starting to see some of the benefits this year from some of the restructuring actions that we announced at the beginning of the fiscal year. And so in the back half of this year, albeit on a little bit lower organic growth, you'll start to see evidence of the fact that we can get it done. And I think we'll be able to talk in the back half of the year about the fact that we're starting to see the light, frankly, toward good incremental operating margins based on the performance. And again, it may be muted from a total bottom line performance by the things that we talked about, FX and mix and things of the sort, but in terms of true operating leverage, certainly within our ability to get to the kind of equation that I described."

We want to make sure that the consumable profile is appropriate, as I said in the prepared remarks. So number one, it's the right people who understand how to sell and design systems and how to make sure that we're capturing all the value that we should on the front end of a system sale and two, frankly only participating where there's a good consumable ratio going forward. We're underway with that. We still got work to do. The org announcement that was in the release that we talked a little bit about last night is a piece of that. There's some more work to do. And we don't expect that all system sales are going to be certainly neutral, certainly not accretive to the rate, but we want to make sure that they are the appropriate profile for us to generate that downstream consumables stream. In terms of bigger picture though, Hamzah, with regard to how we go to market, I think we've got a great sales organization. I think we've got an outstanding applications capability around the world. I think that we have a, while be it expensive one, one that no one out there can replicate, and many have tried. We've got an organization that's got the local capability to validate existing installations of filters to test new products, to work directly with customers by way of local lab expertise. We've got the people around the world already and including much of the investment we need in the emerging markets to get this done. So I think that's, frankly, going to continue to serve us well, and there's not a major structural change that's required. As far as the direct versus distribution thinking, we've been moving, frankly, to a more direct model globally. We'll continue to partner with those people in the North American market and selectively globally otherwise who really do add value will bring both technical and commercial capability as well as customer relationship value. But generally speaking, globally, the direct organization structure that we've been underway with for some time is the one that we'll continue to execute. We, I think, have a business model that serves a particular business profile, our market profile, if you will, really well. We are different than just about all of the industrial peers, and that's good because we like to go after the relatively low volume, really high mix, really tough-to-do stuff. I think the challenge is going to be to apply some of the almost lean-like thinking to how we do it more cost effectively and really measure our ability to do it over time, particularly in the very high mix portion of the industrial market segment set that we serve.

So we're not in a position yet and frankly, we're in a less of a position now than I thought we were a quarter or go to go out and bring in acquisitions.

And those need to be somewhat self-sufficient. We do not have the operations or integration skill set in-house at this point, and we need to build it in. And that's going to take that 12-month period of time in the -- in kind of the time line comment that I made. So the balance sheet question really pertains more to our ability to acquire and integrate versus desire. And at this point, I think over the next 12 months, you'll see us continuing to improve our free cash capability. Obviously, we'll get to a reasonably rich balance sheet position, and it'll set us up nicely for, then, what will be our ability to, I think, get more aggressive in terms of acquisitive activity.

I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; Frank Moschella, Corporate Controller; and Brent Jones, our VP of Finance.As you have seen from our press release last night, it was a difficult third quarter as our re",1881,"Good morning. Thank you for joining us. I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; Frank Moschella, Corporate Controller; and Brent Jones, our VP of Finance.
As you have seen from our press release last night, it was a difficult third quarter as our results were impacted more than anticipated by the weak economy in the Eurozone and a self-inflicted disruption in our supply chain, which was caused by the previously announced global go-live of our new ERP system. This last phase was the big one, encompassing 2,800 users at 28 locations in the Americas and now links our systems worldwide.
While the ERP system clearly will have significant long-term benefits for the company and our temporary transition issues are being resolved, the disruption in the quarter meant that shipments of Consumables were delayed and we incurred substantial additional costs and what I'll call hyper care actions to mitigate the impact on our customers.
While disappointing, we are fortunate that our customers have been understanding and supportive, and I believe we're making very good progress in filling the backorders.
We expect to have caught up with the past due backlog by this August which as you know is the beginning of our fiscal year. So most of the revenue we lack in Q3 will be made up in this fourth quarter.
Unrelated to our ERP challenges, the macro environment is clearly softening while the Americas order rate is showing signs of strengthening, we're highly cautious about the situation in Europe. We anticipate that the organic order rates in Europe will be better in Q4 and next year than what was reported in Q3 though.
As we'll get into momentarily, we're taking appropriate cost actions that are already underway to mitigate the potential impact on our fiscal year '13 profitability. We will walk through both the orders and the sales performance by market and by geography, and I'll assume that you will have a number of questions.
There's obviously a fair bit of noise in the Q3 results due to the enterprise system deployments, so it's important that we clearly distinguish the market versus self-inflicted performance to give you a sense as to how we see next year taking shape.
And it's not all bad news. We have line of sight to the actions within our control to protect profitability even if the global economy stumbles forward. 
With that, as an overview, our remarks this morning will be on a continuing operations basis, which exclude the results of the Blood product line that we are divesting. 
So now, to the quarter.  We estimate that Enterprise system challenges in the quarter cost us about 3 points of organic growth and about $0.10 per share in the quarter, both in terms of delayed sales and increased costs to mitigate the impact on customers. That's all on us, so-called self-inflicted, as I said, temporary, not the economy or end markets.
Let's move on to Slide 6. Going into the third quarter, as we discussed on our last call, we expect that second half sales growth to slow compared with the strong first half, which we grew sales by 10%. That outlook reflected a number of anticipated headwinds, the softening economy in Europe and slower growth in emerging Asia, including China. We also said that we anticipated tough mix in our Industrial segment for the remainder of the year, and all of this has proven to be the case.
Third quarter sales from continuing operations were $658 million dollars or 2.5% growth over last year in local currency. Again, our conversion cost us almost 3 points of organic growth. Consumables and BioPharm, Food & Bev, Aerospace in particular were most impacted.
So within the 2.5% growth that we realized, while Consumables were flat, our system product sales increased 24%. 
So now I'm going to walk through a breakdown of both sales and orders by region and segment, get into a fair amount of detail.
On Slide 7, on a geographic basis, sales in the Americas were down about 1.5%, again the ERP conversion was entered here. Europe sales grew about 1%, with weakness in several key markets, which I'll cover in a moment. Asia had a good quarter overall, with sales growth of over 9%, with most major markets doing well, and despite MicroE, which was down 8% organically.
Relative to global segment performance, moving on to Slides 8 and 9, Life Sciences grew 4%, while Industrial grew just over 1%. Consumable sales were up 1% in Life Sciences and down about 2% in Industrial. And if you look at Slide 8, in Life Sciences, Pharmaceutical Consumables sales were up 9%, but we realized a double-digit decline in Lab instrumentation sales. The 3 issues contributed to the Lab decline. One is, that's where we experienced the slower book and turn activity. Two, our largest channel destock to some degree. And three, we didn't ship what we had the orders for given the ERP issues.
And while Food & Bev had an exceptionally strong systems quarter, $23 million dollars in systems, these sales declined 10%. A variety of factors explain this, including big organic comps that included our wine distribution business that we divested at the beginning of the year, reducing Food & Bev sales by about 4% but the bigger contributor to the decline were the ERP implementation and the European markets volume.
Medical within the Life Science segment was down in the quarter 1.5%, reflecting pressure on hospital spending in Western countries. 
And on Slide 9, within Industrial, microelectronic sales declined 8%, as I said earlier. This is mainly due to continued softness in IC production. However, we are beginning to see signs of recovery with increased capital standing by the chipmakers. Aerospace sales were up 1% Commercial Aerospace sales were down 10%, while Military Aerospace sales increased about 13%.
Sales in Process Technologies within Industrial, that's the Energy & Water process markets, Machinery & Equipment and OEM markets increased almost 5% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by growth in the Energy markets. And Energy sales grew about 16% with good broad-based underlying market drivers.
Muni Water sales were down 14% as capital spend for water plants remained weak with deferred spending and delayed project decision-making.
so again, in total, strong system sales in the quarter offset by slow consumable sales, of which again most of it's on us our execution. And again we would have realized somewhere between 5% and 6% local currency growth had we not been hampered with the conversion challenges.
I am going to move on to orders on Slide 10. The performance in the quarter was a function of our execution to some degree, but it's really more about the macro environment. We also don't face very stiff 2011 orders comps. When you look at the organic orders performance in total. Orders were down 9% compared to up almost 11% a year ago. This was driven largely by a 42% decline in systems compared to a 43% increase last year. When you attribute some of the systems orders shortfall to timing, this is not an unusual situation for capital projects.  And we've already realized some of the Q3 plant orders in May. 
Consumable orders were down 2%, and that included 3.5% growth in Life Sciences but an 8% drop in Industrial. 
So now let's look at orders by region.  Orders were down 20% in Europe, driven by systems, which were down 60%. Again, some of that's tough comps, some is project delays, and we've already realized shortly some of that delayed activity, but most definitely it's macro influence as well.
Conversely, orders in the Americas increased about 5%, about the same in Consumables as in systems. Within Life Sciences, Medical orders, which are booked in turn increased 13%, BioPharm orders were up 20%. We saw exceptional demand for our new Octet and BLItz products, which came with the ForteBio acquisition. And orders decreased about 6% in Asia. And double-digit growth in Life Sciences was offset by a similar rate of decline in the larger Industrial markets in Asia. And Microelectronics remained down, almost 15%.
Now I'm going to walk through orders by segments. Within Industrial, process technologies was down about 15%, driven by a 46% decline in system orders and energy and water with machinery equipment flat. And as I said earlier military Aerospace was down, given the blanket order tough comps.
Commercial Aerospace was up over 22%, with growth accelerating nicely. And MicroE orders were down 10%, reflecting continued weakness experienced over the last 4 quarters. However, we are seeing recovery, as I mentioned earlier. In May we saw as well Microelectronic orders increased sequentially by 12%, so that's a May comment.
Now in the Life Sciences. And we're on Slide 13. Both Medical and BioPharm were flat. Within BioPharm, Consumables were up 10% and systems were down 60%. Laboratory instrumentation was down about 14% due to the slowing activity and the destocking of the channel that I just discussed earlier. Food & Bev always down 5% overall, with a little over 20% decline of systems orders and modest growth of Consumables.
So a lot of volatility in the order performance since the channel and customer base assesses and adjusts to new economic assumptions. I'll address our expectations for what the trend will look like as we exit the year in my summary remarks in a few minutes.
And now I'll turn to Slide 14 and talk about the impact of the Blood business divestiture. As we previously stated, we entered into this transaction to sharpen our strategic focus and enable structure in the Company for core growth. For fiscal year '12, this business is expected to generate about $230  million of revenue, approximately $60 million of operating profit and $0.38 of EPS without considering the fixed cost associated with operating the business. During the third quarter, we generated $57 million dollars in revenue and $0.09 in pro forma EPS again unburden. So Pall, on an all-in basis, that's including the Blood product lines, generated pro forma EPS of $0.70 and $0.72 last year.
Now we expect to mitigate the earnings dilution associated with this transaction in '13, in fiscal year '13, through structural cost actions that are already underway. And we will also continue to supply Haemonetics who acquired the business with core filtration technology, which will offset some of the associated dilution as well.
We announced the transaction in April. As you we remember we expect to receive about $430 million after-tax subject to transactional adjustments and those are in process. We continue to evaluate various alternatives for the transaction proceeds and for capital deployment in general with a strong bias towards growth, particularly acquisitive growth. However, as we reflect on the environment we are facing, including our macro outlook, our balance sheet strengthened free cash profile, FX headwinds and asset pricing in the M&A market were sellers are still looking for top of market valuations, we are increasingly of a view that share repurchase may be a better alternative.
So with that, I'm going to turn this over to Lisa now for her to discuss the financial performance in the quarter, and then I'll come back and we'll wrap up and take a forward-look."

As a reminder, the numbers I'll discuss below are on a continuing operations basis. And additionally, both the Life Sciences and Industrial results have been restated for all periods to reflect the change in the allocation of certain shared costs on a continuing operations basis.
So let's start on Slide 15. I am going to give a high-level overview of the performance of each segment in 3 key areas: Gross margin, SG&A and operating margin. And I'll start with Industrial.
Industrial gross margin came in at 45.4%, a 70-basis point decline from last year. And this was driven by unfavorable mix from the decline in MicroE and relative increases in the systems business sales. This reduced margins by about 150 basis points, similar to what we saw in prior quarters. The decline in MicroE volume and some of the operations challenges in the quarter also resulted in absorption loss of about 100 bps.
We did have favorable savings from previously implemented continuous improvement activities in manufacturing, which substantially overcame cost inflation and added about 150 bps to Industrial's gross margin. Price added about 30 basis points to margin as well, but this was offset by some transactional FX headwind, which I'll discuss in a moment.
Industrial's SG&A increased by about $4.7 million or 4.5%, and that's 6% in local currency. And this is attributable to the allocation of shared cost primarily related to what Larry called hyper care costs, as well as continued emerging region investment. As Larry mentioned, we incurred considerably more cost and plants related to hyper care, and we expect some continuation of this in our fourth quarter.
Segment profit of $39 million generated margin of 11.6%, which was down 220 basis points from last year. And as we've mentioned throughout this year, we're executing several restructuring initiatives that will drive down SG&A to improve the Industrial segment's leverage, though a small portion of this savings will realize in the third quarter, we expect a considerable ramp-up in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2013.
Moving on to Life Sciences in Slide 16. Life Sciences gross margin increased by 70 basis points to 56.7%. Notable items were, one, favorable year-over-year comparison of some inventory recharges were recorded in last year's Q3, and this was favorable by about approximately 19 bps. The negative impact of transactional FX most prominent in our Life Sciences business, given the British pound euro exposure, and favorable pricing, which added about 40 bps, and this was offset by some mixed headwinds in the quarter.
SG&A increased about $7.3 million or 8.7% and this is 11% in local currency. Again, much of these increase relates to the same factors just discussed in Industrial's results related to the hyper care, as well as incremental SG&A related to the ForteBio acquisition.
Segment profit was a little over $75 million, a decrease of 4.4% or 3% from local currency, with segment margins declining 150 basis points to 23.7%. 
Turning now to Slide 17, where we will talk further about our euro risk. And on last quarter's call, we briefed you with respect to our FX profile. Our sales into the euro currency countries comprise about 25% of total Pall sales. About 70% to 80% of those cost of goods are denominated in British pounds or U.S. dollars, mostly in pounds primarily in Life Sciences.
In our forecast at the beginning of the year, we included the U.S. dollar at about 135 and British pound at about 0.89 to the euro. When we provided our updated guidance in our Q2 call with the euro at 131 to the dollar and 0.83 to the pound, we estimated a second half gross profit headwind of about $3.5 million and $6.5 million compared to our original outlook, which is about $0.02 to $0.04 of earnings per share. We experienced this impact in the third quarter where we estimate gross margins were negatively impacted by about $3 million against our original forecast, which equates to about $0.02.
Now on a year-over-year basis, there was about a $2.5 million headwinds to gross profit, also about $0.02. And this is not to be confused with the translational impact to EPS, which was an additional $0.01 negative for a combined year-over-year impact of $0.03, i.e., that's transactional plus translational FX impact earnings per share.
Turning now to the fourth quarter, given the recent continued weakening of the euro versus the pound to about 0.8 and the U.S. dollar to about 1.24, we expect year-over-year transactional headwind to gross profit of $6 million to $8 million dollars or $0.04 to $0.05 in our fourth quarter together with the impact of translation, a headwind of about $0.11 to $0.13 per share year-over-year.
Compared to the rates used in our forecast and guidance, this represents a combined headwind of $0.04 to EPS in Q4. So to be clear, for the full year of fiscal year '12, the combined translational and transactional impact of FX is estimated to be $0.08 negative compared to forecast and $0.06 negative compared to fiscal year 2011.
We are taking actions to mitigate our long euro exposure, and this includes hedging some forecasted transaction, as well as changing certain transactional flows to enhance natural hedging position.
Looking now in income taxes. The effective rate was 20.5 for the quarter compared to 35.6 last year. Last year's rate reflected a one-time impact or charge related to tax costs associated with the establishment of the company's Asian headquarters. The effective tax rate in Q3 FY '11 without that was 26.8 and the substantial reduction as a function of our ongoing planning strategies. 
Wrapping up the discussion about the P&L, net earnings from continuing operations were $70.9 million or $0.60 per share. And this compares to  $61.8 million or $0.52 per share last year. Looking at it on a pro forma basis, earnings per share is defined in our Appendix slides were $0.61 compared to $0.64. Bridging this decrease, operating profit decline was about $0.06, again of which $0.02 is transactional FX and foreign currency translation decreased EPS by about $0.01, and this was partly offset by the improvement in the tax rate, which contributed about $0.04.
Looking now at cash flow, and I am on Slide 19. Operating cash flow on the 9 months was $326 million. This represents a 16% increase and this was primarily driven by inventory reduction. Committed capital has continued to dampen free cash flow generation, and continued progress in capital management is an ongoing priority and post ERP capital spend will decline materially.  And we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. Excuse me. Our cash position stood at $536 million at the and of the quarter, and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 8.4%, and this compares to 9.1% as of the end of fiscal year '11, and we view some excess cash to pay down debt. So with that, I will turn this back to Larry."
185333,205046843,317382,"Pall Corp., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jun 07, 2012",2012-06-07,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Okay, thanks, Lisa. As we discussed earlier, we believe we will recover the Q3 miss related to the ERP implementation. Most importantly, we are entirely focused on serving our customers and fixing the meet earnings. The missed Q3 revenue that pushed Q4, a",685,"Okay, thanks, Lisa. As we discussed earlier, we believe we will recover the Q3 miss related to the ERP implementation. Most importantly, we are entirely focused on serving our customers and fixing the meet earnings. The missed Q3 revenue that pushed Q4, as well as the costs associated with the hyper care that we talked about, equated to about $0.10 of EPS in the quarter. The slowing macro environment will impact Q4 sales, and it will be difficult for us to achieve the previously stated full year estimate.
So the equation is roughly as follows: One, we will make up the third quarter miss. But two, slower orders in Europe. And three, FX will impact and will offset that we will be about $0.10 short of the objective that we communicated during our Q2 earnings call. And if you remember, that was achieving full-year performance at the midpoint of our originally stated EPS range of $3.07 to $3.32.
This update assumes about $0.12 of FX impact, and that's again transactional and translational combined in Q4 versus fiscal year '11. So that equates to $2.72 on a continuing operations basis. 
And I am sure you are wondering how to model 2013 for us given all that we've thrown out in this call. Let me attempt to at least frame up how I am thinking about next year.  And this is an early rough look basically to base your math on. In terms of revenue expectations, I think low single digit organic sales growth is realistic. On a regional basis, we expect increases in Asia and the Americas to more than offset a decline in Europe. And on every point of sales growth, so the third point  of organic sales growth will yield about $0.06 of EPS.
Additionally, our restructuring plans are ratcheting up as we speak to both protect 2013 but also to properly structure the company for the future. We have most of our senior team now in place, and we have well-defined action plans.  As such, we are targeting $100 million of structural cost actions over a multi-year period, of which more than 1/2 of that  $100 million will take effect in fiscal year 2013. 
So given the above, for pro forma basis beginning at $2.72 for this year, which excludes Blood, the math is very roughly as follows: We will achieve about 35% incremental margin on the organic sales growth, again that's the $0.06, the $0.06 EPS that I referred to on every organic sales dollar or sales point generated plus the benefit of the restructuring that I just referred to.
Lisa outlined our FX exposure and I discussed how we intend to and we discussed how to mitigate that, particularly the further dislocation. We'll quantify our planning assumptions next quarter, but you can do the math based on today's rates. So depending on how you model for the year-over-year sales growth that I just spoke to, that would set your foundation for 2013. Obviously, none of that math includes any EPS contribution from share repurchase as associated with the Blood business divestiture or otherwise.
And we're not sure there will be such a difficult economic environment, but we're planning for it. We're taking action now to perform well in spite of it. And we will provide far more clarity in our year-end call next quarter when we provide fiscal year 2013 guidance, but I wanted to give you a sense for how to apply again your math given our European exposure and the macro headlines.
And I'll say again, we have our team in place, and we have a very capable balance sheet. Our business model is very resilient as our performance in previous times of economic stress has shown. It's not unaffected by macroeconomic trends, but the nondiscretionary nature of many of our sales and the ability frankly for us to continue to spec and products through this kind of environment is comforting. And it will continue to support a good growth opportunity even in the softening global environment.
So with that, we're going to open the call to your questions."

Against the numbers that we posted in the quarter, it's a fairly small contributor. I think there's a lot of noise in the numbers as we can all see. Now there is another self-inflicted element to this in terms of frankly sales folks holding customers hands through a go-live process. And I think some of the orders number that you see in the quarter really reflects some of the distraction. That's not lost, it's a business that again you will see play still over the fourth quarter here and into the first.

And as we head into next year, again, we're pretty planning process, but we spent a fair amount of time given the nature of the situation at hand. It still supports a base growth opportunity next year in Asia of high single digit, if not double-digit. The Americas, I think indicative of what we saw exiting the third quarter, nice acceleration in some of the segments. And, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are seeing MicroE tick up pretty nicely on a sequential basis, and forward-looking indicators there are quite strong. Good news is when you think about mix as we head into next year, frankly our 2 strongest and highest margin businesses are being MicroE and BioPharm, basically have pretty decent forward-looking indicators at this point. So it is a very dynamic time, Rick. And I wouldn't want to send specifically to modeling systems organic orders performance as we head into 2013. But there is frankly there is some sanity in how we have done our analysis in looking at both base and systems that still provide a fair amount I think of comfort in at least the low single digit organic opportunity next year."

So one customer, who was divesting kind of their demand rates, I don't want to get more specific on that, but it's a large global customers that we did quite a bit of business with, we haven't lost any share with them by any means, it's just a matter of how they are thinking about adjusting their needs. And when you level that out, when you smooth that out, your comments, just to emphasize them, because they are important are that all of these European or American BioPharm customers are global. So regional macro issues, they have some impact any of these folks. But it's really a global market that our customers are selling into and frankly some of their fastest growth will continue to be in the emerging countries around the world for obvious reasons. So I think that without speaking specifically to what we think Q3, 4 and next year look like for BioPharm, you get to a Consumables assumption still pretty much in line with what we performed over the last couple of years, which is a very, very strong high single if not double-digit organic kind of pattern."

What can cycle and is proving to cycle right now to a much larger degree is the Lab instrumentation purchases. You have seen and heard about some of that from some of the others that have reported on a calendar fiscal year basis as to how they are seeing either by way of federal subsidy funding declines and/or research spending declines the relatively slow sales right now from instrumentation purchases associated with research. We spoke of that in our prepared remarks ago with respect to our instrumentation sales also, were relatively slow in the quarter. Now again we are seeing evidence of that improving as we look at May, but if I have to draw a comment relative to cyclicality in the Life Science space and where the more pronounced impact will be, it's likely to be research versus the production."

Understand that in the brands scheme of how major ERP implementations are handled and how radically wrong they can go, this is by no means a disaster. What we're talking about here is the equivalent of about 3 days of missed shipments. Now in reality, what it was is several weeks, and we are still kind of ramping up to full speed but almost there of missed signals to the supply chain. And we've got a very complex, vertically integrated supply chain internally and then also a very broad set of suppliers externally, again more complex than it needs to be that but it's not something that doesn't get fixed easily overnight. So the question is why didn't we foresee this? Why didn't we deal with it? Why didn't we better prepare more inventory? All those good things. We went live in some of the satellite operations as you maybe aware over the last couple of years, and we did learn from that, and we applied all that learning. This one really was the, as I mentioned, this is kind of the Big Bang. It tied everything together, and largely we executed quite well. We brought the people from the other regions in, so that we had not just the benefit of their documented learning, but them to be part of the go-live. We did all the appropriate training and things of the sort. But to give you a sense for what we're dealing with, the company has had a history of basically being kind of a workaround culture, not very strong with respect to operational process and procedure. So we're not just trying to push a button and go live with a new IT system here. We are trying to really retrain a company to think end-to-end, so that we can take full advantage of what a system of this capability brings and allow us to deal with all of the structural issues we have within operations and supply chain. What I would tell you is these things never are perfect. This one was not nearly as good as what I had anticipated. I think that we've now got the benefit of all the hindsight. There's no surprises of anything that we didn't understand. We've handheld our customers very appropriately. We're rebuilding the appropriate inventory position and that vertically integrated supply chain to make sure that we've got the appropriate stock in place. And all that frankly is against a backdrop of an incredibly dynamic and a very rapidly changing mix environment given what's going on in the economy simultaneously. So it's kind of the trifecta here of internal issues, a couple of them combined with the macroeconomic very dynamic environment that you see the bloody results for. The good news is I think we are on our way out. We have got an organization that's embraced this. It's going to be a great enabler for us, a very critical step for us to go to move forward as a company and mature. But it was painful for the last 4 weeks."

And what we are not going to do is pay top of market prices through acquisitions. Frankly, it doesn't make any sense. We've got plenty of balance sheet capability to do both -- both repurchase the shares if we decide to do that and aggressively acquire.

You tend to run into data migration issues. So when you are porting information from old system to new system, not all the information gets properly handheld through that and you can miss data, which in fact did happen in this case to some degree. You tend to try and use old people process to manage new systems. And in our cases, I' mentioned earlier, we've got a lot of -- we had a lot of tribal knowledge base workaround types of processes, and the new system frankly forces a rigor much more standard work process kind of mentality to help things get done. So a lot of the miss was people not understanding the system at very early stages and not acting appropriately or people thinking they had acted and frankly not having done so. Then you get into our vertically integrated supply chain and the signaling for purchasing and that's where it gets frankly pretty eerie and complicated, and that's where we went through several weeks or a few weeks at least of not having the right by Qs by way of the system and the people interface to the system such that it takes a while for that kind of that deficit and material supply to work its way back through to the point of finished goods that are available for shipment. So again, we can quantify everything in the quarter right down to customer and product and site and past due total, and all that obviously has been done.

I would concur. Not proud of it in any way. But let's put it in perspective. What we did accomplish in the quarter was take a very major step forward in terms of preparing the company for the future and to grow both organically and acquisitively. That's really the internal element of what we worked through in the quarter, and a little bit of work that we still got ahead of us in the fourth quarter. Now in terms of the environment, which is kind of unrelated but an important subject for us to consider, given the kind of where we report off calendar for fiscal year, we did see a fairly dynamic order pattern in the quarter. Again, I wouldn't draw trendlines out of the order pattern that we saw in the quarter. We do think that based on our May experience rate, what we have seen this last month, plus the history and how we think about how the breadth of the business plays against the cycle, you have an evidence of event sequential improvement in a couple of the businesses right now that are destined for that. That the assumptions that we provided in the call are fairly realistic. And beyond that, we've already got those action plans in place. We're prepared, we're underway with what the appropriate cost mitigation, set of things to do, any good company should be doing, we're on the way with that right now.

185333,205046843,317584,"Pall Corp., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jun 07, 2012",2012-06-07,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; Frank Moschella, Corporate Controller; and Brent Jones, our new VP of Finance.As you've seen from our press release last night, it was a difficult third quarter as our",1879,"Good morning. Thank you for joining us. I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; Frank Moschella, Corporate Controller; and Brent Jones, our new VP of Finance.
As you've seen from our press release last night, it was a difficult third quarter as our results were impacted more than anticipated by the weak economy in the Eurozone and a self-inflicted disruption in our supply chain, which was caused by the previously announced global go-live of our new ERP system. This last phase was the big one, encompassing 2,800 users at 28 locations in the Americas and it now links our systems worldwide.
While the ERP system clearly will have significant long-term benefits for the company and our temporary transition issues are being resolved, the disruption in the quarter meant that shipments of Consumables were delayed and we incurred substantial additional costs and what I'll call hyper care actions to mitigate the impact on our customers.
While disappointing, we are fortunate that our customers have been understanding and supportive, and I believe we're making very good progress in filling the backorders.
We expect to have caught up with the past due backlog by this August which, as you know, is the beginning of our fiscal year. So most of the revenue we lost in Q3 will be made up in this fourth quarter.
Unrelated to our ERP challenges, the macro environment is clearly softening. While the Americas order rate is showing signs of strengthening, we're highly cautious about the situation in Europe. We anticipate that the organic order rates in Europe will be better in Q4 and next year than what was reported in Q3 though.
As we'll get into momentarily, we're taking appropriate cost actions that are already underway to mitigate the potential impact on our fiscal year '13 profitability. We'll walk through both the orders and the sales performance by market and by geography, and I'll assume that you'll have a number of questions.
There's obviously a fair bit of noise in the Q3 results due to the enterprise system deployments, so it's important that we clearly distinguish the market versus self-inflicted performance to give you a sense as to how we see next year taking shape.
And it's not all bad news. We have line of sight to the actions within our control to protect profitability even if the global economy stumbles hard. 
With that, as an overview, our remarks this morning will be on a continuing operations basis, which exclude the results of the Blood product line that we are divesting. 
So now to the quarter.  We estimate that enterprise system challenges in the quarter cost us about 3 points of organic growth and about $0.10 per share in the quarter, both in terms of delayed sales and increased costs to mitigate the impact on customers. That's all on us, so-called self-inflicted, as I've said, temporary, not the economy or our end markets.
Going to move on to Slide 6. Going into the third quarter, as we discussed on our last call, we expect that second half sales growth to slow compared with the strong first half, which we grew sales by 10%. That outlook reflected a number of anticipated headwinds, the softening economy in Europe and slower growth in emerging Asia, including China. We also said that we anticipated tough mix in our Industrial segment for the remainder of the year, and all of this has proven to be the case.
Third quarter sales from continuing operations were $658 million or 2.5% growth over last year in local currency. Again, our conversion cost us almost 3 points of organic growth. Consumables and BioPharm, Food & Bev, Aerospace, in particular, were most impacted. So within the 2.5% growth that we realized, while Consumables were flat, system product sales increased 24%. 
So now I'm going to walk through a breakdown of both sales and orders by region and segment, get into a fair amount of detail.
On Slide 7, on a geographic basis, sales in the Americas were down about 1.5%. Again the ERP conversion was centered here. Europe sales grew about 1%, with weakness in several key markets, which I'll cover in a moment. Asia had a good quarter overall, with sales growth of over 9%, with most major markets doing well and despite MicroE, which was down 8% organically.
Relative to global segment performance, moving on to Slides 8 and 9, Life Sciences grew 4% while Industrial grew just over 1%. Consumable sales were up 1% in Life Sciences and down about 2% in Industrial. And if you look at Slide 8, in Life Sciences, Pharmaceutical consumables sales were up 9%, but we realized a double-digit decline in Lab instrumentation sales. The 3 issues contributed to the Lab decline: One is that's where we experienced the slower book and turn activity; two, our largest channel destocked to some degree; and three, we didn't ship what we had the orders for given the ERP issues.
And while Food & Bev had an exceptionally strong systems quarter, $23 million in systems, base sales declined 10%. A variety of factors explain this, including big organic comps that included of wine distribution business that we divested at the beginning of the year, reducing Food & Bev sales by about 4%, but the bigger contributor to the decline were the ERP implementation and the European markets volume.
Medical, within the Life Science segment, was down in the quarter 1.5%, reflecting pressure on hospital spending in Western countries. 
And on Slide 9, within Industrial, Microelectronics sales declined 8% as I said earlier. This is mainly due to continued softness in IC production. However, we're beginning to see signs of recovery with increased capital spending by the chip makers. Aerospace sales were up 1%. Commercial Aerospace sales were down 10%, while Military Aerospace sales increased about 13%.
Sales in Process Technologies within Industrial, that's the Energy & Water process markets, Machinery & Equipment and OEM markets, increased almost 5% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by growth in the Energy markets. And Energy sales grew about 16% with good broad-based underlying market drivers.
Muni Water sales were down 14% as capital spend for water plants remained weak with deferred spending and delayed project decision-making.
so again, in total, strong system sales in the quarter offset by slow consumable sales, of which again most of it's on us, our execution. And again we would have realized somewhere between 5% and 6% local currency growth had we not been hampered with the conversion challenges.
I'm going to move on to orders on Slide 10. The performance in the quarter was a function of our execution to some degree, but it's really more about the macro environment. We also though faced very stiff 2011 orders comps when you look at the organic orders performance in total. Orders were down 9% compared to up almost 11% a year ago. This was driven largely by a 42% decline in systems compared to a 43% increase last year. We attribute some of the systems orders shortfall to timing, and this is not an unusual situation for capital projects.  And we've already realized some of the Q3 planned orders in May. 
Consumable orders were down 2%, and that included a 3.5% growth in Life Sciences but an 8% drop in Industrial. 
So now let's look at orders by region.  Orders were down 20% in Europe, driven by systems, which were down 60%. Again, some of that tough comps, some is project delays, and we've already realized or will shortly some of that delayed activity, but most definitely it's macro influence as well.
Conversely, orders in the Americas increased about 5%, about the same in Consumables as in systems. Within Life Sciences, Medical orders, which are book and turn, increased 13%. BioPharm orders were up 20%. We saw exceptional demand for our new Octet and BLItz products, which came with the ForteBio acquisition. And orders decreased about 6% in Asia. And double-digit growth in Life Sciences was offset by a similar rate of decline in the Larger industrial markets in Asia. And Microelectronics remained down, almost 15%.
Now I'm going to walk through orders by segments. Within Industrial, Process Technologies was down about 15%, driven by a 46% decline in system orders and Energy & Water with Machinery & Equipment flat. And as I said earlier Military Aerospace was down given the blanket order tough comps.
Commercial Aerospace was up over 22%, with growth accelerating nicely. The MicroE orders were down 10%, reflecting continued weakness experienced over the last 4 quarters. However, we are seeing recovery, as I mentioned earlier. In May, we saw as well Microelectronic orders increased sequentially by 12%, so that's a May comment.
Now in the Life Sciences, and we're on Slide 13. Both Medical and BioPharm were flat. Within BioPharm, Consumables were up 10% and systems were down 60%. Laboratory instrumentation was down about 14% due to the slowing activity and the destocking of the channel that I just discussed earlier. Food & Bev was down 5% overall, with a little over 20% decline of systems orders and modest growth in Consumables.
So a lot of volatility in the order performance since the channel and customer base assesses and adjusts to new economic assumptions. I'll address our expectations for what the trend will look like as we exit the year in my summary remarks in a few minutes.
And now I'll turn to Slide 14 and talk about the impact of the Blood business divestiture. As we previously stated, we entered into this transaction to sharpen our strategic focus and enable structuring the company for core growth. For fiscal year '12, this business is expected to generate about $230 million of revenue, approximately $60 million of operating profit and $0.38 of EPS without considering the fixed cost associated with operating the business. 
During the third quarter, generated $57 million in revenue and $0.09 in pro forma EPS, again unburdened. So Pall, on an all-in basis, that's including the Blood product lines, generated pro forma EPS of $0.70 and $0.72 last year.
Now we expect to mitigate the earnings dilution associated with this transaction in '13, in fiscal year '13, through structural cost actions that are already underway. And we will also continue to supply Haemonetics, who acquired the business, with core filtration technology, which will offset some of the associated dilution as well.
We announced the transaction in April. As you we remember, we expect to receive about $430 million after-tax subject to transactional adjustments and those are in process. We continue to evaluate various alternatives for the transaction proceeds and for capital deployment in general with a strong bias toward growth, particularly acquisitive growth. However, as we reflect on the environment we are facing, including the macro outlook, our balance sheet strength and free cash profile, the FX headwinds and asset pricing in the M&A market where sellers are still looking for top-of-market valuations, we are increasingly of a view that share repurchase may be a better alternative.
So with that, I'm going to turn this over to Lisa now for her to discuss the financial performance in the quarter, and then I'll come back and we'll wrap up and take a forward-look."

As a reminder, the numbers I'll be discussing below are on a continuing operations basis. And additionally, both the Life Sciences and Industrial results have been restated for all periods to reflect the change in the allocation of certain shared costs on a continuing operations basis.
So let's start on Slide 15. I am going to give a high-level overview of the performance of each segment in 3 key areas: Gross margin, SG&A and operating margin. And I'll start with Industrial.
Industrial gross margin came in at 45.4%, a 70 basis point decline from last year. And this was driven by unfavorable mix from the decline in MicroE and relative increase in the systems business sales, and this reduced margins by about 150 basis points and similar to what we saw in prior quarters. The decline in MicroE volume and some of the operations challenges in the quarter also resulted in absorption loss of about 100 bps.
We did have favorable themes from previously implemented continuous improvement activities in manufacturing, which substantially overcame cost inflation and added about 150 bps to Industrial's gross margin. Price added about 30 basis points to margin as well, but this was offset by some transactional FX headwind, which I'll discuss in a moment.
Industrial's SG&A increased by about $4.7 million or 4.5%, and that's 6% in local currency. And this is attributable to the allocation of shared costs primarily related to what Larry called hyper care costs, as well as continued emerging region investment. As Larry mentioned, we incurred considerably more cost than planned related to hyper care, and we expect some continuation of this in our fourth quarter.
Segment profit of $39 million generated margin of 11.6%, which was down 220 basis points from last year. And as we've mentioned throughout this year, we are executing several restructuring initiatives that will drive down SG&A to improve the Industrial segment's leverage. Though a small portion of this savings were realized in the third quarter, we expect a considerable ramp-up in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2013.
Moving on to Life Sciences and Slide 16. Life Sciences gross margin increased by 70 basis points to 56.7%. Notable items were: One, favorable year-over-year comparison of some inventory recharges were recorded in last year's Q3, and this was favorable by about approximately 90 bps; the negative impact of transactional FX, most prominent in our Life Sciences business given the British pound euro exposure; and favorable pricing, which added about 40 bps, and this was offset by some mixed headwinds in the quarter.
SG&A increased about $7.3 million or 8.7%, and this is 11% in local currency. Again, much of this increase relates to the same factors just discussed in Industrial's results related to the hyper care, as well as incremental SG&A related to the ForteBio acquisition.
Segment profit was a little over $75 million, a decrease of 4.4% or 3% from local currency, with segment margins declining 150 basis points to 23.7%. 
Turning now to Slide 17, where we'll talk further about our euro risk. And on last quarter's call, we briefed you with respect to our FX profile. Our sales into the euro-currency countries comprise about 25% of total Pall sales. About 70% to 80% of those cost of goods are denominated in British pounds or U.S. dollars, mostly in pounds primarily in Life Sciences.
In our forecast at the beginning of the year, we included the U.S. dollar at about $1.35 and the British pound at about GBP 0.89 to the euro. When we provided our updated guidance in our Q2 call with the euro at 1.31 to the dollar and 0.83 to the pound, we estimated a second half gross profit headwinds of about $3.5 million to $6.5 million compared to our original outlook, which is about $0.02 to $0.04 of earnings per share. We experienced this impact in the third quarter where we estimate gross margins were negatively impacted by about $3 million against our original forecast, which equates to about $0.02.
Now on a year-over-year basis, there was about a $2.5 million headwind to gross profit, also about $0.02. And this is not to be confused with the translational impact to EPS, which was an additional $0.01 negative for a combined year-over-year impact of $0.03, i.e., that's transactional plus translational FX impact to earnings per share.
Turning now to the fourth quarter, given the recent continued weakening of the euro versus the pound to about GBP 0.8 and the U.S. dollar to about $1.24, we expect year-over-year transactional headwind to gross profit of $6 million to $8 million or $0.04 to $0.05 in our fourth quarter together with the impact of translation, a headwind of about $0.11 to $0.13 per share year-over-year.
Compared to the rates used in our forecast and guidance, this represents a combined headwind of $0.04 to EPS in Q4. So to be clear, for the full year of fiscal year '12, the combined translational and transactional impact of FX is estimated to be $0.08 negative compared to forecast and $0.06 negative compared to fiscal year 2011.
We are taking actions to mitigate our long euro exposure, and this includes hedging some forecasted transactions, as well as changing certain transactional flows to enhance natural hedging positions.
Looking now at income taxes. The effective rate was 20.5% for the quarter compared to 35.6% last year. Last year's rate reflected a onetime impact or charge related to the tax costs associated with the establishment of the company's Asian headquarters. The effective tax rate in Q3 FY '11 without that was 26.8% and the substantial reduction as a function of our ongoing planning strategies. 
Wrapping up the discussion about the P&L, net earnings from continuing operations were $70.9 million or $0.60 per share. And this compares to  $61.8 million or $0.52 per share last year. Looking at it on a pro forma basis, earnings per share as defined in our Appendix slides were $0.61 compared to $0.64. Bridging this decrease, operating profit decline was about $0.06, again, of which $0.02 is transactional FX and foreign currency translation decreased EPS by about $0.01, and this was partly offset by the improvement in the tax rate, which contributed about $0.04.
Looking now at cash flow, and I'm on Slide 19. Operating cash flow on the 9 months was $326 million, which represents a 16% increase and this was primarily driven by inventory reduction. Committed capital has continued to dampen free cash flow generation, and continued progress in capital management is an ongoing priority and post-ERP capital spend will decline materially. And we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. Our cash position stood at $536 million at the end of the quarter, and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 8.4%, and this compares to 9.1% as of the end of fiscal year '11. And we've used some excess cash to pay down debt. 
So with that, I will turn this back to Larry."
185333,205046843,317584,"Pall Corp., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jun 07, 2012",2012-06-07,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Okay, thanks, Lisa. As we discussed earlier, we believe we'll recover the Q3 miss related to the ERP implementation. Most importantly, we are entirely focused on serving our customers and fixing the meet earnings. The missed Q3 revenue that pushed Q4, as",682,"Okay, thanks, Lisa. As we discussed earlier, we believe we'll recover the Q3 miss related to the ERP implementation. Most importantly, we are entirely focused on serving our customers and fixing the meet earnings. The missed Q3 revenue that pushed Q4, as well as the costs associated with the hyper care that we've talked about, equated to about $0.10 of EPS in the quarter. The slowing macro environment will impact Q4 sales, and it will be difficult for us to achieve the previously stated full year estimate.
So the equation is roughly as follows: One, we'll make up the third quarter miss; but two, slower orders in Europe; and three, FX will impact and will offset so that we will be about $0.10 short of the objective that we communicated during our Q2 earnings call. And if you remember, that was achieving full year performance at the midpoint of our originally stated EPS range of $3.07 to $3.32.
This update assumes about $0.12 of FX impact, and that's, again, the transactional and translational combined in Q4 versus fiscal year '11. So that equates to $2.72 on a continuing operations basis. 
And I'm sure you're wondering how to model 2013 for us given all that we've thrown out in this call. Let me attempt to, at least, frame up how I'm thinking about next year. And this is an early rough look basically to base your math on. In terms of revenue expectations, I think low single-digit organic sales growth is realistic. On a regional basis, we expect increases in Asia and the Americas to more than offset a decline in Europe. And on every point of sales growth, so that's every point of organic sales growth, will yield about $0.06 of EPS.
Additionally, our restructuring plans are ratcheting up as we speak to both protect 2013 but also to properly structure the company for the future. We have most of our senior team now in place, and we have well-defined action plans. As such, we're targeting $100 million of structural cost actions over a multi-year period, of which more than 1/2 of that $100 million will take effect in fiscal year 2013. 
So given the above, from a pro forma basis beginning at $2.72 for this year, which excludes Blood, the math is very roughly as follows: We'll achieve about 35% incremental margin on the organic sales growth, again, that's the $0.06, the $0.06 EPS that I referred to on every organic sales dollar or sales point generated plus the benefit of the restructuring that I just referred to.
Now Lisa outlined our FX exposure, and I discussed how we intend to, and we discussed how to mitigate that, particularly the further dislocation. We'll quantify our planning assumptions next quarter, but you can do the math based on today's rates. So depending on how you model for the year-over-year sales growth that I just spoke to, that would set your foundation for 2013. Obviously, none of that math includes any EPS contribution from share repurchase as associated with the Blood business divestiture or otherwise.
And we're not sure that it will be such a difficult economic environment, but we're planning for it. We're taking action now to perform well in spite of it. And we'll provide far more clarity in our year-end call next quarter when we provide fiscal year 2013 guidance, but I wanted to give you a sense for how to apply, again, your math given our European exposure and the macro headlines.
And I'll say again, we have our team in place, and we have a very capable balance sheet. Our business model is very resilient as our performance in previous times of economic stress had shown. It's not unaffected by macroeconomic trends, but the nondiscretionary nature of many of our sales and the ability, frankly, for us to continue to spec in products through this kind of environment is comforting. And it will continue to support a good growth opportunity even in the softening global environment.
So with that, we're going to open the call to your questions."

Against the numbers that we posted in the quarter, it's a fairly small contributor. I think there's a lot of noise in the numbers as we can all see. Now there is another self-inflicted element to this in terms of, frankly, sales folks holding customers hands through a go-live process. And I think some of the orders number that you see in the quarter really reflects some of the distraction. That's not lost, it's business that, I think, again we'll see placed over the fourth quarter here and into the first.

The Americas, I think indicative of what we saw exiting the third quarter, nice acceleration in some of the segments. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're seeing MicroE tick up pretty nicely on a sequential basis and forward-looking indicators there are quite strong. Good news is when you think about mix as we head into next year, frankly, our 2 strongest and highest margin businesses, that being MicroE and BioPharm, basically have pretty decent forward-looking indicators at this point. So it is a very dynamic time, Rick. And I wouldn't want to steer specifically to modeling systems organic orders performance as we head into 2013, but there is -- frankly, there's some sanity in how we've done our analysis in looking at both base and systems that still provides a fair amount of, I think, comfort in at least the low single-digit organic opportunity next year."

So one customer, who was divesting kind of their demand rates, I don't want to get too more specific on that, but it's a very large global customer that we do quite a bit of business with. We haven't lost any share with them by any means, it's just a matter of how they're thinking about adjusting their needs. When you level that out or when you smooth that out, your comments, just to emphasize them, because they're important, are that all of these European or American BioPharm customers are global. So regional macro issues, they have some impact on any of these folks. But it's really a global market that our customers are selling into and, frankly, some of their fastest growth will continue to be in the emerging countries around the world for obvious reason. So I think that, without speaking specifically to what we think Q3, 4 and next year look like for BioPharm, you get to a consumables assumption still pretty much in line with what we performed over the last couple of years, which is a very, very strong high-single, if not double-digit organic kind of pattern."

I was just trying to put in context what we're seeing about Europe versus your outlook for the year. So you're not seeing anything currently in terms of the customers that you deal with that would suggest that we're in kind of a broader slowdown for that -- for investment in that space right now."

So the majority of our business is in the actual processing, the manufacturing of the various drugs. And what we tend to drive most of our revenue from is the ongoing consumables associated with producing them. So that doesn't cycle so heavily. What can cycle, and is proving to cycle right now to a much larger degree, is the Lab instrumentation purchases. And you've seen and heard about some of that from some of the others that have reported on a calendar fiscal year basis as to how they're seeing, either by way of federal subsidy funding declines and/or research spending declines, the relatively slow sales right now from instrumentation purchases associated with research. We spoke to that a minute -- in our prepared remarks ago with respect to our instrumentation sales also, we're relatively slow in the quarter. Now again, we're seeing evidence of that improving as we look at May. But if I had to draw a comment relative to cyclicality in the Life Science space and where the more pronounced impact will be -- it's likely to be a research versus the production."

And we'll -- it's not an easy fix, but we'll get it fixed. I think a good chunk of it in 2013. We are looking at various things Lisa spoke to them briefly around how we can basically hedge forecasted transactions. But also in some cases, we've got just the transactions themselves denominated in currencies i.e., we've got customer contracts in British pounds for customers that don't need to be sold in British pound. So that's the stuff that we can fix either way to make sure that we end up with a more balanced and appropriately hedged exposure to the currency if it does continue to dislocate."

Understand that in the brands or scheme of how major ERP implementations are handled and how radically wrong they can go, this is by no means a disaster. What we're talking about here is the equivalent of about 3 days of missed shipments. Now in reality, what it was is several weeks, and we're still kind of ramping up to full speed but almost there of missed signals to the supply chain. And we've got a very complex, vertically integrated supply chain internally and then also very broad set of suppliers externally. Again, more complex than it needs to be that but not something that's going to get fixed easily overnight. So the question is why didn't we foresee this? Why didn't we deal with it? Why didn't we better prepare more inventory? All those good things. We went live in some of the satellite operations as you may be aware over the last couple of years, and we did learn from that, and we applied all that learning. This one really was the -- as I mentioned, this is kind of the Big Bang. It tied everything together, and largely we executed quite well. We brought the people from the other regions in, so that we had not just the benefit of their documented learning, but them to be part of the go-live. We did all the appropriate training and things of the sort. But to give you a sense for what we're dealing with, the company has had a history of basically being kind of a workaround culture, not very strong with respect to operational process and procedure. So we're not just trying to push a button and go live with a new IT system here. We're trying to really retrain a company to think end to end, so that we can take full advantage of what a system of this capability brings and allow us to deal with all of the structural issues we have within operations and supply chain. What I would tell you is these things never are perfect. This one was not nearly as good as what I had anticipated. I think that we've now got the benefit of all the hindsight. There's no surprises of anything that we didn't understand. We've handheld our customers very appropriately. We're rebuilding the appropriate inventory position, and that vertically integrated supply chain to make sure that we've got the appropriate stock in place. And all that, frankly, is against a backdrop of an incredibly dynamic and very rapidly changing mix environment given what's going on in the economy simultaneously. So it's kind of the trifecta here of internal issues. A couple of them combined with the macroeconomic very dynamic environment that you see the bloody results for. So the good news is, I think, we're on our way out. We've got an organization that's embraced this. It's going to be a great enabler for us, a very critical step for us to take -- to go to move forward as a company and mature. But it was painful for the last several weeks."

And what we're not going to do is pay top-of-market prices through acquisitions. Frankly, it doesn't make any sense. We've got plenty of balance sheet capability to do both.

You tend to run into data migration issues. So when you're porting information from old system to new system, not all the information gets properly handheld through that and you can miss data, which, in fact, that did happen in this case to some degree. You tend to try and use old people process to manage new systems. And in our case, as I  mentioned earlier, we've got a lot of -- or we had a lot of tribal knowledge-based workaround types of processes. And the new system frankly forces a rigor much more standard work process kind of mentality to how things get done. So a lot of the miss was people not understanding the system at very early stages and not acting appropriately or people thinking they had acted and frankly not having done so. Then you get into our vertically integrated supply chain and the signaling for purchasing and that's where it gets frankly pretty hairy and complicated, and that's where we went through several weeks or a few weeks, at least, of not having the right buy queues by way of the system and the people interface to the system such that it takes a while for that kind of that deficit and material supply to work its way back through to the point of finished goods that are available for shipment. So again, we can quantify everything in the quarter right down to customer and product and site and past due total, and all that obviously has been done.

I would concur. Not proud of it in any way. But let's put it in perspective. What we did accomplish in the quarter was take a very major step forward in terms of preparing the company for the future and to grow, both organically and acquisitively. That's really the internal element of what we worked through in the quarter, and a little bit of work that we still got ahead of us in the fourth quarter. Now in terms of the environment, which is kind of unrelated but an important subject for us to consider, given the kind of where we report off calendar fiscal year, we did see a fairly dynamic order pattern in the quarter. Again, I wouldn't draw trend lines out of the order pattern that we saw in the quarter. We do think that based on our May experience rate and what we have seen this last month, plus the history and how we think about how the breadth of the business plays against the cycle, you have an evidence of even sequential improvement in a couple of the businesses right now that are destined for that. That the assumptions that we provided in the call are fairly realistic. And beyond that, we've already got those action plans in place. We're prepared, we're underway with what the appropriate cost mitigation set of things to do, any good company should be doing, we're on the way with that right now.

I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; Frank Moschella, Corporate Controller; and Brent Jones, our new VP of Finance.As you've seen from our press release last night, it was a difficult third quarter as our",1881,"Good morning. Thank you for joining us. I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; Frank Moschella, Corporate Controller; and Brent Jones, our new VP of Finance.
As you've seen from our press release last night, it was a difficult third quarter as our results were impacted more than anticipated by the weak economy in the Eurozone and a self-inflicted disruption in our supply chain, which was caused by the previously announced global go-live of our new ERP system. This last phase was the big one, encompassing 2,800 users at 28 locations in the Americas, and it now links our systems worldwide.
While the ERP system clearly will have significant long-term benefits for the company and our temporary transition issues are being resolved, the disruption in the quarter meant that shipments of consumables were delayed and we incurred substantial additional costs in what I'll call hyper care actions to mitigate the impact on our customers.
While disappointing, we are fortunate that our customers have been understanding and supportive, and I believe we're making very good progress in filling the backorders. We expect to have caught up with the past due backlog by this August, which, as you know, is the beginning of our fiscal year. So most of the revenue we lost in Q3 will be made up in this fourth quarter.
Unrelated to our ERP challenges, the macro environment is clearly softening. While the Americas order rate is showing signs of strengthening, we're highly cautious about the situation in Europe. We anticipate that the organic order rates in Europe will be better in Q4 and next year than what was reported in Q3 though.
As we'll get into momentarily, we're taking appropriate cost actions that are already underway to mitigate the potential impact on our fiscal year '13 profitability. We'll walk through both the orders and the sales performance by market and by geography, and I'll assume that you'll have a number of questions. There's obviously a fair bit of noise in the Q3 results due to the enterprise system deployments, so it's important that we clearly distinguish the market versus self-inflicted performance to give you a sense as to how we see next year taking shape. And it's not all bad news. We have line of sight to the actions within our control to protect profitability even if the global economy stumbles hard. 
With that, as an overview, our remarks this morning will be on a continuing operations basis, which exclude the results of the Blood product line that we are divesting. 
So now to the quarter. We estimate that enterprise system challenges in the quarter cost us about 3 points of organic growth and about $0.10 per share in the quarter, both in terms of delayed sales and increased costs to mitigate the impact on customers. That's all on us, so-called self-inflicted, as I've said, temporary, not the economy or our end markets.
Going to move on to Slide 6. Going into the third quarter, as we discussed on our last call, we expect that second half sales growth to slow compared with the strong first half, which we grew sales by 10%. That outlook reflected a number of anticipated headwinds, the softening economy in Europe and slower growth in emerging Asia, including China. We also said that we anticipate a tough mix in our Industrial segment for the remainder of the year, and all of this has proven to be the case.
Third quarter sales from continuing operations were $658 million or 2.5% growth over last year in local currency. Again, our conversion cost us almost 3 points of organic growth. Consumables and BioPharm, Food & Bev, Aerospace, in particular, were most impacted. So within the 2.5% growth that we realized, while consumables were flat, system product sales increased 24%. 
So now I'm going to walk through a breakdown of both sales and orders by region and segment, get into a fair amount of detail.
On Slide 7, on a geographic basis, sales in the Americas were down about 1.5%. Again the ERP conversion was centered here. Europe sales grew about 1%, with weakness in several key markets, which I'll cover in a moment. Asia had a good quarter overall, with sales growth of over 9%, with most major markets doing well and despite MicroE, which was down 8% organically.
Relative to global segment performance, moving on to Slides 8 and 9, Life Sciences grew 4% while Industrial grew just over 1%. Consumable sales were up 1% in Life Sciences and down about 2% in Industrial. And if you look at Slide 8, in Life Sciences, Pharmaceutical consumable sales were up 9%, but we realized a double-digit decline in Lab instrumentation sales. The 3 issues contributed to the Lab decline: One is, that's where we experienced the slower book and turn activity; two, our largest channel destocked to some degree; and three, we didn't ship what we had the orders for, given the ERP issues.
And while Food & Bev had an exceptionally strong systems quarter, $23 million in systems base sales declined 10%. A variety of factors explain this, including big organic comps that included of wine distribution business that we divested at the beginning of the year, reducing Food & Bev sales by about 4%, but the bigger contributor to the decline were the ERP implementation and the European markets slowing.
Medical, within the Life Science segment, was down in the quarter 1.5%, reflecting pressure on hospital spending in Western countries. 
And on Slide 9, within Industrial, Microelectronics sales declined 8% as I said earlier. This is mainly due to continued softness in IC production. However, we're beginning to see signs of recovery with increased capital spending by the chip makers. Aerospace sales were up 1%. Commercial Aerospace sales were down 10%, while Military Aerospace sales increased about 13%.
Sales in Process Technologies within Industrial, that's the Energy & Water process markets and Machinery & Equipment and OEM markets, increased almost 5% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by growth in the Energy markets. And Energy sales grew about 16% with good broad-based underlying market drivers.
Muni Water sales were down 14% as capital spend for water plants remained weak with deferred spending and delayed project decision-making.
So again, in total, strong system sales in the quarter offset by slow consumable sales, of which again, most of it's on us, our execution. And again we would have realized somewhere between 5% and 6% local currency growth had we not been hampered with the conversion challenges.
I'm going to move on to orders on Slide 10. The performance in the quarter was a function of our execution to some degree, but it's really more about the macro environment. We also though faced very stiff 2011 orders comps when you look at the organic orders performance in total. Orders were down 9% compared to up almost 11% a year ago. This was driven largely by a 42% decline in systems compared to a 43% increase last year. We attribute some of the systems orders shortfall to timing, and this is not an unusual situation for capital projects. And we've already realized some of the Q3 planned orders in May. Consumable orders were down 2%, and that included a 3.5% growth in Life Sciences, but an 8% drop in Industrial. 
So now let's look at orders by region. Orders were down 20% in Europe, driven by systems, which were down 60%. Again, some of that’s tough comps, some is project delays. And we've already realized, or will shortly, some of that delayed activity, but most definitely it's macro influence as well.
Conversely, orders in the Americas increased about 5%, about the same in consumables as in systems. Within Life Sciences, Medical orders, which are book and turn, increased 13%. BioPharm orders were up 20%. We saw exceptional demand for our new Octet and BLItz products, which came with the ForteBio acquisition. And orders decreased about 6% in Asia. And double-digit growth in Life Sciences was offset by a similar rate of decline in the larger industrial markets in Asia. And Microelectronics remained down, almost 15%.
Now I'm going to walk through orders by segments. Within Industrial, Process Technologies was down about 15%, driven by a 46% decline in system orders and Energy & Water, with Machinery & Equipment flat. And as I said earlier Military Aerospace was down given the blanket order tough comps.
Commercial Aerospace was up over 22%, with growth accelerating nicely. The MicroE orders were down 10%, reflecting continued weakness experienced over the last 4 quarters. However, we are seeing recovery, as I mentioned earlier. In May, we saw as well Microelectronic orders increased sequentially by 12%, so that's a May comment.
Now on to Life Sciences, and we're on Slide 13. Both Medical and BioPharm were flat. Within BioPharm, consumables were up 10% and systems were down 60%. Laboratory instrumentation was down about 14% due to the slowing activity and the destocking of the channel that I just discussed earlier. Food & Bev was down 5% overall, with a little over 20% decline in systems orders and modest growth in consumables.
So a lot of volatility in the order performance since the channel and customer base assesses and adjusts to new economic assumptions. I'll address our expectations for what the trend will look like as we exit the year in my summary remarks in a few minutes.
And now I'll turn to Slide 14 and talk about the impact of the Blood business divestiture. As we previously stated, we entered into this transaction to sharpen our strategic focus and enable structuring the company for core growth. For fiscal year '12, this business is expected to generate about $230 million of revenue, approximately $60 million of operating profit and $0.38 of EPS without considering the fixed cost associated with operating the business. During the third quarter, generated $57 million in revenue and $0.09 in pro forma EPS, again unburdened. So Pall, on an all-in basis, that's including the Blood product lines, generated pro forma EPS of $0.70 and $0.72 last year.
Now we expect to mitigate the earnings dilution associated with this transaction in '13, in fiscal year '13, through structural cost actions that are already underway. And we will also continue to supply Haemonetics, who acquired the business, with core filtration technology, which will offset some of the associated dilution as well.
We announced the transaction in April. As you we remember, we expect to receive about $430 million after-tax, subject to transactional adjustments and those are in process. We continue to evaluate various alternatives for the transaction proceeds and for capital deployment in general, with a strong bias toward growth, particularly acquisitive growth. However, as we reflect on the environment we are facing, including the macro outlook, our balance sheet strength and free cash profile, the FX headwinds and asset pricing in the M&A market where sellers are still looking for top-of-market valuations, we are increasingly of a view that share repurchase may be a better alternative.
So with that, I'm going to turn this over to Lisa now for her to discuss the financial performance in the quarter, and then I'll come back and we'll wrap up and take a forward-look."
185333,205046843,317748,"Pall Corp., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jun 07, 2012",2012-06-07,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Okay, thanks, Larry. Good morning, everyone. As a reminder, the numbers I'll be discussing below are on a continuing operations basis. And additionally, both the Life Sciences and Industrial results have been restated for all periods to reflect the change",1170,"Okay, thanks, Larry. Good morning, everyone. As a reminder, the numbers I'll be discussing below are on a continuing operations basis. And additionally, both the Life Sciences and Industrial results have been restated for all periods to reflect the change in the allocation of certain shared costs on a continuing operations basis.
So let's start on Slide 15. I am going to give a high-level overview of the performance of each segment in 3 key areas: Gross margin, SG&A and operating margin. And I'll start with Industrial.
Industrial gross margin came in at 45.4%, a 70 basis point decline from last year. And this was driven by unfavorable mix from the decline in MicroE and relative increase in the systems business sales, and this reduced margins by about 150 basis points and similar to what we saw in prior quarters. The decline in MicroE volume and some of the operations challenges in the quarter also resulted in absorption loss of about 100 bps.
We did have favorable themes from previously implemented continuous improvement activities in manufacturing, which substantially overcame cost inflation and added about 150 bps to Industrial's gross margin. Price added about 30 basis points to margin as well, but this was offset by some transactional FX headwind, which I'll discuss in a moment.
Industrial's SG&A increased by about $4.7 million or 4.5%, and that's 6% in local currency. And this is attributable to the allocation of shared costs primarily related to what Larry called hyper care costs, as well as continued emerging region investment. As Larry mentioned, we incurred considerably more cost than planned related to hyper care, and we expect some continuation of this in our fourth quarter.
Segment profit of $39 million generated margin of 11.6%, which was down 220 basis points from last year. And as we've mentioned throughout this year, we are executing several restructuring initiatives that will drive down SG&A to improve the Industrial segment's leverage. Though a small portion of this savings were realized in the third quarter, we expect a considerable ramp-up in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2013.
Moving on to Life Sciences and Slide 16. Life Sciences gross margin increased by 70 basis points to 56.7%. Notable items were: One, favorable year-over-year comparison of some inventory recharges were recorded in last year's Q3, and this was favorable by about approximately 90 bps; the negative impact of transactional FX, most prominent in our Life Sciences business given the British pound euro exposure; and favorable pricing, which added about 40 bps, and this was offset by some mixed headwinds in the quarter.
SG&A increased about $7.3 million or 8.7%, and this is 11% in local currency. Again, much of this increase relates to the same factors just discussed in Industrial's results related to the hyper care, as well as incremental SG&A related to the ForteBio acquisition.
Segment profit was a little over $75 million, a decrease of 4.4% or 3% from local currency, with segment margins declining 150 basis points to 23.7%. 
Turning now to Slide 17, where we'll talk further about our euro risk. And on last quarter's call, we briefed you with respect to our FX profile. Our sales into the euro-currency countries comprise about 25% of total Pall sales. About 70% to 80% of those cost of goods are denominated in British pounds or U.S. dollars, mostly in pounds, primarily in Life Sciences.
In our forecast at the beginning of the year, we included the U.S. dollar at about $1.35 and the British pound at about GBP 0.89 to the euro. When we provided our updated guidance in our Q2 call with the euro at 1.31 to the dollar and 0.83 to the pound, we estimated a second half gross profit headwind of about $3.5 million to $6.5 million compared to our original outlook, which is about $0.02 to $0.04 of earnings per share. We experienced this impact in the third quarter where we estimate gross margins were negatively impacted by about $3 million against our original forecast, which equates to about $0.02.
Now on a year-over-year basis, there was about a $2.5 million headwind to gross profit, also about $0.02. And this is not to be confused with the translational impact to EPS, which was an additional $0.01 negative for a combined year-over-year impact of $0.03, i.e., that's transactional plus translational FX impact to earnings per share.
Turning now to the fourth quarter, given the recent continued weakening of the euro versus the pound to about GBP 0.8 and the U.S. dollar to about $1.24, we expect year-over-year transactional headwinds to gross profit of $6 million to $8 million or $0.04 to $0.05 in our fourth quarter. Together with the impact of translation, a headwind of about $0.11 to $0.13 per share year-over-year.
Compared to the rates used in our forecast and guidance, this represents a combined headwind of $0.04 to EPS in Q4. So to be clear, for the full year of fiscal year '12, the combined translational and transactional impact of FX is estimated to be $0.08 negative compared to forecast and $0.06 negative compared to fiscal year 2011.
We are taking actions to mitigate our long euro exposure, and this includes hedging some forecasted transactions, as well as changing certain transactional flows to enhance natural hedging positions.
Looking now at income taxes. The effective rate was 20.5% for the quarter compared to 35.6% last year. Last year's rate reflected a onetime impact or charge related to the tax costs associated with the establishment of the company's Asian headquarters. The effective tax rate in Q3 FY '11 without that was 26.8% and the substantial reduction as a function of our ongoing planning strategies. 
Wrapping up the discussion about the P&L, net earnings from continuing operations were $70.9 million or $0.60 per share. And this compares to  $61.8 million or $0.52 per share last year. Looking at it on a pro forma basis, earnings per share as defined in our Appendix slides were $0.61 compared to $0.64. Bridging this decrease, operating profit decline was about $0.06, again, of which $0.02 is transactional FX and foreign currency translation decreased EPS by about $0.01, and this was partly offset by the improvement in the tax rate, which contributed about $0.04.
Looking now at cash flow, and I'm on Slide 19. Operating cash flow on the 9 months was $326 million, which represents a 16% increase and this was primarily driven by inventory reduction. Committed capital has continued to dampen free cash flow generation, and continued progress in capital management is an ongoing priority and post-ERP capital spend will decline materially. And we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. Our cash position stood at $536 million at the end of the quarter, and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 8.4%, and this compares to 9.1% as of the end of fiscal year '11. And we've used some excess cash to pay down debt. 
So with that, I will turn this back to Larry."
185333,205046843,317748,"Pall Corp., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jun 07, 2012",2012-06-07,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Okay, thanks, Lisa. As we discussed earlier, we believe we'll recover the Q3 miss related to the ERP implementation. Most importantly, we are entirely focused on serving our customers and flexing to meet their needs. The missed Q3 revenue that pushed Q4,",683,"Okay, thanks, Lisa. As we discussed earlier, we believe we'll recover the Q3 miss related to the ERP implementation. Most importantly, we are entirely focused on serving our customers and flexing to meet their needs. The missed Q3 revenue that pushed Q4, as well as the costs associated with the hyper care that we've talked about, equated to about $0.10 of EPS in the quarter. The slowing macro environment will impact Q4 sales, and it will be difficult for us to achieve the previously stated full year estimate. 
So the equation is roughly as follows: One, we'll make up the third quarter miss; but two, slower orders in Europe; and three, FX will impact and will offset so that we will be about $0.10 short of the objective that we communicated during our Q2 earnings call. And if you remember, that was achieving full year performance at the midpoint of our originally stated EPS range of $3.07 to $3.32. This update assumes about $0.12 of FX impact, and that's, again, the transactional and translational combined in Q4 versus fiscal year '11. So that equates to $2.72 on a continuing operations basis. 
And I'm sure you're wondering how to model 2013 for us given all that we've thrown out in this call. Let me attempt to, at least, frame up how I'm thinking about next year. And this is an early rough look basically to base your math on. In terms of revenue expectations, I think low single-digit organic sales growth is realistic. On a regional basis, we expect increases in Asia and the Americas to more than offset a decline in Europe. And on every point of sales growth, so that's every point of organic sales growth, will yield about $0.06 of EPS.
Additionally, our restructuring plans are ratcheting up as we speak, to both protect 2013, but also to properly structure the company for the future. We have most of our senior team now in place, and we have well-defined action plans. As such, we're targeting $100 million of structural cost actions over a multi-year period, of which more than 1/2 of that $100 million will take effect in fiscal year 2013. 
So given the above, from a pro forma basis beginning at $2.72 for this year, which excludes Blood, the math is very roughly as follows: We'll achieve about 35% incremental margin on the organic sales growth, again, that's the $0.06, the $0.06 EPS that I referred to on every organic sales dollar or sales point generated, plus the benefit of the restructuring that I just referred to.
Now Lisa outlined our FX exposure, and I discussed how we intend to, and we discussed how to mitigate that, particularly the further dislocation. We'll quantify our planning assumptions next quarter, but you can do the math based on today's rates. So depending on how you model for the year-over-year sales growth that I just spoke to, that would set your foundation for 2013. Obviously, none of that math includes any EPS contribution from share repurchase as associated with the Blood business divestiture or otherwise.
And we're not sure that it will be such a difficult economic environment, but we're planning for it. We're taking action now to perform well in spite of it. And we'll provide far more clarity in our year-end call next quarter when we provide fiscal year 2013 guidance, but I wanted to give you a sense for how to apply, again, for math, given our European exposure and the macro headlines.
And I'll say again, we have our team in place, and we have a very capable balance sheet. Our business model is very resilient as our performance in previous times of economic stress had shown, it's not unaffected by macroeconomic trends, but the nondiscretionary nature of many of our sales and the ability, frankly, for us to continue to spec in product through this kind of environment is comforting. And it will continue to support a good growth opportunity, even in the softening global environment.
So with that, we're going to open the call to your questions."

Now there is another self-inflicted element to this in terms of, frankly, sales folks holding customers’ hands through a go-live process. And I think some of the orders number that you see in the quarter really reflects some of the distraction.

The Americas, I think indicative of what we saw exiting the third quarter, nice acceleration in some of the segments. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're seeing MicroE tick up pretty nicely on a sequential basis and forward-looking indicators there are quite strong. Good news is when you think about mix as we head into next year, frankly, our 2 strongest and highest margin businesses, that being MicroE and BioPharm, basically have pretty decent forward-looking indicators at this point. So it is a very dynamic time, Rick. And I wouldn't want to steer you specifically to modeling systems organic orders performance as we head into 2013, but there is -- frankly, there's some sanity in how we've done our analysis in looking at both base and systems that still provides a fair amount of, I think, comfort in at least the low single-digit organic opportunity next year."

If you look at BioPharm in Europe, it was actually more influenced by a particular customer year-over-year comp that represented essentially kind of all the delta between what has been fairly typical strong European BioPharm, both orders and sales performance, versus what we witnessed in the quarter. So one customer, who was divesting kind of their demand rates, I don't want to get too more specific than that, but it's a very large global customer that we do quite a bit of business with. We haven't lost any share with them by any means, it's just a matter of how they're thinking about adjusting their needs. When you level that out or when you smooth that out, your comments, just to emphasize them, because they're important, are that all of these European or American BioPharm customers are global. So regional macro issues, they have some impact on any of these folks. But it's really a global market that our customers are selling into and, frankly, some of their fastest growth will continue to be in the emerging countries around the world for obvious reason. So I think that, without speaking specifically to what we think Q3, 4 and next year look like for BioPharm, you get to a consumables assumption still pretty much in line with what we performed over the last couple of years, which is a very, very strong high-single, if not double-digit organic kind of pattern."

There's a number of things that we're looking at strategically, structurally and within our fiscal tool capability set here to make sure that we don't expose ourselves further. And that comes down to how we think about supply chain and how our cost of goods is denominated. Frankly there's no reason long term why we need to have the dislocation issue, that is the pound versus the euro, in terms of how it impacts our cost of goods, so that's underway. And we'll -- it's not an easy fix, but we'll get it fixed. I think a good chunk of it in 2013. We are looking at various things, and Lisa spoke to them briefly, around how we can basically hedge forecasted transactions. But also in some cases, we've got just the transactions themselves denominated in currencies i.e., we've got customer contracts in British pounds for customers that don't need to be sold in British pounds. So that's the stuff that we can fix either way to make sure that we end up with a more balanced and appropriately hedged exposure to the currency if it does continue to dislocate."

Understand that in the brand or scheme of how major ERP implementations are handled and how radically wrong they can go, this is by no means a disaster. What we're talking about here is the equivalent of about 3 days of missed shipments. Now in reality, what it was is several weeks, and we're still kind of ramping up to full speed but almost there of missed signals to the supply chain. And we've got a very complex, vertically integrated supply chain internally and then also a very broad set of suppliers externally. Again, more complex than it needs to be that but not something that's going to get fixed easily overnight. So the question is: Why didn't we foresee this? Why didn't we deal with it? Why didn't we better prepare more inventory? All those good things. We went live in some of the satellite operations as you may be aware over the last couple of years, and we did learn from that, and we applied all that learning. This one really was the -- as I mentioned, this is kind of the Big Bang. It tied everything together, and largely we executed quite well. We brought the people from the other regions in, so that we had not just the benefit of their documented learning, but them to be part of the go-live. We did all the appropriate training and things of the sort. But to give you a sense for what we're dealing with, the company has had a history of basically being kind of a workaround culture, not very strong with respect to operational process and procedure. So we're not just trying to push a button and go live with a new IT system here. We're trying to really retrain a company to think end to end, so that we can take full advantage of what a system of this capability brings and allow us to deal with all of the structural issues we have within operations and supply chain. What I would tell you is these things never are perfect. This one was not nearly as good as what I had anticipated. I think that we've now got the benefit of all the hindsight. There's no surprises of anything that we didn't understand. We've handheld our customers very appropriately. We're rebuilding the appropriate inventory position in that vertically integrated supply chain to make sure that we've got the appropriate stock in place. And all that, frankly, is against a backdrop of an incredibly dynamic and very rapidly changing mix environment given what's going on in the economy simultaneously. So it's kind of the trifecta here of internal issues. A couple of them combined with the macroeconomic very dynamic environment that you see the bloody results for. So the good news is, I think, we're on our way out. We've got an organization that's embraced this. It's going to be a great enabler for us, a very critical step for us to take -- to go to move forward as a company and mature. But it was painful for the last several [ph] weeks."

You tend to run into data migration issues. So when you're porting information from old system to new system, not all the information gets properly handheld through that and you can miss data, which, in fact, that did happen in this case to some degree. You tend to try and use old people process to manage new systems. And in our case, as I  mentioned earlier, we've got a lot of -- or we had a lot of tribal knowledge-based workaround types of processes. And the new system frankly forces a rigor much more standard work process kind of mentality to how things get done. So a lot of the miss was people not understanding the system at very early stages and not acting appropriately or people thinking they had acted and frankly not having done so. Then you get into our vertically integrated supply chain and the signaling for purchasing and that's where it gets frankly pretty hairy and complicated, and that's where we went through several weeks or a few weeks, at least, of not having the right buy queues by way of the system and the people interface to the system, such that it takes a while for that kind of that deficit and material supply to work its way back through to the point of finished goods that are available for shipment. So again, we can quantify everything in the quarter right down to customer and product and site and past due total, and all that obviously has been done. And this hyper care [ph] thing that we spoke to is really a matter of making sure that our customers all over the world understand our position, our ability to respond to recover, and we're in the process of doing so.

I would concur. Not proud of it in any way. But let's put it in perspective. What we did accomplish in the quarter was take a very major step forward in terms of preparing our company for the future and to grow, both organically and acquisitively. That's really the internal element of what we worked through in the quarter, and a little bit of work that we still got ahead of us in the fourth quarter. Now in terms of the environment, which is kind of unrelated but an important subject for us to consider, given the kind of where we report off calendar fiscal year, now we did see a fairly dynamic order pattern in the quarter. Again, I wouldn't draw trend lines out of the order pattern that we saw in the quarter. We do think that based on our May experience rate and what we have seen this last month, plus the history and how we think about how the breadth of the business plays against the cycle, and evidence of even sequential improvement in a couple of the businesses right now that are destined for that. That the assumptions that we provided in the call are fairly realistic. And beyond that, we've already got those action plans in place. We're prepared, we're underway with what the appropriate cost mitigation set of things to do, any good company should be doing, we're under way with that right now.

I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; Frank Moschella, Corporate Controller; and Brent Jones, our new VP of Finance.As you've seen from our press release last night, it was a difficult third quarter as our",1881,"Good morning. Thank you for joining us. I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; Frank Moschella, Corporate Controller; and Brent Jones, our new VP of Finance.
As you've seen from our press release last night, it was a difficult third quarter as our results were impacted more than anticipated by the weak economy in the Eurozone and a self-inflicted disruption in our supply chain, which was caused by the previously announced global go-live of our new ERP system. This last phase was the big one, encompassing 2,800 users at 28 locations in the Americas, and it now links our systems worldwide.
While the ERP system clearly will have significant long-term benefits for the company and our temporary transition issues are being resolved, the disruption in the quarter meant that shipments of consumables were delayed and we incurred substantial additional costs in what I'll call hyper care actions to mitigate the impact on our customers.
While disappointing, we are fortunate that our customers have been understanding and supportive, and I believe we're making very good progress in filling the backorders. We expect to have caught up with the past due backlog by this August, which, as you know, is the beginning of our fiscal year. So most of the revenue we lost in Q3 will be made up in this fourth quarter.
Unrelated to our ERP challenges, the macro environment is clearly softening. While the Americas order rate is showing signs of strengthening, we're highly cautious about the situation in Europe. We anticipate that the organic order rates in Europe will be better in Q4 and next year than what was reported in Q3 though.
As we'll get into momentarily, we're taking appropriate cost actions that are already underway to mitigate the potential impact on our fiscal year '13 profitability. We'll walk through both the orders and the sales performance by market and by geography, and I'll assume that you'll have a number of questions. There's obviously a fair bit of noise in the Q3 results due to the enterprise system deployments, so it's important that we clearly distinguish the market versus self-inflicted performance to give you a sense as to how we see next year taking shape. And it's not all bad news. We have line of sight to the actions within our control to protect profitability even if the global economy stumbles hard. 
With that, as an overview, our remarks this morning will be on a continuing operations basis, which exclude the results of the Blood product line that we are divesting. 
So now to the quarter. We estimate that enterprise system challenges in the quarter cost us about 3 points of organic growth and about $0.10 per share in the quarter, both in terms of delayed sales and increased costs to mitigate the impact on customers. That's all on us, so-called self-inflicted, as I've said, temporary, not the economy or our end markets.
Going to move on to Slide 6. Going into the third quarter, as we discussed on our last call, we expect that second half sales growth to slow compared with the strong first half, which we grew sales by 10%. That outlook reflected a number of anticipated headwinds, the softening economy in Europe and slower growth in emerging Asia, including China. We also said that we anticipate a tough mix in our Industrial segment for the remainder of the year, and all of this has proven to be the case.
Third quarter sales from continuing operations were $658 million or 2.5% growth over last year in local currency. Again, our conversion cost us almost 3 points of organic growth. Consumables and BioPharm, Food & Bev, Aerospace, in particular, were most impacted. So within the 2.5% growth that we realized, while consumables were flat, system product sales increased 24%. 
So now I'm going to walk through a breakdown of both sales and orders by region and segment, get into a fair amount of detail.
On Slide 7, on a geographic basis, sales in the Americas were down about 1.5%. Again the ERP conversion was centered here. Europe sales grew about 1%, with weakness in several key markets, which I'll cover in a moment. Asia had a good quarter overall, with sales growth of over 9%, with most major markets doing well and despite MicroE, which was down 8% organically.
Relative to global segment performance, moving on to Slides 8 and 9, Life Sciences grew 4% while Industrial grew just over 1%. Consumable sales were up 1% in Life Sciences and down about 2% in Industrial. And if you look at Slide 8, in Life Sciences, Pharmaceutical consumable sales were up 9%, but we realized a double-digit decline in Lab instrumentation sales. The 3 issues contributed to the Lab decline: One is, that's where we experienced the slower book and turn activity; two, our largest channel destocked to some degree; and three, we didn't ship what we had the orders for, given the ERP issues.
And while Food & Bev had an exceptionally strong systems quarter, $23 million in systems base sales declined 10%. A variety of factors explain this, including big organic comps that included of wine distribution business that we divested at the beginning of the year, reducing Food & Bev sales by about 4%, but the bigger contributor to the decline were the ERP implementation and the European markets slowing.
Medical, within the Life Science segment, was down in the quarter 1.5%, reflecting pressure on hospital spending in Western countries. 
And on Slide 9, within Industrial, Microelectronics sales declined 8% as I said earlier. This is mainly due to continued softness in IC production. However, we're beginning to see signs of recovery with increased capital spending by the chip makers. Aerospace sales were up 1%. Commercial Aerospace sales were down 10%, while Military Aerospace sales increased about 13%.
Sales in Process Technologies within Industrial, that's the Energy & Water process markets and Machinery & Equipment and OEM markets, increased almost 5% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by growth in the Energy markets. And Energy sales grew about 16% with good broad-based underlying market drivers.
Muni Water sales were down 14% as capital spend for water plants remained weak with deferred spending and delayed project decision-making.
So again, in total, strong system sales in the quarter offset by slow consumable sales, of which again, most of it's on us, our execution. And again we would have realized somewhere between 5% and 6% local currency growth had we not been hampered with the conversion challenges.
I'm going to move on to orders on Slide 10. The performance in the quarter was a function of our execution to some degree, but it's really more about the macro environment. We also though faced very stiff 2011 orders comps when you look at the organic orders performance in total. Orders were down 9% compared to up almost 11% a year ago. This was driven largely by a 42% decline in systems compared to a 43% increase last year. We attribute some of the systems orders shortfall to timing, and this is not an unusual situation for capital projects. And we've already realized some of the Q3 planned orders in May. Consumable orders were down 2%, and that included a 3.5% growth in Life Sciences, but an 8% drop in Industrial. 
So now let's look at orders by region. Orders were down 20% in Europe, driven by systems, which were down 60%. Again, some of that’s tough comps, some is project delays. And we've already realized, or will shortly, some of that delayed activity, but most definitely it's macro influence as well.
Conversely, orders in the Americas increased about 5%, about the same in consumables as in systems. Within Life Sciences, Medical orders, which are book and turn, increased 13%. BioPharm orders were up 20%. We saw exceptional demand for our new Octet and BLItz products, which came with the ForteBio acquisition. And orders decreased about 6% in Asia. And double-digit growth in Life Sciences was offset by a similar rate of decline in the larger industrial markets in Asia. And Microelectronics remained down, almost 15%.
Now I'm going to walk through orders by segments. Within Industrial, Process Technologies was down about 15%, driven by a 46% decline in system orders and Energy & Water, with Machinery & Equipment flat. And as I said earlier Military Aerospace was down given the blanket order tough comps.
Commercial Aerospace was up over 22%, with growth accelerating nicely. The MicroE orders were down 10%, reflecting continued weakness experienced over the last 4 quarters. However, we are seeing recovery, as I mentioned earlier. In May, we saw as well Microelectronic orders increased sequentially by 12%, so that's a May comment.
Now on to Life Sciences, and we're on Slide 13. Both Medical and BioPharm were flat. Within BioPharm, consumables were up 10% and systems were down 60%. Laboratory instrumentation was down about 14% due to the slowing activity and the destocking of the channel that I just discussed earlier. Food & Bev was down 5% overall, with a little over 20% decline in systems orders and modest growth in consumables.
So a lot of volatility in the order performance since the channel and customer base assesses and adjusts to new economic assumptions. I'll address our expectations for what the trend will look like as we exit the year in my summary remarks in a few minutes.
And now I'll turn to Slide 14 and talk about the impact of the Blood business divestiture. As we previously stated, we entered into this transaction to sharpen our strategic focus and enable structuring the company for core growth. For fiscal year '12, this business is expected to generate about $230 million of revenue, approximately $60 million of operating profit and $0.38 of EPS without considering the fixed cost associated with operating the business. During the third quarter, generated $57 million in revenue and $0.09 in pro forma EPS, again unburdened. So Pall, on an all-in basis, that's including the Blood product lines, generated pro forma EPS of $0.70 and $0.72 last year.
Now we expect to mitigate the earnings dilution associated with this transaction in '13, in fiscal year '13, through structural cost actions that are already underway. And we will also continue to supply Haemonetics, who acquired the business, with core filtration technology, which will offset some of the associated dilution as well.
We announced the transaction in April. As you we remember, we expect to receive about $430 million after-tax, subject to transactional adjustments and those are in process. We continue to evaluate various alternatives for the transaction proceeds and for capital deployment in general, with a strong bias toward growth, particularly acquisitive growth. However, as we reflect on the environment we are facing, including the macro outlook, our balance sheet strength and free cash profile, the FX headwinds and asset pricing in the M&A market where sellers are still looking for top-of-market valuations, we are increasingly of a view that share repurchase may be a better alternative.
So with that, I'm going to turn this over to Lisa now for her to discuss the financial performance in the quarter, and then I'll come back and we'll wrap up and take a forward-look."

As a reminder, the numbers I'll be discussing below are on a continuing operations basis. And additionally, both the Life Sciences and Industrial results have been restated for all periods to reflect the change in the allocation of certain shared costs on a continuing operations basis.
So let's start on Slide 15. I am going to give a high-level overview of the performance of each segment in 3 key areas: Gross margin, SG&A and operating margin. And I'll start with Industrial.
Industrial gross margin came in at 45.4%, a 70 basis point decline from last year. And this was driven by unfavorable mix from the decline in MicroE and relative increase in the systems business sales, and this reduced margins by about 150 basis points and similar to what we saw in prior quarters. The decline in MicroE volume and some of the operations challenges in the quarter also resulted in absorption loss of about 100 bps.
We did have favorable themes from previously implemented continuous improvement activities in manufacturing, which substantially overcame cost inflation and added about 150 bps to Industrial's gross margin. Price added about 30 basis points to margin as well, but this was offset by some transactional FX headwind, which I'll discuss in a moment.
Industrial's SG&A increased by about $4.7 million or 4.5%, and that's 6% in local currency. And this is attributable to the allocation of shared costs primarily related to what Larry called hyper care costs, as well as continued emerging region investment. As Larry mentioned, we incurred considerably more cost than planned related to hyper care, and we expect some continuation of this in our fourth quarter.
Segment profit of $39 million generated margin of 11.6%, which was down 220 basis points from last year. And as we've mentioned throughout this year, we are executing several restructuring initiatives that will drive down SG&A to improve the Industrial segment's leverage. Though a small portion of this savings were realized in the third quarter, we expect a considerable ramp-up in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2013.
Moving on to Life Sciences and Slide 16. Life Sciences gross margin increased by 70 basis points to 56.7%. Notable items were: One, favorable year-over-year comparison of some inventory recharges were recorded in last year's Q3, and this was favorable by about approximately 90 bps; the negative impact of transactional FX, most prominent in our Life Sciences business given the British pound euro exposure; and favorable pricing, which added about 40 bps, and this was offset by some mixed headwinds in the quarter.
SG&A increased about $7.3 million or 8.7%, and this is 11% in local currency. Again, much of this increase relates to the same factors just discussed in Industrial's results related to the hyper care, as well as incremental SG&A related to the ForteBio acquisition.
Segment profit was a little over $75 million, a decrease of 4.4% or 3% from local currency, with segment margins declining 150 basis points to 23.7%. 
Turning now to Slide 17, where we'll talk further about our euro risk. And on last quarter's call, we briefed you with respect to our FX profile. Our sales into the euro-currency countries comprise about 25% of total Pall sales. About 70% to 80% of those cost of goods are denominated in British pounds or U.S. dollars, mostly in pounds, primarily in Life Sciences.
In our forecast at the beginning of the year, we included the U.S. dollar at about $1.35 and the British pound at about GBP 0.89 to the euro. When we provided our updated guidance in our Q2 call with the euro at 1.31 to the dollar and 0.83 to the pound, we estimated a second half gross profit headwind of about $3.5 million to $6.5 million compared to our original outlook, which is about $0.02 to $0.04 of earnings per share. We experienced this impact in the third quarter where we estimate gross margins were negatively impacted by about $3 million against our original forecast, which equates to about $0.02.
Now on a year-over-year basis, there was about a $2.5 million headwind to gross profit, also about $0.02. And this is not to be confused with the translational impact to EPS, which was an additional $0.01 negative for a combined year-over-year impact of $0.03, i.e., that's transactional plus translational FX impact to earnings per share.
Turning now to the fourth quarter, given the recent continued weakening of the euro versus the pound to about GBP 0.8 and the U.S. dollar to about $1.24, we expect year-over-year transactional headwinds to gross profit of $6 million to $8 million or $0.04 to $0.05 in our fourth quarter. Together with the impact of translation, a headwind of about $0.11 to $0.13 per share year-over-year.
Compared to the rates used in our forecast and guidance, this represents a combined headwind of $0.04 to EPS in Q4. So to be clear, for the full year of fiscal year '12, the combined translational and transactional impact of FX is estimated to be $0.08 negative compared to forecast and $0.06 negative compared to fiscal year 2011.
We are taking actions to mitigate our long euro exposure, and this includes hedging some forecasted transactions, as well as changing certain transactional flows to enhance natural hedging positions.
Looking now at income taxes. The effective rate was 20.5% for the quarter compared to 35.6% last year. Last year's rate reflected a onetime impact or charge related to the tax costs associated with the establishment of the company's Asian headquarters. The effective tax rate in Q3 FY '11 without that was 26.8% and the substantial reduction as a function of our ongoing planning strategies. 
Wrapping up the discussion about the P&L, net earnings from continuing operations were $70.9 million or $0.60 per share. And this compares to  $61.8 million or $0.52 per share last year. Looking at it on a pro forma basis, earnings per share as defined in our Appendix slides were $0.61 compared to $0.64. Bridging this decrease, operating profit decline was about $0.06, again, of which $0.02 is transactional FX and foreign currency translation decreased EPS by about $0.01, and this was partly offset by the improvement in the tax rate, which contributed about $0.04.
Looking now at cash flow, and I'm on Slide 19. Operating cash flow on the 9 months was $326 million, which represents a 16% increase and this was primarily driven by inventory reduction. Committed capital has continued to dampen free cash flow generation, and continued progress in capital management is an ongoing priority and post-ERP capital spend will decline materially. And we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. Our cash position stood at $536 million at the end of the quarter, and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 8.4%, and this compares to 9.1% as of the end of fiscal year '11. And we've used some excess cash to pay down debt. 
So with that, I will turn this back to Larry."
185333,205046843,317918,"Pall Corp., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jun 07, 2012",2012-06-07,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Okay, thanks, Lisa. As we discussed earlier, we believe we'll recover the Q3 miss related to the ERP implementation. Most importantly, we are entirely focused on serving our customers and flexing to meet their needs. The missed Q3 revenue that pushed Q4,",683,"Okay, thanks, Lisa. As we discussed earlier, we believe we'll recover the Q3 miss related to the ERP implementation. Most importantly, we are entirely focused on serving our customers and flexing to meet their needs. The missed Q3 revenue that pushed Q4, as well as the costs associated with the hyper care that we've talked about, equated to about $0.10 of EPS in the quarter. The slowing macro environment will impact Q4 sales, and it will be difficult for us to achieve the previously stated full year estimate.
So the equation is roughly as follows: One, we'll make up the third quarter miss; but two, slower orders in Europe; and three, FX will impact and will offset so that we will be about $0.10 short of the objective that we communicated during our Q2 earnings call. And if you remember, that was achieving full year performance at the midpoint of our originally stated EPS range of $3.07 to $3.32. This update assumes about $0.12 of FX impact, and that's, again, the transactional and translational combined in Q4 versus fiscal year '11. So that equates to $2.72 on a continuing operations basis. 
And I'm sure you're wondering how to model 2013 for us given all that we've thrown out in this call. Let me attempt to, at least, frame up how I'm thinking about next year. And this is an early rough look basically to base your math on. In terms of revenue expectations, I think low single-digit organic sales growth is realistic. On a regional basis, we expect increases in Asia and the Americas to more than offset a decline in Europe. And on every point of sales growth, so that's every point of organic sales growth, will yield about $0.06 of EPS.
Additionally, our restructuring plans are ratcheting up as we speak, to both protect 2013, but also to properly structure the company for the future. We have most of our senior team now in place, and we have well-defined action plans. As such, we're targeting $100 million of structural cost actions over a multi-year period, of which more than 1/2 of that $100 million will take effect in fiscal year 2013. 
So given the above, from a pro forma basis beginning at $2.72 for this year, which excludes Blood, the math is very roughly as follows: We'll achieve about 35% incremental margin on the organic sales growth, again, that's the $0.06, the $0.06 EPS that I referred to on every organic sales dollar or sales point generated, plus the benefit of the restructuring that I just referred to.
Now Lisa outlined our FX exposure, and I discussed how we intend to, and we discussed how to mitigate that, particularly the further dislocation. We'll quantify our planning assumptions next quarter, but you can do the math based on today's rates. So depending on how you model for the year-over-year sales growth that I just spoke to, that would set your foundation for 2013. Obviously, none of that math includes any EPS contribution from share repurchase as associated with the Blood business divestiture or otherwise.
And we're not sure that it will be such a difficult economic environment, but we're planning for it. We're taking action now to perform well in spite of it. And we'll provide far more clarity in our year-end call next quarter when we provide fiscal year 2013 guidance, but I wanted to give you a sense for how to apply, again, your math, given our European exposure and the macro headlines.
And I'll say again, we have our team in place, and we have a very capable balance sheet. Our business model is very resilient as our performance in previous times of economic stress had shown, it's not unaffected by macroeconomic trends, but the nondiscretionary nature of many of our sales and the ability, frankly, for us to continue to spec in product through this kind of environment is comforting. And it will continue to support a good growth opportunity, even in the softening global environment.
So with that, we're going to open the call to your questions."

Now there is another self-inflicted element to this in terms of, frankly, sales folks holding customers’ hands through a go-live process.

And as we head into next year – now, and again, we're pre-planning process, but we've spent a fair amount of time given the nature of the situation at hand, it still supports a base growth opportunity next year in Asia of high single digit, if not double digit. The Americas, I think indicative of what we saw exiting the third quarter, nice acceleration in some of the segments. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're seeing MicroE tick up pretty nicely on a sequential basis and forward-looking indicators there are quite strong. Good news is when you think about mix as we head into next year, frankly, our 2 strongest and highest margin businesses, that being MicroE and BioPharm, basically have pretty decent forward-looking indicators at this point. So it is a very dynamic time, Rick. And I wouldn't want to steer you specifically to modeling systems organic orders performance as we head into 2013, but there is -- frankly, there's some sanity in how we've done our analysis in looking at both base and systems that still provides a fair amount of, I think, comfort in at least the low single-digit organic opportunity next year."

Again, I wouldn't try and draw too much of a trend line off of the quarter given the noise that I just spoke to. If you look at BioPharm in Europe, it was actually more influenced by a particular customer year-over-year comp that represented essentially kind of all the delta between what has been fairly typical strong European BioPharm, both orders and sales performance, versus what we witnessed in the quarter. So one customer, who was divesting kind of their demand rates, I don't want to get too more specific than that, but it's a very large global customer that we do quite a bit of business with. We haven't lost any share with them by any means, it's just a matter of how they're thinking about adjusting their needs. When you level that out or when you smooth that out, your comments, just to emphasize them, because they're important, are that all of these European or American BioPharm customers are global. So regional macro issues, they have some impact on any of these folks. But it's really a global market that our customers are selling into and, frankly, some of their fastest growth will continue to be in the emerging countries around the world for obvious reason. So I think that, without speaking specifically to what we think Q3, 4 and next year look like for BioPharm, you get to a consumables assumption still pretty much in line with what we performed over the last couple of years, which is a very, very strong high-single, if not double-digit organic kind of pattern."

And what we tend to drive most of our revenue from is the ongoing consumables associated with producing them. So that doesn't cycle so heavily. What can cycle, and is proving to cycle right now to a much larger degree, is the Lab instrumentation purchases. And you've seen and heard about some of that from some of the others that have reported on a calendar fiscal year basis as to how they're seeing, either by way of federal subsidy funding declines and/or research spending declines, the relatively slow sales right now from instrumentation purchases associated with research. We spoke to that a minute -- in our prepared remarks ago with respect to our instrumentation sales also, we're relatively slow in the quarter.

The lower rate in the quarter just represented a little bit of a different position on our foreign cash, especially as it relates now to the cash that we expect to receive in the U.S. related to the Blood transaction. So that really presents the full year lowering of the rate background."

Understand that in the brand or scheme of how major ERP implementations are handled and how radically wrong they can go, this is by no means a disaster. What we're talking about here is the equivalent of about 3 days of missed shipments. Now in reality, what it was is several weeks, and we're still kind of ramping up to full speed but almost there of missed signals to the supply chain. And we've got a very complex, vertically integrated supply chain internally and then also a very broad set of suppliers externally. Again, more complex than it needs to be that but not something that's going to get fixed easily overnight. So the question is: Why didn't we foresee this? Why didn't we deal with it? Why didn't we better prepare more inventory? All those good things. We went live in some of the satellite operations as you may be aware over the last couple of years, and we did learn from that, and we applied all that learning. This one really was the -- as I mentioned, this is kind of the Big Bang. It tied everything together, and largely we executed quite well. We brought the people from the other regions in, so that we had not just the benefit of their documented learning, but them to be part of the go-live. We did all the appropriate training and things of the sort. But to give you a sense for what we're dealing with, the company has had a history of basically being kind of a workaround culture, not very strong with respect to operational process and procedure. So we're not just trying to push a button and go live with a new IT system here. We're trying to really retrain a company to think end to end, so that we can take full advantage of what a system of this capability brings and allow us to deal with all of the structural issues we have within operations and supply chain. What I would tell you is these things never are perfect. This one was not nearly as good as what I had anticipated. I think that we've now got the benefit of all the hindsight. There's no surprises of anything that we didn't understand. We've handheld our customers very appropriately. We're rebuilding the appropriate inventory position in that vertically integrated supply chain to make sure that we've got the appropriate stock in place. And all that, frankly, is against a backdrop of an incredibly dynamic and very rapidly changing mix environment given what's going on in the economy simultaneously. So it's kind of the trifecta here of internal issues. A couple of them combined with the macroeconomic very dynamic environment that you see the bloody results for. So the good news is, I think, we're on our way out. We've got an organization that's embraced this. It's going to be a great enabler for us, a very critical step for us to take -- to go to move forward as a company and mature. But it was painful for the last several [ph] weeks."

And in our case, as I  mentioned earlier, we've got a lot of -- or we had a lot of tribal knowledge-based workaround types of processes. And the new system frankly forces a rigor much more standard work process kind of mentality to how things get done. So a lot of the miss was people not understanding the system at very early stages and not acting appropriately or people thinking they had acted and frankly not having done so. Then you get into our vertically integrated supply chain and the signaling for purchasing and that's where it gets frankly pretty hairy and complicated, and that's where we went through several weeks or a few weeks, at least, of not having the right buy queues by way of the system and the people interface to the system, such that it takes a while for that kind of that deficit and material supply to work its way back through to the point of finished goods that are available for shipment. So again, we can quantify everything in the quarter right down to customer and product and site and past due total, and all that obviously has been done. And this hyper care [ph] thing that we spoke to is really a matter of making sure that our customers all over the world understand our position, our ability to respond to recover, and we're in the process of doing so. And we're making good, very good progress at this point."

I would concur. Not proud of it in any way. But let's put it in perspective. What we did accomplish in the quarter was take a very major step forward in terms of preparing our company for the future and to grow, both organically and acquisitively. That's really the internal element of what we worked through in the quarter, and a little bit of work that we still got ahead of us in the fourth quarter. Now in terms of the environment, which is kind of unrelated but an important subject for us to consider, given the kind of where we report off calendar fiscal year, now we did see a fairly dynamic order pattern in the quarter. Again, I wouldn't draw trend lines out of the order pattern that we saw in the quarter. We do think that based on our May experience rate and what we have seen this last month, plus the history and how we think about how the breadth of the business plays against the cycle, and evidence of even sequential improvement in a couple of the businesses right now that are destined for that. That the assumptions that we provided in the call are fairly realistic. And beyond that, we've already got those action plans in place. We're prepared, we're underway with what the appropriate cost mitigation set of things to do, any good company should be doing, we're under way with that right now. So again, I think that we're in good shape for entering what will undoubtedly be a dynamic 2013. I'd like to thank you for joining.

I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; and Brent Jones, our VP of Finance.Our remarks this morning will be on a continuing operations basis, which excludes the results of the Blood product line, which we",1888,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; and Brent Jones, our VP of Finance.
Our remarks this morning will be on a continuing operations basis, which excludes the results of the Blood product line, which we divested on August 1. I know that most of you have read our release and know the key headline. We executed a strong fourth quarter and turned in very solid results for the full year. Our pro forma EPS was a record $0.99 or $0.86, excluding Blood. And our full year results met the midpoint of our original guidance at the beginning of the year. That's despite second half economic and FX headwinds. While the sales results for the quarter was strong, our cost to serve, essentially the costs to catch up from Q3, remained high.
But before I jump in to our results, I want to take a few -- make a few preparatory comments about what we've accomplished over the last year and what we anticipate for the year in front of us. I first spoke to you as Pall's CEO in December. At that time, I said that I viewed Pall as a huge long-term value-creation opportunity. I believe that statement even more so today. We talked about foundational work that we had to do, particularly with respect to people, process and technology, and I'm happy to report that we've made significant progress but what we do much more to do. With regard to people, as you know, there have been a number of changes to the executive management team. I'm incredibly pleased with the talent that we now have, as well as the developing strength behind us. In the fourth quarter, we added business development capability, which is critical to our growth strategy. With regard to process, in the quarter, we focused almost exclusively on restoring customer levels to pre-SAP implementation levels and are now working toward best-in-industry metrics. In with regard to technology, we're increasing R&D spend. We're also taking a much more focused approach as to where we invest. We've added significant talents in R&D to accomplish these.
Last year, I articulated the strategy, which highlighted our move toward more embassies on strategic acquisitions to enable core growth. We will do so on a disciplined manner. This may include enhancing our current offerings but also moving into adjacent product markets where our applications expertise and our global channel are a natural fit.
We closed the transaction with Haemonetics on August 1 as planned, and the there are no other planned divestitures. In short, we believe that we can more actively organically manage the portfolio to position ourselves well for future growth.
We're building an acquisition pipeline and expect that we will begin to more consistently acquire about a year from now. Our team has done a solid job integrating ForteBio, and we anticipate that it will exceed our preacquisition model for both growth and return.
I'll now move to our outlook generally. The global economy is concerning with large dose of uncertainty. We assume that Europe will worsen, particularly for our Industrial business. China will grow but only significantly in about 1/3 of our vertical markets, and the Microelectronics global end markets will not recover as previously assumed. However, all in, I think we have gotten ahead of the concerns, and we have a plan to deliver reasonable this results in the face of a choppy environment.
Consistent with these, as you know, we've committed to $100 million instructional costs improvement over the next 3 years. We are targeting that half of that will be accomplished in fiscal year 2013, this year. This program is well underway, and I'm confident that we will achieve our target. It's critical that the rightsize our fixed cost structure at the same time, that we reposition as G&A to take advantage of where growth can be achieved.
So let's move to the quarter discussion. We executed the store recovery from our ERP induced challenges in Q3. Nearly all of the shipments that were deferred into Q4 shift in Q4, bringing down our past dues significantly in the quarter. To be clear, again, we have all the way to go to play best practice, but the team should be congratulated for how well they worked across functions and with our external supply chain to restore confidence. Very solid execution.
We're beginning to make tough choices regarding our systems business and required linkage to the consumable sales. The same time our sales force is been repositioned and compensated to deliver the Pall value proposition to win consumable opportunities based on our industry-leading solutions capability. As we walk through the slides, you'll see we've added emphasis on the business performance of our consumable products as we believe it is more meaningful to understand that in analyzing current trends. So with that, let's dive into the specifics.
I'll start with a brief overview of our Q4 and full year financial performance and I'm on Slide 6. Sales grew about 6%, excluding FX in the quarter, and 7% for the year with contributions from both segments. Pro forma EPS increased 32% to $0.86 per share in the quarter and 16% to $2.80 per share for the year. Operating margin improved 370 basis points in the quarter to 19.3%. Lisa will discuss the key drivers in a little bit. For the full year, operating margin came in at 17% at 50 basis points improvement, still negatively impacted by the ERP limitation expense and, in particular, the customer hyper care transition associated costs that we discussed last quarter. Free cash flow for the year increased 17% to $316 million. 
On Slide 7, Life Sciences sales grew by 8% in the quarter and Industrial grew by 5%, excluding FX. Consumables, which comprised about 84% of total sales, grew almost 40% in Life Sciences and 5% in Industrial. Systems, which comprised 60% of total sales, declined 6% overall as growth in Industrial is offset by a decline in Life Sciences. Some of the decline in Life Sciences reflects our rationalization of low margin food and beverage systems, again, where we don't have that opportunity.
Looking at the year, sales in both Life Sciences and Industrial increased to solid 7%. Consumable sales grew 7% in Life Sciences and 5.5% in Industrial. System sales grew 13% in the year with both segments achieving double-digit growth. 
Now I will discuss the key drivers of the Life Science sales and the orders results in the quarter and the year on slides 8 and 9. First, look at consumable sales. The growth in BioPharm consumable sales of almost 20% in the quarter and 12% for the year reflects continued strength in the biotech sector. The new Octet and BLItz products from ForteBio added about 4% to consumable sales growth in the quarter and 2% for the year to the BioPharm result. Consumable sales in Food & Beverage excluded the impact of the divestiture of our Verona [ph] business in Europe increased organically by about 12% in the quarter and 4% for the year with all regions contributing. The growth was driven by new applications and products. Medical consumable sales growth in the quarter reflects growth in our OEM channel. For the year, this was partially offset by specific customer inventory reductions and weak economy conditions in Europe affecting hospital spend. There's fewer hospitals spent their -- on consumables accordingly and there were fewer hospital -- operates. 
Systems sales declined 31% in the quarter, primarily due to reduce CapEx spend in the Food & Beverage market and also a reduction in BioPharm system sales during the period. The year-over-year comparison also reflects Q4 2011 large system sales in Asia. Life Science orders increased 14% in the quarter with similar growth in both Consumables and systems. The growth was driven by BioPharm. Consumables sales in Process Technologies, I'm onto Slides 10 and 11, which consists of Energy & Water markets and the Machinery & Equipment OEM markets, were flat in the quarter mainly due to reduced capital good shipments to the Energy market, which is as you may recall were as ordinarily high in Q4 of '11. This was offset by increased consumable sales in the Machinery & Equipment markets, reflecting strength in mining and mobile OEM sectors. For the year, consumable sales in Process Technologies grew 8%, reflecting growth in all of the process technology markets. On a full year basis as well, sales to Machinery & Equipment OEMs were particularly robust. 
Aerospace consumable sales were up 22% in the quarter, reflecting strong growth in both Commercial and Military spares. For the full year, Aerospace consumable sales increased 12%. Military sales were particularly strong, increasing 20%. Microelectronics Consumables sales increased modestly at 2% in the quarter and down 3.5% for the year as growth in the Americas and Europe was partially offset by continued weakness in Asia. 
So moving on to Industrial systems performance. Systems sales increased 7% in the quarter and 15% in the year. This was primarily driven by the Energy market reflecting investment in oil and gas infrastructure in the Middle East. This was offset by a decline in Municipal Water sales for the year as capital spend for water plants remained weak with deferred spending and delayed project decision-making. 
Looking at Industrial orders for the quarter. Growth was 9% primarily driven by systems orders, which increased over 33%. Systems orders were particularly strong in the Energy and municipal water markets. consumables orders were up about 3% in total. 
So now on to Slide 12 for a look on the regional basis. Sales in the Americas increased 23%, again, tied to our operational recovery. We estimate that about half of the year-over-year growth in the region for the quarter was recovery and the other half consisted of organic growth of about 7%. Contribution from ForteBio and the acquisition of our Brazilian distributor, those 2 combined, contributed about 4%. Orders in the Americas increased about 16% in the quarter. This reflects recovery demand as well. Orders in Latin America were particularly strong at over 50%. These added about 30% to the Americas total orders growth. The robust sales growth in the Americas was dampened by flat performance in Europe and in Asia. Sales in Europe were flat for the quarter, but orders in Europe did increase at just under 5%. The sales result in Asia was impacted by a 21% decline in system sales, as well as an 8% decline in the Microelectronics market. Sales to the emerging markets in Asia declined in the quarter on weakness in China and India. However, we do anticipate that both China and India will grow just under or at double-digit rates in '13 based on known projects. Japan also performed well in the quarter based on the ongoing biotech investment there. Orders increased 16% in Asia. Systems orders increased over 70% from Korean firms in particular working on large Middle Eastern projects, while consumable orders increased in the low single-digit range. 
So with that, I'm going to turn this over to Lisa to wrap up the financial review and some details around profitability drivers in cash flow performance in the quarter and for the year, then we'll finish up with our outlook for the fiscal year 2013."

I'll start with a review of segment performance, jumping off of Larry's remarks in sales, and I'll begin with Life Sciences. Reflecting the favorable mix and absorption benefits from solid consumable sales growth in the quarter, particularly in Pharmaceuticals, Life Sciences gross margin improved 170 basis points to just under 58%. Favorable pricing and the benefit of sales channel changes from distribution to direct also contributed. However, this was partly offset by about 130 basis points of affects headwinds related to the deterioration of the euro. For the full year, Life Sciences gross margin improved 130 basis points to 58.2% primarily driven by the same factors as in the quarter although FX was neutral for the year. With SG&A increasing about 5%, excluding FX, and down 70 basis points as a percent of sales year-over-year, the flow-through resulted in Life Sciences segment margin improving by 190 basis points in the quarter to 25.7%. 
Turning now to Industrial. As compared to the unfavorable product mix and execution in the fourth quarter of last year, gross margin improved by 280 basis points year-over-year. Systems gross margins improved 600 basis points or 6% year-over-year with improved execution and success of higher margin water trail unit rentals. Some pricing achievement and absorption also provided some benefits as well. That said, gross margin also improved sequentially by 60 basis points from 45.4% in Q3 to 46% this quarter. For the full year, Industrial gross margins increased 10 basis points year-over-year to 45.9% and mainly reflects some improved pricing. 
The cost reduction efforts in Industrial became evident in Q4 in SG&A. And this was flat, excluding FX year-over-year and down sequentially by 1.5% and that's despite sequential sales growth of about 17%. The 140 basis point year-over-year decline in SG&A as a percent of sales, together with gross margin improvement, yielded a 490 basis point improvement in segment margin in the quarter. The industrial segment margin in the year improved to 14% from 13.7% last year. 
Turning now to Slide 14 and recapping our earnings per share performance. I'll spend a moment on the restructuring expenses recorded in the quarter. And this amounted to $36 million, approximately $0.25 in EPS and were principally related to cash severance for the structural cost improvement initiatives that Larry mentioned earlier. Again, this is reflective of what's needed to align our cost structure post-divestiture of the Blood business and to probably prepare us for what we believe will be a choppy economic environment going forward. Excluding these items, pro forma earnings per share in the quarter were $0.86, an increase of $0.21 compared to last year. Bridging the increase, the growth in operating profit contributed about $0.22 and this was net of $0.05 of transactional FX headwind and the tax rate contributed about $0.04. Translational FX headwind also was about $0.05, together $0.10. To recap the year, sales were $2.9 billion, including Blood, and $2.7 billion excluding it, an increase of 6% over last year. Foreign currency translation decreased the top line by about $27 million or about 1%. And so to be clear, excluding FX and Blood, sales were up about 7%. Overall, gross margins improved 70 basis points to 51.7% primarily driven by the improvement in Life Sciences. Now SG&A, excluding FX, increased 8% and increase in SG&A reflects many of the things we've been talking about for the year. The ERP implementation related and customer hyper care costs incurred as we concluded the last phase of our global deployment increased expenses from geographic expansion into Latin America, the Middle East and Asia and the incremental costs related to the acquisition of ForteBio. And these increases were partially offset by savings generated by cost savings programs, most notably in Industrial. 
Turning to income taxes, excluding discrete items, the underlying tax rate in the year was 23.2%, and this compares to 26.5% last year and reflects the tax benefits associated with the company's Asian and European headquarters. Pro forma earnings per share in the year were $2.80, an increase of $0.38 compared to last year. Bridging this increase, the growth in operating profit contributed about $0.25, and this is inclusive of transactional FX headwind of about $0.04 for the year and the tax rate contributed about $0.12 and the share count about $0.01. Translational FX was neutral to EPS for the year.
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the year, and I'm on slide 15, was $475 million, an increase of $45 million or 10% compared to last year. So we saw increased earnings exclusive of restructuring costs of most of these costs, the Q4 costs in FY '13 and reduction in inventory offset by some increase in receivables. The most significant uses of cash during the year included $210 million that we return to shareholders and this was dividends of $89 million and stock repurchases of 121 million, $168 million for the acquisition of ForteBio our Brazilian distributor and just under $160 million in capital spending. 
Wrapping up the discussion of our liquidity, our cash position stood at $500 million at July 31, 2012, and our net debt position was $196 million or 11.5% as a percentage of net debt plus equity. This compares to 9.1% at July 31, 2011. 
I'm going to turn to some forward-looking items before Larry wraps up with full year guidance of fiscal 2013. I'll briefly cover the Blood divestiture and foreign exchange to some stage. So I'm on Slide 16 and reviewing quickly the impact of Blood. I'm not going to review all of the pro forma impact on earnings as we've done so in 2 prior calls but I will highlight that accounting for the proceeds of the transaction, net of tax, we move from a net debt position again of $196 million at year end to a pro forma net cash position of $245 million. So in conjunction with the EPS guidance, Larry will discuss assumptions around these proceeds. 
Now moving on to FX impact, I'm on Slide 17. Looking at the major currency pairs impacting our business in Q4 compared to a year ago, the euro weakened against the U.S. dollar by 13% and the pound by 9% and the pound also weakened against the U.S. dollar by 4%. The dislocation of the euro in the second half of our fiscal year was a headwind to Q4 and, more importantly, to fiscal year 2013, which I'll discuss in a moment. To review the Q4 impact again, FX headwinds adversely impacted EPS by $0.10 with $0.05 of transactional impact and $0.05 of gross margin degradation transactional impact. Looking at the major currency pairs for the full year on a basis related to our results compared to your earlier, the euro weakened against the U.S. dollar by about 4% and against the pound by about 3% and the pound also weakened against the U.S. dollar by 1%. Conversely, the yen strengthened against the U.S. dollar by 5%. Together, these movements adversely impacted EPS by $0.04, and this was all transactional driven as the translational impact was about neutral to EPS for the year. 
Turning now to fiscal 2013. We are forecasting that FX headwinds will adversely impact earnings per share by $0.22 to $0.24 with $0.07 to $0.08 of transactional impact and $0.15 to $0.16 of gross margin transactional impact. We have taken actions to mitigate our long euro exposure, including hedging forecast of transactions to cushion the risk of further weakening. Our need to enter into hedge agreements will lessen as we make changes to our transactional flows to minimize -- to maximize natural hedges through better currency matching of revenue and expense. That concludes my report. I'll now hand this back to Larry."

Against that comparison, we'll outperform against the general environment in Asia and the Americas but expect that we could as we said contracted the low- to mid-single-digits rate in the Eurozone for the year. 
Slides 19 and 20 depict our modeling assumptions for the year, which are pretty consistent with what we said in the third quarter. You can see the region, the segment expectations for growth, the operations improvements and their associated impact, the year-over-year FX impact that Lisa just walked through, our intended R&D investments and our repurchase assumptions. Given all the above, we expect pro forma EPS in the $3.05 to $3.25 range, reflecting a 9% to 16% earnings per share growth. And again, that assumes an adverse impact of between $0.22 and $0.24 based on current exchange rates.
Obviously, as the markets are better than we anticipate, we take more share. We should be able to convert organic sales very well based on our improved fixed cost leverage. Our current view though is that we're working very hard to achieve that stated range. So with that, we're going to open the line for questions, operator."

As I said in my remarks, we built our business development team. That's group is in place no. We're building a proprietary transaction funnel. We're more actively engaging with the investment banking community, and we're tasking our senior team with cultivation responsibilities. So this will become a more acquisitive company, but it will be user of the very strategic acquisition and it will be those that we can take advantage of principally the sales and applications expertise that's a pretty big component of our SG&A structure globally. To your structural question about what's ideal, think about high 20s net debt kind of numbers. And that gives us a lot of spend capability.

What's important to understand in these numbers especially as you compare them to our fiscal year 2012 result is that we have a number of motivations in our cash flow numbers, first of which is some of the cash flows that we'll see associated with the sale of the Blood business. So the taxes that we'll pay as it is, which is reflected in the cash flow statement will negatively impact our free cash flow but the game goes below the line. And then we have a number of, as we disclosed in our release, we have a number of IRS audit settlements that we're working on that we expect to be settling from a cash perspective in fiscal year '13. So we have those numbers, if you will, $140 million to $160 million of unusual type items that if you wanted to make a pro forma cash flow, you would add back."

I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; and Brent Jones, our VP of Finance.Our remarks this morning will be on a continuing operations basis, which excludes the results of the Blood product line, which we",1886,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; and Brent Jones, our VP of Finance.
Our remarks this morning will be on a continuing operations basis, which excludes the results of the Blood product line, which we divested on August 1. I know that most of you have read our release and know the key headline. We executed a strong fourth quarter and turned in very solid results for the full year. Our pro forma EPS was a record $0.99 or $0.86 excluding Blood, and our full year results met the midpoint of our original guidance at the beginning of the year, and that's despite second half economic and FX headwinds. While the sales result for the quarter was strong, our cost to serve, essentially the cost to catch up from Q3, remained high.
But before I jump in to our results, I want to take a few -- make a few preparatory comments about what we've accomplished over the last year and what we anticipate for the year in front of us. I first spoke to you as Pall's CEO in December. At that time, I said that I viewed Pall as a huge long-term value-creation opportunity. I believe that statement even more so today. We talked about foundational work that we had to do, particularly with respect to people, process and technology, and I'm happy to report that we've made significant progress but with much more to do. With regard to people, as you know, there have been a number of changes to the executive management team. I'm incredibly pleased with the talent that we now have, as well as the developing bench strength behind them. In the fourth quarter, we added business development capability, which is critical to our growth strategy. 
With regard to process, in the quarter, we focused almost exclusively on restoring customer service levels to pre-SAP implementation levels and are now working toward best-in-industry metrics. And with regard to technology, we're increasing R&D spend. We're also taking a much more focused approach as to where we invest. We've added significant talents in R&D to accomplish this.
Last year, I articulated the strategy which highlighted our move toward more emphasis on strategic acquisitions to enable core growth. We will do so on a disciplined manner. This may include enhancing our current offerings but also moving into adjacent product markets where our applications expertise and our global channel are a natural fit.
We closed the transaction with Haemonetics on August 1 as planned, and there are no other planned divestitures. In short, we believe that we can more actively organically manage the portfolio to position ourselves well for future growth.
We're building an acquisition pipeline and expect that we will begin to more consistently acquire about a year from now. Our team has done a solid job integrating ForteBio, and we anticipate that it will exceed our preacquisition model for both growth and return.
I'll now move to our outlook generally. The global economy is concerning with a large dose of uncertainty. We assume that Europe will worsen, particularly for our Industrial business, China will grow but only significantly in about 1/3 of our vertical markets and the Microelectronics global end markets will not recover as previously assumed. However, all in, I think we have gotten ahead of the concerns, and we have a plan to deliver reasonable results in the face of a choppy environment.
Consistent with these, as you know, we've committed to $100 million instructional cost improvement over the next 3 years. We are targeting that half of that will be accomplished in fiscal year 2013, this year. This program is well underway, and I'm confident that we will achieve our target. It's critical that we rightsize our fixed cost structure at the same time that we reposition SG&A to take advantage of where growth can be achieved.
So let's move to the quarter discussion. We executed a strong recovery from our ERP-induced challenges in Q3. Nearly all of the shipments that were deferred into Q4 shift in Q4, bringing down our past dues significantly in the quarter. To be clear, again, we have a long way to go to claim best practice, but the team should be congratulated for how well they worked across function and with our external supply chain to restore confidence. Very solid execution.
We're beginning to make tough choices regarding our systems business and the required linkage to consumable sales. At the same time, our sales force is being repositioned and compensated to deliver the Pall value proposition to win consumable opportunities based on our industry-leading solutions capability. As we walk through the slides, you'll see that we've added emphasis on the business performance of our consumable products as we believe it is more meaningful to understand that in analyzing current trends. So with that, let's dive into the specifics.
I'll start with a brief overview of our Q4 and full year financial performance, and I'm on Slide 6. Sales grew about 6% excluding FX in the quarter, and 7% for the year, with contributions from both segments. Pro forma EPS increased 32% to $0.86 per share in the quarter and 16% to $2.80 per share for the year. Operating margin improved 370 basis points in the quarter to 19.3%. And Lisa will discuss the key drivers in a little bit. 
For the full year, operating margin came in at 17% at 50 basis points improvement, still negatively impacted by the ERP implementation expense and, in particular, the customer Hypercare transition-associated costs that we discussed last quarter. Free cash flow for the year increased 17% to $316 million. 
On Slide 7, Life Sciences sales grew by 8% in the quarter and Industrial grew by 5% excluding FX. Consumables, which comprised about 84% of total sales, grew almost 14% in Life Sciences and 5% in Industrial. Systems, which comprised 60% of total sales, declined 6% overall as growth in Industrial is offset by a decline in Life Sciences. Some of the decline in Life Sciences reflects our rationalization of low margin Food & Beverage systems, again, where we don't have that razor-blade opportunity.
Looking at the year, sales in both Life Sciences and Industrial increased to solid 7%. Consumable sales grew 7% in Life Sciences and 5.5% in Industrial. System sales grew 13% in the year, with both segments achieving double-digit growth. 
Now I will discuss the key drivers of the Life Science sales and the orders results in the quarter and the year on Slides 8 and 9. First, look at consumable sales. The growth in BioPharm consumable sales of almost 20% in the quarter and 12% for the year reflects continued strength in the biotech sector. The new Octet and BLItz products from ForteBio added about 4% to consumable sales growth in the quarter and 2% for the year to the BioPharm result. Consumable sales in Food & Beverage excluded the impact of the divestiture of our Verona business in Europe increased organically by about 12% in the quarter and 4% for the year with all regions contributing. The growth was driven by new applications and products. 
Medical consumable sales growth in the quarter reflects growth in our OEM channel. For the year, this was partially offset by specific customer inventory reductions and weak economic conditions in Europe affecting hospital spend, as fewer hospitals spent their -- on consumables accordingly and there were fewer hospital bacterial outbreaks. 
System sales declined 31% in the quarter, primarily due to reduce CapEx spend in the Food & Beverage market and also a reduction in BioPharm system sales during the period. The year-over-year comparison also reflects Q4 2011 large system sales in Asia. Life Science orders increased 14% in the quarter, with similar growth in both consumables and systems. The growth was driven by BioPharm. 
Consumables sales in Process Technologies, and I'm onto Slides 10 and 11, which consist of Energy & Water markets and the Machinery & Equipment OEM markets, were flat in the quarter mainly due to reduced capital good shipments to the Energy market, which, as you may recall, were extraordinarily high in Q4 of '11. This was offset by increased consumable sales in the Machinery & Equipment markets, reflecting strength in mining and mobile OEM sectors. For the year, consumable sales in Process Technologies grew 8%, reflecting growth in all of the process technology markets. On a full year basis as well, sales to Machinery & Equipment OEMs were particularly robust. 
Aerospace consumable sales were up 22% in the quarter, reflecting strong growth in both Commercial and Military spares. For the full year, Aerospace consumable sales increased 12%. Military sales were particularly strong, increasing 20%. Microelectronics consumables sales increased modestly at 2% in the quarter and down 3.5% for the year as growth in the Americas and Europe was partially offset by continued weakness in Asia. 
So moving on to Industrial systems performance. System sales increased 7% in the quarter and 15% in the year. This was primarily driven by the Energy market reflecting investment in oil and gas infrastructure in the Middle East. This was offset by a decline in Municipal Water sales in the year, as capital spend for water plants remained weak with deferred spending and delayed project decision-making. 
Looking at Industrial orders for the quarter, growth was 9%, primarily driven by systems orders, which increased over 33%. Systems orders were particularly strong in the Energy and Municipal Water markets. Consumables orders were up about 3% in total. 
So now on to Slide 12 for a look on the regional basis. Sales in the Americas increased 23%, again, tied to our operational recovery. We estimate that about half of the year-over-year growth in the region for the quarter was recovery and the other half consisted of organic growth of about 7%. Contribution from ForteBio and the acquisition of our Brazilian distributor, those 2 combined, contributed about 4%. Orders in the Americas increased about 16% in the quarter. This reflects recovery demand as well. Orders in Latin America were particularly strong at over 50%. This added about 3% to the Americas total orders growth. The robust sales growth in the Americas was dampened by flat performance in Europe and in Asia. Sales in Europe were flat for the quarter, but orders in Europe did increase at just under 5%. The sales result in Asia was impacted by a 21% decline in system sales, as well as an 8% decline in the Microelectronics market. Sales to the emerging markets in Asia declined in the quarter on weakness in China and India. However, we do anticipate that both China and India will grow just under or at double-digit rates in '13 based on known projects. Japan also performed well in the quarter based on the ongoing biotech investment there. 
Orders increased 16% in Asia. Systems orders increased over 70% from Korean firms in particular working on large Middle Eastern projects, while consumable orders increased in the low single-digit range. 
So with that, I'm going to turn this over to Lisa to wrap up the financial review with some details around profitability drivers and cash flow performance in the quarter and for the year, then we'll finish up with our outlook for the fiscal year 2013."
185333,216321609,357720,"Pall Corp., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Sep 13, 2012",2012-09-13,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a review of segment performance, jumping off of Larry's remarks on sales, and I'll begin with Life Sciences. Reflecting the favorable mix and absorption benefits from solid consumable sal",1302,"Okay. Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a review of segment performance, jumping off of Larry's remarks on sales, and I'll begin with Life Sciences. Reflecting the favorable mix and absorption benefits from solid consumable sales growth in the quarter, particularly in Pharmaceuticals, Life Sciences gross margin improved 170 basis points to just under 58%. Favorable pricing and the benefit of sales channel changes from distribution to direct also contributed. However, this was partly offset by about 130 basis points of FX headwind related to the deterioration of the euro. 
For the full year, Life Sciences gross margin improved 130 basis points to 58.2%, primarily driven by the same factors as in the quarter although FX was neutral for the year. With SG&A increasing about 5% excluding FX and down 70 basis points as a percent of sales year-over-year, the flow-through resulted in Life Sciences segment margin improving by 190 basis points in the quarter to 25.7%. 
Turning now to Industrial. As compared to the unfavorable product mix and execution in the fourth quarter of last year, gross margin improved by 280 basis points year-over-year. Systems gross margins improved 600 basis points or 6% year-over-year with improved execution and success of higher margin water trailer unit rentals. Some pricing achievement and absorption also provided some benefit as well. That said, gross margin also improved sequentially by 60 basis points from 45.4% in Q3 to 46% this quarter. For the full year, Industrial gross margins increased 10 basis points year-over-year to 45.9% that mainly reflects some improved pricing. 
The cost reduction efforts in Industrial became evident in Q4 in SG&A. And this was flat excluding FX year-over-year and down sequentially by 1.5%, then that's despite sequential sales growth of about 17%. The 140 basis point year-over-year decline in SG&A as a percent of sales, together with gross margin improvement, yielded a 490-basis-point improvement in segment margin in the quarter. The Industrial segment margin in the year improved to 14% from 13.7% last year. 
Turning now to Slide 14, and recapping our earnings per share performance. I'll spend a moment on the restructuring expenses recorded in the quarter, and this amounted to $36 million, approximately $0.25 in EPS and were principally related to cash severance for the structural cost improvement initiatives that Larry mentioned earlier. Again, this is reflective of what's needed to align our cost structure post-divestiture of the Blood business and to probably prepare us for what we believe will be a choppy economic environment going forward. Excluding these items, pro forma earnings per share in the quarter were $0.86, an increase of $0.21 compared to last year. Bridging the increase, the growth in operating profit contributed about $0.22, and this was net of $0.05 of transactional FX headwind, and the tax rate contributed about $0.04. Translational FX headwind also was about $0.05; together, $0.10. 
To recap the year, sales were $2.9 billion, including Blood, and $2.7 billion excluding it, an increase of 6% over last year. Foreign currency translation decreased the top line by about $27 million or about 1%. And so to be clear, excluding FX and Blood, sales were up about 7%. Overall, gross margins improved 70 basis points to 51.7%, primarily driven by the improvement in Life Sciences. Now SG&A excluding FX increased to 8%, and the increase in SG&A reflects many of the things we've been talking about through the year: the ERP implementation related in customer Hypercare costs incurred as we concluded the last phase of our global deployment; increased expenses from geographic expansion into Latin America, the Middle East and Asia; and the incremental costs related to the acquisition of ForteBio. And these increases were partly offset by savings generated by cost savings programs, most notably in Industrial. 
Turning to income taxes, excluding discrete items, the underlying tax rate in the year was 23.2%, and this compares to 26.5% last year and reflects the tax benefits associated with the company's Asian and European headquarters. Pro forma earnings per share in the year were $2.80, an increase of $0.38 compared to last year. And bridging this increase, the growth in operating profit contributed about $0.25, and this is inclusive of transactional FX headwinds of about $0.04 for the year. And the tax rate contributed about $0.12, and the share count about $0.01. Translational FX was neutral to EPS for the year.
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the year, and I'm on slide 15, was $475 million, an increase of $45 million or 10% compared to last year. So we saw increased earnings exclusive of restructuring costs as most of these costs, the Q4 costs, will be paid in FY '13 and a reduction in inventory offset by some increase in receivables. The most significant uses of cash during the year included $210 million that we return to shareholders, and this was dividends of $89 million and stock repurchases of 121 million, $168 million for the acquisition of ForteBio and our Brazilian distributor and just under $160 million in capital spending. 
Wrapping up the discussion of our liquidity, our cash position stood at $500 million at July 31, 2012, and our net debt position was $196 million or 11.5% as a percentage of net debt plus equity. This compares to 9.1% at July 31, 2011. 
I'm going to turn to some forward-looking items before Larry wraps up with a full year guidance of fiscal 2013. I'll briefly cover the Blood divestiture and foreign exchange to set the stage. 
So I'm on Slide 16, and reviewing quickly the impacts of Blood. I'm not going to review all of the pro forma impact on earnings as we've done so in 2 prior calls, but I will highlight that accounting for the proceeds of the transaction, net of tax, we move from a net debt position again of $196 million at year end to a pro forma net cash position of $245 million. So in conjunction with the EPS guidance, Larry will discuss assumptions around these proceeds. 
Now moving on to FX impact, I'm on Slide 17. Looking at the major currency pairs impacting our business in Q4 compared to a year ago, the euro weakened against the U.S. dollar by 13% and the pound by 9%, and the pound also weakened against the U.S. dollar by 4%. The dislocation of the euro in the second half of our fiscal year was a headwind to Q4 and, more importantly, to fiscal year 2013, which I'll discuss in a moment. To review the Q4 impact again, FX headwinds adversely impacted EPS by $0.10, with $0.05 of transactional impact and $0.05 of gross margin degradation transactional impact. Looking at the major currency pairs for the full year on a basis related to our results compared to a year earlier, the euro weakened against the U.S. dollar by about 4% and against the pound by about 3%, and the pound also weakened against the U.S. dollar by 1%. Conversely, the yen strengthened against the U.S. dollar by 5%. Together, these movements adversely impacted EPS by $0.04, and this was all transactional-driven as the translational impact was about neutral to EPS for the year. 
Turning now to fiscal 2013. We are forecasting that FX headwinds will adversely impact earnings per share by $0.22 to $0.24, with $0.07 to $0.08 of transactional impact and $0.15 to $0.16 of gross margin transactional impact. We have taken actions to mitigate our long euro exposure, including hedging forecast of transactions to cushion the risk of further weakening. Our need to enter into hedge agreements will lessen as we make changes to our transactional flows to minimize -- to maximize natural hedges through better currency matching of revenue and expense. 
That concludes my report, and I'll hand this back to Larry."

As we look forward, as I said, the market environment, it's mixed. Q4 was solid, and we did recover from our internal issues. Our assumptions for 2013 correlate pretty closely with the macro regional depiction that we have on Slide 18. Against that comparison, we'll outperform against the general environment in Asia and the Americas, but expect that we could, as we said, contract at a low to mid single-digit rate in the Eurozone for the year. 
Slides 19 and 20 depict our modeling assumptions for the year, which are pretty consistent with what we said in the third quarter. You can see the region and the segment expectations for growth, the operations' improvements and their associated impact, the year-over-year FX impact that Lisa just walked through, our intended R&D investments and our repurchase assumptions. Given all the above, we expect pro forma EPS in the $3.05 to $3.25 range, reflecting a 9% to 16% earnings per share growth. And again, that assumes an adverse impact of between $0.22 and $0.24 based on current exchange rates.
Obviously, if the markets are better than we anticipate, where we take more share. We should be able to convert organic sales very well based on our improved fixed cost leverage. Our current view, though, is that we're working very hard to achieve that stated range. 
So with that, we're going to open the line for questions, operator."

As I said in my remarks, we've built our business development team. That group is in place now. We're building a proprietary transaction funnel. We're more actively engaging with the investment banking community, and we're tasking our senior team with cultivation responsibilities. So this will become a more acquisitive company, but it'll be certainly very strategic acquisitions and it'll be those that we can take advantage of principally the sales and applications expertise that's a pretty big component of our SG&A structure globally. To your structural question about what's ideal, think about high 20s net debt kind of numbers. And that gives us a lot of spend capability.

And the assumptions that a number of the large -- both chip producers, as well as the capital equipment guys have modified in their view of the back half of the calendar year '12 and their view of calendar year '13 are such that it's kind of flattish performance. And you got some share gain shift going on among the chip producers. And so for folks like ours, what's most important is to make sure we're participating with those that are taking share in the segment versus losing. And there's an interesting dynamic in that regard.

I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; and Brent Jones, our VP of Finance.
Our remarks this morning will be on a continuing operations basis, which excludes the results of the Blood product line, which we divested on August 1. I know that most of you have read our release and know the key headline. We executed a strong fourth quarter and turned in very solid results for the full year. Our pro forma EPS was a record $0.99 or $0.86 excluding Blood, and our full year results met the midpoint of our original guidance at the beginning of the year, and that's despite second half economic and FX headwinds. While the sales result for the quarter was strong, our cost to serve, essentially the cost to catch up from Q3, remained high.
But before I jump in to our results, I want to take a few -- make a few preparatory comments about what we've accomplished over the last year and what we anticipate for the year in front of us. I first spoke to you as Pall's CEO in December. At that time, I said that I viewed Pall as a huge long-term value-creation opportunity. I believe that statement even more so today. We talked about foundational work that we had to do, particularly with respect to people, process and technology, and I'm happy to report that we've made significant progress but with much more to do. With regard to people, as you know, there have been a number of changes to the executive management team. I'm incredibly pleased with the talent that we now have, as well as the developing bench strength behind them. In the fourth quarter, we added business development capability, which is critical to our growth strategy. 
With regard to process, in the quarter, we focused almost exclusively on restoring customer service levels to pre-SAP implementation levels and are now working toward best-in-industry metrics. And with regard to technology, we're increasing R&D spend. We're also taking a much more focused approach as to where we invest. We've added significant talents in R&D to accomplish this.
Last year, I articulated the strategy which highlighted our move toward more emphasis on strategic acquisitions to enable core growth. We will do so in a disciplined manner. This may include enhancing our current offerings but also moving into adjacent product markets where our applications expertise and our global channel are a natural fit.
We closed the transaction with Haemonetics on August 1 as planned, and there are no other planned divestitures. In short, we believe that we can more actively organically manage the portfolio to position ourselves well for future growth.
We're building an acquisition pipeline and expect that we will begin to more consistently acquire about a year from now. Our team has done a solid job integrating ForteBio, and we anticipate that it will exceed our preacquisition model for both growth and return.
I'll now move to our outlook generally. The global economy is concerning with a large dose of uncertainty. We assume that Europe will worsen, particularly for our Industrial business, China will grow but only significantly in about 1/3 of our vertical markets and the Microelectronics global end markets will not recover as previously assumed. However, all in, I think we have gotten ahead of the concerns, and we have a plan to deliver reasonable results in the face of a choppy environment.
Consistent with this, as you know, we've committed to $100 million in structural cost improvement over the next 3 years. We are targeting that half of that will be accomplished in fiscal year 2013, this year. This program is well underway, and I'm confident that we will achieve our target. It's critical that we rightsize our fixed cost structure at the same time that we reposition SG&A to take advantage of where growth can be achieved.
So let's move to the quarter discussion. We executed a strong recovery from our ERP-induced challenges in Q3. Nearly all of the shipments that were deferred into Q4 shipped in Q4, bringing down our past dues significantly in the quarter. To be clear, again, we have a long way to go to claim best practice, but the team should be congratulated for how well they worked across function and with our external supply chain to restore confidence. Very solid execution.
We're beginning to make tough choices regarding our systems business and the required linkage to consumable sales. At the same time, our sales force is being repositioned and compensated to deliver the Pall value proposition to win consumable opportunities based on our industry-leading solutions capability. As we walk through the slides, you'll see that we've added emphasis on the business performance of our consumable products as we believe it is more meaningful to understand that in analyzing current trends. So with that, let's dive into the specifics.
I'll start with a brief overview of our Q4 and full year financial performance, and I'm on Slide 6. Sales grew about 6% excluding FX in the quarter, and 7% for the year, with contributions from both segments. Pro forma EPS increased 32% to $0.86 per share in the quarter and 16% to $2.80 per share for the year. Operating margin improved 370 basis points in the quarter to 19.3%. And Lisa will discuss the key drivers in a little bit. 
For the full year, operating margin came in at 17%, a 50-basis-point improvement, still negatively impacted by the ERP implementation expense and, in particular, the customer Hypercare transition-associated costs that we discussed last quarter. Free cash flow for the year increased 17% to $316 million. 
On Slide 7, Life Sciences sales grew by 8% in the quarter and Industrial grew by 5% excluding FX. Consumables, which comprised about 84% of total sales, grew almost 14% in Life Sciences and 5% in Industrial. Systems, which comprised 60% of total sales, declined 6% overall as growth in Industrial was offset by a decline in Life Sciences. Some of the decline in Life Sciences reflects our rationalization of low margin Food & Beverage systems, again, where we don't have that razor-blade opportunity.
Looking at the year, sales in both Life Sciences and Industrial increased a solid 7%. Consumable sales grew 7% in Life Sciences and 5.5% in Industrial. System sales grew 13% in the year, with both segments achieving double-digit growth. 
Now I will discuss the key drivers of the Life Science sales and the orders results in the quarter and the year on Slides 8 and 9. First, look at consumable sales. The growth in BioPharm consumable sales of almost 20% in the quarter and 12% for the year reflects continued strength in the biotech sector. The new Octet and BLItz products from ForteBio added about 4% to consumable sales growth in the quarter and 2% for the year to the BioPharm result. Consumable sales in Food & Beverage excluding the impact of the divestiture of our Verona business in Europe increased organically by about 12% in the quarter and 4% for the year with all regions contributing. The growth was driven by new applications and products. 
Medical consumable sales growth in the quarter reflects growth in our OEM channel. For the year, this was partially offset by specific customer inventory reductions and weak economic conditions in Europe affecting hospital spend, as fewer hospitals spent their -- on consumables accordingly and there were fewer hospital bacterial outbreaks. 
System sales declined 31% in the quarter, primarily due to reduced CapEx spend in the Food & Beverage market and also a reduction in BioPharm system sales during the period. The year-over-year comparison also reflects Q4 2011 large system sales in Asia. Life Science orders increased 14% in the quarter, with similar growth in both consumables and systems. The growth was driven by BioPharm. 
Consumables sales in Process Technologies, and I'm on to Slides 10 and 11, which consist of Energy & Water markets and the Machinery & Equipment OEM markets, were flat in the quarter, mainly due to reduced capital goods shipments to the Energy market, which, as you may recall, were extraordinarily high in Q4 of '11. This was offset by increased consumable sales in the Machinery & Equipment markets, reflecting strength in mining and mobile OEM sectors. For the year, consumable sales in Process Technologies grew 8%, reflecting growth in all of the process technology markets. On a full year basis as well, sales to Machinery & Equipment OEMs were particularly robust. 
Aerospace consumable sales were up 22% in the quarter, reflecting strong growth in both Commercial and Military spares. For the full year, Aerospace consumable sales increased 12%. Military sales were particularly strong, increasing 20%. Microelectronics consumables sales increased modestly at 2% in the quarter and down 3.5% for the year as growth in the Americas and Europe was partially offset by continued weakness in Asia. 
So moving on to Industrial systems performance. System sales increased 7% in the quarter and 15% in the year. This was primarily driven by the energy market reflecting investment in oil and gas infrastructure in the Middle East. This was offset by a decline in Municipal Water sales in the year, as capital spend for water plants remained weak with deferred spending and delayed project decision-making. 
Looking at Industrial orders for the quarter, growth was 9%, primarily driven by systems orders, which increased over 33%. Systems orders were particularly strong in the Energy and Municipal Water markets. Consumables orders were up about 3% in total. 
So now on to Slide 12 for a look on a regional basis. Sales in the Americas increased 23%, again tied to our operational recovery. We estimate that about half of the year-over-year growth in the region for the quarter was recovery and the other half consisted of organic growth of about 7%. Contribution from ForteBio and the acquisition of our Brazilian distributor, those 2 combined, contributed about 4%. Orders in the Americas increased about 16% in the quarter. This reflects recovery demand as well. Orders in Latin America were particularly strong at over 50%. This added about 3% to the Americas total orders growth. The robust sales growth in the Americas was dampened by flat performance in Europe and in Asia. Sales in Europe were flat for the quarter, but orders in Europe did increase at just under 5%. The sales result in Asia was impacted by a 21% decline in system sales, as well as an 8% decline in the Microelectronics market. Sales to the emerging markets in Asia declined in the quarter on weakness in China and India. However, we do anticipate that both China and India will grow just under or at double-digit rates in '13 based on known projects. Japan also performed well in the quarter based on the ongoing biotech investment there. 
Orders increased 16% in Asia. Systems orders increased over 70% from Korean firms in particular working on large Middle Eastern projects, while consumable orders increased in the low-single digit range. 
So with that, I'm going to turn this over to Lisa to wrap up the financial review with some details around profitability drivers and cash flow performance in the quarter and for the year, then we'll finish up with our outlook for the fiscal year 2013."

I'll start with a review of segment performance, jumping off of Larry's remarks on sales, and I'll begin with Life Sciences. Reflecting the favorable mix and absorption benefits from solid consumable sales growth in the quarter, particularly in Pharmaceuticals, Life Sciences gross margin improved 170 basis points to just under 58%. Favorable pricing and the benefit of sales channel changes from distribution to direct also contributed. However, this was partly offset by about 130 basis points of FX headwind related to the deterioration of the euro. 
For the full year, Life Sciences gross margin improved 130 basis points to 58.2%, primarily driven by the same factors as in the quarter although FX was neutral for the year. With SG&A increasing about 5% excluding FX and down 70 basis points as a percent of sales year-over-year, the flow-through resulted in Life Sciences segment margin improving by 190 basis points in the quarter to 25.7%. 
Turning now to Industrial. As compared to the unfavorable product mix and execution in the fourth quarter of last year, gross margin improved by 280 basis points year-over-year. Systems gross margins improved 600 basis points or 6% year-over-year with improved execution and success of higher margin water trailer unit rentals. Some pricing achievement and absorption also provided some benefit as well. That said, gross margin also improved sequentially by 60 basis points from 45.4% in Q3 to 46% this quarter. For the full year, Industrial gross margins increased 10 basis points year-over-year to 45.9%. That mainly reflects some improved pricing. 
The cost reduction efforts in Industrial became evident in Q4 in SG&A. And this was flat excluding FX year-over-year and down sequentially by 1.5%, then that's despite sequential sales growth of about 17%. The 140-basis-point year-over-year decline in SG&A as a percent of sales, together with gross margin improvement, yielded a 490-basis-point improvement in segment margin in the quarter. The Industrial segment margin in the year improved to 14% from 13.7% last year. 
Turning now to Slide 14, and recapping our earnings per share performance. I'll spend a moment on the restructuring expenses recorded in the quarter, and these amounted to $36 million, approximately $0.25 in EPS and were principally related to cash severance for the structural cost improvement initiatives that Larry mentioned earlier. Again, this is reflective of what's needed to align our cost structure post-divestiture of the Blood business and to properly prepare us for what we believe will be a choppy economic environment going forward. Excluding these items, pro forma earnings per share in the quarter were $0.86, an increase of $0.21 compared to last year. Bridging the increase, the growth in operating profit contributed about $0.22, and this was net of $0.05 of transactional FX headwind, and the tax rate contributed about $0.04. Translational FX headwind also was about $0.05; together, $0.10. 
To recap the year, sales were $2.9 billion, including Blood, and $2.7 billion excluding it, an increase of 6% over last year. Foreign currency translation decreased the top line by about $27 million or about 1%. And so to be clear, excluding FX and Blood, sales were up about 7%. Overall, gross margins improved 70 basis points to 51.7%, primarily driven by the improvement in Life Sciences. Now SG&A excluding FX increased 8%, and the increase in SG&A reflects many of the things we've been talking about through the year: the ERP implementation-related and customer Hypercare costs incurred as we concluded the last phase of our global deployment; increased expenses from geographic expansion into Latin America, the Middle East and Asia; and the incremental costs related to the acquisition of ForteBio. And these increases were partly offset by savings generated by cost savings programs, most notably in Industrial. 
Turning to income taxes, excluding discrete items, the underlying tax rate in the year was 23.2%, and this compares to 26.5% last year and reflects the tax benefits associated with the company's Asian and European headquarters. Pro forma earnings per share in the year were $2.80, an increase of $0.38 compared to last year. And bridging this increase, the growth in operating profit contributed about $0.25, and this is inclusive of transactional FX headwinds of about $0.04 for the year. And the tax rate contributed about $0.12, and the share count about $0.01. Translational FX was neutral to EPS for the year.
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the year, and I'm on slide 15, was $475 million, an increase of $45 million or 10% compared to last year. So we saw increased earnings exclusive of restructuring costs as most of these costs, the Q4 costs, will be paid in FY '13 and a reduction in inventory offset by some increase in receivables. The most significant uses of cash during the year included $210 million that we return to shareholders, and this was dividends of $89 million and stock repurchases of $121 million, $168 million for the acquisition of ForteBio and our Brazilian distributor and just under $160 million in capital spending. 
Wrapping up the discussion of our liquidity, our cash position stood at $500 million at July 31, 2012, and our net debt position was $196 million or 11.5% as a percentage of net debt plus equity. This compares to 9.1% at July 31, 2011. 
I'm going to turn to some forward-looking items before Larry wraps up with a full year guidance of fiscal 2013. I'll briefly cover the Blood divestiture and foreign exchange to set the stage. 
So I'm on Slide 16, and reviewing quickly the impacts of Blood. I'm not going to review all of the pro forma impact on earnings as we've done so in 2 prior calls, but I will highlight that accounting for the proceeds of the transaction, net of tax, we move from a net debt position again of $196 million at year end to a pro forma net cash position of $245 million. So in conjunction with the EPS guidance, Larry will discuss assumptions around these proceeds. 
Now moving on to FX impact, I'm on Slide 17. Looking at the major currency pairs impacting our business in Q4 compared to a year ago, the euro weakened against the U.S. dollar by 13% and the pound by 9%, and the pound also weakened against the U.S. dollar by 4%. The dislocation of the euro in the second half of our fiscal year was a headwind to Q4 and, more importantly, to fiscal year 2013, which I'll discuss in a moment. To review the Q4 impact again, FX headwinds adversely impacted EPS by $0.10, with $0.05 of translational impact and $0.05 of gross margin degradation transactional impact. Looking at the major currency pairs for the full year on a basis weighted to our results compared to a year earlier, the euro weakened against the U.S. dollar by about 4% and against the pound by about 3%, and the pound also weakened against the U.S. dollar by 1%. Conversely, the yen strengthened against the U.S. dollar by 5%. Together, these movements adversely impacted EPS by $0.04, and this was all transactional-driven as the translational impact was about neutral to EPS for the year. 
Turning now to fiscal 2013. We are forecasting that FX headwinds will adversely impact earnings per share by $0.22 to $0.24, with $0.07 to $0.08 of translational impact and $0.15 to $0.16 of gross margin transactional impact. We have taken actions to mitigate our long euro exposure, including hedging forecasted transactions to cushion the risk of further weakening. Our need to enter into hedge agreements will lessen as we make changes to our transactional flows to minimize -- to maximize natural hedges through better currency matching of revenue and expense. 
That concludes my report, and I'll hand this back to Larry."

As we look forward, as I said, the market environment, it's mixed. Q4 was solid, and we did recover from our internal issues. Our assumptions for 2013 correlate pretty closely with the macro regional depiction that we have on Slide 18. Against that comparison, we'll outperform against the general environment in Asia and the Americas, but expect that we could, as we said, contract at a low- to mid-single digit rate in the Eurozone for the year. 
Slides 19 and 20 depict our modeling assumptions for the year, which are pretty consistent with what we said in the third quarter. You can see the region and the segment expectations for growth, the operations' improvements and their associated impact, the year-over-year FX impact that Lisa just walked through, our intended R&D investment and our repurchase assumptions. Given all the above, we expect pro forma EPS in the $3.05 to $3.25 range, reflecting a 9% to 16% earnings per share growth. And again, that assumes an adverse impact of between $0.22 and $0.24 based on current exchange rates.
Obviously, if the markets are better than we anticipate or we take more share, we should be able to convert organic sales very well based on our improved fixed cost leverage. Our current view, though, is that we're working very hard to achieve that stated range. 
So with that, we're going to open the line for questions, operator."

As I said in my remarks, we've built our business development team. That group's in place now. We're building a proprietary transaction funnel. We're more actively engaging with the investment banking community, and we're tasking our senior team with cultivation responsibilities. So this will become a more acquisitive company, but it'll be certainly very strategic acquisitions and it'll be those that we can take advantage of principally the sales and applications expertise that's a pretty big component of our SG&A structure globally. To your structural question about what's ideal, think about high 20s net debt kind of numbers. And that gives us a lot of spend capability.

The mix should be pretty good. The challenge with incremental assumptions on organic growth when it's lower single-digit organic growth versus higher single-digit organic growth is you know you have to first outpace the natural inflation factors. And so no matter what your P&L profile is and what your improved cost structure might be or better mix might be, the incrementals, the margin -- the incremental rate grows substantially once you clear that inherent inflation requirement or number that's part of the year-over-year bridge. So it does depend substantially on how much growth there is. On a lower organic kind of single-digit assumption basis, it's going to be 30% to 35% incrementals.

And the assumption's that a number of the large -- both chip producers, as well as the capital equipment guys have modified in their view of the back half of the calendar year '12 and their view of calendar year '13 are such that it's kind of flattish performance. And you got some share gain shift going on among the chip producers.

Thank you for joining us as well. I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; and Brent Jones, VP of Finance.Our remarks this morning will be on a continuing operations basis, which excludes the results of the Blood prod",1509,"Thank you, Brook. Good morning. Thank you for joining us as well. I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; and Brent Jones, VP of Finance.
Our remarks this morning will be on a continuing operations basis, which excludes the results of the Blood product line we divested on August 1. As most of you know, we made public statements a few weeks ago to provide our initial read of our Q1 results and to update our perspective for the full fiscal year. We noted that the end market environment had changed since we provided full year guidance in early September, specifically after a typically slow but hard to trend August, mid-September was slower than anticipated, and October while showing signs of improvement was also choppy. All of this was against the backdrop of public commentary and actual financial results by our customers, our peers, as well as other large industrial players. And even though some of the messaging was mixed, the underlying theme was clear. The macroenvironment is sloppy. There is continued pressure on capital investment and the emerging country economies in particular are slower than most anticipated. And we're forecasting to us, in the case of our customers. 
Given the diversity of our exposure, it's often difficult to distill such an environment into summary level themes to be more about the specific projects and utilization rates, which drive consumption of our product. A couple of current takeaways though. First, despite the macro headwinds, the Life Sciences segment continues to perform with Q1 growth of about 4%, orders were up 5% and the Life Sciences segment did experience strong momentum in the September, October time frame. The main driver was unsurprisingly BioPharm where we are winning new customers and new types of applications, all in a very attractive space. We continue to see strong momentum for the back half of the year. 
Second, the global Industrial end markets have taken a bit of a pause for a few months and look to be selectively soft for several months ahead. We sorted through how much of the impact to Q1 was end market demand reduction versus channel destocking and it appears to be about 2/3 end market versus destocking That's contributing to our year-to-date results. Sales for our Industrial segment in total were down 3.5% and orders were down about 13%. The most acute impact was from global semiconductor fabricators and Machinery & Equipment OEMs and end users. Our Industrial customers in many cases had adopted a much more cautious tone though for the foreseeable future.
The third takeaway though is the impact of our cost savings initiatives. Our operating profit increased 80 bps on a year-over-year basis and the Industrial business segment margin increased 360 bps. Our structural cost savings initiatives were not only necessary, a point that we consistently made, but were also well timed. The team is acting globally to properly position our cost structure to perform in the current environment, but we will not disable our growth or innovation potential.
Fourth and finally, we're in an environment where growth is critical, but we're making the necessary investments to do so. As I've previously discussed, we're increasing the focus of our R&D organization so we can get the best bang for our buck, but also increasing our actual spend. R&D investment in Q1 increased by $3 million and it is expected to grow by $12 million to $15 million this fiscal year.
Moving on to look at Q1 results now from a geographic perspective first with some market specific color. The Americas was not as strong as we expected with sales up 2%, excluding FX, and down slightly organically with strong BioPharm driven performance and Life Sciences while Industrial was down. This result was significantly impacted by weakness in Water, while orders from the Industrial OEMs who sell globally were down. The Americas result is a function of export order volume decline in addition to the in-region, end market demands. 
Europe was a little stronger than expected, up a little over 3% in [indiscernible] as expected BioPharm was a strong contributor but the Industrial process systems business also shipped well in the quarter. However, orders were impacted by capital spending issues. 
Finally, Asia was down nearly 7%. Performance was challenged in our larger country markets other than Korea and India. China was down double digits again delays in capital projects and weakness specifically on our Power Generation products and primary metals applications. Japan continue to experience the effects of the lower semiconductor industry production rates and other Microelectronics sluggish demand. 
So with that, let's look at the specifics for the quarter. On Slide 6, first by segment. Life Sciences sales grew by about 4% in the quarter, excluding FX, and Industrial declined by about the same. Consumables, the replaceable filters, which comprised 88% of total sales grew 4% in Life Sciences and decreased 3% in Industrial. Systems was comprised 12% of the total sales in the quarter, declined 2% overall, as growth in Life Science was offset by a decline in Industrial. 
And now turning to Slide 7, the drivers of the Life Science sales and orders. First, if we look at Consumables sales. The growth in Biopharmaceutical Consumables of 7% in the quarter reflects continued strength in the biotech, biosimilar and other biological drug sectors. Consumables sales in Food & Beverage, excluding the impact of the divestiture of our Verona business in Europe, were up slightly. Strong growth in the Americas due impart to Latin American largely offset weakness in Europe, and that was related to sluggishness in the beer and wine production volume there. Medical consumable sales were flat in the quarter on tough comparables in the OEM sector year-over-year. Systems sales increased 2% in the quarter as growth in BioPharm was partially offset by a decline in Food & Beverage reflective of weak capital spend and again against the large comp in the prior year quarter in the Americas. Life Sciences total segment orders increased 5% in the quarter with Consumables growth of 7%, again driven by BioPharm. Systems orders were down reflecting slowing and capital spend in Food & Bev. 
And then moving on to Slide 8. Looking at Industrial. Consumable sales in Process Technologies were down about 4% in the quarter mainly due to reduced sales in the Machinery & Equipment market, reflecting weakness in the mobile OEM, the primary metals and construction sectors, as well as our decision to exit certain lower margin products. This was partly offset by increased consumable sales in the Energy markets. Aerospace Consumables sales were up 3%. Commercial Aerospace increased 5% driven by increased aftermarket sales. And Military Consumables were flat. And Microelectronics Consumables sales declined 7%, again reflecting the low utilization rates that I spoke to.
So moving on to Industrial Systems sales performance. Systems sales declined 4% primarily on weakness in the Municipal Water market as customers are delaying projects and are looking to reduce spending. Additionally, the compared to the quarter of '12 included a large wastewater project that did not repeat this year. Looking at Industrial orders for the quarter, Consumables were down about 11%. Systems declined 26%, consistent with the capital commitment trends I mentioned earlier. The impact to Industrial organic orders performance was pretty broad based with the exception of Commercial Aerospace.
And Slide 9 refers to specific regional performance, but I think I've covered that, so I'm going to move on. Let's go to Slide 10. With regard to  overall performance in the quarter, sales were $628 million compared to $651 million last year. Foreign currency translation decreased the top line by about $23 million or about 3.5%, excluding FX, sales were flat. Overall, gross margins improved 60 basis points to 52.1%. This reflects the notable improvement in Industrial but that's partly offset by the FX driven decline in Life Sciences. SG&A, excluding FX, decreased 200 basis points. This reflects the savings generated by our structural cost improvement initiatives that we've spoken to. Net of the those investments we're making to structure the company for future profitable growth. Excluding the discrete items, the underlying tax rate in the quarter was 23.3% compared to 23.9% last year. Pro forma earnings per share in the quarter were $0.68, an increase of $0.02 compared to last year. And bridging this, the growth in the operating profit contributed about $0.08, $0.04 net of the transactional FX headwind. And the tax rate and share count reduction combined contributed about $0.01. Translational FX, decremented EPS by about $0.03, so for combined FX headwind or impact of $0.07.
From an operations management perspective, we achieved a reasonable leverage. If you think about it on flat sales, we grew EPS about 13.5%. That's obviously excluding the total FX impact. 
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Lisa to discuss the specifics of segment performance and more detail around profitability drivers, as well as cash flow performance in the quarter. And then we'll finish up with the current business outlook for the full year."

I'll start with the review of the segment performance in the context of Larry's overall comments. And I'll begin on Slide 11 with Life Sciences. Life Sciences gross margin declined 40 basis points to 58.",675,"Okay, thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the review of the segment performance in the context of Larry's overall comments. And I'll begin on Slide 11 with Life Sciences. Life Sciences gross margin declined 40 basis points to 58.7% and this principally reflects about 150 bps of FX headwinds related to the deterioration of the euro, and it was partly mitigated by favorable mix from the solid Pharmaceuticals consumable sales growth in the quarter.
R&D expenditures in Life Sciences increased $4 million or 35%, and this excludes FX, and it's about 130 bps as a percent of sales. And this reflects the increased focus on development of our instrumentation capabilities including spends related to our ForteBio product line.
SG&A increased about 9%, excluding FX, and this also principally reflects the ForteBio associated costs. Putting these factors together, Life Sciences segment profit declined 8%, excluding FX, with the investment impact of ForteBio slightly dilutive.
Turning now to Industrial. Gross margin improved by 110 basis points to 46.1% and this reflects all Industrial's continued rationalization of its product line. And this performance was also attributable to a larger proportion of higher margins Systems and service revenue than usual. We do not expect this to be sustained for the rest of the year. The structural cost improvement efforts begun last year and continuing into this year in Industrial, benefited SG&A, which declined about 11% ex-FX. So we are pleased with this result. The 240-basis-point decline in SG&A as a percentage of sales, together with gross margin improvement, yielded a 360 bps improvement in segment margin in the quarter. Segment profit dollars increased 23%, excluding FX, despite the decline in revenue of almost 4%.
Now one item of note with respect to our overall corporate-wide SG&A is that in our second quarter, we expect a typical sequential increase due to certain annual events such as merit increases, equity grants, et cetera. So that's important to consider generally in connection with our second quarter operating margins.
Turning now to Slide 12. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $39 million, which was a decrease of $39 million year-over-year. This reflects the impact to cash flow of the Blood sale as well is the settlement of several years of U.S. tax audits to payments for the structural cost-reduction initiatives in the quarter, and that we talked about in our fourth quarter last year. On a year-over-year basis, our inventory is essentially flat, but with the $25 million reallocation from finished goods the raw materials and whip, which is part of our media supermarket strategy. This will allow us to better allocate resources and more efficiently manage our production while avoiding unnecessary inventory build.
Significant uses of cash included just under $100 million return to shareholders with dividends of 24 million and stock repurchases of $75 million. Repayment of short term debt of $75 million and $23 million in CapEx. Wrapping up the discussion of our liquidity, our cash positions at approximately $910 million at quarter end and our cash position net of debt was $291 million and this compares to a net debt position of $196 million at year end.
Before Larry wraps up with our current outlook for 2013, I'll briefly recap FX on Slide 14. Looking at the major currency compares impacting our business, compared to a year ago, the euro weakened against the dollar, the U.S. dollar and the pound by 10% in the first quarter, recapping the impact as Larry covered a moment ago, the dislocation of the euro was a headwind of approximately $0.07 in the first quarter. And we continue to have significant euro exposure. And as we've spoken about before, we have taken actions to mitigate it including hedging forecasted transactions to cushion the risk of possible further weakening. Now our need to enter into hedging agreements will lessen as we make changes to our transactional flows to maximize natural hedges to better matching of revenue and expense. 
That concludes my report. And I'll turn it back over to Larry."

As you know, we're in a very dynamic environment, but we're responding well to. There are a number of moving targets FX volatility and governmental budgetary pressure, customers changing risk tolerance and a number of others. They all have t",603,"Thanks, Lisa. As you know, we're in a very dynamic environment, but we're responding well to. There are a number of moving targets FX volatility and governmental budgetary pressure, customers changing risk tolerance and a number of others. They all have the potential to continue to affect the activity globally. That being said, we're listening closely to the customers, and we parse what we've heard from them into the trends, which form the basis of our updated forecast. 
So first, the specific Life Science input. BioPharm continues at a healthy pace even in Europe, driven by will Western world product development supporting the so-called pharmerging global activity. The sustained growth of the BioPharm end markets in particular the biologicals, monoclonal-based treatments for autoimmune diseases will continue to drive very strong performance in the face of choppy economics. Our outlook accordingly is that from first to second half of our fiscal year that we've got a 10% growth assumptions, so sequential growth of 10%. That calculates on a full year basis to an assumption of a mid- to high single digits organic growth for Life Sciences. 
In the Industrial end markets, as we've said, current sales and order rate performance for Industrial segment is driven by both end market softening and destocking. And these trends are particularly germane to our microelectronics and the Machinery & Equipment markets. In the microelectronics, the majority of the current sales trend is end market capacity driven. And MicroE demand is pretty broadly down. Recent consumer demand is sustained suggest that some of the inventory will be consumed though. And therefore fab utilization might increase before the end of our fiscal year. And for Machinery & Equipment, we attribute the current challenge to both too much OEM inventory, as well as lower utilization rates. And more specifically for Machinery & Equipment in the Americas, the outlook assume that in-region demand and exports impact OEMs but also that end-users spend generally remains pressured.
Europe is largely affected by low utilization rates and Asia is more of a destocking channel driven, sort of which could rebound but it may not be until the end of the year. Municipal Water just doesn't look good. Continued weakness is expected in Muni Water through the end of the fiscal year. So our outlook for Industrial accordingly is that we expect Industrial sales growth to be down low- to mid-single digits and this factors in a sequential improvements through the balance of the year.
Our updated guidance is entirely driven by the range of sales performance we now anticipate. We think Q2 sales levels will be similar to Q1. However, we know that we will not have the benefit of several favorable mix in the Industrial business. In addition, due to the holidays and scheduled this year, there nare less work days versus last. And some of our customers may selectively shut down to a greater degree this year. We'll see. Relative to margin for the upcoming quarter, as Lisa mentioned, we also expect the typical sequential SG&A increase from Q1 to 2 that will modestly impact margins. However, our structural actions are on target and we're beginning to see the benefits of productivity enhancements. For the full year, the underlying tax rate will be 24% in line with the previous guidance. And there is no significant change to our repurchase assumption. Our FX exposure again represents about an 8% drag on earnings for the full year. So in total, all factored in, we are guiding pro forma EPS to $2.95 to $3.15. 
So with that, operator, we're ready to go to the Q&A session."

So it's inventory that OEMs may have built in to product that hasn't sold and/or product that they have on the shelf awaiting a build cycle. And that's a significant portion of the content that represents about the 1/3 of the impact to the sales numbers that we described for Industrial is down in 1/3 destockers and 2/3 the Industrial and demand. I think that it's leaned out pretty well, to answer your question. I don't think there's too much more that will come. It's a little bit of a different picture in Asia versus the Rest of the World where there is more inventory in the OEM food chain in Asia, so there could be slightly kind of more to come there. But I think that what we've seen is kind of representation of the destocking component. And as far as the end market demand, you didn't specifically ask, but we don't expect it to get a lot worse. And if you go back to my comments relative to guidance, we think the back half does improve sequentially, some of that is not unusual but fairly typical Pall in a seasonal trend.

We expect a more normalized Industrial mix as we go into the remainder of the year. Now as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the good news is that we're getting after the costs, both the direct costs about more importantly, the cost to serve in Industrial such that we'll continue to see Industrial, both gross margins and up margins improve over the intermediate period, as well as the long term, but it's not going to be kind of completely clean bridge of 16% as we go forward."

And in some cases, those that didn't have a Consumables follow on a razor blade nature to them, they're also low margins. So those are the ones that we don't definitely want to be a long term.

And I would say that we do believe from a macro perspective that things are have bottomed out, so we don't expect a lot more downward pressure. I spoke to the factors that there's a lot of variables out there in the world right now. But kind of a little bit early good news that China may be coming back from a plan for how they're going after to continually to spend on the infrastructure associated set of segments which we'll benefit from. And I do think MicroE is somewhat bottomed out for the comments that we just made.

Secondly, with respect to we had a little bit of a plant interruption at our Fort Myers facility in Florida, where we had a fire during the quarter and we lost several days of production. And we were not able to return to what our desired customer-driven sales opportunity was for the quarter by the end of the quarter.

The bigger element to what's happening in terms of how we're thinking about managing inventory, both from what's happened in the current environment but also structurally and strategically for how we get a much better working capital story, is and Lisa mentioned it, but we're building inventory principally in whip and a little bit in raw it's about $25 million that moves from finished goods of the whip and raw in the quarter such that we can respond just as fast going forward without having to have the degree of dedicated finished goods inventory that we have historically. So historically, we have as you know, held a fair amount of finished goods inventory that's in many cases customer specific. We're moving to world stock media such that we can convert very quickly and be much more flexible and allow ourselves to finished goods inventory reduction over time.

Good morning. Thank you for joining us as well. I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; and Brent Jones, VP of Finance.
Our remarks this morning will be on a continuing operations basis, which exclude the results of the blood product line we divested on August 1.
As most of you know, we made public statements a few weeks ago to provide our initial read of our Q1 results and to update our perspective for the full fiscal year. We noted that the end market environment had changed since we provided full year guidance in early September, specifically after a typically slow but hard-to-trend August. Late September was slower than anticipated, and October, while showing signs of improvement, was also choppy. All of this was against the backdrop of public commentary and actual financial results by our customers, our peers as well as other large industrial players. And even though some of the messaging was mixed, the underlying theme was clear: The macroenvironment is sloppy. There is continued pressure on capital investment, and the emerging country economies in particular are slower than most anticipated and were forecasting to us, in the case of our customers. Given the diversity of our exposure, it's often difficult to distill such an environment into summary-level themes that tend to be more about the specific projects and about utilization rates, which drive consumption of our product.
A couple of current takeaways, though. First, despite the macro headwinds, the Life Sciences segment continues to perform, with Q1 growth of about 4%. Orders were up 5%, and the Life Sciences segment did experience strong momentum in the September-October time frame. The main driver was, unsurprisingly, biopharm where we are winning new customers and new types of applications, all in a very attractive space. We continue to see strong momentum for the back half of the year.
Second, the global industrial end markets have taken a bit of a pause for a few months and look to be selectively soft for several months ahead. We sorted through how much of the impact to Q1 was end market demand reduction versus channel destocking, and it appears to be about 2/3 end market versus destocking that's contributing to our year-to-date results. Sales for our Industrial segment in total were down 3.5%, and orders were down about 13%. The most acute impact was from global semiconductor fabricators and Machinery & Equipment OEMs and end users. Our Industrial customers, in many cases, have adopted a much more cautious tone, though, for the foreseeable future.
The third takeaway, though, is the impact of our cost-savings initiatives. Our operating profit increased 80 bps on a year-over-year basis, and the Industrial business's segment margin increased 360 bps. Our structural cost-savings initiatives were not only necessary, a point that we have consistently made, but were also well timed. The team is acting globally to properly position our cost structure to perform in the current environment, but we will not disable our growth or innovation potential.
Fourth and finally, we're in an environment where growth is critical, and we're making the necessary investments to do so. As I've previously discussed, we're increasing the focus of our R&D organizations so we can get the best bang for our buck but also increasing our actual spend. R&D investment in Q1 increased by $3 million, and it is expected to grow by $12 million to $15 million this fiscal year.
Moving on to look at Q1 results now from a geographic perspective first with some market-specific color. The Americas was not as strong as we expected, with sales up 2%, excluding FX, and down slightly organically, with strong biopharm-driven performance and Life Sciences, while Industrial was down. This result was significantly impacted by weakness in water, while orders from the industrial OEMs, who sell globally, were down. The Americas result is a function of export order volume decline in addition to the in-region end market demands.
Europe was a little stronger than expected, up a little over 3% [indiscernible]. As expected, biopharm was a strong contributor, but the Industrial process systems business also shipped well in the quarter. However, orders were impacted by capital spend decisions.
Finally, Asia was down nearly 7%. Performance was challenged in our larger-country markets other than Korea and India. China was down double digits, again delays in capital projects and weakness specifically on our Power Generation products and primary metals applications. Japan continued to experience the effects of the lower semiconductor industry production rates and other Microelectronics sluggish demand.
So with that, let's look at the specifics for the quarter. On Slide 6, first by segment. Life Sciences sales grew by about 4% in the quarter, excluding FX, and Industrial declined by about the same. Consumables, the replaceable filters which comprised 88% of total sales, grew 4% in Life Sciences and decreased 3% in Industrial. Systems, which comprise 12% of the total sales in the quarter, declined 2% overall as growth in life science was offset by a decline in Industrial.
And now turning to Slide 7, the drivers of the life science sales and orders. First, if we look at consumables sales. The growth in Biopharmaceutical consumables of 7% in the quarter reflects continued strength in the biotech, biosimilar and other biological drug sectors. Consumable sales in Food & Beverage, excluding the impact of the divestiture of our Verona business in Europe, were up slightly. Strong growth in the Americas, due in part to Latin America, largely offset weakness in Europe, and that was related to sluggishness in the beer and wine production volume there. Medical consumable sales were flat in the quarter on tough comparables in the OEM sector year-over-year.
Systems sales increased 2% in the quarter, as growth in biopharm was partially offset by a decline in Food & Beverage, reflective of weak capital spend and, again, against the large comp in the prior year quarter in the Americas. Life science total segment orders increased 5% in the quarter, with Consumables growth of 7%, again driven by biopharm. Systems orders were down, reflecting slowing and capital spend in food and bev.
And then moving on to Slide 8, looking at Industrial. Consumable sales in Process Technologies were down about 4% in the quarter mainly due to reduced sales in the Machinery & Equipment market, reflecting weakness in the mobile OEM, the primary metals and construction sectors, as well as our decision to exit certain lower-margin products. This was partly offset by increased consumable sales in the energy markets. Aerospace consumables sales were up 3%. Commercial Aerospace increased 5%, driven by increased aftermarket sales, and military consumables were flat. And Microelectronics consumables sales declined 7%, again reflecting the low utilization rates that I spoke to.
So moving on to Industrial systems sales performance. Systems sales declined 4% primarily on weakness in the Municipal Water market as customers are delaying projects and are looking to reduce spending. Additionally, the compare to quarter of '12 included a large wastewater project that did not repeat this year.
Looking at Industrial orders for the quarter. Consumables were down about 11%. Systems declined 26%, consistent with the capital commitment trends I mentioned earlier. The impact to Industrial organic orders performance was pretty broad based, with the exception of Commercial Aerospace.
And Slide 9 refers to specific regional performance, but I think I've covered that so I'm going to move on. Let's go to Slide 10.
With regard to  overall performance in the quarter, sales were $628 million compared to $651 million last year. Foreign currency translation decreased the top line by about $23 million or about 3.5%. Excluding FX, sales were flat. Overall gross margins improved 60 basis points to 52.1%. This reflects the notable improvement in Industrial, but it's partly offset by the FX-driven decline in Life Sciences.
SG&A, excluding FX, decreased 200 basis points. This reflects the savings generated by our structural cost improvement initiatives that we've spoken to, net of the those investments we're making to structure the company for future profitable growth. Excluding the discrete items, the underlying tax rate in the quarter was 23.3% compared to 23.9% last year.
Pro forma earnings per share in the quarter were $0.68, an increase of $0.02 compared to last year. And bridging this, the growth in the operating profit contributed about $0.08, $0.04, net of the transactional FX headwind, and the tax rate and share count reduction, combined, contributed about $0.01. Translational FX decremented EPS by about $0.03, so for combined FX headwind or impact of $0.07. From an operations management perspective, we achieved reasonable leverage. If you think about it, on flat sales, we grew EPS about 13.5%. That's obviously excluding the total FX impact.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Lisa to discuss the specifics of segment performance and more detail around profitability drivers, as well as cash flow performance in the quarter. And then we'll finish up with the current business outlook for the full year."

I'll start with the review of segment performance in the context of Larry's overall comments, and I'll begin on Slide 11 with Life Sciences.Life Sciences gross margin declined 40 basis points to 58.7%,",677,"Okay, thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the review of segment performance in the context of Larry's overall comments, and I'll begin on Slide 11 with Life Sciences.
Life Sciences gross margin declined 40 basis points to 58.7%, and this principally reflects about 150 bps of FX headwinds related to the deterioration of the euro. And it was partly mitigated by favorable mix from the solid Pharmaceuticals consumable sales growth in the quarter.
R&D expenditures in Life Sciences increased $4 million or 35%, and this excludes FX, and it's about 130 bps as a percent of sales. And this reflects the increased focus on development of our instrumentation capabilities, including spends related to our ForteBio product lines.
SG&A increased about 9%, excluding FX, and this also principally reflects the ForteBio-associated costs. Putting these factors together, Life Sciences segment profit declined 8%, excluding FX, with the investment impact of ForteBio slightly dilutive.
Turning now to Industrial. Gross margin improved by 110 basis points to 46.1%, and this reflects Pall Industrial's continued rationalization of its product lines. And this performance was also attributable to a larger proportion of higher-margin systems and service revenue than usual. We do not expect this to be sustained for the rest of the year. The structural cost improvement efforts begun last year and continuing into this year in Industrial benefited SG&A, which declined about 11%, x FX. So we are pleased with this result. The 240-basis-point decline in SG&A as a percentage of sales, together with gross margin improvement, yielded a 360-bp improvement in segment margin in the quarter. Segment profit dollars increased 23%, excluding FX, despite the decline in revenue of almost 4%.
Now one item of note with respect to our overall corporate-wide SG&A is that, in our second quarter, we expect a typical sequential increase due to certain annual events such as merit increases, equity grants, et cetera. So that's important to consider generally in connection with our second quarter operating margins.
Turning now to Slide 12. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $39 million, which was a decrease of $39 million year-over-year. This reflects the impact to cash flow of the blood sale as well as the settlement of several years of U.S. tax audits and payments for the structural cost-reduction initiatives in the quarter, and that we're -- we talked about in our fourth quarter last year. On a year-over-year basis, our inventory is essentially flat but with the $25 million reallocation from finished goods to raw materials and WIP, which is part of our media supermarket strategy. This will allow us to better allocate resources and more efficiently manage our production while avoiding unnecessary inventory builds.
Significant uses of cash included just under $100 million return to shareholders, with dividends of $24 million and stock repurchases of $75 million, repayment of short-term debt of $75 million and $23 million in CapEx.
Wrapping up the discussion of our liquidity. Our cash position stood at approximately $910 million at quarter end. And our cash position, net of debt, was $291 million, and this compares to a net debt position of $196 million at year end.
Before Larry wraps up with our current outlook for 2013, I'll briefly recap FX on Slide 14 (sic) [13]. Looking at the major currency pairs impacting our business, compared to a year ago, the euro weakened against the dollar -- the U.S. dollar and the pound by 10% in the first quarter. Recapping the impact, as Larry covered a moment ago, the dislocation of the euro was a headwind of approximately $0.07 in the first quarter, and we continue to have significant euro exposure. And as we've spoken about before, we have taken actions to mitigate it, including hedging forecasted transaction to cushion the risk of possible further weakening. Now our need to enter into hedge agreements will lessen as we make changes to our transactional flows to maximize natural hedges through better currency matching of revenue and expense.
That concludes my report, and I'll turn this back to Larry."
185333,224049722,392827,"Pall Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Nov 29, 2012",2012-11-29,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lisa.As you know, we're in a very dynamic environment, but we're responding well to it.

As you know, we're in a very dynamic environment, but we're responding well to it. There are a number of moving targets: FX volatility and governmental budgetary pressure, customers changing risk tolerance and a number of others. They all have the potential to continue to affect activity globally. That being said, we're listening closely to the customers, and we parse what we've heard from them into the trends, which form the basis of our updated forecast.
So first, the specific Life Sciences input. Biopharm continues at a healthy pace, even in Europe, driven by Western world product development supporting the so-called pharmerging global activity. The sustained growth of the biopharm end markets, in particular the biologicals, monoclonal-based treatments for autoimmune diseases, will continue to drive very strong performance in the face of choppy economics. Our outlook accordingly is that -- from first to second half of our fiscal year, that we've got a 10% growth assumption, so sequential growth of 10%. That calculates on a full year basis to an assumption of mid- to high-single-digit organic growth for Life Sciences.
In the Industrial end markets. As we've said, current sales and order rate performance for our Industrial segment is driven by both end market softening and destocking. And these trends are particularly germane to our Microelectronics and the Machinery & Equipment markets. In Microelectronics, the majority of the current sales trend is end market capacity-driven. MicroE demand is pretty broadly down. Recent consumer demand, if sustained, suggests that some of the inventory will be consumed, though. And therefore, fab utilization might increase before the end of our fiscal year. And for Machinery & Equipment, we attribute the current challenge to both too much OEM inventory as well as lower utilization rates. And more specifically, for Machinery & Equipment in the Americas, the outlook assumes that in-region demand and exports impact OEMs but also that end user spend generally remains pressured.
Europe is largely affected by low utilization rates. And Asia has more of a destocking, channel-driven set of issues, which could rebound but it may not be until the end of the year. And Municipal Water just doesn't look good. Continued weakness is expected in muni water through the end of the fiscal year.
So our outlook for Industrial, accordingly, is that we expect Industrial sales growth to be down low to mid single digits, and this factors in a sequential improvements through the balance of the year.
Our updated guidance is entirely driven by the range of sales performance we now anticipate. We think Q2 sales levels will be similar to Q1. However, we know that we will not have the benefit of favorable mix in the Industrial business. In addition, due to the holidays -- in the schedule this year, there are less work days versus last, and some of our customers may selectively shut down to a greater degree this year. We'll see. Relative to margin for the upcoming quarter, as Lisa mentioned, we also expect the typical sequential SG&A increase from Q1 to 2 that will modestly impact margins. However, our structural actions are on target, and we're beginning to see the benefits of productivity enhancements.
For the full year, the underlying tax rate will be 24%, in line with the previous guidance. And there is no significant change to our repurchase assumption. Our FX exposure, again, represents about an 8% drag on earnings for the full year. So in total, all factored in, we're guiding pro forma EPS to $2.95 to $3.15.
So with that, operator, we're ready to go into the Q&A session."

So it's inventory that OEMs may have built into product that hasn't sold and/or product that they have on the shelf awaiting a build cycle. And that's a significant portion of the content that represents about the 1/3 of the impact to the sales numbers that we described for Industrial as down: 1/3 destock versus the 2/3 the Industrial end demand. I think that it's leaned out pretty well, to answer your question. I don't think there's too much more that will come. It's a little bit of a different picture in Asia versus the rest of the world where there is more inventory in the OEM food chain in Asia, so there could be slightly kind of more to come there, but I think that what we've seen is kind of representation of the destocking component. And as far as the end market demand, you didn't specifically ask, but we don't expect it to get a lot worse. And if you go back to my comments relative to guidance, we think the back half does improve sequentially. Some of that is not unusual. That's a fairly typical Pall and a seasonal trend, and so it's not unusual for us to assume sequential improvement of that magnitude.

We expect a more normalized Industrial mix as we go into the remainder of the year. Now as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the good news is that we're getting after the cost, both direct costs but more importantly the cost to serve, in Industrial such that we'll continue to see Industrial both gross margins and OP margins improve over the intermediate period as well as the long term, but it's not going to be a kind of completely clean bridge of 16% as we go forward."

So it's not a traditional market share kind of win-loss dynamic as much as it is where we're stronger in a given fab, even a -- just a site itself. We may either benefit or lose as a function of our relative position. But we've got great products. We've got, obviously, a great reputation in the space and doing quite well."

And I've talked before about the fact that, once we're all said and done, it cost us probably less but it's as much as a point in terms of sales growth or sales contribution to the total company. The issue here is that we've historically participated in some systems that don't have some follow-on consumables opportunity.

Singapore has dedicated a fairly large chunk of their industrial growth plan to working with European and American global players. And in a couple of cases, we hadn't had a position with a global player where they were producing product in, say, Europe, but because our strength is what it is in Singapore, that's been the catalyst to allow us to build now our relationship back to have that global position that we hadn't historically had with that customer.

Good morning. Thank you for joining us as well. I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; and Brent Jones, VP of Finance.
Our remarks this morning will be on a continuing operations basis, which exclude the results of the blood product line, which we divested on August 1.
As most of you know, we made public statements a few weeks ago to provide our initial read of our Q1 results and to update our perspective for the full fiscal year. We noted that the end market environment had changed since we provided full year guidance in early September, specifically after a typically slow but hard-to-trend August. Late September was slower than anticipated, and October, while showing signs of improvement, was also choppy. All of this was against the backdrop of public commentary and actual financial results by our customers, our peers, as well as other large industrial players. And even though some of the messaging was mixed, the underlying theme was clear: The macroenvironment is sloppy. There is continued pressure on capital investment, and the emerging country economies in particular are slower than most anticipated and were forecasting to us, in the case of our customers. Given the diversity of our exposure, it's often difficult to distill such an environment into summary-level themes. It tends to be more about the specific projects and about utilization rates, which drive consumption of our product.
A couple of current takeaways, though. First, despite the macro headwinds, the Life Sciences segment continues to perform, with Q1 growth of about 4%. Orders were up 5%, and the Life Sciences segment did experience strong momentum in the September-October time frame. The main driver was, unsurprisingly, biopharm, where we are winning new customers and new types of applications, all in a very attractive space. We continue to see strong momentum for the back half of the year.
Second, the global industrial end markets have taken a bit of a pause for a few months and look to be selectively soft for several months ahead. We sorted through how much of the impact to Q1 was end market demand reduction versus channel destocking, and it appears to be about 2/3 end market versus destocking that's contributing to our year-to-date results. Sales for our Industrial segment in total were down 3.5%, and orders were down about 13%. The most acute impact was from global semiconductor fabricators and Machinery & Equipment OEMs and end users. Our Industrial customers, in many cases, have adopted a much more cautious tone, though, for the foreseeable future.
The third takeaway, though, is the impact of our cost-savings initiatives. Our operating profit increased 80 bps on a year-over-year basis, and the Industrial business' segment margin increased 360 bps. Our structural cost-savings initiatives were not only necessary, a point that we have consistently made, but were also well timed. The team is acting globally to properly position our cost structure to perform in the current environment, but we will not disable our growth or innovation potential.
Fourth and finally, we're in an environment where growth is critical, and we're making the necessary investments to do so. As I've previously discussed, we're increasing the focus of our R&D organization so we can get the best bang for our buck but also increasing our actual spend. R&D investment in Q1 increased by $3 million, and it is expected to grow by $12 million to $15 million this fiscal year.
Moving on to look at Q1 results now from a geographic perspective first with some market-specific color. The Americas was not as strong as we expected, with sales up 2%, excluding FX, and down slightly organically, with strong biopharm-driven performance in Life Sciences, while Industrial was down. This result was significantly impacted by weakness in water, while orders from the industrial OEMs, who sell globally, were down. The Americas result is a function of export order volume decline in addition to the in-region end market demand.
Europe was a little stronger than expected, up a little over 3%, ex FX. As expected, biopharm was a strong contributor, but the Industrial process systems business also shipped well in the quarter. However, orders were impacted by capital spend decisions.
Finally, Asia was down nearly 7%. Performance was challenged in our larger-country markets other than Korea and India. China was down double digits, again delays in capital projects and weakness specifically on our Power Generation products and primary metals applications. Japan continued to experience the effects of the lower semiconductor industry production rates and other Microelectronics sluggish demand.
So with that, let's look at the specifics for the quarter. On Slide 6, first by segment. Life Sciences sales grew by about 4% in the quarter, excluding FX, and Industrial declined by about the same. Consumables, the replaceable filters which comprised 88% of total sales, grew 4% in Life Sciences and decreased 3% in Industrial. Systems, which comprise 12% of the total sales in the quarter, declined 2% overall, as growth in Life Science was offset by a decline in Industrial.
And now turning to Slide 7, the drivers of the Life Science sales and orders. First, if we look at consumables sales. The growth in BioPharmaceutical consumables of 7% in the quarter reflects continued strength in the biotech, biosimilar and other biological drug sectors. Consumable sales in Food & Beverage, excluding the impact of the divestiture of our Verona business in Europe, were up slightly. Strong growth in the Americas, due in part to Latin America, largely offset weakness in Europe, and that was related to sluggishness in the beer and wine production volume there. Medical consumable sales were flat in the quarter on tough comparables in the OEM sector year-over-year.
Systems sales increased 2% in the quarter, as growth in biopharm was partially offset by a decline in Food & Beverage, reflective of weak capital spend and, again, against the large comp in the prior year quarter in the Americas. Life Science total segment orders increased 5% in the quarter, with Consumables growth of 7%, again driven by biopharm. Systems orders were down, reflecting slowing in capital spend in food and bev.
And then moving on to Slide 8, looking at Industrial. Consumable sales in Process Technologies were down about 4% in the quarter, mainly due to reduced sales in the Machinery & Equipment market, reflecting weakness in the mobile OEM, the primary metals and construction sectors, as well as our decision to exit certain lower-margin products. This was partly offset by increased consumable sales in the energy markets. Aerospace consumables sales were up 3%. Commercial Aerospace increased 5%, driven by increased aftermarket sales, and military consumables were flat. And Microelectronics consumables sales declined 7%, again reflecting the low utilization rates that I spoke to.
So moving on to Industrial systems sales performance. Systems sales declined 4% primarily on weakness in the Municipal Water market as customers are delaying projects and are looking to reduce spending. Additionally, the comparative quarter of '12 included a large wastewater project that did not repeat this year.
Looking at Industrial orders for the quarter. Consumables were down about 11%. Systems declined 26%, consistent with the capital commitment trends I mentioned earlier. The impact to Industrial organic orders performance was pretty broad based, with the exception of Commercial Aerospace.
And Slide 9 refers to specific regional performance, but I think I've covered that, so I'm going to move on. Let's go to Slide 10.
With regard to overall performance in the quarter, sales were $628 million compared to $651 million last year. Foreign currency translation decreased the top line by about $23 million or about 3.5%. Excluding FX, sales were flat. Overall gross margins improved 60 basis points to 52.1%. This reflects the notable improvement in Industrial, but it's partly offset by the FX-driven decline in Life Sciences.
SG&A, excluding FX, decreased 200 basis points. This reflects the savings generated by our structural cost improvement initiatives that we've spoken to, net of those investments we're making to structure the company for future profitable growth. Excluding the discrete items, the underlying tax rate in the quarter was 23.3% compared to 23.9% last year.
Pro forma earnings per share in the quarter were $0.68, an increase of $0.02 compared to last year. And bridging this, the growth in the operating profit contributed about $0.08, $0.04, net of the transactional FX headwind, and the tax rate and share count reduction, combined, contributed about $0.01. Translational FX decremented EPS by about $0.03, so for combined FX headwind or impact of $0.07. From an operations management perspective, we achieved reasonable leverage. If you think about it, on flat sales, we grew EPS about 13.5%. That's obviously excluding the total FX impact.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Lisa to discuss the specifics of segment performance and more detail around profitability drivers, as well as cash flow performance in the quarter. And then we'll finish up with a current business outlook for the full year."

I'll start with the review of segment performance in the context of Larry's overall comments, and I'll begin on Slide 11 with Life Sciences.Life Sciences gross margin declined 40 basis points to 58.7%,",678,"Okay, thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the review of segment performance in the context of Larry's overall comments, and I'll begin on Slide 11 with Life Sciences.
Life Sciences gross margin declined 40 basis points to 58.7%, and this principally reflects about 150 bps of FX headwinds related to the deterioration of the euro. And it was partly mitigated by favorable mix from the solid Pharmaceuticals consumable sales growth in the quarter.
R&D expenditures in Life Sciences increased $4 million or 35%, and this excludes FX, and it's about 130 bps as a percent of sales. And this reflects the increased focus on development of our instrumentation capabilities, including spends related to our ForteBio product lines.
SG&A increased about 9%, excluding FX, and this also principally reflects the ForteBio-associated costs. Putting these factors together, Life Sciences segment profit declined 8%, excluding FX, with the investment impact of ForteBio slightly dilutive.
Turning now to Industrial. Gross margin improved by 110 basis points to 46.1%, and this reflects Pall Industrial's continued rationalization of its product lines. And this performance was also attributable to a larger proportion of higher-margin systems and service revenue than usual. We do not expect this to be sustained for the rest of the year. The structural cost improvement efforts begun last year and continuing into this year in Industrial benefited SG&A, which declined about 11%, ex FX. So we are pleased with this result. The 240-basis-point decline in SG&A as a percentage of sales, together with gross margin improvement, yielded a 360-bp improvement in segment margin in the quarter. Segment profit dollars increased 23%, excluding FX, despite the decline in revenue of almost 4%.
Now one item of note with respect to our overall corporate-wide SG&A is that, in our second quarter, we expect a typical sequential increase due to certain annual events such as merit increases, equity grants, et cetera. So that's important to consider generally in connection with our second quarter operating margins.
Turning now to Slide 12. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $39 million, which was a decrease of $39 million year-over-year. This reflects the impact to cash flow of the blood sale as well as the settlement of several years of U.S. tax audits and payments for the structural cost-reduction initiatives in the quarter, and that we're -- we talked about in our fourth quarter last year. On a year-over-year basis, our inventory is essentially flat but with a $25 million reallocation from finished goods to raw materials and WIP, which is part of our media supermarket strategy. This will allow us to better allocate resources and more efficiently manage our production while avoiding unnecessary inventory build.
Significant uses of cash included just under $100 million returned to shareholders with dividends of $24 million and stock repurchases of $75 million, repayment of short-term debt of $75 million and $23 million in CapEx.
Wrapping up the discussion of our liquidity. Our cash position stood at approximately $910 million at quarter end. And our cash position, net of debt, was $291 million, and this compares to a net debt position of $196 million at year end.
Before Larry wraps up with our current outlook for 2013, I'll briefly recap FX on Slide 14 (sic) [Slide 13]. Looking at the major currency pairs impacting our business, compared to a year ago, the euro weakened against the dollar -- the U.S. dollar and the pound by 10% in the first quarter. Recapping the impact, as Larry covered a moment ago, the dislocation of the euro was a headwind of approximately $0.07 in the first quarter, and we continue to have significant euro exposure. And as we've spoken about before, we have taken actions to mitigate it, including hedging forecasted transaction to cushion the risk of possible further weakening. Now our need to enter into hedge agreements will lessen as we make changes to our transactional flows to maximize natural hedges through better currency matching of revenue and expense.
That concludes my report, and I'll turn this back to Larry."
185333,224049722,392920,"Pall Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Nov 29, 2012",2012-11-29,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lisa.As you know, we're in a very dynamic environment, but we're responding well to it.

As you know, we're in a very dynamic environment, but we're responding well to it. There are a number of moving targets: FX volatility and governmental budgetary pressure, customers changing risk tolerance and a number of others. They all have the potential to continue to affect activity globally. That being said, we're listening closely to the customers, and we’ve parsed what we've heard from them into the trends, which form the basis of our updated forecast.
So first, the specific Life Sciences input. Biopharm continues at a healthy pace, even in Europe, driven by Western world product development supporting the so-called pharmerging global activity. The sustained growth of the biopharm end markets, in particular the biologicals, monoclonal-based treatments for autoimmune diseases, will continue to drive very strong performance in the face of choppy economics. Our outlook, accordingly, is that -- from first to second half of our fiscal year, that we've got a 10% growth assumption, so sequential growth of 10%. That calculates on a full year basis to an assumption of mid- to high-single-digit organic growth for Life Sciences.
In the Industrial end markets. As we've said, current sales and order rate performance for our Industrial segment is driven by both end market softening and destocking. And these trends are particularly germane to our Microelectronics and the Machinery & Equipment markets. In Microelectronics, the majority of the current sales trend is end market capacity-driven. MicroE demand is pretty broadly down. Recent consumer demand, if sustained, suggests that some of the inventory will be consumed, though. And therefore, fab utilization might increase before the end of our fiscal year. And for Machinery & Equipment, we attribute the current challenge to both too much OEM inventory as well as lower utilization rates. And more specifically, for Machinery & Equipment in the Americas, the outlook assumes that in-region demand and exports impact OEMs but also that end user spend generally remains pressured.
Europe is largely affected by low utilization rates. And Asia is more of a destocking, channel-driven set of issues, which could rebound, but it may not be until the end of the year. And Municipal Water just doesn't look good. Continued weakness is expected in muni water through the end of the fiscal year.
So our outlook for Industrial, accordingly, is that we expect Industrial sales growth to be down low to mid-single digits, and this factors in a sequential improvement through the balance of the year.
Our updated guidance is entirely driven by the range of sales performance we now anticipate. We think Q2 sales levels will be similar to Q1. However, we know that we will not have the benefit of favorable mix in the Industrial business. In addition, due to the holidays -- in the schedule this year, there are less work days versus last, and some of our customers may selectively shut down to a greater degree this year. We'll see. Relative to margin for the upcoming quarter, as Lisa mentioned, we also expect the typical sequential SG&A increase from Q1 to 2 that will modestly impact margins. However, our structural actions are on target, and we're beginning to see the benefits of productivity enhancements.
For the full year, the underlying tax rate will be 24%, in line with the previous guidance. And there is no significant change to our repurchase assumption. Our FX exposure, again, represents about an 8% drag on earnings for the full year. So in total, all factored in, we're guiding pro forma EPS to $2.95 to $3.15.
So with that, operator, we're ready to go into the Q&A session."

So it's inventory that OEMs may have built into product that hasn't sold and/or product that they have on the shelf awaiting a build cycle. And that's a significant portion of the content that represents about the 1/3 of the impact to the sales numbers that we described for Industrial as down: 1/3 destock versus the 2/3 the Industrial end demand. I think that it's leaned out pretty well, to answer your question. I don't think there's too much more that will come. It's a little bit of a different picture in Asia versus the rest of the world where there is more inventory in the OEM food chain in Asia, so there could be slightly kind of more to come there, but I think that what we've seen is kind of representation of the destocking component. And as far as the end market demand, you didn't specifically ask, but we don't expect it to get a lot worse. And if you go back to my comments relative to guidance, we think the back half does improve sequentially. Some of that is not unusual. That's a fairly typical Pall and a seasonal trend, and so it's not unusual for us to assume sequential improvement of that magnitude.

And then with respect to your -- the upcoming quarter question around Industrial gross margin or, for that matter, bridging off the first quarter for the rest of the year, what Industrial saw in the first quarter were just a couple of things. First, the systems margin for Industrial was particularly positive or strong in the quarter, driven by a stronger service component within systems. And we didn't have as much, call it, bad-margin systems business either. Some of the fall-off, Industrial water -- or excuse me, Municipal Water, in particular, isn't such a bad thing. We expect a more normalized Industrial mix as we go into the remainder of the year. Now as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the good news is that we're getting after the cost, both direct costs but, more importantly, the cost to serve, in Industrial such that we'll continue to see Industrial both gross margins and OP margins improve over the intermediate period as well as the long term, but it's not going to be a kind of completely clean bridge off 16% as we go forward."

There's others where we're not making as much as we would like for a system that does generate a downstream consumable opportunity. And in those cases, we're trying to work through our cost structure, design issues and other things that contribute to make that a more attractive value proposition for the customer and business opportunity for us.

It's about $25 million that moves from finished goods to the WIP and raw in the quarter such that we can respond just as fast going forward without having to have the degree of dedicated finished goods inventory that we have historically. So historically, we have, as you know, held a fair amount of finished goods inventory. That's, in many cases, customer specific. We're moving to rolled stock media such that we can convert very quickly and be much more flexible and allow ourselves a finished goods inventory reduction over time.

Good morning. Thank you for joining us as well. I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; and Brent Jones, VP of Finance.
Our remarks this morning will be on a continuing operations basis, which exclude the results of the blood product line, which we divested on August 1.
As most of you know, we made public statements a few weeks ago to provide our initial read of our Q1 results and to update our perspective for the full fiscal year. We noted that the end market environment had changed since we provided full year guidance in early September, specifically after a typically slow but hard-to-trend August. Late September was slower than anticipated, and October, while showing signs of improvement, was also choppy. All of this was against the backdrop of public commentary and actual financial results by our customers, our peers, as well as other large industrial players. And even though some of the messaging was mixed, the underlying theme was clear: The macroenvironment is sloppy. There is continued pressure on capital investment, and the emerging country economies in particular are slower than most anticipated and were forecasting to us, in the case of our customers. Given the diversity of our exposure, it's often difficult to distill such an environment into summary-level themes. It tends to be more about the specific projects and about utilization rates, which drive consumption of our product.
A couple of current takeaways, though. First, despite the macro headwinds, the Life Sciences segment continues to perform, with Q1 growth of about 4%. Orders were up 5%, and the Life Sciences segment did experience strong momentum in the September-October time frame. The main driver was, unsurprisingly, biopharm, where we are winning new customers and new types of applications, all in a very attractive space. We continue to see strong momentum for the back half of the year.
Second, the global industrial end markets have taken a bit of a pause for a few months and look to be selectively soft for several months ahead. We sorted through how much of the impact to Q1 was end market demand reduction versus channel destocking, and it appears to be about 2/3 end market versus destocking that's contributing to our year-to-date results. Sales for our Industrial segment in total were down 3.5%, and orders were down about 13%. The most acute impact was from global semiconductor fabricators and Machinery & Equipment OEMs and end users. Our Industrial customers, in many cases, have adopted a much more cautious tone, though, for the foreseeable future.
The third takeaway, though, is the impact of our cost-savings initiatives. Our operating profit increased 80 bps on a year-over-year basis, and the Industrial business' segment margin increased 360 bps. Our structural cost-savings initiatives were not only necessary, a point that we have consistently made, but were also well timed. The team is acting globally to properly position our cost structure to perform in the current environment, but we will not disable our growth or innovation potential.
Fourth and finally, we're in an environment where growth is critical, and we're making the necessary investments to do so. As I've previously discussed, we're increasing the focus of our R&D organization so we can get the best bang for our buck but also increasing our actual spend. R&D investment in Q1 increased by $3 million, and it is expected to grow by $12 million to $15 million this fiscal year.
Moving on to look at Q1 results now from a geographic perspective first with some market-specific color. The Americas was not as strong as we expected, with sales up 2%, excluding FX, and down slightly organically, with strong biopharm-driven performance in Life Sciences, while Industrial was down. This result was significantly impacted by weakness in water, while orders from the industrial OEMs, who sell globally, were down. The Americas result is a function of export order volume decline in addition to the in-region end market demand.
Europe was a little stronger than expected, up a little over 3%, x FX. As expected, biopharm was a strong contributor, but the Industrial process systems business also shipped well in the quarter. However, orders were impacted by capital spend decisions.
Finally, Asia was down nearly 7%. Performance was challenged in our larger-country markets other than Korea and India. China was down double digits, again delays in capital projects and weakness specifically on our Power Generation products and primary metals applications. Japan continued to experience the effects of the lower semiconductor industry production rates and other Microelectronics sluggish demand.
So with that, let's look at the specifics for the quarter. On Slide 6, first by segment. Life Sciences sales grew by about 4% in the quarter, excluding FX, and Industrial declined by about the same. Consumables, the replaceable filters which comprised 88% of total sales, grew 4% in Life Sciences and decreased 3% in Industrial. Systems, which comprise 12% of the total sales in the quarter, declined 2% overall, as growth in Life Science was offset by a decline in Industrial.
And now turning to Slide 7, the drivers of the Life Science sales and orders. First, if we look at consumables sales. The growth in BioPharmaceutical consumables of 7% in the quarter reflects continued strength in the biotech, biosimilar and other biological drug sectors. Consumable sales in Food & Beverage, excluding the impact of the divestiture of our Verona business in Europe, were up slightly. Strong growth in the Americas, due in part to Latin America, largely offset weakness in Europe, and that was related to sluggishness in the beer and wine production volume there. Medical consumable sales were flat in the quarter on tough comparables in the OEM sector year-over-year.
Systems sales increased 2% in the quarter, as growth in biopharm was partially offset by a decline in Food & Beverage, reflective of weak capital spend and, again, against the large comp in the prior year quarter in the Americas. Life Science total segment orders increased 5% in the quarter, with Consumables growth of 7%, again driven by biopharm. Systems orders were down, reflecting slowing in capital spend in food and bev.
And then moving on to Slide 8, looking at Industrial. Consumable sales in Process Technologies were down about 4% in the quarter, mainly due to reduced sales in the Machinery & Equipment market, reflecting weakness in the mobile OEM, the primary metals and construction sectors, as well as our decision to exit certain lower-margin products. This was partly offset by increased consumable sales in the energy markets. Aerospace consumables sales were up 3%. Commercial Aerospace increased 5%, driven by increased aftermarket sales, and military consumables were flat. And Microelectronics consumables sales declined 7%, again reflecting the low utilization rates that I spoke to.
So moving on to Industrial systems sales performance. Systems sales declined 4% primarily on weakness in the Municipal Water market as customers are delaying projects and are looking to reduce spending. Additionally, the comparative quarter of '12 included a large wastewater project that did not repeat this year.
Looking at Industrial orders for the quarter. Consumables were down about 11%. Systems declined 26%, consistent with the capital commitment trends I mentioned earlier. The impact to Industrial organic orders performance was pretty broad based, with the exception of Commercial Aerospace.
And Slide 9 refers to specific regional performance, but I think I've covered that, so I'm going to move on. Let's go to Slide 10.
With regard to overall performance in the quarter, sales were $628 million compared to $651 million last year. Foreign currency translation decreased the top line by about $23 million or about 3.5%. Excluding FX, sales were flat. Overall gross margins improved 60 basis points to 52.1%. This reflects the notable improvement in Industrial, but it's partly offset by the FX-driven decline in Life Sciences.
SG&A, excluding FX, decreased 200 basis points. This reflects the savings generated by our structural cost improvement initiatives that we've spoken to, net of those investments we're making to structure the company for future profitable growth. Excluding the discrete items, the underlying tax rate in the quarter was 23.3% compared to 23.9% last year.
Pro forma earnings per share in the quarter were $0.68, an increase of $0.02 compared to last year. And bridging this, the growth in the operating profit contributed about $0.08, $0.04, net of the transactional FX headwind, and the tax rate and share count reduction, combined, contributed about $0.01. Translational FX decremented EPS by about $0.03, so for combined FX headwind or impact of $0.07. From an operations management perspective, we achieved reasonable leverage. If you think about it, on flat sales, we grew EPS about 13.5%. That's obviously excluding the total FX impact.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Lisa to discuss the specifics of segment performance and more detail around profitability drivers, as well as cash flow performance in the quarter. And then we'll finish up with a current business outlook for the full year."

I'll start with the review of segment performance in the context of Larry's overall comments, and I'll begin on Slide 11 with Life Sciences.Life Sciences gross margin declined 40 basis points to 58.7%,",678,"Okay, thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the review of segment performance in the context of Larry's overall comments, and I'll begin on Slide 11 with Life Sciences.
Life Sciences gross margin declined 40 basis points to 58.7%, and this principally reflects about 150 bps of FX headwinds related to the deterioration of the euro. And it was partly mitigated by favorable mix from the solid Pharmaceuticals consumable sales growth in the quarter.
R&D expenditures in Life Sciences increased $4 million or 35%, and this excludes FX, and it's about 130 bps as a percent of sales. And this reflects the increased focus on development of our instrumentation capabilities, including spends related to our ForteBio product lines.
SG&A increased about 9%, excluding FX, and this also principally reflects the ForteBio-associated costs. Putting these factors together, Life Sciences segment profit declined 8%, excluding FX, with the investment impact of ForteBio slightly dilutive.
Turning now to Industrial. Gross margin improved by 110 basis points to 46.1%, and this reflects Pall Industrial's continued rationalization of its product lines. And this performance was also attributable to a larger proportion of higher-margin systems and service revenue than usual. We do not expect this to be sustained for the rest of the year. The structural cost improvement efforts begun last year and continuing into this year in Industrial benefited SG&A, which declined about 11%, x FX. So we are pleased with this result. The 240-basis-point decline in SG&A as a percentage of sales, together with gross margin improvement, yielded a 360-bp improvement in segment margin in the quarter. Segment profit dollars increased 23%, excluding FX, despite the decline in revenue of almost 4%.
Now one item of note with respect to our overall corporate-wide SG&A is that, in our second quarter, we expect a typical sequential increase due to certain annual events such as merit increases, equity grants, et cetera. So that's important to consider generally in connection with our second quarter operating margins.
Turning now to Slide 12. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $39 million, which was a decrease of $39 million year-over-year. This reflects the impact to cash flow of the blood sale as well as the settlement of several years of U.S. tax audits and payments for the structural cost-reduction initiatives in the quarter, and that we're -- we talked about in our fourth quarter last year. On a year-over-year basis, our inventory is essentially flat but with a $25 million reallocation from finished goods to raw materials and WIP, which is part of our media supermarket strategy. This will allow us to better allocate resources and more efficiently manage our production while avoiding unnecessary inventory build.
Significant uses of cash included just under $100 million returned to shareholders with dividends of $24 million and stock repurchases of $75 million, repayment of short-term debt of $75 million and $23 million in CapEx.
Wrapping up the discussion of our liquidity. Our cash position stood at approximately $910 million at quarter end. And our cash position, net of debt, was $291 million, and this compares to a net debt position of $196 million at year end.
Before Larry wraps up with our current outlook for 2013, I'll briefly recap FX on Slide 14 (sic) [Slide 13]. Looking at the major currency pairs impacting our business, compared to a year ago, the euro weakened against the dollar -- the U.S. dollar and the pound by 10% in the first quarter. Recapping the impact, as Larry covered a moment ago, the dislocation of the euro was a headwind of approximately $0.07 in the first quarter, and we continue to have significant euro exposure. And as we've spoken about before, we have taken actions to mitigate it, including hedging forecasted transaction to cushion the risk of possible further weakening. Now our need to enter into hedge agreements will lessen as we make changes to our transactional flows to maximize natural hedges through better currency matching of revenue and expense.
That concludes my report, and I'll turn this back to Larry."
185333,224049722,394246,"Pall Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Nov 29, 2012",2012-11-29,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lisa.As you know, we're in a very dynamic environment, but we're responding well to it. There are a number of moving targets: FX volatility and governmental budgetary pressure, customers changing risk tolerance and a number of others. They all h",600,"Thanks, Lisa.
As you know, we're in a very dynamic environment, but we're responding well to it. There are a number of moving targets: FX volatility and governmental budgetary pressure, customers changing risk tolerance and a number of others. They all have the potential to continue to affect activity globally. That being said, we're listening closely to the customers, and we’ve parsed what we've heard from them into the trends, which form the basis of our updated forecast.
So first, the specific Life Sciences input. Biopharm continues at a healthy pace, even in Europe, driven by Western world product development supporting the so-called pharmerging global activity. The sustained growth of the biopharm end markets, in particular the biologicals, monoclonal-based treatments for autoimmune diseases, will continue to drive very strong performance in the face of choppy economics. Our outlook, accordingly, is that -- from first to second half of our fiscal year, that we've got a 10% growth assumption, so sequential growth of 10%. That calculates on a full year basis to an assumption of mid- to high-single-digit organic growth for Life Sciences.
In the Industrial end markets. As we've said, current sales and order rate performance for our Industrial segment is driven by both end market softening and destocking. And these trends are particularly germane to our Microelectronics and the Machinery & Equipment markets. In Microelectronics, the majority of the current sales trend is end market capacity-driven. MicroE demand is pretty broadly down. Recent consumer demand, if sustained, suggests that some of the inventory will be consumed, though. And therefore, fab utilization might increase before the end of our fiscal year. And for Machinery & Equipment, we attribute the current challenge to both too much OEM inventory as well as lower utilization rates. And more specifically, for Machinery & Equipment in the Americas, the outlook assumes that in-region demand and exports impact OEMs but also that end user spend generally remains pressured.
Europe is largely affected by low utilization rates. And Asia is more of a destocking, channel-driven set of issues, which could rebound, but it may not be until the end of the year. And Municipal Water just doesn't look good. Continued weakness is expected in muni water through the end of the fiscal year.
So our outlook for Industrial, accordingly, is that we expect Industrial sales growth to be down low to mid-single digits, and this factors in a sequential improvement through the balance of the year.
Our updated guidance is entirely driven by the range of sales performance we now anticipate. We think Q2 sales levels will be similar to Q1. However, we know that we will not have the benefit of favorable mix in the Industrial business. In addition, due to the holidays -- in the schedule this year, there are less work days versus last, and some of our customers may selectively shut down to a greater degree this year. We'll see. Relative to margin for the upcoming quarter, as Lisa mentioned, we also expect the typical sequential SG&A increase from Q1 to 2 that will modestly impact margins. However, our structural actions are on target, and we're beginning to see the benefits of productivity enhancements.
For the full year, the underlying tax rate will be 24%, in line with the previous guidance. And there is no significant change to our repurchase assumption. Our FX exposure, again, represents about an 8% drag on earnings for the full year. So in total, all factored in, we're guiding pro forma EPS to $2.95 to $3.15.

So it's inventory that OEMs may have built into product that hasn't sold and/or product that they have on the shelf awaiting a build cycle. And that's a significant portion of the content that represents about the 1/3 of the impact to the sales numbers that we described for Industrial as down: 1/3 destock versus the 2/3 the Industrial end demand. I think that it's leaned out pretty well, to answer your question. I don't think there's too much more that will come. It's a little bit of a different picture in Asia versus the rest of the world where there is more inventory in the OEM food chain in Asia, so there could be slightly kind of more to come there, but I think that what we've seen is kind of representation of the destocking component. And as far as the end market demand, you didn't specifically ask, but we don't expect it to get a lot worse. And if you go back to my comments relative to guidance, we think the back half does improve sequentially. Some of that is not unusual. That's a fairly typical Pall and a seasonal trend, and so it's not unusual for us to assume sequential improvement of that magnitude.

We expect a more normalized Industrial mix as we go into the remainder of the year. Now as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the good news is that we're getting after the cost, both direct costs but, more importantly, the cost to serve, in Industrial such that we'll continue to see Industrial both gross margins and OP margins improve over the intermediate period as well as the long term, but it's not going to be a kind of completely clean bridge off 16% as we go forward."

And I've talked before about the fact that, once we're all said and done, it cost us probably less, but it's as much as a point in terms of sales growth or sales contribution to the total company.

We do not want to be in low-margin systems that don't have a consumables follow-on opportunity. And those are the ones that we're further along with, maybe that's a fifth inning kind of situation. There's others where we're not making as much as we would like for a system that does generate a downstream consumable opportunity. And in those cases, we're trying to work through our cost structure, design issues and other things that contribute to make that a more attractive value proposition for the customer and business opportunity for us.

If you look at some of the order pattern that we're anticipating for Europe, including the emerging portion of that total sales content, it's not fabulous. So we don't expect Europe to continue to trend at the fantastic pace on the Industrial side relative to the markets they serve, as it has in the first quarter. However, I would tell you, from an execution standpoint, I think our team is doing a super job in Europe. And if anywhere globally we're taking share right now, it would be in Europe, both life science and Industrial. If you look at Pall Europe from a regional perspective, obviously, including life science, it comes back to the comments of the fact that there's a lot of strong European and biopharmaceutical content that actually ends up in emerging markets otherwise around the world. So the sales transaction is a European one, but the demand is a function of what's happening globally."

One, the last bit of lagging impact of the SAP go-live was in our medical and lab products. And we saw certainly a little bit of sales impact in the quarter just based on ability to return to strong customer-driven requests for products. So there's a bit of an impact there, not a lot. Secondly, with respect to -- we had a little bit of a plant interruption at our Fort Myers facility in Florida where we had a fire during the quarter, and we lost several days of production. And we were not able to return to what our desired customer-driven sales opportunity was for the quarter by the end of the quarter. And it cost us, from an absorption perspective, by about $0.5 million as well. So that would total the tally of kind of where we ended up with fulfillment challenges in the quarter."

Some of that is a dynamic of what we ship at the end of our fiscal year and how we recognize that. The bigger element to what's happening in terms of how we're thinking about managing inventory, both from what's happening in the current environment but also structurally and strategically for how we get at a much better working capital story, is -- and Lisa mentioned it, but we're building inventory principally in WIP, a little bit in raw. It's about $25 million that moves from finished goods to the WIP and raw in the quarter such that we can respond just as fast going forward without having to have the degree of dedicated finished goods inventory that we have historically. So historically, we have, as you know, held a fair amount of finished goods inventory. That's, in many cases, customer specific. We're moving to rolled stock media such that we can convert very quickly and be much more flexible and allow ourselves a finished goods inventory reduction over time. So the swing in the quarter really had to do more so with the move from finished goods to WIP and raw when you look at it from a year-over-year basis.
