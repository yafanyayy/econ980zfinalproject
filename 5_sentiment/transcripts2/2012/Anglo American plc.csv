As you can see, I'll do anything to protect the rights of the shareholders. I'll start by giving you the highlights of what we did achieve this year. we'll also walk you through the operational performance and then",1870,"It's good to see you again this morning. As you can see, I'll do anything to protect the rights of the shareholders. I'll start by giving you the highlights of what we did achieve this year. we'll also walk you through the operational performance and then will take you through the financials. And then I'll say a few words about the long-term, including our growth profile and world-class exploration achievements. Over the past 5 years, Anglo American has been on a journey to become the leading global mining company. We've developed a clear strategy. We simplified our organizations and our portfolio. We set straight targets, and we invested in growth. 5 years on, we continue our journey, and the fruits of our efforts are there for all to see. Record operating profit delivery of 3 of our 4 major projects. Robust balance sheet, the multipart balance project pipeline in the industry, and world-class geological discoveries. 
Our focus has and continues to be on people in driving performance with everyone involved. Our record financial performance last year reflects operational and business improvement foundations we have put in place. Total group operating profit was a record $11.1 billion, up 14%. Our underlying earnings were $6.1 billion, with earnings per share at $5.06. I now pleased to announce we've raised the final dividend to $0.46 per share, and this brings a total dividend for the year to $0.74 per share. 
We have minimized the impact of events beyond our control, likewise, rain or snow, input cost inflation and infrastructure constraints. On the growth front, our decision in 2009 to continue investing in our 4 major projects is paying off. 3 projects started production on or ahead of schedule. All 3 are ramping up. Our asset optimization and supply chain initiatives will continue to create and deliver value. And we are delivering volume growth and continue to move down the cost curve.  Beyond these initiatives, we have launched a commercial excellence model. We rose up the coordinated global marketing approach with centers in Singapore and London, and we expect this to generate significant value. 
Before we start to enter into the operating performance, I want to talk about safety. As you know, safety is an absolute priority for Anglo American and for me. In 2011, 17 of our colleagues lost their lives. The fact is that 2011 safety performance at Platinum was disappointing. The Platinum team are the first to admit this, and we're working together to do something about it. Following 2 fatalities in short success, and we decided to stop all Platinum operations on the 3rd of November. I went to South Africa, joined by Neville, Norman, and the team to address over 30,000 of our employees. We were also joined by trade union leaders and governments safety instructors and launched the Zero Harm In Action initiative. It aims to bring about cultural change through targeted action and individual responsibility. We've also shown 0 harm is achievable in all parts of the organization. 
Across our business units, excluding Platinum, loss time injury frequency rate has dropped by 16%, and 91% of our operations had no fatalities in 2011. No matter what the record is though, 17 deaths are 17, too many. So we recommit our selves to prioritize, to simplify and communicate our safety programs to achieve 0 harm. 
When considering our improved performance, there's one initiative that started us on the path to becoming best-in-class operators. 5 years ago, we launched that asset optimization and supply chain initiatives. In 2009, we set a savings target up to $2 billion by 2011. Since then, we have consistently exceeded the target. In 2011, we delivered $3.2 billion in savings, and these programs are now embedded in our operations and will deliver substantial value. 
Having exceeded our target, there is further value to be unlocked from our asset optimization. We've embedded OPS, asset optimization and an operational excellence across the group. For example, best-in-class performance delivered record production in thermal metallurgical coal, Open pit mines, but there is so much more value to extract. 
Last year alone, we completed 6 operational reviews, and identified almost $900 million in potential value. 
Beyond our asset optimization initiatives, global supply chains delivers multiple benefits, unlocking real savings, establishing long-term partnerships, and providing benefits for the communities in which we operate through local procurement. All our suppliers are required to adapt and embed our approach to safety as well as our values, effectively, becoming an extension of our organization. 
In Queensland, we've established a partnership with Joy to improve long haul productivity, critical to tripling our metallurgical coal production by 2020. In 2011, we delivered 9 projects in challenging geographies covering 4 countries and 5 commodities on or ahead of schedule. 4 of our core projects are low-cost, long-life, Tier 1 assets, will generate significant value. Our decision to invest through the cycle is paying off. And we are now looking for rewards. 
Over and above our organic growth pipeline, we have delivered substantial value from recent transactions in an industry that considers time in decades, not years, it is crucial to grow and replace production continuously. So we have always looked at opportunities to supplement our pipeline. De Beers was one of those, which we have been pursuing for some time. We're thrilled to have secured a world-class business through that deal. Similarly, in recognition of the value metallurgical coal generates, we take a closer look at Peace River Coal, and we decided to retain and grow this business. 
This led us to take out the minorities and we did that at an attractive value. In addition, the sale of our 24.5% interest in Anglo American tour Mitsubishi builds on our clear and consistent strategy of protecting and delivering value. We have done the right thing. 
At $22 billion on 100% basis, the minority sale of the Anglo American tour generated significant value. As you know, we're currently involved in a legal dispute with Cadelco over the OPS agreement relating to the Anglo American tool. We have said consistently that we are ready to work together to agree on a commercial solution, but it has not been possible to reach a settlement that takes into account Anglo American's strong legal position. 
We continue to be open, to sensible negotiations, conducted in good faith, but we will not be moved from defending our clear legal rights, and protecting value for our shareholders, recognizing our legal rights under what is a simple contract between 2 companies and the effect of Cadelco's breach of the contract. 
Cadelco knew what our alternatives were in terms of selling down our holding to a third-party prior to any valid exercise of the option, and it sought to prematurely exercise the option. The strength of our legal position is beyond question. 
Now turning to our operational performance. Let's start with Iron Ore and Manganese. 2011 was a record, achieving high margins and returns. Sishen continues to operate strongly, despite being impacted by heavy rains in the first half. Kolomela was delivered on budget and 5 months ahead of schedule. Kolomela is set to deliver 4 million to 5 million tons in 2012, and we're pleased to hear the President of South Africa confirm the plan expansion of the Iron Ore export channel were moving an impediment to our growth. 
Amapa continue to be a turnaround story, although relatively small part of our portfolio, we achieved operating profit of $120 million in 2011, compared to just $16 million the year before. And we're also making good progress at. And I'll talk about that in a few minutes. 
Turning to Metallurgical Coal. Operating profit was also a record. Production was impacted by rain in the first half, followed by an incident at Moranbah underground mine. But we have strong recovery driven by best-in-class open pit performance, with a 90% first half versus, improvement versus the second half production increase. Phase I of the Grosvenor project was approved in December and this kicks off our more involved Metallurgical Coal hub which treats 4 sequential projects has one. 
Gouverneur will be a low-cost operation, leveraging existing infrastructure in our own backyard. We have planed to secure our port and rail capacity for our growth. And in December, we were awarded for respondent status of the element of a 30 million ton dedicated coal terminal at Abbott point. 
Thermal Coal is another business unit to have delivered a record operating profit, despite production being impacted by rain in the first half. We were able to take advantage of the strong recovery in transit performance in the second half to our own operational flexibility and efficient load-out stations. Zibulo, a 6.6 million-ton low-cost thermal coal mine was ramped up ahead of schedule. And had a new production record, and is progressing with an 8 million ton expansion. 
Moving to Copper. Operating profit was $2.5 billion. While copper prices were somewhat volatile on average, the copper price for the year was higher. As with the industry peers, production was impacted by severe weather disruptions and grade declines. We've partially offset these impacts to asset optimization and volume growth. At Los Bronces, SAG mill throughput improved following a series of asset optimization initiatives. At Collahuasi, we're working with our partners to accelerate all expansion projects. And in Puru, we are in dialogue with all levels of government and local communities to secure permits for Quellaveco.  We are progressing but it will take time. 
Nickel operating profit was $57 million. Production increased by 44%. Loma de Níquel delivered a 14% compound annual growth rate in production since 2009. The Bellato Project was delivered on time and on local budget. Bellato surpassed all other Nickel projects around the world in terms of on-time start-up, quantity of metal produced from the onset and world-class safety performance. Bellato is ramping up well. At full capacity it will more than double our nickel production. 
Turning to Platinum. Operating profit increased to $890 million, despite 81 safety stoppages at our own operations. The open pit mine performed strongly. Anke produced 52,000 Platinum ounces, reaching steady-state 1 year ahead of schedule. The Platinum business for today is a far cry from what it was in terms of production, in terms of productivity, and in terms of safety. We have seen substantial improvements and the returns are in line with the industry. However, these returns declined in recent years, and are not acceptable to us for the medium term. 
The Platinum industry faces significant challenges whether cost inflation, whether safety stoppages, or lingering concerns over European demand. As a result, we are embarking on our review to assess the optimal configuration of the Platinum portfolio. And we will do this with a single purpose in mind, maximizing shareholder value and returns through the cycle. 
And finally, Diamonds. De Beers operating profit was up 33%. in times prices were a record, up 29%, and we are optimistic about China and India continuing to drive demand growth in the medium to long-term. De Beers is well positioned to capture this growth through its forever mark, and De Beers Diamond Jewelry brand expansion. So would that now, I'll hand over to René."

Towards the end of 2011, there was a distinct slow down in major emerging countries and continuing doubts over Europe's fiscal sustainability. Uncertainty is likely to persist in the short-term. This is important but we do not base our investment decisions on short-term drivers. And instead, our eyes are on the next decade and beyond. What is important for us is that the long-term fundamentals are sound. 
Looking at the left side of the page, we have the most diversified and that was portfolio with unparalleled exposure to late cycle development. For the first time, more than half of China's population now lives in cities. This tipping point happened in the U.K. in the 1850s, and in the U.S. in the 1920s. So there is a long road of growth and development ahead. We saw this during a recent trip to China and India. While development in China is coastal provinces are at early stages of development, recording double-digit growth. This will continue to drive demand for raw materials over the coming decades, and we believe as development shifts from an investments to consumption-driven economy, the growth rate in steel will moderate. 
Growing middle classes in China and India and rising disposable incomes are driving demand for late-cycle commodities like diamonds and PGMs. In addition, medium-term replacement of infrastructure in the developed world, presents further opportunities for steel. And there's no doubt in my mind, value creation will be the fruit of our diversified and balanced portfolio. 
Demand is only part of the story. Our industry continues to face tough challenges, and these include: coals for higher taxes and royalties, rising capital intensity, infrastructure constraints, and tighter environmental regulators. Copper lift the coins in existing mines, the picture emerges of supply consistently under delivering against market expectation, and this was support prices over the medium to long-term.  Because we take the long-term view, we look beyond volatility, and continue to invest in value accretive growth -- 
Barro Alto, Los Bronces, Kolomela, showcase our ability to build large, complex projects. We currently have 9 projects approved. These improvements is real in Brazil, Grovernor in Queensland, Collahuasi Phase II. In Chile, P500 Phase I in Colombia, and Cut8 in Botswana. And these projects are in the right commodities. At the low-end of the cost curve, offering attractive returns. 
Minas Rio is a large and complex refill project. Here, we have a high quality Tier 1 asset. It has a large resource base that's only getting bigger. It is expandable. It's capital intensity remains in line with comparable Greenfield projects, and at full productions, the deliver cash costs of around $50 per ton is at the very low-end of the cost curve, and we are making progress. 
More than 90% of the land access has been secured along the pipeline. More than 200 kilometers of the pipeline has now been laid buried and installed. As we expected, we are encountering environmental realities such as caves, land access and permitting within an ever-changing regulatory environment adds complexity, but we are overcoming these challenges to target first orange chef in the second half of 2013, and within the announced 15% capital increase. We are accelerating pre-commissioning plans, engaging proactively with permitting authorities, and locking in labor costs. And yes, it takes time, but we want to get it right. The projects showing value, remain very robustly tested for cost and timing sensitivities. And we're still working at it, but we have the right team in place committed to making progress. 
We have the potential to double production with the delivery of almost $100 billion project pipeline, covering almost 90 projects. Our growth pipeline is the most diversified and balanced in the industry. We will continue to invest in commodities with strong fundamentals, the most attractive risk return profiles that deliver long-term return to the cycle for our shareholders, and all of this with a backdrop of continuing growth in demand for our products. 
In the meantime, our world-class exploration team has been discovering the next generation of Tier 1 assets. Since 1999, we have made 15 major discoveries and have received international recognition for Los Sulfatos and Sikati. Sikati is a porphyry deposit of high quality copper, nickel, PGMs and cobalt, and forms part of our tenements, covering more than 800 square kilometers. The deposit is within a, of world-class infrastructure, and sits in an existing mining region. All levels of government in Finland are very receptive to mining investment. Our drilling has yet to determine the extent of the deposits the north, towards the south, and towards the west, as well as the depth of the deposit, and we will not, however, be making announcements until we have defined the resource size. 
This will take about 2 to 3 years, but the development is not automatic. As with all our projects, we will work through the relevant environmental approvals. In a world of diminishing Tier 1 assets, our world class exploration approach truly gives us a competitive edge. 
So to sum up, we have again shown our ability to deliver value. Today, you've heard about record operating profits, strong project delivery and commercial success. We have the resources, we have the know-how, and we have the people to achieve our ambition of becoming the leading global mining company. And our success is made possible by our focus on delivering a clear and consistent strategy. We're investing in commodities with the strongest long-term fundamentals and with the most attractive risk return profiles. The bulk of our operations are at the low-end of the cost curve. Our growth pipeline is balanced, taking advantage of all stages of the cycle, and our exploration team is making the most impressive discoveries in the industry, restocking our pipeline of Tier 1 assets. 
We have also made clear that we are prepared to take the tough decisions where assets are not delivering acceptable returns. You've seen us do this before and we will do it again. We will become the leading global mining company, delivering real, sustainable shareholder value. 
So thank you very much for your attention. Thanks for coming. Thank heavens for raw materials, because I would not be standing up here were it not be for iron ore, stainless steel and titanium. And now I'll be very happy to take any questions, and we'll start from London, and will turn to South Africa."

There are number of smaller projects in South Africa, and they depend on expansion of the infrastructure, than all of the other normal minings. Cynthia mentioned that the President, in the State of the Nation address last week, mentioned that there would -- that one of the infrastructure expansion projects in South Africa would be decisions of our export channel. And he mentioned -- well he mentioned 2 numbers. He said we'll expand from 60 to 80, and a bit later, mentioned that we'll expand from 60 to 100. But it's certainly, I think it's very positive, that in the State of the Nation Address, the President is mentioning infrastructure expansion, particularly on iron ore export channels. So a very positive news, and that's exactly when the big bottlenecks that are needed to be unlocked to be able to grow in South Africa. So a very positive news indeed, and then we also announced in the half-year, and again at the final year results, that Kumba will be seeking to work with Anglo American in Africa, and that project has started between ourself and.

So as I said earlier in my presentation, I mean we've come a long way, and I think it's very fair to say that since 2007, or so, I'm looking at Neville over here, I  mean we've improved our safety performance substantially, we've increased the productivity hugely, we've delivered on our production targets, and we've contained costs in line with what we committed to the market, between ZAR 11,000 and ZAR 12,000 per ounce. So I think that's a big achievement. Now last year, sadly, fortunately, however you want to describe it, the industry was faced with serious safety stoppages, and the inspectors were going into our mines and not just sending down sections where there was a safety discrepancy identified by whole mines on that. The industry at large, lost over 300,000 ounces. So what are we doing about this? Well, we've got some near-term quick fixes, so to speak, Neville, I'm looking at you. Neville, if you grab the microphone. We've got some near-term initiatives that we're looking at. We have spent time with the DMR to engage with them, and get them to make the right approach, and I think that they're now showing signs of doing that. And we're seeing some fair treatment with respect to stoppages. And we're looking at the longer term. So coming back to your question, I mean, and I mentioned it, we're looking at the shape of the portfolio, we're looking at the size of the portfolio, we're looking at whether we should be doing more in recycling, we're looking at where do we want to leverage our asset base? Where do we want to take Mogalakwena, for an example, where are we taking Anke in the future? How do we deploy our workforce? And how do we get this business back to the returns that we were seeing in 2008? And that's the bottom line, Jason. We're not doing anything other than focusing on getting it right and it may be, as I've said earlier, maybe it's acceptable for the industry to see lower returns. Everybody's seeing the same thing. And as I've also said, I've talked about that position on the cost curve, I mean, 2007, 2008, we had about 1/3 of our operations in the first half of the year -- cost curve. Today, we have over 60%. So again, we've come a long way, but we need to get this to a better place so we're seeing greater return. So we're not -- we haven't taken the decision to do anything, except focus and deliver more value in the business."

I think as Cynthia said, the model we're following has been held up by the Peruvian governments as the model had locked to see in terms of community consultation, local represent of consultation. What really progressing with these 2 parallel but interconnected streams of work, the first of those is the dialogue table. I think that's doing remarkably well, we've got 20 different stakeholder from the regions, from central governments, from all sorts of community group. That's, I think that dialogue table is divided into 3 aspects, the issues around water, the issues around the environments, and the issues around social contribution. We've completed the issues around water, and with the results that the community that are supportive of the water scheme that we're proposing. We're very close to concluding the area, the part of the environmental, where we'd look at the various environmental issues that we're concerns to the community, and I think we've had satisfactorily results, pretty much all of those, and we're going to the last phase of discussing how this project is going to contribute to the local community. Simultaneously with that, we're working on the permitting process. I think we've made some improvements, steps forward in terms of, it's a multistep process. Each permit requires steps that's -- one of the changes that happened in the legislation was the steps needed to be done in series rather than in parallel, so we're busy expediting each of those steps. At this stage, both processes need to come to a conclusion, for us to take this project to the final stage, which is our board approval. The technical part of the feasibility study is done. That is complete. It's really those 2 last steps that we're busy with. We're working through those as expeditiously as we can, but also recognizing the fact that we tend to be a long-term investor in Peru. This isn't just any project in Peru. We've got Michiquillay as well, a very intensive excavation program. And we want to make sure that we do this project right the first time. And that we do have both the sort of local, the regional, and the national stakeholders, all on sites when we do it. We have seen the consequences of projects that have stepped forward too quickly without getting everybody on sides, and in the long term, we believe that actually cost us more than it does to do it right in the first time."

The increase in Queensland is between 25 million and 30 million tons, which is enough to justify dedicated term of minimum of economic size by, about 30 million tons. We were granted Preferred Respondent Status for development of a terminal at Abbott Point in December. At the same time, we approved in fact, the Grosvenor project. We moved to develop the status in April of this year. So we have in fact, anticipated granting of the Preferred Respondent Rights. We started the pre-feasibility study on this terminal back in September. The first phase will be finished in March, which will allow us to go for internal approval to pay $75 million to move to developer status. So we'd anticipate the 1st week of April, paying that $75 million and moving to the developer status. The pre-feasibility will be finished by the end of this year, and freeze, then we can move into freeze at the end of this year, feasibility complete a5t the end of next year, and we will be going for board approval, then if all makes sense, at the end of next year to build our terminal. The rail development is integrated with the whole terminal development. The size we're looking at isn't enough to justify dedicated track. So we are talking to Queensland Rail about expansion of existing track, their so-called, Nor The Missing Link, which turns to Abbott Point, and mission indications from Queensland Rail, that true incremental expansion of existing track electrification, et cetera. We showed -- they should be able to accommodate our required tonnages for Abbott Point. The access, what's called the access undertaking Queensland, which is the regulatory regime for construction of new track, allows us in the event that Queensland Rail don't feel -- able to actually fund the expansion of that track. It allows us as a producer, the funder ourselves, and for Queensland Rail to manage it. So we have some certainty over to capacity and the timing, and the only question mark, will be about funding, but we'll walk through that as part of that Abbott Point pre-feasibility work this year."

We'll also look at the operatio",1880,"[indiscernible] everybody, and it's good to see you again this morning. As you can see, I'll do anything to protect the rights of our shareholders. 
I'll start by giving you the highlights of what we've achieved this year. We'll also look at the operational performance, and René will take you through the financials. And then I'll say a few words about the long term, including our growth profile and world-class exploration achievements. Over the past 5 years, Anglo American has been on a journey to become the leading global mining company. We've developed a clear strategy, we simplified our organization and our portfolio, we set strict targets and we invested in growth. Five years on, we continue our journey and the fruits of our efforts are there for all to see: record-operating profit; delivery of 3 of our 4 major projects; robust balance sheet; the most diversified and balanced project pipeline in the industry; and world-class geological discoveries. 
Our focus has and continues to be on people and driving performance with everyone involved. Our record financial performance last year reflects the operational and business improvement foundations we have put in place. 
Total group operating profit was a record $11.1 billion, up 14%. Our underlying earnings were $6.1 billion with earnings per share at $5.06. I'm therefore pleased to announce we've raised the final dividend to $0.46 per share, and this brings the total dividend for the year to $0.74 per share. 
We have minimized the impact of events beyond our control like floods, rain or snow, input cost inflation and infrastructure constraints. 
On the growth front, our decision in 2009 to continue investing in our 4 major projects is paying off. Three projects started production on or ahead of schedule. All 3 are ramping up. Our asset optimization and supply chain initiatives will continue to create and deliver value. And we are delivering volume growth and continue to move down the cost curve.  Beyond these initiatives, we have launched a commercial excellence model. We worked out a coordinated global marketing approach with centers in Singapore and London, and we expect this to generate significant value. 
Before we start to enter into the operating performance, I want to talk about safety. As you know, safety is an absolute priority for Anglo American and for me. In 2011, 17 of our colleagues lost their lives. The fact is that 2011 safety performance at Platinum was disappointing. The Platinum team are the first to admit this, and we're working together to do something about it. Following 2 fatalities in short succession, we decided to stop all Platinum operations on the 3rd of November. I went to South Africa, joined by Neville, Norman and the team to address over 30,000 of our employees. We were also joined by trade union leaders and government safety inspectors and launched the zero harm in action initiative. It aims to bring about cultural change through targeted action and individual responsibility. We've also shown zero harm is achievable in all parts of the organization. 
Across our business units, excluding Platinum, lost-time injury frequency rate dropped by 16% and 91% of our operations had no fatalities in 2011. No matter what the record is, though, 17 deaths are 17 too many. So we recommit our selves to prioritize, to simplify and community -- communicate our safety programs to achieve zero harm. 
When considering our improved performance, there is one initiative that started us on the path to becoming best-in-class operators. Five years ago, we launched that asset optimization and supply chain initiatives. In 2009, we set a savings target of to $2 billion by 2011. Since then, we have consistently exceeded the target. In 2011, we delivered $3.2 billion in savings, and these programs are now embedded in our operations and will deliver substantial value. 
Having exceeded our target, there is further value to be unlocked from asset optimization. We've embedded ops -- asset optimization and an operational excellence across the group. For example, best-in-class performance delivered record production in thermal and metallurgical coal open-pit mines, but there is so much more value to extract. Last year, alone, we completed 6 operational reviews and identified almost $900 million in potential value. 
Beyond our asset optimization initiatives, global supply chain delivered multiple benefits, unlocking real savings, establishing long-term partnerships and providing benefits for the communities in which we operate through local procurement. All our suppliers are required to adopt and embed our approach to safety as well as our values, effectively becoming our -- an extension of our organization. 
In Queensland, we've established a partnership with Joy [ph] to improve longwall productivity critical to tripling our metallurgical coal production by 2020. 
In 2011, we delivered 9 projects in challenging geographies covering 4 countries and 5 commodities on or ahead of schedule. Three of our 4 projects, all low-cost, long-life, Tier 1 assets, will generate significant value. Our decision to invest through the cycle is paying off. And we are now reaping the rewards. 
Over and above our organic growth pipeline, we have delivered substantial value from recent transactions. In an industry that considers time in decades, not years, it is crucial to grow and replace production continuously, so we have always looked at opportunities to supplement our pipeline. De Beers was one of those, which we have been pursuing for some time. We're thrilled to have secured a world-class business through that deal. Similarly, in recognition of the value metallurgical coal generates, we took a closer look at Peace River Coal, and we've decided to retain and grow this business. This led us to take out the minorities and we did that at an attractive value. 
In addition, the sale of our 24.5% interest in Anglo American Sur to Mitsubishi builds on our clear and consistent strategy of protecting and delivering value. We have done the right thing. At $22 billion on 100% basis, the minority sale of Anglo American Sur generated significant value. 
As you know, we're currently involved in a legal dispute with Cadelco over the option agreement relating to the Anglo American Sur. We have said consistently that we are ready to work together to agree on a commercial solution, but it has not been possible to reach a settlement that takes into account Anglo American's strong legal position. We continue to be open to sensible negotiations conducted in good faith, but we will not be moved from defending our clear legal rights and protecting value for our shareholders, recognizing our legal rights under what is a simple contract between 2 companies and the effect of Cadelco's breach of the contract. Cadelco knew what our alternatives were in terms of selling down our holding to a third-party prior to any valid exercise of the option, and it sought to prematurely exercise the option. The strength of our legal position is beyond question. 
Now turning to our operational performance. Let's start with Iron Ore and Manganese. 2011 was a record, achieving high margins and returns. Sishen continued to operate strongly, despite being impacted by heavy rains in the first half. Kolomela was delivered on budget and 5 months ahead of schedule. Kolomela is set to deliver 4 million to 5 million tons in 2012, and we're pleased to hear the President of South Africa confirm the planned expansion of the iron ore export channel, removing an impediment to our growth. 
Amapa continues to be a turnaround story. Although a relatively small part of our portfolio, we achieved operating profit of $120 million in 2011 compared to just $16 million the year before. And we're also making good progress at Minas-Rio, and I'll talk about that in a few minutes. 
Turning to Metallurgical Coal. Operating profit was also a record. Production was impacted by rain in the first half, followed by an incident at Moranbah underground mine, but we've staged a strong recovery, driven by best-in-class open-pit performance with a 90% first half versus -- improvement versus the second half production increase. Phase 1 of the Grosvenor project was approved in December and this kicks off our Moranbah metallurgical coal hub, which treats 4 sequential projects as one. Grosvenor will be a low-cost operation, leveraging existing infrastructure in our own backyard. We have plans to secure our port and rail capacity for our growth. And in December, we were awarded Preferred Respondent status for the development of a 30 million ton dedicated coal terminal at Abbott Point. 
Thermal Coal is another business unit to have delivered a record operating profit despite production being impacted by rain in the first half. We were able to take advantage of the strong recovery in transit performance in the second half to our own operational flexibility and efficient load-out stations. Zibulo, a 6.6 million ton low-cost thermal coal mine was ramped up ahead of schedule. And Cerrejon set a new production record and is progressing with an 8 million-ton expansion. 
Moving to Copper. Operating profit was $2.5 billion. While copper prices were somewhat volatile, on average, the copper price for the year was higher. As with the industry peers, production was impacted by severe weather disruptions and grade decline. We've partially offset these impacts through asset optimization and volume growth. At Los Bronces, SAG mill throughput improved following a series of asset optimization initiatives. At Collahuasi, we're working with our partners to accelerate all expansion projects. And in Peru, we are in dialogue with all levels of government and local communities to secure permits for Quellaveco.  We are progressing, but it will take time. 
Nickel operating profit was $57 million. Production increased by 44%. Loma de Níquel delivered a 14% compound annual growth rate in production since 2009. The Barro Alto project was delivered on time and on local budget. Barro Alto surpassed all other nickel projects around the world in terms of on-time startup, quality of metal produced from the outset and world-class safety performance. Barro Alto is ramping up well. At full capacity, it will more than double our nickel production. 
Turning to Platinum. Operating profit increased to $890 million despite 81 safety stoppages at our own operations. Mogalakwena open-pit mine performed strongly. Unki produced 52,000 platinum ounces, reaching steady state 1 year ahead of schedule. The Platinum business for today is a far cry from what it was in terms of production, in terms of productivity and in terms of safety. We have seen substantial improvements and the returns are in line with the industry. However, these returns declined in recent years and are not acceptable to us for the medium term. The platinum industry faces significant challenges whether cost inflation, whether safety stoppages or lingering concerns over European demand. As a result, we are embarking on a review to assess the optimal configuration of the Platinum portfolio and we will do this with a single purpose in mind, maximizing shareholder value and returns through the cycle. 
And finally, Diamonds. De Beers operating profit was up 33%. Rough prices were a record, up 29%, and we are optimistic about China and India continuing to drive demand growth in the medium to long term. De Beers is well positioned to capture this growth through its Forevermark and De Beers diamond Jewellry brand expansions. 
So with that now, I'll hand over to René."

Towards the end of 2011, there was a distinct slowdown in major emerging countries and continuing doubts over Europe's fiscal sustainability. Uncertainty is likely to persist in the short term. This is important, but we do not base our investment decisions on short-term drivers. And instead, our eyes are on the next decade and beyond. What is important for us is that the long-term fundamentals are sound. 
Looking at the left side of the page, you will see we have the most diversified and balanced portfolio with unparalleled exposure to late-cycle development. For the first time, more than 1/2 of China's population now lives in cities. This tipping point happened in the U.K. in the 1850s and in the U.S. in the 1920s, so there is a long road of growth and development ahead. We saw this during a recent trip to China and India. While development in China's coastal provinces is maturing, inland provinces are at early stages of development, recording double-digit growth. This will continue to drive demand for raw materials over the coming decades. And we believe as development shifts from an investment to consumption-driven economy, the growth rate in steel will moderate. 
Growing middle classes in China and India and rising disposable incomes are driving demand for late-cycle commodities like diamonds and PGMs. In addition, medium-term replacement of infrastructure in the developed world presents further opportunities for steel. And there's no doubt in my mind, value creation will be the fruit of our diversified and balanced portfolio. 
Demand is only part of the story. Our industry continues to face tough challenges, and these include calls for higher taxes and royalties, rising capital intensity, infrastructure constraints and tighter environmental regulations. Coupled with declines in existing mines, a picture emerges of supply consistently under delivering against market expectation and this will support prices over the medium to long term.  Because we take the long-term view, we look beyond volatility and continue to invest in value-accretive growth.
Barro Alto, Los Bronces, Kolomela showcase our ability to build large, complex projects. We currently have 9 projects approved. These include Minas-Rio in Brazil, Grosvenor in Queensland, Collahuasi Phase 2 in Chile, Cerrejon P500 Phase 1 in Colombia and Jwaneng-Cut 8 in Botswana. And these projects are in the right commodities, at the low end of the cost curve, offering attractive returns. 
Minas-Rio is a large and complex greenfield project. Here, we have a high-quality Tier 1 asset. It has a large resource base that's only getting bigger. It is expandable. Its capital intensity remains in line with comparable greenfield projects. And at full production, the delivered cash costs of around $50 per ton at the -- is at the very low end of the cost curve, and we are making progress. More than 90% of the land access has been secured along the pipeline. More than 200 kilometers of the pipeline have now been laid buried and installed. As we expected, we are encountering environmental realities such as caves. Land access and permitting within an ever-changing regulatory environment adds complexity, but we are overcoming these challenges to target first ore shipped in the second half of 2013 and within the announced 15% capital increase. We are accelerating pre-commissioning plans, engaging proactively with permitting authorities and locking in labor costs. And yes, it takes time, but we want to get it right. The project [indiscernible] value remain very robust. It was tested for cost and timing sensitivities. And we're still working at it, but we have the right team in place committed to making progress. 
We have the potential to double production with the delivery of almost $100 billion project pipeline, covering almost 90 projects. Our growth pipeline is the most diversified and balanced in the industry. We will continue to invest in commodities with strong fundamentals, the most attractive risk return profiles that deliver long-term return through the cycle for our shareholders, and all of this with a backdrop of continuing growth in demand for our products. 
In the meantime, our world-class exploration team has been discovering the next generation of Tier 1 assets. Since 1999, we have made 15 major discoveries and have received international recognition for Los Sulfatos and Sakatti. Sakatti is a porphyry deposit of high-quality copper, nickel, PGMs and cobalt and forms part of our tenements, covering more than 800 square kilometers. The deposit is within a stone's throw of world-class infrastructure and sits in an existing mining region. All levels of government in Finland are very receptive to mining investments. Our drilling has yet to determine the extent of the deposits towards the north, towards the south and towards the west as well as the depth of the deposits. And we will not, however, be making announcements until we have defined the resource size. This will take about 2 to 3 years, but the development is then not automatic. As with all our projects, we will work through the relevant environmental approvals. In a world of diminishing Tier 1 assets, our world-class exploration approach truly gives us a competitive edge. 
So to sum up, we have again shown our ability to deliver value. Today, you've heard about record operating profits, strong project delivery and commercial success. We have the resources, we have the know-how and we have the people to achieve our ambition of becoming the leading global mining company. And our success is made possible by our focus on delivering a clear and consistent strategy. We invest in commodities with the strongest long-term fundamentals and with the most attractive risk return profiles. The bulk of our operations are at the low end of the cost curve. Our growth pipeline is balanced, taking advantage of all stages of the cycle. And our exploration team is making the most impressive discoveries in the industry, restocking our pipeline of Tier 1 assets. 
We have also made clear that we are prepared to take the tough decisions where assets are not delivering acceptable returns. You've seen us do this before and we will do it again. We will become the leading global mining company, delivering real, sustainable shareholder value. 
So thank you very much for your attention. Thanks for coming. Thank heavens for raw materials because I would not be standing up here were it not be for iron ore, stainless steel and titanium. 
And now I'd be very happy to take any questions, and we'll start from London and then turn to South Africa."

Basically out of the 130 license that we need, 80% of them are concluded. There's still work to be done on the others, of course. But I think the key challenge is to continue to engage very proactively with the government, with the entities that regulate these -- the permitting because there are things that come up like the caves issue that Cynthia referred to. But then to sum up, there has been very good projects around the licensing and permitting. We continue to engage very proactively with the government.

Yes, so I'll just briefly mention that we have, now consistently over the last few years, mentioned that we will deliver first the jig plant, which was a 13-million ton expansion, then the Kolomela plant. And then above that, there was still a potential of about another 20 million tons above then the 50 million tons. That's still remains on track. There are number of smaller projects in South Africa and they depend on expansion of the infrastructure than all of the other normal health warnings. Now Cynthia mentioned that the President, in his State of the Nation address last week, mentioned that there would be -- that one of the infrastructure expansion projects in South Africa would be Sishen-Saldana export channel. And he mentioned -- well, he mentioned 2 numbers. He said it would expand from 60 to 80 and a bit later mentioned that it would expand from 60 to 100. But there's certainly, I think, it's very positive, that in the State of the Nation address, the President is mentioning infrastructure expansion and particularly on the iron ore export channel. So a very positive news and that's exactly one of the big bottlenecks that are needed to be unlocked to be able to grow in South Africa. So a very positive news, indeed. And then we also announced at the half year and again at the final year results that Kumba would be seeking to work with Anglo American in Africa and that project has started. Between myself and Peter, we are running the steering committee that's looking at expansion opportunities. We are talking to some people, have identified some projects, but that is about as much as we can say at this point in time. But that work is now underway."

So as I said earlier in my presentation, I mean we've come a long way and I think it's very fair to say that since 2007 or so, and I'm looking at Neville over here, I mean we've improved our safety performance substantially. We've improved -- increased the productivity hugely, we've delivered on our production targets and we've contained costs in line with what we committed to the market between ZAR 11,000 and ZAR 12,000 per ounce, so I think that's a big achievement. Now last year, sadly, fortunately, however you want to describe it, the industry was faced with serious safety stoppages and the inspectors were going into our mines and not just sending down sections where there was a safety discrepancy identified by whole mines for days on end. The industry, at large, lost over 300,000 ounces. So what are we doing about this? Well, we've got some near-term quick fixes, so to speak. Neville, I'm looking at you. Neville, if you grab the microphone. We've got some near-term initiatives that we're looking at. We have spent time with the DMR to engage with them and get them to take the right approach, and I think that they're now showing signs of doing that. And we're seeing some fair treatment with respect to stoppages. And we're looking at the longer term. So coming back to your question, I mean, and I mentioned it, we're looking at the shape of the portfolio, we're looking at the size of the portfolio, we're looking at whether we should be doing more in recycling, we're looking at where do we want to leverage our asset base, where do we want to take Mogalakwena, for an example, where are we taking Unki in the future, how do we deploy our workforce and how do we get this business back to the returns that we were seeing in 2008? That's the bottom line, Jason. We're not doing anything other than focusing on getting it right and it may be, as I've said earlier, it may be acceptable for the industry to see lower returns. Everybody's seeing the same thing. And as I also -- I said -- talked about our position on the cost curve, I mean, 2007, 2008, we had about 1/3 of our operations in the first half of the year -- cost curve. Today, we have over 60%. So again, we've come a long way, but we need to get this to a better place so we're seeing this greater return.

I think as Cynthia said, the model we're following has been held up by the Peruvian governments as the model they'd like to see in terms of community consultation, local representative consultation. What's really progressing with these 2 parallel but interconnected streams of work, the first of those is the dialogue table. I think that's going remarkably well. We've got 28 different stakeholders from the regions, from the central government, from all sorts of community groups. That's, I think -- that dialogue table is divided into 3 aspects: the issues around water, the issues around the environment and the issues around social contribution. We have concluded the issues around water and with the result that the communities are supportive of the water scheme that we're proposing. We're very close to concluding the area -- the part on environmental where we've looked at the various environmental issues that were a concern to the community and I think we've satisfactorily resolved pretty much all of those. And we're now into the last phase of discussing how this project is going to contribute to the local communities. Simultaneously with that, we're working on the permitting process. I think we've made some important steps forward in terms of -- it's a multistep process. Each permit requires steps that's -- one of the changes that happened in the legislation was these steps needed to be done in series rather than in parallel, so we're busy expediting each of those steps. At this stage, both processes need to come to a conclusion for us to take this project to the final stage, which is our board approval. The technical part of the feasibility study is done. That is complete. It's really those 2 last steps that we're busy with. We're working through those as expeditiously as we can, but also recognizing the fact that we intend to be a long-term investor in Peru. This isn't our only project in Peru. We've got Michiquillay as well. We've got very intensive exploration program. And we want to make sure that we do this project right the first time and that we do have both the sort of local, the regional and the national stakeholders all on site when we do it. We have seen the consequences of projects that have stepped forward too quickly without getting everybody on site. And in the long term, we believe that actually costs us more than it does to do it right the first time."

The increase in Queensland is between 25 million and 30 million ton, which is enough to justify dedicated terminal and minimum economic size by terminal is about 30 million ton. We were granted Preferred Respondent status for development of a terminal at Abbott Point in December. At the same time, we approved, in fact, the Grosvenor project. We moved to develop a status in April of this year. So we had, in fact, anticipated granting of the Preferred Respondent rights. We started a pre-feasibility study on this terminal back in September. The first phase will be finished in March, which will allow us to go for internal approval to pay $75 million to move to developer status. So we would anticipate in the 1st week of April paying that $75 million and moving to developer status. The pre-feas will be finished by the end of this year and then fees -- we can move into fees at the end of this year. Feasibility complete at the end of next year, and we will be going for board approval then, if all makes sense, at the end of next year to build that terminal. The rail development is integrated with the whole terminal development. The size we're looking at isn't enough to justify dedicated track. So we are talking to Queensland Rail about expansion of the existing track, so-called North Missing Link, which runs through Abbott Point and mission [ph] indications [ph] from Queensland Rail, that true incremental expansion of existing track electrification, et cetera. We should -- they should be able to accommodate our required tonnages for Abbott Point. The access, what's called the Access Undertaking in Queensland, which is the regulatory regime for construction of new track, allows us in the event that Queensland Rail don't feel able to actually fund the expansion of that track, it allows us as a producer to fund it ourselves and for Queensland Rail to manage it. So we have some certainty over the capacity and the timing, and the only question mark will be about funding. But we'll work through that as part of that Abbott Point pre-feasibility work this year."

That's in the real terms, obviously, so it doesn't account for the effect of timing of the project. In fact, there's going to be escalation. But in real terms, we're looking at a benchmark capital intensity of $350. The first stage of Grosvenor is slightly below that as you would have seen. The second thing I'd say is that the projects in Queensland are all longwall projects and we're taking a, what's called, a program management approach, delivering all those projects. So we would -- in other words, we're designing the longwall and associate infrastructure ones for Grosvenor and looking to repeat that then for the 4 longwalls that encompass the growth plans in Queensland. We were there, but by taking this approach, expect to see, on average, over those 4 longwalls a reduction in that average capital intensity.

We'll also look at the operatio",1873,"[indiscernible] everybody, and it's good to see you again this morning. As you can see, I'll do anything to protect the rights of our shareholders. 
I'll start by giving you the highlights of what we've achieved this year. We'll also look at the operational performance, and René will take you through the financials. And then I'll say a few words about the long term, including our growth profile and world-class exploration achievements. Over the past 5 years, Anglo American has been on a journey to become the leading global mining company. We've developed a clear strategy: We simplified our organization and our portfolio, we set strict targets and we invested in growth. Five years on, we continue our journey, and the fruits of our efforts are there for all to see: record-operating profit; delivery of 3 of our 4 major projects; robust balance sheet; the most diversified and balanced project pipeline in the industry; and world-class geological discoveries. 
Our focus has and continues to be on people and driving performance with everyone involved. Our record financial performance last year reflects the operational and business improvement foundations we have put in place. 
Total group operating profit was a record $11.1 billion, up 14%. Our underlying earnings were $6.1 billion with earnings per share at $5.06. I'm therefore pleased to announce we've raised the final dividend to $0.46 per share, and this brings the total dividend for the year to $0.74 per share. 
We have minimized the impact of events beyond our control like floods, rain or snow, input cost inflation and infrastructure constraints. 
On the growth front, our decision in 2009 to continue investing in our 4 major projects is paying off. Three projects started production on or ahead of schedule. All 3 are ramping up. Our asset optimization and supply chain initiatives will continue to create and deliver value. And we are delivering volume growth and continue to move down the cost curve.  Beyond these initiatives, we have launched a commercial excellence model. We will adopt a coordinated global marketing approach with centers in Singapore and London, and we expect this to generate significant value. 
Before we start to -- and turn to the operating performance, I want to talk about safety. As you know, safety is an absolute priority for Anglo American and for me. In 2011, 17 of our colleagues lost their lives. The fact is that 2011 safety performance at Platinum was disappointing. The Platinum team are the first to admit this, and we're working together to do something about it. Following 2 fatalities in short succession, we decided to stop all Platinum operations on the 3rd of November. I went to South Africa, joined by Neville, Norman and the team to address over 30,000 of our employees. We were also joined by trade union leaders and government safety inspectors and launched the zero harm in action initiative. It aims to bring about cultural change through targeted action and individual responsibility. We've also shown zero harm is achievable in all parts of the organization. 
Across our business units, excluding Platinum, lost-time injury frequency rate dropped by 16%, and 91% of our operations had no fatalities in 2011. No matter what the record is, though, 17 deaths are 17 too many. So we recommit ourselves to prioritize, to simplify and community -- communicate our safety programs to achieve zero harm. 
When considering our improved performance, there is one initiative that started us on the path to becoming best-in-class operators. Five years ago, we launched the asset optimization and supply chain initiatives. In 2009, we set a savings target of $2 billion by 2011. Since then, we have consistently exceeded the target. In 2011, we delivered $3.2 billion in savings, and these programs are now embedded in our operations and will deliver substantial value. 
Having exceeded our target, there is further value to be unlocked from asset optimization. We've embedded asset optimization and an operational excellence across the group. For example, best-in-class performance delivered record production in thermal and metallurgical coal open-pit mines, but there is so much more value to extract. Last year, alone, we completed 6 operational reviews and identified almost $900 million in potential value. 
Beyond our asset optimization initiatives, global supply chain delivers multiple benefits: unlocking real savings, establishing long-term partnerships and providing benefits for the communities in which we operate through local procurement. All our suppliers are required to adopt and embed our approach to safety as well as our values, effectively becoming our -- an extension of our organization. 
In Queensland, we've established a partnership with Joy [ph] to improve longwall productivity critical to tripling our metallurgical coal production by 2020. 
In 2011, we delivered 9 projects in challenging geographies, covering 4 countries and 5 commodities on or ahead of schedule. Three of our 4 projects, all low-cost, long-life, Tier 1 assets, will generate significant value. Our decision to invest through the cycle is paying off. And we are now reaping the rewards. 
Over and above our organic growth pipeline, we have delivered substantial value from recent transactions. In an industry that considers time in decades, not years, it is crucial to grow and replace production continuously, so we have always looked at opportunities to supplement our pipeline. De Beers was one of those, which we have been pursuing for some time. We're thrilled to have secured a world-class business through that deal. Similarly, in recognition of the value metallurgical coal generates, we took a closer look at Peace River Coal, and we've decided to retain and grow this business. This led us to take out the minorities, and we did that at an attractive value. 
In addition, the sale of our 24.5% interest in Anglo American Sur to Mitsubishi builds on our clear and consistent strategy of protecting and delivering value. We have done the right thing. At $22 billion on 100% basis, the minority sale of Anglo American Sur generated significant value. 
As you know, we're currently involved in a legal dispute with Cadelco over the option agreement relating to Anglo American Sur. We have said consistently that we are ready to work together to agree on a commercial solution, but it has not been possible to reach a settlement that takes into account Anglo American's strong legal position. We continue to be open to sensible negotiations conducted in good faith, but we will not be moved from defending our clear legal rights and protecting value for our shareholders, recognizing our legal rights under what is a simple contract between 2 companies and the effect of Cadelco's breach of the contract. Cadelco knew what our alternatives were in terms of selling down our holding to a third-party prior to any valid exercise of the option, and it sought to prematurely exercise the option. The strength of our legal position is beyond question. 
Now turning to our operational performance. Let's start with Iron Ore and Manganese. 2011 was a record, achieving high margins and returns. Sishen continued to operate strongly, despite being impacted by heavy rains in the first half. Kolomela was delivered on budget and 5 months ahead of schedule. Kolomela is set to deliver 4 million to 5 million tonnes in 2012, and we're pleased to hear the President of South Africa confirm the planned expansion of the iron ore export channel, removing an impediment to our growth. 
Amapa continues to be a turnaround story. Although a relatively small part of our portfolio, we achieved operating profit of $120 million in 2011 compared to just $16 million the year before. And we're also making good progress at Minas-Rio, and I'll talk about that in a few minutes. 
Turning to Metallurgical Coal. Operating profit was also a record. Production was impacted by rain in the first half, followed by an incident at Moranbah underground mine, but we've staged a strong recovery, driven by best-in-class open-pit performance with a 90% first half versus -- improvement versus the second half production increase. Phase 1 of the Grosvenor project was approved in December, and this kicks off our Moranbah metallurgical coal hub, which treats 4 sequential projects as one. Grosvenor will be a low-cost operation, leveraging existing infrastructure in our own backyard. We have plans to secure our port and rail capacity for our growth. And in December, we were awarded Preferred Respondent status for the development of a 30-million-tonne dedicated coal terminal at Abbott Point. 
Thermal Coal is another business unit to have delivered a record operating profit, despite production being impacted by rain in the first half. We were able to take advantage of the strong recovery in Transnet performance in the second half through our own operational flexibility and efficient load-out stations. Zibulo, a 6.6-million-tonne low-cost thermal coal mine, was ramped up ahead of schedule. And Cerrejon set a new production record and is progressing with an 8-million-tonne expansion. 
Moving to Copper. Operating profit was $2.5 billion. While copper prices were somewhat volatile, on average, the copper price for the year was higher. As with the industry peers, production was impacted by severe weather disruptions and grade decline. We've partially offset these impacts through asset optimization and volume growth. At Los Bronces, SAG mill throughput improved following a series of asset optimization initiatives. At Collahuasi, we're working with our partners to accelerate all expansion projects. And in Peru, we are in dialogue with all levels of government and local communities to secure permits for Quellaveco.  We are progressing, but it will take time. 
Nickel operating profit was $57 million. Production increased by 44%. Loma de Níquel delivered a 14% compound annual growth rate in production since 2009. The Barro Alto project was delivered on time and on local budget. Barro Alto surpassed all other nickel projects around the world in terms of on-time startup, quality of metal produced from the outset and world-class safety performance. Barro Alto is ramping up well. At full capacity, it will more than double our nickel production. 
Turning to Platinum. Operating profit increased to $890 million despite 81 safety stoppages at our own operations. Mogalakwena open-pit mine performed strongly. Unki produced 52,000 platinum ounces, reaching steady state 1 year ahead of schedule. The Platinum business for today is a far cry from what it was in terms of production, in terms of productivity and in terms of safety. We have seen substantial improvements, and the returns are in line with the industry. However, these returns declined in recent years and are not acceptable to us for the medium term. The platinum industry faces significant challenges whether cost inflation, whether safety stoppages or lingering concerns over European demand. As a result, we are embarking on a review to assess the optimal configuration of the Platinum portfolio, and we will do this with a single purpose in mind, maximizing shareholder value and returns through the cycle. 
And finally, Diamonds. De Beers operating profit was up 33%. Rough diamond prices were a record, up 29%, and we are optimistic about China and India continuing to drive demand growth in the medium to long term. De Beers is well positioned to capture this growth through its Forevermark and De Beers diamond Jewellery brand expansions. 
So with that now, I'll hand over to René."

Looking at the left side of the page, you will see we have the most diversified and balanced portfolio with unparalleled exposure to late-cycle development. For the first time, more than 1/2 of China's population now lives in cities. This tipping point happened in the U.K. in the 1850s and in the U.S. in the 1920s, so there is a long road of growth and development ahead. We saw this during a recent trip to China and India. While development in Chinese coastal provinces is maturing, inland provinces are at early stages of development, recording double-digit growth. This will continue to drive demand for raw materials over the coming decades. And we believe as development shifts from an investment to consumption-driven economy, the growth rate in steel will moderate. 
Growing middle classes in China and India and rising disposable incomes are driving demand for late-cycle commodities like diamonds and PGMs. In addition, medium-term replacement of infrastructure in the developed world presents further opportunities for steel. And there's no doubt in my mind, value creation will be the fruit of our diversified and balanced portfolio. 
Demand is only part of the story. Our industry continues to face tough challenges, and these include calls for higher taxes and royalties, rising capital intensity, infrastructure constraints and tighter environmental regulations. Coupled with declines in existing mines, a picture emerges of supply consistently under-delivering against market expectation and this will support prices over the medium to long term.  Because we take the long-term view, we look beyond current volatility and continue to invest in value-accretive growth.
Barro Alto, Los Bronces, Kolomela showcase our ability to build large, complex projects. We currently have 9 projects approved. These include Minas-Rio in Brazil, Grosvenor in Queensland, Collahuasi Phase 2 in Chile, Cerrejon P500 Phase 1 in Colombia and Jwaneng-Cut 8 in Botswana. And these projects are in the right commodities, at the low end of the cost curve, offering attractive returns. 
Minas-Rio is a very large and complex greenfield project. Here, we have a high-quality Tier 1 asset. It has a large resource base that's only getting bigger. It is expandable. Its capital intensity remains in line with comparable greenfield projects. And at full production, the delivered cash costs of around $50 per tonne at the -- is at the very low end of the cost curve, and we are making progress. More than 90% of the land access has been secured along the pipeline. More than 200 kilometers of the pipeline has now been laid, buried and installed. As we expected, we are encountering environmental realities such as caves. Land access and permitting within an ever-changing regulatory environment adds complexity, but we are overcoming these challenges to target first ore and chip in the second half of 2013 and within the announced 15% capital increase. We are accelerating pre-commissioning plans, engaging proactively with permitting authorities and locking in labor costs. And yes, it takes time, but we want to get it right. The project [indiscernible] value remained very robust when tested for cost and timing sensitivities. And we're still working at it, but we have the right team in place committed to making progress. 
We have the potential to double production with the delivery of almost $100 billion project pipeline, covering almost 90 projects. Our growth pipeline is the most diversified and balanced in the industry. We will continue to invest in commodities with strong fundamentals, the most attractive risk return profiles that deliver long-term returns through the cycle for our shareholders, and all of this with a backdrop of continuing growth in demand for our products. 
In the meantime, our world-class exploration team has been discovering the next generation of Tier 1 assets. Since 1999, we have made 15 major discoveries and have received international recognition for Los Sulfatos and Sakatti. Sakatti is a porphyry deposit of high-quality copper, nickel, PGMs and cobalt and forms part of our tenements, covering more than 800 square kilometers. The deposit is within a stone's throw of world-class infrastructure and sits in an existing mining region. All levels of government in Finland are very receptive to mining investments. Our drilling has yet to determine the extent of the deposits towards the north, towards the south and towards the west as well as the depth of the deposits. And we will not, however, be making announcements until we have defined the resource size. This will take about 2 to 3 years, but the development is then not automatic. As with all our projects, we will work through the relevant environmental approvals. In a world of diminishing Tier 1 assets, our world-class exploration approach truly gives us a competitive edge. 
So to sum up, we have again shown our ability to deliver value. Today, you've heard about record operating profits, strong project delivery and commercial success. We have the resources, we have the know-how and we have the people to achieve our ambition of becoming the leading global mining company. And our success is made possible by our focus on delivering a clear and consistent strategy. We invest in commodities with the strongest long-term fundamentals and with the most attractive risk return profiles. The bulk of our operations are at the low end of the cost curve. Our growth pipeline is balanced, taking advantage of all stages of the cycle. And our exploration team is making the most impressive discoveries in the industry, restocking our pipeline of Tier 1 assets. 
We have also made clear that we are prepared to take the tough decisions where assets are not delivering acceptable returns. You've seen us do this before, and we will do it again. We will become the leading global mining company, delivering real, sustainable shareholder value. 
So thank you very much for your attention. Thanks for coming. Thank heavens for raw materials because I would not be standing up here were it not be for iron ore, stainless steel and titanium. 
And now I'd be very happy to take any questions, and we'll start from London and then turn to South Africa."

It is an ever-changing, evolving licensing environment. And I think, to sum up, the key risks that we still manage there are around licensing and permitting. We have made very good progress in 2011. Basically out of the 130 license that we need, 80% of them are concluded. There's still work to be done on the others, of course. But I think the key challenge is to continue to engage very proactively with the government, with the entities that regulate these -- the permitting because there are things that come up like the caves issue that Cynthia referred to. But then to sum up, there has been very good progress around the licensing and permitting. We continue to engage very proactively with the government.

There are number of smaller projects in South Africa, and they depend on expansion of the infrastructure and then all of the other normal health warnings. Now Cynthia mentioned that the President, in his State of the Nation address last week, mentioned that there would be -- that one of the infrastructure expansion projects in South Africa would be the Sishen-Saldana export channel. And he mentioned -- well, he mentioned 2 numbers. He said it would expand from 60 to 80 and a bit later mentioned that it would expand from 60 to 100. But there's certainly, I think, it's very positive, that in the State of the Nation address, the President is mentioning infrastructure expansion and particularly on the iron ore export channel. So very positive news, and that's exactly one of the big bottlenecks that are needed to be unlocked to be able to grow in South Africa. So very positive news, indeed. And then we also announced at the half year and again at the final year results that Kumba would be seeking to work with Anglo American in Africa, and that project has started. Between myself and Peter, we are running the steering committee that's looking at expansion opportunities. We are talking to some people, have identified some projects, but that is about as much as we can say at this point in time. But that work is now underway."

So as I said earlier in my presentation, I mean, we've come a long way, and I think it's very fair to say that since 2007 or so, and I'm looking at Neville over here, I mean, we've improved our safety performance substantially. We've improved -- increased the productivity hugely, we've delivered on our production targets and we've contained costs in line with what we committed to the market between ZAR 11,000 and ZAR 12,000 per ounce, so I think that's a big achievement. Now last year, sadly, unfortunately, however you want to describe it, the industry was faced with serious safety stoppages, and the inspectors were going into our mines and not just sending down sections where there was a safety discrepancy identified by whole mines for days on end. The industry, at large, lost over 300,000 ounces. So what are we doing about this? Well, we've got some near-term quick fixes, so to speak. Neville, I'm looking at you. Neville, if you grab the microphone. We've got some near-term initiatives that we're looking at. We have spent time with the DMR to engage with them and get them to take the right approach, and I think that they're now showing signs of doing that. And we're seeing some fair treatment with respect to stoppages. And we're looking at the longer term. So coming back to your question, I mean, and I mentioned it, we're looking at the shape of the portfolio, we're looking at the size of the portfolio, we're looking at whether we should be doing more in recycling, we're looking at where do we want to leverage our asset base, where do we want to take Mogalakwena, for an example, where are we taking Unki in the future, how do we deploy our workforce, and how do we get this business back to the returns that we were seeing in 2008? That's the bottom line, Jason. We're not doing anything other than focusing on getting it right, and it may be, as I said earlier, it may be acceptable for the industry to see lower returns. Everybody's seeing the same thing. And as I also -- I said -- talked about our position on the cost curve, I mean, 2007, 2008, we had about 1/3 of our operations in the first half of the cost curve. Today, we have over 60%. So again, we've come a long way, but we need to get this to a better place so we're seeing those greater returns. So we're not -- we haven't taken the decision to do anything except focus and deliver more value in the business."

I think as Cynthia said, the model we're following has been held up by the Peruvian governments as the model they'd like to see in terms of community consultation, local representative consultation. What's really [ph] progressing with these 2 parallel but interconnected streams of work, the first of those is the dialogue table. I think that's going remarkably well. We've got 28 different stakeholders from the region, from the central governments, from all sorts of community groups. That's, I think -- that dialogue table is divided into 3 aspects: the issues around water, the issues around the environment and the issues around social contribution. We have concluded the issues around water and with the result that the communities are supportive of the water scheme that we're proposing. We're very close to concluding the area -- the part on environmental where we've looked at the various environmental issues that were a concern to the community, and I think we've satisfactorily resolved pretty much all of those. And we're now into the last phase of discussing how this project is going to contribute to the local communities. Simultaneously with that, we're working on the permitting process. I think we've made some important steps forward in terms of -- it's a multistep process. Each permit requires steps that's -- one of the changes that happened in the legislation was these steps needed to be done in series rather than in parallel, so we're busy expediting each of those steps. At this stage, both processes need to come to a conclusion for us to take this project to the final stage, which is our board approval. The technical part of the feasibility study is done. That is complete. It's really those 2 last steps that we're busy with. We're working through those as expeditiously as we can but also recognizing the fact that we intend to be a long-term investor in Peru. This isn't our only project in Peru. We've got Michiquillay as well. We've got a very extensive exploration program. And we want to make sure that we do this project right the first time and that we do have both the sort of local, the regional and the national stakeholders all on site when we do it. We have seen the consequences of projects that have stepped forward too quickly without getting everybody on site.

Feasibility complete at the end of next year, and we will be going for board approval then, if all makes sense, at the end of next year to build that terminal. The rail development is integrated with the whole terminal development. The size we're looking at isn't enough to justify dedicated track. So we are talking to Queensland Rail about expansion of the existing track, the so-called North Missing Link, which runs through Abbott Point, and initial indications from Queensland Rail are that true incremental expansion of existing track electrification, et cetera, we should -- they should be able to accommodate our required tonnages for Abbott Point. The access -- what's called the Access Undertaking in Queensland, which is the regulatory regime for construction of new track, allows us in the event that Queensland Rail don't feel able to actually fund the expansion of that track, it allows us as a producer to fund it ourselves and for Queensland Rail to manage it. So we have some certainty over the capacity and the timing, and the only question mark will be about funding. But we'll work through that as part of that Abbott Point pre-feasibility work this year."

In our communities, we’re very well respected. And I would say we are the leading mining company in Chile. Now I could -- I'm sure there are others who might argue about that, John, but I think that we have done and will continue to do all the right things in Chile. We will continue to invest in Chile. We spent $6.5 billion over the last couple of decades in Chile, and we're not going away. We're there for the long term, we've got great assets and we've got great people.

The second thing I'll say is that the projects in Queensland are all longwall projects, and we're taking a, what's called, a program management approach, delivering all those projects. So we would -- in other words, we're designing the longwall and the associate infrastructure once for Grosvenor and looking to repeat that then for the 4 longwalls that encompass the growth plans in Queensland. We would there, by taking this approach, expect to see, on average, over those 4 longwalls a reduction in that average capital intensity.

We'll also look at the operatio",1873,"[indiscernible] everybody, and it's good to see you again this morning. As you can see, I'll do anything to protect the rights of our shareholders. 
I'll start by giving you the highlights of what we've achieved this year. We'll also look at the operational performance, and René will take you through the financials. And then I'll say a few words about the long term, including our growth profile and world-class exploration achievements. Over the past 5 years, Anglo American has been on a journey to become the leading global mining company. We've developed a clear strategy: We simplified our organization and our portfolio, we set strict targets and we invested in growth. Five years on, we continue our journey, and the fruits of our efforts are there for all to see: record-operating profit; delivery of 3 of our 4 major projects; robust balance sheet; the most diversified and balanced project pipeline in the industry; and world-class geological discoveries. 
Our focus has and continues to be on people and driving performance with everyone involved. Our record financial performance last year reflects the operational and business improvement foundations we have put in place. 
Total group operating profit was a record $11.1 billion, up 14%. Our underlying earnings were $6.1 billion with earnings per share at $5.06. I'm therefore pleased to announce we've raised the final dividend to $0.46 per share, and this brings the total dividend for the year to $0.74 per share. 
We have minimized the impact of events beyond our control like floods, rain or snow, input cost inflation and infrastructure constraints. 
On the growth front, our decision in 2009 to continue investing in our 4 major projects is paying off. Three projects started production on or ahead of schedule. All 3 are ramping up. Our asset optimization and supply chain initiatives will continue to create and deliver value. And we are delivering volume growth and continue to move down the cost curve.  Beyond these initiatives, we have launched a commercial excellence model. We will adopt a coordinated global marketing approach with centers in Singapore and London, and we expect this to generate significant value. 
Before we start to -- and turn to the operating performance, I want to talk about safety. As you know, safety is an absolute priority for Anglo American and for me. In 2011, 17 of our colleagues lost their lives. The fact is that 2011 safety performance at Platinum was disappointing. The Platinum team are the first to admit this, and we're working together to do something about it. Following 2 fatalities in short succession, we decided to stop all Platinum operations on the 3rd of November. I went to South Africa, joined by Neville, Norman and the team to address over 30,000 of our employees. We were also joined by trade union leaders and government safety inspectors and launched the zero harm in action initiative. It aims to bring about cultural change through targeted action and individual responsibility. We've also shown zero harm is achievable in all parts of the organization. 
Across our business units, excluding Platinum, lost-time injury frequency rate dropped by 16%, and 91% of our operations had no fatalities in 2011. No matter what the record is, though, 17 deaths are 17 too many. So we recommit ourselves to prioritize, to simplify and community -- communicate our safety programs to achieve zero harm. 
When considering our improved performance, there is one initiative that started us on the path to becoming best-in-class operators. Five years ago, we launched the asset optimization and supply chain initiatives. In 2009, we set a savings target of $2 billion by 2011. Since then, we have consistently exceeded the target. In 2011, we delivered $3.2 billion in savings, and these programs are now embedded in our operations and will deliver substantial value. 
Having exceeded our target, there is further value to be unlocked from asset optimization. We've embedded asset optimization and an operational excellence across the group. For example, best-in-class performance delivered record production in thermal and metallurgical coal open-pit mines, but there is so much more value to extract. Last year, alone, we completed 6 operational reviews and identified almost $900 million in potential value. 
Beyond our asset optimization initiatives, global supply chain delivers multiple benefits: unlocking real savings, establishing long-term partnerships and providing benefits for the communities in which we operate through local procurement. All our suppliers are required to adopt and embed our approach to safety as well as our values, effectively becoming our -- an extension of our organization. 
In Queensland, we've established a partnership with Joy [ph] to improve longwall productivity critical to tripling our metallurgical coal production by 2020. 
In 2011, we delivered 9 projects in challenging geographies, covering 4 countries and 5 commodities on or ahead of schedule. Three of our 4 projects, all low-cost, long-life, Tier 1 assets, will generate significant value. Our decision to invest through the cycle is paying off. And we are now reaping the rewards. 
Over and above our organic growth pipeline, we have delivered substantial value from recent transactions. In an industry that considers time in decades, not years, it is crucial to grow and replace production continuously, so we have always looked at opportunities to supplement our pipeline. De Beers was one of those, which we have been pursuing for some time. We're thrilled to have secured a world-class business through that deal. Similarly, in recognition of the value metallurgical coal generates, we took a closer look at Peace River Coal, and we've decided to retain and grow this business. This led us to take out the minorities, and we did that at an attractive value. 
In addition, the sale of our 24.5% interest in Anglo American Sur to Mitsubishi builds on our clear and consistent strategy of protecting and delivering value. We have done the right thing. At $22 billion on 100% basis, the minority sale of Anglo American Sur generated significant value. 
As you know, we're currently involved in a legal dispute with Cadelco over the option agreement relating to Anglo American Sur. We have said consistently that we are ready to work together to agree on a commercial solution, but it has not been possible to reach a settlement that takes into account Anglo American's strong legal position. We continue to be open to sensible negotiations conducted in good faith, but we will not be moved from defending our clear legal rights and protecting value for our shareholders, recognizing our legal rights under what is a simple contract between 2 companies and the effect of Cadelco's breach of the contract. Cadelco knew what our alternatives were in terms of selling down our holding to a third-party prior to any valid exercise of the option, and it sought to prematurely exercise the option. The strength of our legal position is beyond question. 
Now turning to our operational performance. Let's start with Iron Ore and Manganese. 2011 was a record, achieving high margins and returns. Sishen continued to operate strongly, despite being impacted by heavy rains in the first half. Kolomela was delivered on budget and 5 months ahead of schedule. Kolomela is set to deliver 4 million to 5 million tonnes in 2012, and we're pleased to hear the President of South Africa confirm the planned expansion of the iron ore export channel, removing an impediment to our growth. 
Amapa continues to be a turnaround story. Although a relatively small part of our portfolio, we achieved operating profit of $120 million in 2011 compared to just $16 million the year before. And we're also making good progress at Minas-Rio, and I'll talk about that in a few minutes. 
Turning to Metallurgical Coal. Operating profit was also a record. Production was impacted by rain in the first half, followed by an incident at Moranbah underground mine, but we've staged a strong recovery, driven by best-in-class open-pit performance with a 90% first half versus -- improvement versus the second half production increase. Phase 1 of the Grosvenor project was approved in December, and this kicks off our Moranbah metallurgical coal hub, which treats 4 sequential projects as one. Grosvenor will be a low-cost operation, leveraging existing infrastructure in our own backyard. We have plans to secure our port and rail capacity for our growth. And in December, we were awarded Preferred Respondent status for the development of a 30-million-tonne dedicated coal terminal at Abbott Point. 
Thermal Coal is another business unit to have delivered a record operating profit, despite production being impacted by rain in the first half. We were able to take advantage of the strong recovery in Transnet performance in the second half through our own operational flexibility and efficient load-out stations. Zibulo, a 6.6-million-tonne low-cost thermal coal mine, was ramped up ahead of schedule. And Cerrejon set a new production record and is progressing with an 8-million-tonne expansion. 
Moving to Copper. Operating profit was $2.5 billion. While copper prices were somewhat volatile, on average, the copper price for the year was higher. As with the industry peers, production was impacted by severe weather disruptions and grade decline. We've partially offset these impacts through asset optimization and volume growth. At Los Bronces, SAG mill throughput improved following a series of asset optimization initiatives. At Collahuasi, we're working with our partners to accelerate all expansion projects. And in Peru, we are in dialogue with all levels of government and local communities to secure permits for Quellaveco.  We are progressing, but it will take time. 
Nickel operating profit was $57 million. Production increased by 44%. Loma de Níquel delivered a 14% compound annual growth rate in production since 2009. The Barro Alto project was delivered on time and on local budget. Barro Alto surpassed all other nickel projects around the world in terms of on-time startup, quality of metal produced from the outset and world-class safety performance. Barro Alto is ramping up well. At full capacity, it will more than double our nickel production. 
Turning to Platinum. Operating profit increased to $890 million despite 81 safety stoppages at our own operations. Mogalakwena open-pit mine performed strongly. Unki produced 52,000 platinum ounces, reaching steady state 1 year ahead of schedule. The Platinum business for today is a far cry from what it was in terms of production, in terms of productivity and in terms of safety. We have seen substantial improvements, and the returns are in line with the industry. However, these returns declined in recent years and are not acceptable to us for the medium term. The platinum industry faces significant challenges whether cost inflation, whether safety stoppages or lingering concerns over European demand. As a result, we are embarking on a review to assess the optimal configuration of the Platinum portfolio, and we will do this with a single purpose in mind, maximizing shareholder value and returns through the cycle. 
And finally, Diamonds. De Beers operating profit was up 33%. Rough diamond prices were a record, up 29%, and we are optimistic about China and India continuing to drive demand growth in the medium to long term. De Beers is well positioned to capture this growth through its Forevermark and De Beers diamond Jewellery brand expansions. 
So with that now, I'll hand over to René."

I'll now turn to the macro environment. Towards the end of 2011, there was a distinct slowdown in major emerging countries and continuing doubts over Europe's fiscal sustainability. Uncertainty is likely to persist in the short",1089,"Thank you very much, René. I'll now turn to the macro environment. Towards the end of 2011, there was a distinct slowdown in major emerging countries and continuing doubts over Europe's fiscal sustainability. Uncertainty is likely to persist in the short term. This is important, but we do not base our investment decisions on short-term drivers. And instead, our eyes are on the next decade and beyond. What is important for us is that the long-term fundamentals are sound. 
Looking at the left side of the page, you will see we have the most diversified and balanced portfolio with unparalleled exposure to late-cycle development. For the first time, more than 1/2 of China's population now lives in cities. This tipping point happened in the U.K. in the 1850s and in the U.S. in the 1920s, so there is a long road of growth and development ahead. We saw this during a recent trip to China and India. While development in Chinese coastal provinces is maturing, inland provinces are at early stages of development, recording double-digit growth. This will continue to drive demand for raw materials over the coming decades. And we believe as development shifts from an investment to consumption-driven economy, the growth rate in steel will moderate. 
Growing middle classes in China and India and rising disposable incomes are driving demand for late-cycle commodities like diamonds and PGMs. In addition, medium-term replacement of infrastructure in the developed world presents further opportunities for steel. And there's no doubt in my mind, value creation will be the fruit of our diversified and balanced portfolio. 
Demand is only part of the story. Our industry continues to face tough challenges, and these include calls for higher taxes and royalties, rising capital intensity, infrastructure constraints and tighter environmental regulations. Coupled with declines in existing mines, a picture emerges of supply consistently under-delivering against market expectation and this will support prices over the medium to long term.  Because we take the long-term view, we look beyond current volatility and continue to invest in value-accretive growth.
Barro Alto, Los Bronces, Kolomela showcase our ability to build large, complex projects. We currently have 9 projects approved. These include Minas-Rio in Brazil, Grosvenor in Queensland, Collahuasi Phase 2 in Chile, Cerrejon P500 Phase 1 in Colombia and Jwaneng-Cut 8 in Botswana. And these projects are in the right commodities, at the low end of the cost curve, offering attractive returns. 
Minas-Rio is a very large and complex greenfield project. Here, we have a high-quality Tier 1 asset. It has a large resource base that's only getting bigger. It is expandable. Its capital intensity remains in line with comparable greenfield projects. And at full production, the delivered cash costs of around $50 per tonne at the -- is at the very low end of the cost curve, and we are making progress. More than 90% of the land access has been secured along the pipeline. More than 200 kilometers of the pipeline has now been laid, buried and installed. As we expected, we are encountering environmental realities such as caves. Land access and permitting within an ever-changing regulatory environment adds complexity, but we are overcoming these challenges to target first ore and chip in the second half of 2013 and within the announced 15% capital increase. We are accelerating pre-commissioning plans, engaging proactively with permitting authorities and locking in labor costs. And yes, it takes time, but we want to get it right. The project [indiscernible] value remained very robust when tested for cost and timing sensitivities. And we're still working at it, but we have the right team in place committed to making progress. 
We have the potential to double production with the delivery of almost $100 billion project pipeline, covering almost 90 projects. Our growth pipeline is the most diversified and balanced in the industry. We will continue to invest in commodities with strong fundamentals, the most attractive risk return profiles that deliver long-term returns through the cycle for our shareholders, and all of this with a backdrop of continuing growth in demand for our products. 
In the meantime, our world-class exploration team has been discovering the next generation of Tier 1 assets. Since 1999, we have made 15 major discoveries and have received international recognition for Los Sulfatos and Sakatti. Sakatti is a porphyry deposit of high-quality copper, nickel, PGMs and cobalt and forms part of our tenements, covering more than 800 square kilometers. The deposit is within a stone's throw of world-class infrastructure and sits in an existing mining region. All levels of government in Finland are very receptive to mining investments. Our drilling has yet to determine the extent of the deposits towards the north, towards the south and towards the west as well as the depth of the deposits. And we will not, however, be making announcements until we have defined the resource size. This will take about 2 to 3 years, but the development is then not automatic. As with all our projects, we will work through the relevant environmental approvals. In a world of diminishing Tier 1 assets, our world-class exploration approach truly gives us a competitive edge. 
So to sum up, we have again shown our ability to deliver value. Today, you've heard about record operating profits, strong project delivery and commercial success. We have the resources, we have the know-how and we have the people to achieve our ambition of becoming the leading global mining company. And our success is made possible by our focus on delivering a clear and consistent strategy. We invest in commodities with the strongest long-term fundamentals and with the most attractive risk return profiles. The bulk of our operations are at the low end of the cost curve. Our growth pipeline is balanced, taking advantage of all stages of the cycle. And our exploration team is making the most impressive discoveries in the industry, restocking our pipeline of Tier 1 assets. 
We have also made clear that we are prepared to take the tough decisions where assets are not delivering acceptable returns. You've seen us do this before, and we will do it again. We will become the leading global mining company, delivering real, sustainable shareholder value. 
So thank you very much for your attention. Thanks for coming. Thank heavens for raw materials because I would not be standing up here were it not be for iron ore, stainless steel and titanium. 
And now I'd be very happy to take any questions, and we'll start from London and then turn to South Africa."

It is an ever-changing, evolving licensing environment. And I think, to sum up, the key risks that we still manage there are around licensing and permitting. We have made very good progress in 2011. Basically out of the 130 license that we need, 80% of them are concluded. There's still work to be done on the others, of course. But I think the key challenge is to continue to engage very proactively with the government, with the entities that regulate these -- the permitting because there are things that come up like the caves issue that Cynthia referred to. But then to sum up, there has been very good progress around the licensing and permitting. We continue to engage very proactively with the government.

There are number of smaller projects in South Africa, and they depend on expansion of the infrastructure and then all of the other normal health warnings. Now Cynthia mentioned that the President, in his State of the Nation address last week, mentioned that there would be -- that one of the infrastructure expansion projects in South Africa would be the Sishen-Saldana export channel. And he mentioned -- well, he mentioned 2 numbers. He said it would expand from 60 to 80 and a bit later mentioned that it would expand from 60 to 100. But there's certainly, I think, it's very positive, that in the State of the Nation address, the President is mentioning infrastructure expansion and particularly on the iron ore export channel. So very positive news, and that's exactly one of the big bottlenecks that are needed to be unlocked to be able to grow in South Africa. So very positive news, indeed. And then we also announced at the half year and again at the final year results that Kumba would be seeking to work with Anglo American in Africa, and that project has started. Between myself and Peter, we are running the steering committee that's looking at expansion opportunities. We are talking to some people, have identified some projects, but that is about as much as we can say at this point in time. But that work is now underway."

So as I said earlier in my presentation, I mean, we've come a long way, and I think it's very fair to say that since 2007 or so, and I'm looking at Neville over here, I mean, we've improved our safety performance substantially. We've improved -- increased the productivity hugely, we've delivered on our production targets and we've contained costs in line with what we committed to the market between ZAR 11,000 and ZAR 12,000 per ounce, so I think that's a big achievement. Now last year, sadly, unfortunately, however you want to describe it, the industry was faced with serious safety stoppages, and the inspectors were going into our mines and not just sending down sections where there was a safety discrepancy identified by whole mines for days on end. The industry, at large, lost over 300,000 ounces. So what are we doing about this? Well, we've got some near-term quick fixes, so to speak. Neville, I'm looking at you. Neville, if you grab the microphone. We've got some near-term initiatives that we're looking at. We have spent time with the DMR to engage with them and get them to take the right approach, and I think that they're now showing signs of doing that. And we're seeing some fair treatment with respect to stoppages. And we're looking at the longer term. So coming back to your question, I mean, and I mentioned it, we're looking at the shape of the portfolio, we're looking at the size of the portfolio, we're looking at whether we should be doing more in recycling, we're looking at where do we want to leverage our asset base, where do we want to take Mogalakwena, for an example, where are we taking Unki in the future, how do we deploy our workforce, and how do we get this business back to the returns that we were seeing in 2008? That's the bottom line, Jason. We're not doing anything other than focusing on getting it right, and it may be, as I said earlier, it may be acceptable for the industry to see lower returns. Everybody's seeing the same thing. And as I also -- I said -- talked about our position on the cost curve, I mean, 2007, 2008, we had about 1/3 of our operations in the first half of the cost curve. Today, we have over 60%. So again, we've come a long way, but we need to get this to a better place so we're seeing those greater returns. So we're not -- we haven't taken the decision to do anything except focus and deliver more value in the business."

I think as Cynthia said, the model we're following has been held up by the Peruvian governments as the model they'd like to see in terms of community consultation, local representative consultation. What's really [ph] progressing with these 2 parallel but interconnected streams of work, the first of those is the dialogue table. I think that's going remarkably well. We've got 28 different stakeholders from the region, from the central governments, from all sorts of community groups. That's, I think -- that dialogue table is divided into 3 aspects: the issues around water, the issues around the environment and the issues around social contribution. We have concluded the issues around water and with the result that the communities are supportive of the water scheme that we're proposing. We're very close to concluding the area -- the part on environmental where we've looked at the various environmental issues that were a concern to the community, and I think we've satisfactorily resolved pretty much all of those. And we're now into the last phase of discussing how this project is going to contribute to the local communities. Simultaneously with that, we're working on the permitting process. I think we've made some important steps forward in terms of -- it's a multistep process. Each permit requires steps that's -- one of the changes that happened in the legislation was these steps needed to be done in series rather than in parallel, so we're busy expediting each of those steps. At this stage, both processes need to come to a conclusion for us to take this project to the final stage, which is our board approval. The technical part of the feasibility study is done. That is complete. It's really those 2 last steps that we're busy with. We're working through those as expeditiously as we can but also recognizing the fact that we intend to be a long-term investor in Peru. This isn't our only project in Peru. We've got Michiquillay as well. We've got a very extensive exploration program. And we want to make sure that we do this project right the first time and that we do have both the sort of local, the regional and the national stakeholders all on site when we do it. We have seen the consequences of projects that have stepped forward too quickly without getting everybody on site.

The increase in Queensland is between 25 million and 30 million tonne, which is enough to justify dedicated terminal minimum economic size, but terminal is about 30 million tonne. We were granted Preferred Respondent status for development of a terminal at Abbott Point in December. At the same time, we approved, in fact, the Grosvenor project. We moved to develop a status in April of this year. So we had, in fact, anticipated granting of the Preferred Respondent rights. We started a pre-feasibility study on this terminal back in September. The first phase will be finished in March, which will allow us to go for internal approval to pay $75 million to move to developer status. So we would anticipate in the 1st week of April paying that $75 million and moving to developer status. The pre-feas will be finished by the end of this year and then feas -- we can move into feas at the end of this year. Feasibility complete at the end of next year, and we will be going for board approval then, if all makes sense, at the end of next year to build that terminal. The rail development is integrated with the whole terminal development. The size we're looking at isn't enough to justify dedicated track. So we are talking to Queensland Rail about expansion of the existing track, the so-called North Missing Link, which runs through Abbott Point, and initial indications from Queensland Rail are that true incremental expansion of existing track electrification, et cetera, we should -- they should be able to accommodate our required tonnages for Abbott Point. The access -- what's called the Access Undertaking in Queensland, which is the regulatory regime for construction of new track, allows us in the event that Queensland Rail don't feel able to actually fund the expansion of that track, it allows us as a producer to fund it ourselves and for Queensland Rail to manage it. So we have some certainty over the capacity and the timing, and the only question mark will be about funding. But we'll work through that as part of that Abbott Point pre-feasibility work this year."

That's in the real terms, obviously, so it doesn't account for the effect of timing of the project. In fact, there's going to be escalation. But in real terms, we're looking at a benchmark capital intensity of $350. The first stage of Grosvenor is slightly below that as you would have seen. The second thing I'll say is that the projects in Queensland are all longwall projects, and we're taking a, what's called, a program management approach, delivering all those projects. So we would -- in other words, we're designing the longwall and the associate infrastructure once for Grosvenor and looking to repeat that then for the 4 longwalls that encompass the growth plans in Queensland. We would there, by taking this approach, expect to see, on average, over those 4 longwalls a reduction in that average capital intensity. But at the moment, if we work off that $350 figure, we would hope and expect to see a reduction in that if we can maximize the benefit basically of delivering the same project effectively 4x."

We'll also look at the operatio",1873,"[indiscernible] everybody, and it's good to see you again this morning. As you can see, I'll do anything to protect the rights of our shareholders. 
I'll start by giving you the highlights of what we've achieved this year. We'll also look at the operational performance, and René will take you through the financials. And then I'll say a few words about the long term, including our growth profile and world-class exploration achievements. Over the past 5 years, Anglo American has been on a journey to become the leading global mining company. We've developed a clear strategy: We simplified our organization and our portfolio, we set strict targets and we invested in growth. Five years on, we continue our journey, and the fruits of our efforts are there for all to see: record-operating profit; delivery of 3 of our 4 major projects; robust balance sheet; the most diversified and balanced project pipeline in the industry; and world-class geological discoveries. 
Our focus has and continues to be on people and driving performance with everyone involved. Our record financial performance last year reflects the operational and business improvement foundations we have put in place. 
Total group operating profit was a record $11.1 billion, up 14%. Our underlying earnings were $6.1 billion with earnings per share at $5.06. I'm therefore pleased to announce we've raised the final dividend to $0.46 per share, and this brings the total dividend for the year to $0.74 per share. 
We have minimized the impact of events beyond our control like floods, rain or snow, input cost inflation and infrastructure constraints. 
On the growth front, our decision in 2009 to continue investing in our 4 major projects is paying off. Three projects started production on or ahead of schedule. All 3 are ramping up. Our asset optimization and supply chain initiatives will continue to create and deliver value. And we are delivering volume growth and continue to move down the cost curve.  Beyond these initiatives, we have launched a commercial excellence model. We will adopt a coordinated global marketing approach with centers in Singapore and London, and we expect this to generate significant value. 
Before we start to -- and turn to the operating performance, I want to talk about safety. As you know, safety is an absolute priority for Anglo American and for me. In 2011, 17 of our colleagues lost their lives. The fact is that 2011 safety performance at Platinum was disappointing. The Platinum team are the first to admit this, and we're working together to do something about it. Following 2 fatalities in short succession, we decided to stop all Platinum operations on the 3rd of November. I went to South Africa, joined by Neville, Norman and the team to address over 30,000 of our employees. We were also joined by trade union leaders and government safety inspectors and launched the zero harm in action initiative. It aims to bring about cultural change through targeted action and individual responsibility. We've also shown zero harm is achievable in all parts of the organization. 
Across our business units, excluding Platinum, lost-time injury frequency rate dropped by 16%, and 91% of our operations had no fatalities in 2011. No matter what the record is, though, 17 deaths are 17 too many. So we recommit ourselves to prioritize, to simplify and community -- communicate our safety programs to achieve zero harm. 
When considering our improved performance, there is one initiative that started us on the path to becoming best-in-class operators. Five years ago, we launched the asset optimization and supply chain initiatives. In 2009, we set a savings target of $2 billion by 2011. Since then, we have consistently exceeded the target. In 2011, we delivered $3.2 billion in savings, and these programs are now embedded in our operations and will deliver substantial value. 
Having exceeded our target, there is further value to be unlocked from asset optimization. We've embedded asset optimization and an operational excellence across the group. For example, best-in-class performance delivered record production in thermal and metallurgical coal open-pit mines, but there is so much more value to extract. Last year, alone, we completed 6 operational reviews and identified almost $900 million in potential value. 
Beyond our asset optimization initiatives, global supply chain delivers multiple benefits: unlocking real savings, establishing long-term partnerships and providing benefits for the communities in which we operate through local procurement. All our suppliers are required to adopt and embed our approach to safety as well as our values, effectively becoming our -- an extension of our organization. 
In Queensland, we've established a partnership with Joy [ph] to improve longwall productivity critical to tripling our metallurgical coal production by 2020. 
In 2011, we delivered 9 projects in challenging geographies, covering 4 countries and 5 commodities on or ahead of schedule. Three of our 4 projects, all low-cost, long-life, Tier 1 assets, will generate significant value. Our decision to invest through the cycle is paying off. And we are now reaping the rewards. 
Over and above our organic growth pipeline, we have delivered substantial value from recent transactions. In an industry that considers time in decades, not years, it is crucial to grow and replace production continuously, so we have always looked at opportunities to supplement our pipeline. De Beers was one of those, which we have been pursuing for some time. We're thrilled to have secured a world-class business through that deal. Similarly, in recognition of the value metallurgical coal generates, we took a closer look at Peace River Coal, and we've decided to retain and grow this business. This led us to take out the minorities, and we did that at an attractive value. 
In addition, the sale of our 24.5% interest in Anglo American Sur to Mitsubishi builds on our clear and consistent strategy of protecting and delivering value. We have done the right thing. At $22 billion on 100% basis, the minority sale of Anglo American Sur generated significant value. 
As you know, we're currently involved in a legal dispute with Cadelco over the option agreement relating to Anglo American Sur. We have said consistently that we are ready to work together to agree on a commercial solution, but it has not been possible to reach a settlement that takes into account Anglo American's strong legal position. We continue to be open to sensible negotiations conducted in good faith, but we will not be moved from defending our clear legal rights and protecting value for our shareholders, recognizing our legal rights under what is a simple contract between 2 companies and the effect of Cadelco's breach of the contract. Cadelco knew what our alternatives were in terms of selling down our holding to a third-party prior to any valid exercise of the option, and it sought to prematurely exercise the option. The strength of our legal position is beyond question. 
Now turning to our operational performance. Let's start with Iron Ore and Manganese. 2011 was a record, achieving high margins and returns. Sishen continued to operate strongly, despite being impacted by heavy rains in the first half. Kolomela was delivered on budget and 5 months ahead of schedule. Kolomela is set to deliver 4 million to 5 million tonnes in 2012, and we're pleased to hear the President of South Africa confirm the planned expansion of the iron ore export channel, removing an impediment to our growth. 
Amapa continues to be a turnaround story. Although a relatively small part of our portfolio, we achieved operating profit of $120 million in 2011 compared to just $16 million the year before. And we're also making good progress at Minas-Rio, and I'll talk about that in a few minutes. 
Turning to Metallurgical Coal. Operating profit was also a record. Production was impacted by rain in the first half, followed by an incident at Moranbah underground mine, but we've staged a strong recovery, driven by best-in-class open-pit performance with a 90% first half versus -- improvement versus the second half production increase. Phase 1 of the Grosvenor project was approved in December, and this kicks off our Moranbah metallurgical coal hub, which treats 4 sequential projects as one. Grosvenor will be a low-cost operation, leveraging existing infrastructure in our own backyard. We have plans to secure our port and rail capacity for our growth. And in December, we were awarded Preferred Respondent status for the development of a 30-million-tonne dedicated coal terminal at Abbott Point. 
Thermal Coal is another business unit to have delivered a record operating profit, despite production being impacted by rain in the first half. We were able to take advantage of the strong recovery in Transnet performance in the second half through our own operational flexibility and efficient load-out stations. Zibulo, a 6.6-million-tonne low-cost thermal coal mine, was ramped up ahead of schedule. And Cerrejon set a new production record and is progressing with an 8-million-tonne expansion. 
Moving to Copper. Operating profit was $2.5 billion. While copper prices were somewhat volatile, on average, the copper price for the year was higher. As with the industry peers, production was impacted by severe weather disruptions and grade decline. We've partially offset these impacts through asset optimization and volume growth. At Los Bronces, SAG mill throughput improved following a series of asset optimization initiatives. At Collahuasi, we're working with our partners to accelerate all expansion projects. And in Peru, we are in dialogue with all levels of government and local communities to secure permits for Quellaveco.  We are progressing, but it will take time. 
Nickel operating profit was $57 million. Production increased by 44%. Loma de Níquel delivered a 14% compound annual growth rate in production since 2009. The Barro Alto project was delivered on time and on local budget. Barro Alto surpassed all other nickel projects around the world in terms of on-time startup, quality of metal produced from the outset and world-class safety performance. Barro Alto is ramping up well. At full capacity, it will more than double our nickel production. 
Turning to Platinum. Operating profit increased to $890 million despite 81 safety stoppages at our own operations. Mogalakwena open-pit mine performed strongly. Unki produced 52,000 platinum ounces, reaching steady state 1 year ahead of schedule. The Platinum business for today is a far cry from what it was in terms of production, in terms of productivity and in terms of safety. We have seen substantial improvements, and the returns are in line with the industry. However, these returns declined in recent years and are not acceptable to us for the medium term. The platinum industry faces significant challenges whether cost inflation, whether safety stoppages or lingering concerns over European demand. As a result, we are embarking on a review to assess the optimal configuration of the Platinum portfolio, and we will do this with a single purpose in mind, maximizing shareholder value and returns through the cycle. 
And finally, Diamonds. De Beers operating profit was up 33%. Rough diamond prices were a record, up 29%, and we are optimistic about China and India continuing to drive demand growth in the medium to long term. De Beers is well positioned to capture this growth through its Forevermark and De Beers diamond Jewellery brand expansions. 
So with that now, I'll hand over to René."

I'll now turn to the macro environment. Towards the end of 2011, there was a distinct slowdown in major emerging countries and continuing doubts over Europe's fiscal sustainability. Uncertainty is likely to persist in the short",1089,"Thank you very much, René. I'll now turn to the macro environment. Towards the end of 2011, there was a distinct slowdown in major emerging countries and continuing doubts over Europe's fiscal sustainability. Uncertainty is likely to persist in the short term. This is important, but we do not base our investment decisions on short-term drivers. And instead, our eyes are on the next decade and beyond. What is important for us is that the long-term fundamentals are sound. 
Looking at the left side of the page, you will see we have the most diversified and balanced portfolio with unparalleled exposure to late-cycle development. For the first time, more than 1/2 of China's population now lives in cities. This tipping point happened in the U.K. in the 1850s and in the U.S. in the 1920s, so there is a long road of growth and development ahead. We saw this during a recent trip to China and India. While development in Chinese coastal provinces is maturing, inland provinces are at early stages of development, recording double-digit growth. This will continue to drive demand for raw materials over the coming decades. And we believe as development shifts from an investment to consumption-driven economy, the growth rate in steel will moderate. 
Growing middle classes in China and India and rising disposable incomes are driving demand for late-cycle commodities like diamonds and PGMs. In addition, medium-term replacement of infrastructure in the developed world presents further opportunities for steel. And there's no doubt in my mind, value creation will be the fruit of our diversified and balanced portfolio. 
Demand is only part of the story. Our industry continues to face tough challenges, and these include calls for higher taxes and royalties, rising capital intensity, infrastructure constraints and tighter environmental regulations. Coupled with declines in existing mines, a picture emerges of supply consistently under-delivering against market expectation and this will support prices over the medium to long term.  Because we take the long-term view, we look beyond current volatility and continue to invest in value-accretive growth.
Barro Alto, Los Bronces, Kolomela showcase our ability to build large, complex projects. We currently have 9 projects approved. These include Minas-Rio in Brazil, Grosvenor in Queensland, Collahuasi Phase 2 in Chile, Cerrejon P500 Phase 1 in Colombia and Jwaneng-Cut 8 in Botswana. And these projects are in the right commodities, at the low end of the cost curve, offering attractive returns. 
Minas-Rio is a very large and complex greenfield project. Here, we have a high-quality Tier 1 asset. It has a large resource base that's only getting bigger. It is expandable. Its capital intensity remains in line with comparable greenfield projects. And at full production, the delivered cash costs of around $50 per tonne at the -- is at the very low end of the cost curve, and we are making progress. More than 90% of the land access has been secured along the pipeline. More than 200 kilometers of the pipeline has now been laid, buried and installed. As we expected, we are encountering environmental realities such as caves. Land access and permitting within an ever-changing regulatory environment adds complexity, but we are overcoming these challenges to target first ore and chip in the second half of 2013 and within the announced 15% capital increase. We are accelerating pre-commissioning plans, engaging proactively with permitting authorities and locking in labor costs. And yes, it takes time, but we want to get it right. The project [indiscernible] value remained very robust when tested for cost and timing sensitivities. And we're still working at it, but we have the right team in place committed to making progress. 
We have the potential to double production with the delivery of almost $100 billion project pipeline, covering almost 90 projects. Our growth pipeline is the most diversified and balanced in the industry. We will continue to invest in commodities with strong fundamentals, the most attractive risk return profiles that deliver long-term returns through the cycle for our shareholders, and all of this with a backdrop of continuing growth in demand for our products. 
In the meantime, our world-class exploration team has been discovering the next generation of Tier 1 assets. Since 1999, we have made 15 major discoveries and have received international recognition for Los Sulfatos and Sakatti. Sakatti is a porphyry deposit of high-quality copper, nickel, PGMs and cobalt and forms part of our tenements, covering more than 800 square kilometers. The deposit is within a stone's throw of world-class infrastructure and sits in an existing mining region. All levels of government in Finland are very receptive to mining investments. Our drilling has yet to determine the extent of the deposits towards the north, towards the south and towards the west as well as the depth of the deposits. And we will not, however, be making announcements until we have defined the resource size. This will take about 2 to 3 years, but the development is then not automatic. As with all our projects, we will work through the relevant environmental approvals. In a world of diminishing Tier 1 assets, our world-class exploration approach truly gives us a competitive edge. 
So to sum up, we have again shown our ability to deliver value. Today, you've heard about record operating profits, strong project delivery and commercial success. We have the resources, we have the know-how and we have the people to achieve our ambition of becoming the leading global mining company. And our success is made possible by our focus on delivering a clear and consistent strategy. We invest in commodities with the strongest long-term fundamentals and with the most attractive risk return profiles. The bulk of our operations are at the low end of the cost curve. Our growth pipeline is balanced, taking advantage of all stages of the cycle. And our exploration team is making the most impressive discoveries in the industry, restocking our pipeline of Tier 1 assets. 
We have also made clear that we are prepared to take the tough decisions where assets are not delivering acceptable returns. You've seen us do this before, and we will do it again. We will become the leading global mining company, delivering real, sustainable shareholder value. 
So thank you very much for your attention. Thanks for coming. Thank heavens for raw materials because I would not be standing up here were it not be for iron ore, stainless steel and titanium. 
And now I'd be very happy to take any questions, and we'll start from London and then turn to South Africa."

Yes, so I'll just briefly mention that we have, now consistently over the last few years, mentioned that we will deliver first the jig plant, which was a 13-million-tonne expansion, then the Kolomela plant. And then above that, there was still a potential of about another 20 million tonnes above then the 50 million tonnes. That still remains on track. There are number of smaller projects in South Africa, and they depend on expansion of the infrastructure and then all of the other normal health warnings. Now Cynthia mentioned that the President, in his State of the Nation address last week, mentioned that there would be -- that one of the infrastructure expansion projects in South Africa would be the Sishen-Saldana export channel. And he mentioned -- well, he mentioned 2 numbers. He said it would expand from 60 to 80 and a bit later mentioned that it would expand from 60 to 100. But there's certainly, I think, it's very positive, that in the State of the Nation address, the President is mentioning infrastructure expansion and particularly on the iron ore export channel. So very positive news, and that's exactly one of the big bottlenecks that are needed to be unlocked to be able to grow in South Africa. So very positive news, indeed. And then we also announced at the half year and again at the final year results that Kumba would be seeking to work with Anglo American in Africa, and that project has started. Between myself and Peter, we are running the steering committee that's looking at expansion opportunities. We are talking to some people, have identified some projects, but that is about as much as we can say at this point in time. But that work is now underway."

So as I said earlier in my presentation, I mean, we've come a long way, and I think it's very fair to say that since 2007 or so, and I'm looking at Neville over here, I mean, we've improved our safety performance substantially. We've improved -- increased the productivity hugely, we've delivered on our production targets and we've contained costs in line with what we committed to the market between ZAR 11,000 and ZAR 12,000 per ounce, so I think that's a big achievement. Now last year, sadly, unfortunately, however you want to describe it, the industry was faced with serious safety stoppages, and the inspectors were going into our mines and not just sending down sections where there was a safety discrepancy identified by whole mines for days on end. The industry, at large, lost over 300,000 ounces. So what are we doing about this? Well, we've got some near-term quick fixes, so to speak. Neville, I'm looking at you. Neville, if you grab the microphone. We've got some near-term initiatives that we're looking at. We have spent time with the DMR to engage with them and get them to take the right approach, and I think that they're now showing signs of doing that. And we're seeing some fair treatment with respect to stoppages. And we're looking at the longer term. So coming back to your question, I mean, and I mentioned it, we're looking at the shape of the portfolio, we're looking at the size of the portfolio, we're looking at whether we should be doing more in recycling, we're looking at where do we want to leverage our asset base, where do we want to take Mogalakwena, for an example, where are we taking Unki in the future, how do we deploy our workforce, and how do we get this business back to the returns that we were seeing in 2008? That's the bottom line, Jason. We're not doing anything other than focusing on getting it right, and it may be, as I said earlier, it may be acceptable for the industry to see lower returns. Everybody's seeing the same thing. And as I also -- I said -- talked about our position on the cost curve, I mean, 2007, 2008, we had about 1/3 of our operations in the first half of the cost curve. Today, we have over 60%. So again, we've come a long way, but we need to get this to a better place so we're seeing those greater returns. So we're not -- we haven't taken the decision to do anything except focus and deliver more value in the business."

I think as Cynthia said, the model we're following has been held up by the Peruvian governments as the model they'd like to see in terms of community consultation, local representative consultation. What's really [ph] progressing with these 2 parallel but interconnected streams of work, the first of those is the dialogue table. I think that's going remarkably well. We've got 28 different stakeholders from the region, from the central governments, from all sorts of community groups. That's, I think -- that dialogue table is divided into 3 aspects: the issues around water, the issues around the environment and the issues around social contribution. We have concluded the issues around water and with the result that the communities are supportive of the water scheme that we're proposing. We're very close to concluding the area -- the part on environmental where we've looked at the various environmental issues that were a concern to the community, and I think we've satisfactorily resolved pretty much all of those. And we're now into the last phase of discussing how this project is going to contribute to the local communities. Simultaneously with that, we're working on the permitting process. I think we've made some important steps forward in terms of -- it's a multistep process. Each permit requires steps that's -- one of the changes that happened in the legislation was these steps needed to be done in series rather than in parallel, so we're busy expediting each of those steps. At this stage, both processes need to come to a conclusion for us to take this project to the final stage, which is our board approval. The technical part of the feasibility study is done. That is complete. It's really those 2 last steps that we're busy with. We're working through those as expeditiously as we can but also recognizing the fact that we intend to be a long-term investor in Peru. This isn't our only project in Peru. We've got Michiquillay as well. We've got a very extensive exploration program. And we want to make sure that we do this project right the first time and that we do have both the sort of local, the regional and the national stakeholders all on site when we do it. We have seen the consequences of projects that have stepped forward too quickly without getting everybody on site. And in the long term, we believe that actually costs us more than it does to do it right the first time."

The increase in Queensland is between 25 million and 30 million tonne, which is enough to justify dedicated terminal minimum economic size, but terminal is about 30 million tonne. We were granted Preferred Respondent status for development of a terminal at Abbott Point in December. At the same time, we approved, in fact, the Grosvenor project. We moved to develop a status in April of this year. So we had, in fact, anticipated granting of the Preferred Respondent rights. We started a pre-feasibility study on this terminal back in September. The first phase will be finished in March, which will allow us to go for internal approval to pay $75 million to move to developer status. So we would anticipate in the 1st week of April paying that $75 million and moving to developer status. The pre-feas will be finished by the end of this year and then feas -- we can move into feas at the end of this year. Feasibility complete at the end of next year, and we will be going for board approval then, if all makes sense, at the end of next year to build that terminal. The rail development is integrated with the whole terminal development. The size we're looking at isn't enough to justify dedicated track. So we are talking to Queensland Rail about expansion of the existing track, the so-called North Missing Link, which runs through Abbott Point, and initial indications from Queensland Rail are that true incremental expansion of existing track electrification, et cetera, we should -- they should be able to accommodate our required tonnages for Abbott Point. The access -- what's called the Access Undertaking in Queensland, which is the regulatory regime for construction of new track, allows us in the event that Queensland Rail don't feel able to actually fund the expansion of that track, it allows us as a producer to fund it ourselves and for Queensland Rail to manage it. So we have some certainty over the capacity and the timing, and the only question mark will be about funding. But we'll work through that as part of that Abbott Point pre-feasibility work this year."

That's in the real terms, obviously, so it doesn't account for the effect of timing of the project. In fact, there's going to be escalation. But in real terms, we're looking at a benchmark capital intensity of $350. The first stage of Grosvenor is slightly below that as you would have seen. The second thing I'll say is that the projects in Queensland are all longwall projects, and we're taking a, what's called, a program management approach, delivering all those projects. So we would -- in other words, we're designing the longwall and the associate infrastructure once for Grosvenor and looking to repeat that then for the 4 longwalls that encompass the growth plans in Queensland. We would there, by taking this approach, expect to see, on average, over those 4 longwalls a reduction in that average capital intensity.

We'll also look at the operatio",1873,"[indiscernible] everybody, and it's good to see you again this morning. As you can see, I'll do anything to protect the rights of our shareholders. 
I'll start by giving you the highlights of what we've achieved this year. We'll also look at the operational performance, and René will take you through the financials. And then I'll say a few words about the long term, including our growth profile and world-class exploration achievements. Over the past 5 years, Anglo American has been on a journey to become the leading global mining company. We've developed a clear strategy: We simplified our organization and our portfolio, we set strict targets and we invested in growth. Five years on, we continue our journey, and the fruits of our efforts are there for all to see: record-operating profit; delivery of 3 of our 4 major projects; robust balance sheet; the most diversified and balanced project pipeline in the industry; and world-class geological discoveries. 
Our focus has and continues to be on people and driving performance with everyone involved. Our record financial performance last year reflects the operational and business improvement foundations we have put in place. 
Total group operating profit was a record $11.1 billion, up 14%. Our underlying earnings were $6.1 billion with earnings per share at $5.06. I'm therefore pleased to announce we've raised the final dividend to $0.46 per share, and this brings the total dividend for the year to $0.74 per share. 
We have minimized the impact of events beyond our control like floods, rain or snow, input cost inflation and infrastructure constraints. 
On the growth front, our decision in 2009 to continue investing in our 4 major projects is paying off. Three projects started production on or ahead of schedule. All 3 are ramping up. Our asset optimization and supply chain initiatives will continue to create and deliver value. And we are delivering volume growth and continue to move down the cost curve.  Beyond these initiatives, we have launched a commercial excellence model. We will adopt a coordinated global marketing approach with centers in Singapore and London, and we expect this to generate significant value. 
Before we start to -- and turn to the operating performance, I want to talk about safety. As you know, safety is an absolute priority for Anglo American and for me. In 2011, 17 of our colleagues lost their lives. The fact is that 2011 safety performance at Platinum was disappointing. The Platinum team are the first to admit this, and we're working together to do something about it. Following 2 fatalities in short succession, we decided to stop all Platinum operations on the 3rd of November. I went to South Africa, joined by Neville, Norman and the team to address over 30,000 of our employees. We were also joined by trade union leaders and government safety inspectors and launched the zero harm in action initiative. It aims to bring about cultural change through targeted action and individual responsibility. We've also shown zero harm is achievable in all parts of the organization. 
Across our business units, excluding Platinum, lost-time injury frequency rate dropped by 16%, and 91% of our operations had no fatalities in 2011. No matter what the record is, though, 17 deaths are 17 too many. So we recommit ourselves to prioritize, to simplify and community -- communicate our safety programs to achieve zero harm. 
When considering our improved performance, there is one initiative that started us on the path to becoming best-in-class operators. Five years ago, we launched the asset optimization and supply chain initiatives. In 2009, we set a savings target of $2 billion by 2011. Since then, we have consistently exceeded the target. In 2011, we delivered $3.2 billion in savings, and these programs are now embedded in our operations and will deliver substantial value. 
Having exceeded our target, there is further value to be unlocked from asset optimization. We've embedded asset optimization and an operational excellence across the group. For example, best-in-class performance delivered record production in thermal and metallurgical coal open-pit mines, but there is so much more value to extract. Last year, alone, we completed 6 operational reviews and identified almost $900 million in potential value. 
Beyond our asset optimization initiatives, global supply chain delivers multiple benefits: unlocking real savings, establishing long-term partnerships and providing benefits for the communities in which we operate through local procurement. All our suppliers are required to adopt and embed our approach to safety as well as our values, effectively becoming our -- an extension of our organization. 
In Queensland, we've established a partnership with Joy [ph] to improve longwall productivity critical to tripling our metallurgical coal production by 2020. 
In 2011, we delivered 9 projects in challenging geographies, covering 4 countries and 5 commodities on or ahead of schedule. Three of our 4 projects, all low-cost, long-life, Tier 1 assets, will generate significant value. Our decision to invest through the cycle is paying off. And we are now reaping the rewards. 
Over and above our organic growth pipeline, we have delivered substantial value from recent transactions. In an industry that considers time in decades, not years, it is crucial to grow and replace production continuously, so we have always looked at opportunities to supplement our pipeline. De Beers was one of those, which we have been pursuing for some time. We're thrilled to have secured a world-class business through that deal. Similarly, in recognition of the value metallurgical coal generates, we took a closer look at Peace River Coal, and we've decided to retain and grow this business. This led us to take out the minorities, and we did that at an attractive value. 
In addition, the sale of our 24.5% interest in Anglo American Sur to Mitsubishi builds on our clear and consistent strategy of protecting and delivering value. We have done the right thing. At $22 billion on 100% basis, the minority sale of Anglo American Sur generated significant value. 
As you know, we're currently involved in a legal dispute with Cadelco over the option agreement relating to Anglo American Sur. We have said consistently that we are ready to work together to agree on a commercial solution, but it has not been possible to reach a settlement that takes into account Anglo American's strong legal position. We continue to be open to sensible negotiations conducted in good faith, but we will not be moved from defending our clear legal rights and protecting value for our shareholders, recognizing our legal rights under what is a simple contract between 2 companies and the effect of Cadelco's breach of the contract. Cadelco knew what our alternatives were in terms of selling down our holding to a third-party prior to any valid exercise of the option, and it sought to prematurely exercise the option. The strength of our legal position is beyond question. 
Now turning to our operational performance. Let's start with Iron Ore and Manganese. 2011 was a record, achieving high margins and returns. Sishen continued to operate strongly, despite being impacted by heavy rains in the first half. Kolomela was delivered on budget and 5 months ahead of schedule. Kolomela is set to deliver 4 million to 5 million tonnes in 2012, and we're pleased to hear the President of South Africa confirm the planned expansion of the iron ore export channel, removing an impediment to our growth. 
Amapa continues to be a turnaround story. Although a relatively small part of our portfolio, we achieved operating profit of $120 million in 2011 compared to just $16 million the year before. And we're also making good progress at Minas-Rio, and I'll talk about that in a few minutes. 
Turning to Metallurgical Coal. Operating profit was also a record. Production was impacted by rain in the first half, followed by an incident at Moranbah underground mine, but we've staged a strong recovery, driven by best-in-class open-pit performance with a 90% first half versus -- improvement versus the second half production increase. Phase 1 of the Grosvenor project was approved in December, and this kicks off our Moranbah metallurgical coal hub, which treats 4 sequential projects as one. Grosvenor will be a low-cost operation, leveraging existing infrastructure in our own backyard. We have plans to secure our port and rail capacity for our growth. And in December, we were awarded Preferred Respondent status for the development of a 30-million-tonne dedicated coal terminal at Abbott Point. 
Thermal Coal is another business unit to have delivered a record operating profit, despite production being impacted by rain in the first half. We were able to take advantage of the strong recovery in Transnet performance in the second half through our own operational flexibility and efficient load-out stations. Zibulo, a 6.6-million-tonne low-cost thermal coal mine, was ramped up ahead of schedule. And Cerrejon set a new production record and is progressing with an 8-million-tonne expansion. 
Moving to Copper. Operating profit was $2.5 billion. While copper prices were somewhat volatile, on average, the copper price for the year was higher. As with the industry peers, production was impacted by severe weather disruptions and grade decline. We've partially offset these impacts through asset optimization and volume growth. At Los Bronces, SAG mill throughput improved following a series of asset optimization initiatives. At Collahuasi, we're working with our partners to accelerate all expansion projects. And in Peru, we are in dialogue with all levels of government and local communities to secure permits for Quellaveco.  We are progressing, but it will take time. 
Nickel operating profit was $57 million. Production increased by 44%. Loma de Níquel delivered a 14% compound annual growth rate in production since 2009. The Barro Alto project was delivered on time and on local budget. Barro Alto surpassed all other nickel projects around the world in terms of on-time startup, quality of metal produced from the outset and world-class safety performance. Barro Alto is ramping up well. At full capacity, it will more than double our nickel production. 
Turning to Platinum. Operating profit increased to $890 million despite 81 safety stoppages at our own operations. Mogalakwena open-pit mine performed strongly. Unki produced 52,000 platinum ounces, reaching steady state 1 year ahead of schedule. The Platinum business for today is a far cry from what it was in terms of production, in terms of productivity and in terms of safety. We have seen substantial improvements, and the returns are in line with the industry. However, these returns declined in recent years and are not acceptable to us for the medium term. The platinum industry faces significant challenges whether cost inflation, whether safety stoppages or lingering concerns over European demand. As a result, we are embarking on a review to assess the optimal configuration of the Platinum portfolio, and we will do this with a single purpose in mind, maximizing shareholder value and returns through the cycle. 
And finally, Diamonds. De Beers operating profit was up 33%. Rough diamond prices were a record, up 29%, and we are optimistic about China and India continuing to drive demand growth in the medium to long term. De Beers is well positioned to capture this growth through its Forevermark and De Beers diamond Jewellery brand expansions. 
So with that now, I'll hand over to René."

Very pleased to report a record operating profit at $11.1 billion, driven by a strong performance on the work site, Kumba, Metallurgical Coal and Thermal Coal. 
Underlying earnings up 23%. We got the benefit of a lower tax rate at 23.3% as a result of favorable outcome of some outstanding issue with various tax authorities. For 2012, we are expecting a tax rate of 31%. 
CapEx, up to $5.8 billion, as we were completing the 3 projects that Cynthia referred to: Los Bronces expansion, Barro Alto and Kolomela. 
Net debt down to $1.4 billion, but if you incorporate the impact of the De Beers transaction both from a liquidity and debt standpoint as well as a capital gain tax, which will be payable in the first quarter with a mix associated with the Mitsubishi transaction, the debt level at end of December, on a pro forma basis, is $9 billion. 
Turning to the operating profit waterfall. You see the price variance, $3.8 billion, mostly in the first half of the year, prominently in Iron Ore and Metallurgical Coal, respectively, $900 million for Met Coal and $1.3 billion for Iron Ore. 
FX, a negative variance of $149 million with a positive variance in the second half of 2011, following the declines around somewhat offsetting the negative variance of $527 million in the first half of 2011. 
Inflation, $585 million negative with inflation ranging from 3.3% in Chile to 5% in South Africa. 
Volume negative variance of $140 million. Limited benefit of the commissioning of the 3 projects that Cynthia mentioned. We'll get the full benefit in 2012. 2011 negative impact from a volume standpoint of the flooding in Queensland, which impacted the production of Metallurgical Coal in Australia. 
Cash cost, negative $1.2 billion, an increase of 8%. I will cover that in more details in my presentation. 
Associate, an improvement of $175 million with De Beers contributing $659 million in 2011. And then you see the impact of the divestment at the operating profit level of Scaw International and the zinc business at end of 2010 and early 2011. 
Turning to the price variance. First, PGM, Copper and Nickel. On the Platinum side, despite the fluctuation in U.S. dollar, you see that the basket price in long terms has been pretty stable, slightly above ZAR 19,000 from the second half of 2012, despite the decline of platinum in U.S. dollar. 
Copper, average price realized at $3.78 versus an average LME price of $4. You see the impact of the mark-to-market adjustment. We had a positive impact in 2010, $195 million, and a negative impact in 2011 of $278 million. At end of December, we had 138,000 tonnes of copper, which were provisionally priced at $3.45. I'd like to highlight the fact that on the back of expansion at Los Bronces, that will increase the volatility going forward as we will have larger volume provisioning price at the end of each period. 
Turning to the bulk side. On the Iron Ore side first, we have seen some positive change in term of pricing mechanisms. In the last quarter of 2011, although Japanese and Korean customers remain on the quarterly [indiscernible] benchmark, Chinese customers and probably around 75% of European customers had moved either to mostly benchmark or current quarter benchmark. 
On the Metallurgical Coal side, we have moved to a quarterly benchmark. And over the last 4 quarters, we have outperformed either the spot market or the mostly benchmark. For the current quarter as you know, we have settled at $235 a tonne for hard coking coal, and we are currently negotiating for the following quarter. 
Turning to volume variance. Platinum sales up 3% at 2.6 million ounces despite the decline in production that Cynthia mentioned. Our guidance for 2012 is between 2.5 million and 2.6 million ounces. On Iron Ore, we were able also to maintain the level of export sales despite a 6% decline of production at Sishen, mostly associated with some issue at the DMS plant. Copper, down 2% as a result of the weather issue at Collahuasi and lower grade. Nickel, we had the benefit of the commissioning of -- at Barro Alto, but also an improvement at Loma de Níquel. Met Coal, decline of production, mostly in the first half of 2011 due to the flooding in Queensland with a very strong recovery in the second half of 2011, especially for our open-cast operation. 
Turning to cash costs. We continue to face sustainable inflationary pressure, primarily around wage and electricity in South Africa and Chile. If you normalize the level of production for the weather event, whether it's in Queensland, at Collahuasi, at Sishen and for the non-safe -- the non-fatality safety stoppage impacting in Platinum, the wage -- the inflationary pressure was around 5%. 
In 2012, we received the benefit of a reversal of power costs in Chile and the benefit of higher production, and we expect this number to be below 5%, between 3% and 4%. 
Turning to CapEx and net debt. $5.8 billion CapEx in 2011. You will notice the increase in stay-in-business CapEx, mostly associated with the renewal and the expansion of the fleet at the Sishen due to the higher west stripping activity as well as the development program for our longwall in Australia. 
For 2012, we are projecting $7 billion CapEx. With a ramp-up at Minas-Rio, we will spend $2.1 billion CapEx in 2012. So far, we have spent $2.2 billion. We have also, as you know, approved the Grosvenor project in Australia. That's a $1.7 billion coking coal project, and we will spend $0.5 billion in 2012. We expect this level of stay-in-business CapEx to remain around this level of $2.4 billion. 
Net debt, $1.4 billion at end of December. And you see the breakdown of the adjustment that I mentioned earlier with the pro forma net debt level of $9 billion at end of December. 
Thank you. Over to you, Cynthia."
409115,153951128,266969,"Anglo American plc, 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2012",2012-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thank you very much, René. I'll now turn to the macro environment. Towards the end of 2011, there was a distinct slowdown in major emerging countries and continuing doubts over Europe's fiscal sustainability. Uncertainty is likely to persist in the short",1089,"Thank you very much, René. I'll now turn to the macro environment. Towards the end of 2011, there was a distinct slowdown in major emerging countries and continuing doubts over Europe's fiscal sustainability. Uncertainty is likely to persist in the short term. This is important, but we do not base our investment decisions on short-term drivers. And instead, our eyes are on the next decade and beyond. What is important for us is that the long-term fundamentals are sound. 
Looking at the left side of the page, you will see we have the most diversified and balanced portfolio with unparalleled exposure to late-cycle development. For the first time, more than 1/2 of China's population now lives in cities. This tipping point happened in the U.K. in the 1850s and in the U.S. in the 1920s, so there is a long road of growth and development ahead. We saw this during a recent trip to China and India. While development in Chinese coastal provinces is maturing, inland provinces are at early stages of development, recording double-digit growth. This will continue to drive demand for raw materials over the coming decades. And we believe as development shifts from an investment to consumption-driven economy, the growth rate in steel will moderate. 
Growing middle classes in China and India and rising disposable incomes are driving demand for late-cycle commodities like diamonds and PGMs. In addition, medium-term replacement of infrastructure in the developed world presents further opportunities for steel. And there's no doubt in my mind, value creation will be the fruit of our diversified and balanced portfolio. 
Demand is only part of the story. Our industry continues to face tough challenges, and these include calls for higher taxes and royalties, rising capital intensity, infrastructure constraints and tighter environmental regulations. Coupled with declines in existing mines, a picture emerges of supply consistently under-delivering against market expectation and this will support prices over the medium to long term.  Because we take the long-term view, we look beyond current volatility and continue to invest in value-accretive growth.
Barro Alto, Los Bronces, Kolomela showcase our ability to build large, complex projects. We currently have 9 projects approved. These include Minas-Rio in Brazil, Grosvenor in Queensland, Collahuasi Phase 2 in Chile, Cerrejon P500 Phase 1 in Colombia and Jwaneng-Cut 8 in Botswana. And these projects are in the right commodities, at the low end of the cost curve, offering attractive returns. 
Minas-Rio is a very large and complex greenfield project. Here, we have a high-quality Tier 1 asset. It has a large resource base that's only getting bigger. It is expandable. Its capital intensity remains in line with comparable greenfield projects. And at full production, the delivered cash costs of around $50 per tonne at the -- is at the very low end of the cost curve, and we are making progress. More than 90% of the land access has been secured along the pipeline. More than 200 kilometers of the pipeline has now been laid, buried and installed. As we expected, we are encountering environmental realities such as caves. Land access and permitting within an ever-changing regulatory environment adds complexity, but we are overcoming these challenges to target first ore and chip in the second half of 2013 and within the announced 15% capital increase. We are accelerating pre-commissioning plans, engaging proactively with permitting authorities and locking in labor costs. And yes, it takes time, but we want to get it right. The project [indiscernible] value remained very robust when tested for cost and timing sensitivities. And we're still working at it, but we have the right team in place committed to making progress. 
We have the potential to double production with the delivery of almost $100 billion project pipeline, covering almost 90 projects. Our growth pipeline is the most diversified and balanced in the industry. We will continue to invest in commodities with strong fundamentals, the most attractive risk return profiles that deliver long-term returns through the cycle for our shareholders, and all of this with a backdrop of continuing growth in demand for our products. 
In the meantime, our world-class exploration team has been discovering the next generation of Tier 1 assets. Since 1999, we have made 15 major discoveries and have received international recognition for Los Sulfatos and Sakatti. Sakatti is a porphyry deposit of high-quality copper, nickel, PGMs and cobalt and forms part of our tenements, covering more than 800 square kilometers. The deposit is within a stone's throw of world-class infrastructure and sits in an existing mining region. All levels of government in Finland are very receptive to mining investments. Our drilling has yet to determine the extent of the deposits towards the north, towards the south and towards the west as well as the depth of the deposits. And we will not, however, be making announcements until we have defined the resource size. This will take about 2 to 3 years, but the development is then not automatic. As with all our projects, we will work through the relevant environmental approvals. In a world of diminishing Tier 1 assets, our world-class exploration approach truly gives us a competitive edge. 
So to sum up, we have again shown our ability to deliver value. Today, you've heard about record operating profits, strong project delivery and commercial success. We have the resources, we have the know-how and we have the people to achieve our ambition of becoming the leading global mining company. And our success is made possible by our focus on delivering a clear and consistent strategy. We invest in commodities with the strongest long-term fundamentals and with the most attractive risk return profiles. The bulk of our operations are at the low end of the cost curve. Our growth pipeline is balanced, taking advantage of all stages of the cycle. And our exploration team is making the most impressive discoveries in the industry, restocking our pipeline of Tier 1 assets. 
We have also made clear that we are prepared to take the tough decisions where assets are not delivering acceptable returns. You've seen us do this before, and we will do it again. We will become the leading global mining company, delivering real, sustainable shareholder value. 
So thank you very much for your attention. Thanks for coming. Thank heavens for raw materials because I would not be standing up here were it not be for iron ore, stainless steel and titanium. 
And now I'd be very happy to take any questions, and we'll start from London and then turn to South Africa."

It is an ever-changing, evolving licensing environment. And I think, to sum up, the key risks that we still manage there are around licensing and permitting. We have made very good progress in 2011. Basically out of the 130 license that we need, 80% of them are concluded. There's still work to be done on the others, of course. But I think the key challenge is to continue to engage very proactively with the government, with the entities that regulate these -- the permitting because there are things that come up like the caves issue that Cynthia referred to. But then to sum up, there has been very good progress around the licensing and permitting. We continue to engage very proactively with the government. We have the right people in place, and we're very confident that we're going to continue to manage those."

Yes, so I'll just briefly mention that we have, now consistently over the last few years, mentioned that we will deliver first the jig plant, which was a 13-million-tonne expansion, then the Kolomela plant. And then above that, there was still a potential of about another 20 million tonnes above then the 50 million tonnes. That still remains on track. There are number of smaller projects in South Africa, and they depend on expansion of the infrastructure and then all of the other normal health warnings. Now Cynthia mentioned that the President, in his State of the Nation address last week, mentioned that there would be -- that one of the infrastructure expansion projects in South Africa would be the Sishen-Saldana export channel. And he mentioned -- well, he mentioned 2 numbers. He said it would expand from 60 to 80 and a bit later mentioned that it would expand from 60 to 100. But there's certainly, I think, it's very positive, that in the State of the Nation address, the President is mentioning infrastructure expansion and particularly on the iron ore export channel. So very positive news, and that's exactly one of the big bottlenecks that are needed to be unlocked to be able to grow in South Africa. So very positive news, indeed. And then we also announced at the half year and again at the final year results that Kumba would be seeking to work with Anglo American in Africa, and that project has started. Between myself and Peter, we are running the steering committee that's looking at expansion opportunities. We are talking to some people, have identified some projects, but that is about as much as we can say at this point in time. But that work is now underway."

So as I said earlier in my presentation, I mean, we've come a long way, and I think it's very fair to say that since 2007 or so, and I'm looking at Neville over here, I mean, we've improved our safety performance substantially. We've improved -- increased the productivity hugely, we've delivered on our production targets and we've contained costs in line with what we committed to the market between ZAR 11,000 and ZAR 12,000 per ounce, so I think that's a big achievement. Now last year, sadly, unfortunately, however you want to describe it, the industry was faced with serious safety stoppages, and the inspectors were going into our mines and not just sending down sections where there was a safety discrepancy identified by whole mines for days on end. The industry, at large, lost over 300,000 ounces. So what are we doing about this? Well, we've got some near-term quick fixes, so to speak. Neville, I'm looking at you. Neville, if you grab the microphone. We've got some near-term initiatives that we're looking at. We have spent time with the DMR to engage with them and get them to take the right approach, and I think that they're now showing signs of doing that. And we're seeing some fair treatment with respect to stoppages. And we're looking at the longer term. So coming back to your question, I mean, and I mentioned it, we're looking at the shape of the portfolio, we're looking at the size of the portfolio, we're looking at whether we should be doing more in recycling, we're looking at where do we want to leverage our asset base, where do we want to take Mogalakwena, for an example, where are we taking Unki in the future, how do we deploy our workforce, and how do we get this business back to the returns that we were seeing in 2008? That's the bottom line, Jason. We're not doing anything other than focusing on getting it right, and it may be, as I said earlier, it may be acceptable for the industry to see lower returns. Everybody's seeing the same thing. And as I also -- I said -- talked about our position on the cost curve, I mean, 2007, 2008, we had about 1/3 of our operations in the first half of the cost curve. Today, we have over 60%. So again, we've come a long way, but we need to get this to a better place so we're seeing those greater returns. So we're not -- we haven't taken the decision to do anything except focus and deliver more value in the business."

I think as Cynthia said, the model we're following has been held up by the Peruvian governments as the model they'd like to see in terms of community consultation, local representative consultation. What's really [ph] progressing with these 2 parallel but interconnected streams of work, the first of those is the dialogue table. I think that's going remarkably well. We've got 28 different stakeholders from the region, from the central governments, from all sorts of community groups. That's, I think -- that dialogue table is divided into 3 aspects: the issues around water, the issues around the environment and the issues around social contribution. We have concluded the issues around water and with the result that the communities are supportive of the water scheme that we're proposing. We're very close to concluding the area -- the part on environmental where we've looked at the various environmental issues that were a concern to the community, and I think we've satisfactorily resolved pretty much all of those. And we're now into the last phase of discussing how this project is going to contribute to the local communities. Simultaneously with that, we're working on the permitting process. I think we've made some important steps forward in terms of -- it's a multistep process. Each permit requires steps that's -- one of the changes that happened in the legislation was these steps needed to be done in series rather than in parallel, so we're busy expediting each of those steps. At this stage, both processes need to come to a conclusion for us to take this project to the final stage, which is our board approval. The technical part of the feasibility study is done. That is complete. It's really those 2 last steps that we're busy with. We're working through those as expeditiously as we can but also recognizing the fact that we intend to be a long-term investor in Peru. This isn't our only project in Peru. We've got Michiquillay as well. We've got a very extensive exploration program. And we want to make sure that we do this project right the first time and that we do have both the sort of local, the regional and the national stakeholders all on site when we do it. We have seen the consequences of projects that have stepped forward too quickly without getting everybody on site. And in the long term, we believe that actually costs us more than it does to do it right the first time."

The increase in Queensland is between 25 million and 30 million tonne, which is enough to justify dedicated terminal minimum economic size, but terminal is about 30 million tonne. We were granted Preferred Respondent status for development of a terminal at Abbott Point in December. At the same time, we approved, in fact, the Grosvenor project. We moved to develop a status in April of this year. So we had, in fact, anticipated granting of the Preferred Respondent rights. We started a pre-feasibility study on this terminal back in September. The first phase will be finished in March, which will allow us to go for internal approval to pay $75 million to move to developer status. So we would anticipate in the 1st week of April paying that $75 million and moving to developer status. The pre-feas will be finished by the end of this year and then feas -- we can move into feas at the end of this year. Feasibility complete at the end of next year, and we will be going for board approval then, if all makes sense, at the end of next year to build that terminal. The rail development is integrated with the whole terminal development. The size we're looking at isn't enough to justify dedicated track. So we are talking to Queensland Rail about expansion of the existing track, the so-called North Missing Link, which runs through Abbott Point, and initial indications from Queensland Rail are that true incremental expansion of existing track electrification, et cetera, we should -- they should be able to accommodate our required tonnages for Abbott Point. The access -- what's called the Access Undertaking in Queensland, which is the regulatory regime for construction of new track, allows us in the event that Queensland Rail don't feel able to actually fund the expansion of that track, it allows us as a producer to fund it ourselves and for Queensland Rail to manage it. So we have some certainty over the capacity and the timing, and the only question mark will be about funding. But we'll work through that as part of that Abbott Point pre-feasibility work this year."

That's in the real terms, obviously, so it doesn't account for the effect of timing of the project. In fact, there's going to be escalation. But in real terms, we're looking at a benchmark capital intensity of $350. The first stage of Grosvenor is slightly below that as you would have seen. The second thing I'll say is that the projects in Queensland are all longwall projects, and we're taking a, what's called, a program management approach, delivering all those projects. So we would -- in other words, we're designing the longwall and the associate infrastructure once for Grosvenor and looking to repeat that then for the 4 longwalls that encompass the growth plans in Queensland. We would there, by taking this approach, expect to see, on average, over those 4 longwalls a reduction in that average capital intensity. But at the moment, if we work off that $350 figure, we would hope and expect to see a reduction in that if we can maximize the benefit basically of delivering the same project effectively 4x."

I'll start by giving you the highlights of what we've achieved this year. We'll also look at the operational performance, and René will take you through the financials. And then I'll say a few words about the long term, including our growth profile and world-class exploration achievements.
Over the past 5 years, Anglo American has been on a journey to become the leading global mining company. We've developed a clear strategy. We simplified our organization and our portfolio. We set strict targets, and we invested in growth. 5 years on, we continue our journey, and the fruits of our efforts are there for all to see: Record operating profit, delivery of 3 of our 4 major projects, robust balance sheet, the most diversified and balanced project pipeline in the industry and world-class geological discoveries. Our focus has and continues to be on people and driving performance with everyone involved. Our record financial performance last year reflects the operational and business improvement foundations we have put in place.
Total group operating profit was a record $11.1 billion, up 14%. Our underlying earnings were $6.1 billion, with earnings per share at $5.06. I'm therefore pleased to announce we raised the final dividend to $0.46 per share, and this brings the total dividend for the year to $0.74 per share. We have minimized the impact of events beyond our control like floods, rain or snow, input cost inflation and infrastructure constraints. 
On the growth front, our decision in 2009 to continue investing in our 4 major projects is paying off. Three projects started production on or ahead of schedule. All 3 are ramping up. Our asset optimization and supply chain initiatives will continue to create and deliver value, and we are delivering volume growth and continue to move down the cost curve. 
Beyond these initiatives, we have launched a commercial excellence model. We will adopt a coordinated global marketing approach with centers in Singapore and London. And we expect this to generate significant value.
Before we start and turn to the operating performance, I want to talk about safety. As you know, safety is an absolute priority for Anglo American and for me. In 2011, 17 of our colleagues lost their lives. The fact is that 2011 safety performance at Platinum was disappointing. The Platinum team are the first to admit this, and we're working together to do something about it. Following 2 fatalities in short succession, we decided to stop all Platinum operations on the 3rd of November. 
I went to South Africa, joined by Neville, Norman and the team to address over 30,000 of our employees. We were also joined by trade union leaders and government safety inspectors and launched the zero harm in action initiative. It aims to bring about cultural change through targeted actions and individual responsibility. We've also shown zero harm is achievable in all parts of the organization. Across our business units, excluding Platinum, lost-time injury frequency rates have dropped by 16%, and 91% of our operations had no fatalities in 2011.
No matter what the record is though, 17 deaths are 17 too many. So we recommit ourselves to prioritize, to simplify and communicate our safety programs to achieve zero harm.
When considering our improved performance, there is one initiative that started us on a path to becoming best-in-class operators. 5 years ago, we launched the asset optimization and supply chain initiatives. In 2009, we set a savings target of $2 billion by 2011. Since then, we have consistently exceeded the target. In 2011, we delivered $3.2 billion in savings, and these programs are now embedded in our operations and will deliver substantial value.
Having exceeded our target, there was further value to be unlocked from asset optimization. We've embedded asset optimization and in operational excellence across the group. For example, best-in-class performance delivered record production in thermal metallurgical coal, open pit mines, but there is so much more value to extract. 
Last year alone, we completed 6 operational reviews and identified almost $900 million in potential value. Beyond our asset optimization initiatives, global supply chain delivers multiple benefits, unlocking real savings, establishing long-term partnerships and providing benefits for the communities in which we operate through local procurement. All our suppliers are required to adopt and embed our approach to safety, as well as our values, effectively becoming our -- an extension of our organization.
In Queensland, we've established a partnership with Joy [ph] to improve Longwall productivity critical to tripling our Metallurgical Coal production by 2020. In 2011, we delivered 9 projects in challenging geographies, covering 4 countries and 5 commodities on or ahead of schedule. 3 of our 4 projects, all low-cost, long-life, Tier 1 assets, will generate significant value. Our decision to invest through the cycle is paying off, and we are now reaping the rewards. 
Over and above our organic growth pipeline, we have delivered substantial value from recent transactions. In an industry that considers time in decades, not years, it is crucial to grow and replace production continuously. So we have always looked at opportunities to supplement our pipeline. De Beers was one of those, which we have been pursuing for some time. We're thrilled to have secured a world-class business through that deal. 
Similarly, in recognition of the value Metallurgical Coal generates, we took a closer look at Peace River Coal, and we decided to retain and grow this business. This led us to take out the minorities, and we did that at an attractive value. In addition, the sale of our 24.5% interest in Anglo American Sur to Mitsubishi builds on our clear and consistent strategy of protecting and delivering value. We have done the right thing. At $22 billion on a 100% basis, the minority sale of Anglo American Sur generated significant value. 
As you know, we're currently involved in a legal dispute with Cadelco over the option agreement relating to Anglo American Sur. We have said consistently that we are ready to work together to agree on a commercial solution, but it has not been possible to reach a settlement that takes into account Anglo American's strong legal position. We continue to be open to sensible negotiations conducted in good faith, but we will not be moved from defending our clear legal rights and protecting value for our shareholders, recognizing our legal rights under what is a simple contract between 2 companies and the effect of Cadelco's breach of the contract.
Cadelco knew what our alternatives were in terms of selling down our holding to a third party prior to any valid exercise of the option, and it sought to prematurely exercise the option. The strength of our legal position is beyond question.
Now turning to our operational performance. Let's start with Iron Ore and Manganese. 2011 was a record, achieving high margins and returns. Sishen continued to operate strongly despite being impacted by heavy rains in the first half. Kolomela was delivered on budget and 5 months ahead of schedule. Kolomela is set to deliver 4  million to 5 million tons in 2012. And we're pleased to hear the President of South Africa confirm the planned expansion of the Iron Ore export channel, removing an impediment to our growth.
Amapa continues to be a turnaround story. Although a relatively small part of our portfolio, we achieved operating profit of $120 million in 2011 compared to just $16 million the year before. And we're also making good progress at Minas-Rio, and I'll talk about that in a few minutes.
Turning to Metallurgical Coal. Operating profit was also a record. Production was impacted by rain in the first half followed by an incident at Moranbah underground mine, but we've staged a strong recovery, driven by best-in-class, open-pit performance with a 90% first half improvement versus the second half production increase. Phase I of the Grosvenor project was approved in December, and this kicks off our Moranbah metallurgical coal hub, which treats 4 sequential projects as 1. 
Grosvenor will be a low-cost operation, leveraging existing infrastructure in our own backyard. We have plans to secure port and rail capacity for our growth. And in December, we were awarded preferred respondent status for the development of a 30 million-ton dedicated coal terminal at Abbott Point.
Thermal Coal is another business unit to have delivered a record operating profit despite production being impacted by rain in the first half. We were able to take advantage of the strong recovery in trials [ph] and performance in the second half to our own operational flexibility and efficient load-out stations. Zibulo, a 6.6 million-ton low-cost thermal coal mine was ramped up ahead of schedule. And Cerrejon set a new production record and is progressing with an 8 million-ton expansion.
Moving to Copper. Operating profit was $2.5 billion. While copper prices were somewhat volatile, on average, the copper price for the year was higher. As with industry peers, production was impacted by severe weather disruptions and gray decline. We've partially offset these impacts through asset optimization and volume growth. 
At Los Bronces, SAG mill throughput improved following a series of asset optimization initiatives. At Collahuasi, we're working with our partners to accelerate all expansion projects. And in Peru, we are in dialogue with all levels of government and local communities to secure permits for Quellaveco. We are progressing, but it will take time.
Nickel operating profit was $57 million. Production increased by 44%. Loma de Níquel delivered a 14% compound annual growth rate in production since 2009. The Barro Alto project was delivered on time and on local budget. Barro Alto surpassed all other Nickel projects around the world in terms of on-time start-up, quality of metal produced from the outset and world-class safety performance. Barro Alto is ramping up well. At full capacity, it will more than double our nickel production.
Turning to Platinum. Operating profit increased to $890 million, despite 81 safety stoppages at our own operations. Mogalakwena open pit mine performed strongly. Unki produced 52,000 platinum ounces, reaching steady-state 1 year ahead of schedule. The Platinum business for today is a far cry from what it was in terms of production, in terms of productivity and in terms of safety. We have seen substantial improvements, and the returns are in line with the industry. However, these returns declined in recent years and are not acceptable to us for the medium term. 
The Platinum industry faces significant challenges, whether cost inflation, whether safety stoppages or lingering concerns over European demand. As a result, we are embarking on a review to assess the optimal configuration of the Platinum portfolio, and we will do this with a single purpose in mind: Maximizing shareholder value and returns through the cycle.
And finally, Diamonds. De Beers operating profit was up 33%. Rough diamond prices were a record, up 29%, and we are optimistic about China and India continuing to drive demand growth in the medium to long-term. De Beers is well-positioned to capture this growth through its Forevermark and De Beers diamond jewelry brand expansions. 
So with that, now I'll hand over to René."

Very pleased to report or record operating profit at $11.1 billion, driven by a strong performance on the bulk side, Kumba, Metallurgical Coal and Thermal Coal. Underlying earnings up 23%. We got the benefit of lower tax rate at 23.3% as a result of favorable outcome of some outstanding issue with various tax authorities. For 2012, we are expecting a tax rate of 31%. CapEx, up to $5.8 billion as we were completing the 3 projects that Cynthia referred to, Los Bronces expansion, Barro Alto and Kolomela.
Net debt down to $1.4 billion, but if you incorporate the impact of the De Beers transaction, both from an equity and debt standpoint, as well as a capital gain tax which will be payable in the first quarter associated with the Mitsubishi transaction, the debt level at end of December on a pro forma basis is $9 billion.
Turning to the operating profit waterfall, you see the price variance, $3.8 billion, mostly in the first part of the year, primarily in Iron Ore and Metallurgical Coal, respectively $900 million for Met Coal and $1.3 billion for Iron Ore.
FX, negative variance of $149 billion, with a positive variance in the second half of 2011 following the declines around, somewhat offsetting the negative variance of $527 million in the first half of 2011.
Inflation, $585 million negative, with inflation ranging from 3.3% in Chile to 5% in South Africa. Volume, negative variance of $140 million, limited benefit of the commissioning of the 3 projects that Cynthia mentioned. We'll get the full benefit in 2012, 2011 negative impact from the volume standpoint to the flooding in Queensland, which impacted the position of Metallurgical Coal in Australia. Cash cost negative $1.2 billion, an increase of 8%, I will cover that in more details in my presentation.
Associate improvement of $175 million, with De Beers contributing $659 million in 2011, and then you see the impact of the divestment at the operating profit level of Scaw International and the Zinc business at end of 2010 and early 2011.
Turning to the price variance. First, PGM, copper and nickel. On the Platinum side, despite the situation in U.S. dollar, you see that the basket price in long term has been pretty stable, slightly above R19,000 from the second half of 2012, despite the decline of Platinum in U.S. dollar. Copper, average price realized at $3.78 versus an average LME price of $4. You see the impact of the mark-to-market adjustment. We had a positive impact in 2010, $195 million and a negative impact in 2011 of $278 million. At end of December, we had 138,000 tons of Copper, which were originally priced as $3.45. I'd like to highlight the fact that on the back of the expansion at Los Bronces, that will increase the volatility going forward as you will have larger volume provisioning price at the end of each period.
Turning to the Bulk side. On the Iron Ore side first, we are seeing some further change in terms of pricing mechanisms. In the last quarter of 2011, although Japanese and Korean customers remain on the quarterly [indiscernible] benchmark, Chinese customers and probably around 75% of European customers have moved either to mostly benchmark or current quarter benchmark.
On the Metallurgical Coal side, we had moved to a quarterly benchmark, and over the last 4 quarters, we have outperformed either the spot market or also  mostly benchmark. For the current quarter, as you know, we have settled a $235 dollar return for hard coking coal and we are currently negotiating for the following quarter.
Turning to volume variance. Platinum sales up 3%, 2.6 million ounces, despite the decline in positions that Cynthia mentioned. Our guidance for 2012 is between 2.5 million and 2.6 million ounces. On Iron Ore, we were able also to maintain the level of export sales despite a 6% decline of production at Sishen, mostly associated with some issue at the DMS plant. 
Copper down 2% as a result of the weather issue at Collahuasi and lower-grade nickel. We had the benefit of the commissioning at Barro Alto but also an improvement at Loma de Níquel. Met Coal decline of production mostly in the first half of 2011, due to the flooding in Queensland, with a very strong recovery in the second half of 2011, especially for our opencast operation.
Turning to cash cost. We continue to face sustainable inflationary pressure, primarily around wage and the electricity in South Africa and Chile. If you normalize the level of production for the weather event, whether it's in Queensland, at Collahuasi, at Sishen and for the [indiscernible] safety stoppage in Platinum, the inflationary pressure was around 5%. In 2012, we will see the benefit of a reversal of our power cost in Chile as a benefit of higher production and we expect this number to be below 5%, between 3% and 4%.
Turning to CapEx and net debt, $5.8 billion CapEx in 2011. You will notice the increase in Spain business CapEx, mostly associated with the renewal and the expansion of the 3 acquisitions, due to the higher west stripping activity, as well as the development program for our Longwall in Australia. 
For 2012, we are projecting $7 billion CapEx with a ramp-up at Minas-Rio, we will spend $2.1 billion CapEx in 2012. So far we have spent $0.2 [ph] billion. We have also, as you know, approved the Grosvenor project in Australia, that's a $1.7 billion coking coal project, and we will spend $0.5 billion in 2012. We expect this level of same business CapEx to remain around this level of $2.4 billion.
Net debt, $1.4 billion at end of December. And you see the breakdown of the adjustment that I mentioned earlier with a pro forma net debt level of $9 billion at end of December. 
Thank you. Over to you, Cynthia."
409115,153951128,278161,"Anglo American plc, 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2012",2012-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thank you very much, René. I'll now turn to the macroenvironment. Towards the end of 2011, there was a distinct slowdown in major emerging countries and continuing doubts over Europe's fiscal sustainability. Uncertainly is likely to persist in the short",1089,"Thank you very much, René. I'll now turn to the macroenvironment. Towards the end of 2011, there was a distinct slowdown in major emerging countries and continuing doubts over Europe's fiscal sustainability. Uncertainly is likely to persist in the short term. This is important, but we do not base our investment decisions on short-term drivers, and instead our eyes are on the next decade and beyond. What is important for us is that the long-term fundamentals are sound. 
Looking at the left side of the page, you will see we have the most diversified and balanced portfolio, with unparalleled exposure to late cycle development. For the first time, more than half of China's population now lives in cities. This tipping point happened in the U.K. in the 1850s and in the U.S. in the 1920s, so there is a long road of growth and development ahead. We saw this during a recent trip to China and India. 
While development in Chinese coastal provinces is maturing, inland provinces are at early stages of development, recording double-digit growth. This will continue to drive demand for raw materials over the coming decades. And we believe as development shifts from an investment to consumption-driven economy, the growth rate in steel will moderate. 
Growing middle classes in China and India and rising disposable incomes are driving demand for late-cycle commodities like Diamonds and PGMs. In addition, medium term replacement of infrastructure in the developed world presents further opportunities for steel, and there's no doubt in my mind, value creation will be the fruit of our diversified and balanced portfolio.
Demand is only part of the story. Our industry continues to face tough challenges, and these include calls for higher taxes and royalties, rising capital intensity, infrastructure constraints and tighter environmental regulations. Coupled with declines in existing mines, a picture emerges of supply consistently under-delivering against market expectation. And this will support prices over the medium to long term. Because we take the long-term view, we look beyond current volatility, and continue to invest in value-accretive growth.
Barro Alto, Los Bronces, Kolomela showcase our ability to build large complex projects. We currently have 9 projects approved. These include Minas-Rio in Brazil, Grosvenor in Queensland, Collahuasi Phase 2 in Chile, Cerrejon P500 Phase 1 in Colombia and Jwaneng-Cut 8 in Botswana. And these projects are in the white commodities, at the low end of the cost curve offering attractive returns.
Minas-Rio is a very large and complex greenfield project. Here, we have a high quality Tier 1 asset. It has a large resource base that's only getting bigger. It is expandable. Its capital intensity remains in line with comparable Greenfield projects and at full production, the delivered cash cost around of around $50 per ton is at the very low end of the cost curve, and we are making progress. More than 90% of the land access has been secured along the pipeline. More than 200 kilometers of the pipeline has now been laid, buried and installed. 
As to be expected, we are encountering environmental realities such as caves, land access and permitting within an ever-changing regulatory environment adds complexity, but we are overcoming these challenges to target first ore on ship in the second half of 2013 and within the announced 15% capital increase. We are accelerating pre-commissioning plans, engaging proactively both with permitting authorities and locking in labor cost. And yes, it takes time, but we want to get it right. 
The project sharing value remains very robust when tested for cost and timing sensitivities, and we're still working at it, but we have the right team in place committed to making progress.
We have the potential to double production with the delivery of almost $100 billion project pipeline covering almost 90 projects. Our growth pipeline is the most diversified and balanced in the industry. We will continue to invest in commodities with strong fundamentals, the most attractive risk return profile that deliver long-term returns through the cycle for our shareholders. And all of this with a backdrop of continuing growth and demand for our products.
In the meantime, our world-class exploration team has been discovering the next generation of Tier 1 assets. Since 1999, we have made 15 major discoveries and have received international recognition for Los Sulfatos and Sakatti. Sakatti is a porphyry deposit of high-quality copper, nickel, PGMs and cobalts and forms part of our tenements covering more than 800 square kilometers. The deposit is within a stone's throw of world-class infrastructure and sits in an existing mining region. 
All levels of government in Finland are very receptive to mining investments. Our drilling has yet to determine the extent of the deposit towards the north, towards the south and towards the west, as well as the depth of the deposits, and we will not, however, be making announcements until we have defined the resource size. This will take about 2 to 3 years, but the development is then not automatic. As with all projects, we will work through the relevant environmental approvals. In a world of diminishing Tier 1 assets, our world-class exploration approach truly gives us a competitive edge.
So, to sum up. We have again shown our ability to deliver value. Today, you've heard about record operating profits, strong project delivery and commercial success. We have the resources, we have the know-how, and we have the people to achieve our ambition of becoming the leading global mining company. And our success is made possible by our focus on delivering a clear and consistent strategy. 
We invest in commodities with the strongest long-term fundamentals and with the most attractive risk return profile. The bulk of our operations are at the low end of the cost curve. Our growth pipeline is balanced, taking advantage of all stages of the cycle. And our exploration team is making the most impressive discoveries in the industry, restocking our pipeline of Tier 1 assets.
We have also made clear that we are prepared to take the tough decisions where assets are not delivering acceptable returns. You've seen us do this before, and we will do it again. We will become the leading global mining company, delivering real, sustainable shareholder value.
So thank you very much for your attention. Thanks for coming. Thank heavens for raw materials, because I would not be standing up here were it not for iron ore, stainless steel and titanium. And now, I'd be very happy to take any questions, and we'll start from London and then turn to South Africa."

It is an ever-changing, evolving licensing environment. And I think, to sum up, that the key risks that we still manage today are around licensing and permitting. We have made very good progress in 2011. Basically, out of the 130 license that we need, definitely 80% of them are concluded. There's still work to be done on the others of course. But I think the key challenge is to continue to engage very proactively with the government, with the entities that regulate the permitting, because there are things that come up, like the caves issue that Cynthia referred to. But then to sum up, there has been very good progress around the licensing and permitting. We continue to engage very proactively with the government.

That still remains on track. There are a number of smaller projects in South Africa, and they depend on expansion of infrastructure then all the other normal health warnings. Now Cynthia mentioned that the President in his State of the Nation Address last week mentioned that one of the infrastructure expansion projects in South Africa would be the Sishen-Saldanha export channel. And he mentioned 2 numbers. He said we'll expand from 60 to 80 and a bit later mentioned that we'll expand from 60 to 100. But there's certainly I think it's very positive that in the State of the Nation Address, the President is mentioning infrastructure expansion and particularly on the iron ore export channel. So very positive news, and that's exactly one of the big bottlenecks that are needed to be unlocked to be able to grow in South Africa. So very positive news indeed. And then we also announced at the half-year and again at the final year results that Copebras would be seeking to work with Anglo American in Africa. And that project has started. Between myself and Peter we're running the steering committee that's looking at expansion opportunities. We are talking to some people, have identified some projects, but that is about as much as we can say at this point of time. But that work is now underway."

So as I've said earlier in my presentation, I mean we've come a long way. And I think it's very fair to say that since 2007 or so and I'm looking at Neville over here, I mean we've improved our safety performance substantially. We increased the productivity hugely. We've delivered on our production targets and we've contained costs in line with what we've committed to the market between ZAR 11,000 and ZAR 12,000 grand per ounce. So I think that was a big achievement. Now last year, sadly, unfortunately, however, you want to describe it, the industry was faced with serious safety stoppages and that the inspectors were going into our mines and not just sending down sections where there was a safety discrepancy identified by whole mines for days on end. The industry at large lost over 300,000 ounces. So what are we doing about this? Well we've got some near-term quick fixes, so to speak. Neville, I'm looking at you. Neville, if you grab the microphone. We've got some near-term initiatives that we're looking at. We have spent time with the DMR to engage with them and get them to take the right approach, and I think that they're now showing signs of doing that. And we're seeing some fair treatment with respect to stoppages. And we're looking at the longer term. So coming back to your question, I mean, and I mentioned that we're looking at the shape of the portfolio, we're looking at the size of the portfolio, we're looking at whether we should be doing more in recycling, we're looking at where do we want to leverage our asset base, where do want to take Mogalakwena for an example? Where are we taking Unki in the future? How do we deploy our workforce? And how do we get this business back to the returns that we were seeing in 2008? And that's the bottom line, Jason. We're not doing anything other than focusing on getting it right. Any it may be, as I said earlier, may be acceptable for the industry to see lower returns. Everybody's seeing the same thing, and as I also I said -- talked about our position on account -- cost curve, I mean 2007, 2008 we had about 1/3 of our operations in the first half of the cost curve. Today we have over 60%. So again we've come a long way, but we need to get this to a better place, so we're seeing those greater returns. So we're not -- we haven't taken the decision to do anything except focus and deliver more value in the business."

I think as Cynthia said, the model we're following has been held up by the Peruvian governments as the model they'd like to see in terms of community consultation, local representative consultation. What we're busy progressing with is 2 parallel but interconnected streams of work. The first of those is the dialogue table. I think that's going remarkably well. We've got 28 different stakeholders from the region, from central governments, and from all sorts of community groups. That's -- I think that dialogue table's divided into 3 aspects, the issues around water, the issues around environment and the issues around social contribution. We've completed the issues around water and with the result that the communities are supportive of the water scheme that we're proposing. We're very close to concluding the area, the part on the environmental where we've looked at the various environmental issues that were a concern to the community and I think we've satisfactorily resolved pretty much all of those. And we're now into the last phase of discussing how this project is going to contribute to the local communities. Simultaneously, with that, we're working on the permitting process. I think we've made some important steps forward in terms of -- it's a multistep process. Each permit requires steps that's -- one of the changes that happened in the legislation was these steps needed to be done in series rather than in parallel. So we're busy expediting each of those steps. At this stage, both processes need to come to a conclusion for us to take this project to the final stage, which is our board approval. The technical part of the feasibility study is done. That is complete. So it's really those 2 last steps that we're busy with. We're working through those as expeditiously as we can but also recognizing the fact that we intend to be a long-term investor in Peru. This isn't our only project in Peru, we've got Michiquillay as well. We've got a very extensive exploration program. And we want to make sure that we do this project right the first time, that we do have both the sort of local, regional and the national stakeholders all on sides when we do it. We have seen the consequences of projects that have stepped forward too quickly without getting everybody on sides and, in the long term, we believe that actually costs us more than it does to do it right the first time."

The increase in Queensland is between 25 million and 30 million ton, which is enough to justify dedicated terminal minimum economics size for terminals about 30 million ton. We were granted Preferred Respondent status for development of a terminal at Abbott Point in December. At the same time, we approved in fact Grosvenor project. We moved to develop a status in April of this year. So we had in fact anticipated granting of the Preferred Respondent rights. We started the pre-feasibility study on this terminal back in September. The first phase will be finished in March, which will allow us to go for internal approval to pay $75 million to move to developer status. So we'd anticipate the first week of April paying the $75 million and moving to developer status. The pre-fees were finished at the end of this year and in fees, we could move into fees at the end of this year, feasibility complete at the end of next year and we would be going for board approval. Then if all makes sense, at the end of next year to build that terminal. The rail development is integrated with the whole terminal development. The size we're looking at isn't enough to justify a dedicated track, so we are talking to Queensland Rail about expansion of the existing track, the so-called north [ph] missing link, which runs through Abbott Point. And initial indications from Queensland Rail that through incremental expansion of the existing track, electrification, et cetera, they should be able to accommodate our required tonnages for Abbott Point. What's called the Access Undertaking Queensland, which is the regulatory regime for construction of new track, allows us in the event that Queensland Rail don't feel able to actually fund the expansion of that track, it allows us as a producer to fund that ourselves and for Queensland Rail to manage it. So we have some certainty over the capacity and the timing and the only question mark would be about funding. But we worked through that as a part of that Abbott Point pre-feasibility work this year."

That's in real terms obviously, so it doesn't account for the fact that timing of the projects. And in fact, there's going to be an escalation. But in real terms, we're looking at a benchmark capital intensity of $350. The first stage of Grosvenor is slightly below that as you would have seen. The second thing I'll say is that the projects in Queensland are all Longwall projects and we're taking a what's called a program and management approach delivering all those projects. So we're designing the Longwall and the sort [ph] of  infrastructure ones [ph] for Grosvenor and looking to repeat that then for the 4 Longwalls that encompass the growth plans in Queensland. We would therefore, by taking this approach, expect to see on average over those 4 Longwalls a reduction in an average capital intensity. But at the moment, if work off the $350 figure, we would hope and expect to see a reduction in that if we can maximize the benefit basically of delivering the same project effectively 4x."

And thank you very much for making it through the Olympic Games traffic to be here with us this morning. I'll start by giving you the highlights of what we have achieved this year. We'll also look of the operational performance and",2348,"Good morning, everyone. And thank you very much for making it through the Olympic Games traffic to be here with us this morning. I'll start by giving you the highlights of what we have achieved this year. We'll also look of the operational performance and René will take you through the financials. I'll then say a few words about the outlook and our disciplined approach to allocating capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value. 
You have heard me talk about the journey we started more than 5 years ago to turn around performance across to group. 
As a result, we have a performance driven culture and we strive for continued improvements across all areas of the business. 
We took the hard decision to early on to restructure our organization and we largely completed our divestment program to focus on the right commodities. 
We generated almost $4 billion in proceeds and during the first half of 2012, we absorbed more volatility in the external trending environment. 
Prices eased from last year. René will show you a little later that this reduced operating profit by almost $2 billion. 
As a result, our operating profit was down by 38% to $3.7 billion. 
Our decision to invest through the cycle however positions us well to continue delivering volume growth at attractive returns. 
We've been very consistent about supporting and growing Tier 1 assets. 
And the projects we completed last year are ramping up well. 
At the Los Bronces, mill throughput already at 92%, an industry-leading performance. Kolomela was completed on budget and 5 months ahead of schedule and it will produce 6 million tonnes this year, exceeding the previous guidance of 4 million to 5 million tonnes. 
As I often highlighted, these projects are very competitive from an operating and capital cost standpoint. 
Take the Las Cruces expansion project, its capital intensity is more than 30% lower than the recently announced project in Chile. 
And beyond organic growth, we've simplified our minority ownership of De Beers by moving on our position of control. 
And we've also acquired an additional 4.5% stake in Kumba, bringing our total holdings to almost 70%. 
Increasing our second Kumba, aligns with our strategic objective of investing in large-scale assets that are long life, low-cost profiles and have clear expansion potential. 
This acquisition is a low-risk acquisition, and immediately cast generative transaction that will deliver long-term value. 
I'll shortly provide you with more detail on Kumba's continuing strong performance. 
Turning to Mozambique. Our decision to acquire a stake in Revuboè project aligned with our stated objective of building a global metallurgical coal business. 
Through this transaction, we're securing a high-quality Metallurgical Coal resource potential and position in the Moa TC Coal basin in Mozambique. 
The project is expected to competitive operating cost makes it a compelling long-term opportunity. I'll take you through our operating performance a little later, but before doing this, I wish to reiterate that every decision that we have taken and will continue to take has a single objective of maximizing shareholder value. 
We're achieving this through a disciplined and prudent approach to managing our business and allocating capital. 
In the past 2 years, we produced our workforce worldwide by about 50,000 people. We have turned around performance across our group, including Metallurgical Coal and Iron Ore. 
And as a result, the majority of our operations are on the lower half of the cost curve and we will continue to drive down costs. No matter where we are in the cycle, our focus is fixed on delivering value to our shoulders, and that's why given the current volatile market, we're pleased to declare a dividend of $0.32 per share, an increase of 14%.  And we are determined to sustain this level of dividend. 
So before I turn to the operating performance, I'd like to say a few words on safety, our #1 priority. 
We've made progress since the start of a journey towards 0 harm 5 years ago. Injury, severity rates have fallen and there's also been about a 56% reduction fatality rates over that period. 
We've shown 0 harm is achievable in all parts of the organization, and about 94% of our operations are fatality-free. 
Kolomela achieved over 25 million man-hours without an LTI. Minas-Rio achieved 30 million man-hours without an LTI. And since the start of the year, however, 7 of our colleagues have lost their lives, which I'm sure you would agree with me is unacceptable. And there is absolutely no room for complacency on safety. 
So we have reinforced the message in April at our Senior Leadership Safety Summit in South Africa and we've tapped into our collective knowledge of fun ways to share best practice and to make what we do on a continuous basis that much more effective. 
Turning to operating performance. Starting with Iron Ore and Manganese. Following a record profit in 2011, Iron Ore continue to deliver strong operational performance. Weaker prices and cost inflation have more than offset the operational gain, and despite strong headwinds, Kumba's margins remain healthy at 56%. 
Kolomela is a world-class Iron Ore operations, some of you in Johannesburg can certainly attest to this. It showcases Anglo-Americans and South Africa's ability to deliver large complex projects and let me remind you of a few facts: Kolomela was completed on budget and 5 months ahead of schedule. Capital intensity is as much as 60% lower than other current Iron Ore projects. Cash cost delivered to is around $55 per tonne and the payback period is less than 3 years. 
Now, turning to our biggest project, Minas-Rio. We've continued to confirm that this is a high-quality Iron Ore resource with significant expansion potential. And despite the current challenges Minas-Rio will prove to be a major contributor to the group for many decades to come. 
This is one of the largest and most complex projects in the world and certainly, in Brazil. 
It spans 527 kilometers from the Atlantic coast to the Minas Gerais state and to deliver Minas-Rio, our team has been managing over 130 licensees. In fact, today, we've achieved close to 200, covering the mine, covering the beneficiation plant, pipeline and port. 
At the same time, we continue to make headway in meeting our license condition at around 60% of 1,000 conditions have been completed already. These licenses and permits are granted by different government entities at the state level, at the federal level and at the municipal level. Despite this progress, we are experiencing delays, including legal interruptions and the presence of caves at the beneficiation plant site. 
That said, we're not alone. As you can see, project delays are common in Brazil, impacting both industry, as well as government. I discussed this last night with the President of Brazil, the Secretary of State and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. To places in the context, some 40 projects worth approximately $225 billion are currently facing delays, averaging 24 months and they include nongovernment infrastructure projects. 
We strengthen the projects and permitting teams reporting to who's here with us today and we transferred Amapá to OMI and freed up the team to focus on the task at hand. 
However, until these hurdles are cleared, we cannot determine with confidence the date of first production. If we manage to clear all current bottlenecks by the end of the year, this year and experience no further unexpected interventions, we expect to be in a position to ship first ore in the second half of 2014. 
The project budget is being reviewed, following a detailed assessment of the schedule by a third-party and I'll provide an update by the end of the year. 
All right. Turning to Metallurgical Coal. Record production was delivered in the first half of the year. Our Queensland business continued its journey of strong performance, particularly in our open Cut Mines, which delivered record production. This resulted from a proactive rain mitigation program and best-in-class equipment utilization. 
We're also tackling cost inflation through disciplined cost reduction and we've laid the foundation to outperform our peers. The 5 million tonnes Grosvenor Project, the first of 4 underground hard coking coal projects secured its mining license in the first half and this project places us on track to more than double our hard coking coal production by 2020. These are high quality, low-cost, Brownfield and Greenfield operations leveraging existing infrastructure in our own backyard. 
Thermal Coal continue to perform strongly, despite weaker prices. Sales from South African operations perform strongly and we're up 22%. 
Zibulo is continuing to ramp up and we are protecting our advantage margin position by closing high cost sections in South Africa. 
We've adjusted our export product mix in South Africa in response to changing demand and in Columbia, SoHahn delivered record production up 18% on the previous half. 
Norman Zima has done a great job and we look forward to who's here with us this morning taking performance to the next level right, right, Godfrey? As Norman heads to Kumba. 
Turning to Copper. As I mentioned earlier, the expansion is ramping up strongly. It achieved 92% of nameplate capacity and like others in the industry, however, established part of the mine will continue to be impacted by declining grades. 
Production from Collahuasi fell due to expected lower grades, adverse lower condition and a ball mill failure and we expect some of these challenges to continue into the second half with repairs to the ball mill due for completion by the end of August. 
However, overall Copper production at Collahuasi is expected to gradually improve in the second half of the year. And this will be due to the business improvement plan initiated by the joint venture partners in June starting to take effect. We will be giving further updates to the market in due course. In Peru, we successfully completed the Quellaveco dialog table and we reached agreement on social and environmental contribution to be made as part of the project. 
This was a first engagement process of its type ever undertaken in Peru, involving government, the community and a mining company. And it's a clear demonstration of the value we place on engagement and the development of sustainable communities. 
We will continue to work with the Peruvian government to secure the outstanding permits, prior to submitting the project for board consideration. 
Turning to nickel. Nickel generated an operating profit of $58 million. Production increased by 80%, following the completion of the Barro Alto project last year. 
Barrel Alto is ramping up well and it's line 1 is achieving average feed rate of more than 70% of capacity. 
With improving feed rates grade and recovery, we expect targeting full capacity in 2013. 
De Beers delivered a sound operating profit of $250 million in the first half. After a very strong start to 2011, difficult rating conditions experience of the end of that year continued into 2012.  And despite these challenges, rough diamond price levels remain relatively stable. 
In the meantime, De Beers mines continue to focus on eliminating waste stripping and they were focused on eliminating waste stripping and maintenance backlogs. 
Infrastructure, construction at Cot8, expansion project is now 98% complete and looking to the future, we see continued strong long-term demand growth for luxury goods with compound annual growth up to 9%. 
Chinese cement is still expected to show double-digit percentage growth this year alone. Supporting moderately positive growth in global diamond jewelry sales. 2/3 of Chinese future wealth creation will come from Tier 3 and Tier 4 areas. 
So we are well positioned with a diverse portfolio to take advantage of this late cycle development. And I welcome Bruce Lieber and Gary Boston who are members of the De Beers team with us today and I look forward to the De Beers acquisition reaching its conclusion shortly. 
As you're aware, the Platinum industry is facing significant headwinds. Economic uncertainty in Europe continues to have a negative impact on demand. Mining inflation has remained well above the South African consumer price index. 
As a result, operating profit is due to increase by 85%. In the short term, we expect demand to remain subdued. 
While in the medium to longer-term, we expect the market to rebalance. our response to the situation has been thoughtful and discipline. We made significant progress of platinum since 2008. Productivity between 2008 and 2010 increased by 25%. Safety has significantly improved and over 60% of our production is now in the low end of the cost curve. However, we are experiencing the same conditions as the rest of the industry and while our margins of 11% is in line with the rest of the industry, we recognize that it is not acceptable. 
In the short term, what are we doing? First, together with our joint venture partner, we placed the raised the Marcano mine under current maintenance. Second, we will go beyond our capital reduction target for Platinum and deliver a cut of almost $200 million by the end of the year. Third, we are reviewing our overhead costs and we also continue to review the shape and the scale of the business. The key objective is to thoroughly assess the options available to establish a long-term portfolio with sustainable competitive advantages that will maximize value. And we will look at the entire value chain from resources to mining to processes, sales and marketing and people. And no option is off the table and we will retain Platinum as a part of Anglo American, that is a starting point. 
As I've outlined in February, this review will be completed by the end of the year and as you're aware, Neville resigned as CEO of Anglo Platinum a week ago. Chris has been appointed to seceding from the 1st of September and Chris, as many of you know, brings a lot of experience. He spent 18 years in the Platinum business with deep knowledge of that business. So I'm looking forward to having Chris as an integral part of that review. 
I'll now turn it over to René who will take  you through the financials."

For the first half of this year, we are reporting profit $3.7 billion, a decline of 38%. Obviously, the major impact came from the decline in commodity prices, they somewhat mitigated by the additional pollution from the 3 projects that we commissioned in 2011.
 The level of tax rate for the first half was 30.3%, below last year, 31.8%. For the full year, we are projecting a level of tax rate between 30% and 31%. 
EPS of $1.38. The impact of the Mitsubishi transaction was $0.03 in the first half of this year and the conversation of the convertible just $0.01. 
Now if you turn to operating profit waterfall, Cynthia already mentioned close to $2 billion cash, $1.8 billion, that's the exact number. That was pretty much in the second quarter, $1.4 billion in the second quarter, as pie started to decline at the end of March. 
Volume increased, a positive volume variance mostly driven by the ramp you at the Kolomela and the Los Bronces transaction, offsetting the shortfall at more permanently the mines in Chile, the existing mines at Collahuasi and Los Bronces, as well as in Platinum. 
Looking at more detail the various variances. First, starting with the cash variance, so base and precious. Platinum price in road was in fact flat around 20,000 with the round decline almost offsetting the decline in U.S. dollar. 
Now, that was the case up to the end of June over the next few weeks, the basket price has declined to 18,000 round. 
In the case of Copper, the realized price was $3.70 in the first half of this year, compared to $4.22 last year. At the end of June, we add 116,000 tonnes of Copper, which were provisioning price at $3.49. 
Turning to bulk. Iron Ore price declined to $134 a tonne, compared to $169 a tonne in the first half of 2011. That in fact South Africa, very similar in fact to the price in China with the quality of the Kumba products and the loan premium of safety, the freight costs between South Africa and China. 
In the case of Met Coal, we have the benefit in terms of prices at the beginning of 2011 of the flooding in Queensland. So price of $251 a tonne down to $191 a tonne in the first half of this year, a mixed issue also in the first half of this year with the collapse of early at the end of 2011, which impacted the product mix. 
Turning to the volume variance, except Platinum, all business unit reported an increase in volume. Kumba Copper and nickel grabbed the benefit of the 3 projects, which were commissioned last year. 
In the case of Platinum, the sale volume was down 21% and we have some problem earlier this year with the Platinum converter, following the annual methanol shutdown. 
In the case of Met Coal, the volume was up 38% as we got the benefit of higher productivity, but also the benefit of the weak, the RAND mitigating investment, which were implemented by the unit at the end of 2011 and early 2012. 
Turning to cash cost, you remember last year, we reported 8% real cash cost increase. So a key issue for us is as we see pressure on prices, how our cost line reacting, we have seen a slowdown to 4% real cash cost increase. We expect further declines in the second half projection will come down to 2% in the second half of 2012. 
Turning to CapEx and net debt. CapEx of $2.3 billion in the first half. For the full year, we are projecting $5.5 billion, that's down $1.5 billion compared to our guidance of the beginning of the year and Cynthia will cover later what does that mean in terms of capital allocation and our focus on reducing the level of capital intensity. 
The level of net debt at $3.1 billion as of June, if you factor the impact of the De Beers acquisition and remove acquisition in Mozambique on a pro forma basis, $10 billion. Our level of at end of June stood at $19 billion with $11.3 billion in cash and $8 billion of ungrown committed facilities. Thank you."

There is no doubt that the global economic environment has deteriorated, driven by the crisis in the Euro zone. And there is continuing uncertainty over the sustainability of the U.S. economic recovery. 
China's slowdown and growth rate is also contributing to the fragile short-term outlook, but in the longer-term, we continue to see resilient commodity demand. And this is driven by wising living standard in emerging countries such as China and India and infrastructure replacement in developed countries. 
If current trends are sustained by 2025, cities around the world will build the equivalent of the land mass of Austria in residential and commercial floorspace and this will require cumulative investment, totaling around $80 trillion. 
As developing in the emerging markets ships over time from investment to consumption, growth rates in steel demand should moderate. 
And the expanding metal classes in many emerging countries should boost consumption of Platinum and Diamonds as that transition occurs. 
1 billion people are forecast to enter the consuming classes by 2025 and our diversified and balanced portfolio positions us well to take advantage of the structural changes in the global economy. 
Of course, that's only part of the story. What's happening on supply is just as important. Prices will be underpinned by supply-constrained, as well as difficulties, producers face deliver that supply. 
As I mentioned earlier, projects are facing significant delays as a result of increasingly complex planning and permitting routines. 
Developing and developed countries alike are seeking a larger slice of the mining cake, whether it's through joint ventures with mining companies, windfall taxes, increased royalties and in some cases, expropriating mining assets. 
Remaining resources are located in places that are harder to access and have underdeveloped our nonexisting infrastructure. 
At the same time, mining itself is becoming more difficult, more challenging with existing operations, facing greater declines and higher waste stripping. 
In an industry that things in decades, not in years, capital allocation and balance sheet management require discipline and sound judgment. Our resilient and well diversified portfolio is the outcome of adhering to a clear and consistent strategy. 
We have invested in the right commodities in the right high-quality and low-cost asset at the right time. And we still have the best pipeline of growth options in the industry. Progress to date seems ceases well-positioned to establish a new balance between rewarding our shareholders and investing in growth. 
Shareholders have been very clear with us about the need to strike a balance and we listened and we've responded in a way that achieve both objectives. 
Today, we increase our dividend by 14%, despite a reported lower earnings and we are determined to maintain and build on this new base through the cycle. It is a strong signal of our commitment to striking a balance between maintaining a strong investment rating, returns to shareholders and sequencing future investments, in line with resulting funding capacity. 
We recognized that future cash flow will be impacted by both economic uncertainty and higher capital and operating costs. 
To maintain our investment rating and dividend to shareholders, we will stage our investment. 
As guided previously, CapEx budgeted for 2012, as René said, $7 billion is what we said at the beginning of the year. The revised guidance, as you will see from the bottom of this chart will be $5.5 billion. 
In addition, we are deferring $200 million in exploration and early study development expenses in 2012. 
For 2013, we have set a CapEx funding target of $6 billion and the 2013 funding target for exploration and early studies will be $600 million, down a further 300  on 2012. 
Investment will be directed to the most value accretive and lowest rates options. 
As you know, we have the most diversified and balanced portfolio in the industry. That remains the case. Our operations and project pipeline are in advantage commodities at the lower end of the cost curve and offering attractive returns throughout the cycle. 
We will continue to capitalize on the value inherent in these options. And we will focus on projects, aiming to deliver the highest sustainable returns within the shortest and the lowest risk timetable. 
Our investment will be sequenced to take advantage of all stages of development in emerging countries. In a world of developing, diminishing Tier 1 assets and with mining becoming ever more challenging, our portfolio truly gives us a competitive advantage. 
With that in mind, I'd like to conclude by reminding you that the journey we started 5 years ago has embedded a high performance culture in this organization. We deliver on our commitments, safety have improved, non-core assets have been largely divested and we've turned around our businesses. Our decision to invest through the cycle in 2008 positioned us well to continue delivering volume growth. The projects completed last year are ramping up well and generating strong cash flows. 
That is been made possible because we have a clear and consistent strategy. As you know, we invest in commodities with the strongest long-term fundamentals and the most attractive risk return profiles. The bulk of our operations are at the lower end of the cost curve and we will continue to drive down cost. 
However, challenges remain with respect to Platinum, clearly, there is no silver bullet. We've come a long way of Platinum, with an improved cost position. 
While our returns are in line with the industry, they are not acceptable, as I said earlier, they are not acceptable to us for the medium to long-term. And we're working through the Platinum review to assess the optimal configuration of the portfolio. This will take time and it will not be easy. And in light of the current volatile environment, discipline is paramount. 
At a group level, we will also be disciplined and strike the right balance on our capital allocation. We will sequence investment in line with our funding capacity and focus on the most value accretive and lowest risk options. 
We are responding to tough times, but let there be no doubt in anyone's mind that we're well-positioned to get through them in strong shape. 
That brings me to the end of my presentation, everyone. So we thank you for your attention. We're very happy to take questions. We've got the entire EXCO up with us at the front here, and I'm happy to shoot questions across to them. Let me just start here in London first and then move to South Africa and finally take questions on the phone. 
So Jason, you're always the first 1, Jason."

We're looking at over 500,000 this year, so really outstanding. We also started with cost of around $85 per tonne and we are now done for the mine level to about 45 or so it's really fantastic position and really, that team there is doing a great job. We wanted the Minas Rio group to be absolutely focused on delivering the project. And it was for that reason that we decided to move it up into Duncan's own OMI group. We have not taken the decision in terms of what we ultimately do with Amapa and we're always looking for creation of or shareholder value and that's the response of that question. In terms of Minas Rio, look, we are in a very challenging country, an environment. It's a developing country, it's developing its regulatory framework. As I said, there are 50 projects or so that have been put into the delay category, representing massive amounts. We did emphasize this last night to the President and she is certainly aware and we have made incredible progress, where we've got -- where we -- I'm going to ask paul to stand here in a minute. Where we have access to land, we have actually surpassed the targets. So we've done superbly in that regard. We've got about 92% of land access in the pipeline. We've got -- we've moved about 80% of the earthworks around the mine and beneficiation plant. We've been moving along as much as we could when we have the permits and as I said earlier, we have 1,000 conditions and we've satisfied 60. So, Jason, we are making good progress and this is a fantastic resource that we're sending on probably, one of the most unique in the world. Having said that, we have been set back by these unexpected, unanticipated interruptions. You would know that Valley is in exactly the same both. They have a number of them themselves that they're dealing with. We had, as an example, we had that permit issued to us in March on the transmission line and a month later, it was taken away from us and we were told that no, the state could not issue it. The federal government has to issue it. So we're working through all of that. So what I would say to you, I would reiterate that this is, given the size, the complexity, of course, there are going to be issues that we face. We're working I can promise you avidly on every single 1 on a continuous basis. I mean, this team is absolutely outstanding. We have a third-party assessment, as I mentioned a few weeks ago and as I said, these are experts in construction, they sent these guys, they're doing a great job but we've got the public authorities that are in an evolution mode or environment -- we're there to try to set the framework and established themselves and so therefore, those challenges there. So these were not anticipated, Jason, by any means. Others like Valley are also dealing with. Paul, why don't  you stand up and talk a little more specifically about the process and what we're doing about it."

And all these 3 that we actually shared with yourselves 6 months ago, we actually have been able to clear them all. So just to elaborate on what Cynthia said, actually the team has managed to: A, being awarded to the transmission line license, we have worked together with the authorities to define the regulation around caves and also, managed to successfully acquire 2 very important pieces of land at the beneficiation plant. However, as Cynthia highlighted, we have been facing not the rather other players in the Brazilian mining industry with legal stoppages. These have actually tackled exactly those same bottlenecks that we mentioned and thus, a progress was very difficult to be made. Cindy also highlighted the significant progress on the areas that we had access to land at the pipeline. Similarly, at the Board, I mean, we have managed over the last 6 months to complete more than 20% from last 6 months at the filtration plant for instance where we had no blockages or any other of these challenges. It's just really to highlight that we shared with you the 4 key bottlenecks that we had. These have been tackled. We have been suffering with the legal stoppages. We continue to work on them as shared with you intensifying resources on the legal side, on the licensing and permitting side and again, where we ever had access progress was made."

We have been working very closely with the government. This has been resolved in early this year that the regulations around caves was to be done at the state. This is also a result of good relationships with the environmental authorities at state level. And as Cynthia shared with you, we's are also making very good progress around the profiling and making even the federal level.

Met Coal is certainly 1 of our favored core commodities with attractive long-term fundamentals. We have -- we've indicated to the market that we expect to increase our output quite significantly. Last year, we produced about 40 million tonnes of Met Coal out of Australia and we're adding, along the way, our Peace River Coal from British Columbia, very effectively. But the fact is, although we are growing and we are progressing on Grosvenor and expect to reach about 45 million tonnes by 2020, we need to always be thinking about the next basin and the next phase of this business. And so we've been looking around the world at what opportunities or might be and where we can leverage our best-in-class performance out of Australia. And so we have been spending time on the ground the last couple of years or so, looking at Mozambique. Mozambique is obviously a neighbor to in South Africa. We've been thinking about how do we leverage our expertise and our technical group out of South Africa and capitalize on nickel group out of Australia and this is really what it's all about, Peter. If you look at this investment, relative to some of our other peers investments in Mozambique, I think you would know that it's a very, very good return investment on a -- an investment of enterprise value perspective per resource. It's about 1.4 billion tonnes of resource. We can't tell you right now when exactly where we're going to develop that's really on the basis of development of infrastructure. I have seen the President, I have seen the mining minister and Seamus has been down there a number of times and many of our group members also are very familiar with Mozambique. So we think it's an opportunity to leverage a high quality resource base with our expertise. Okay? Thank you very much. Let me take a question from South Africa."

We've got 12 operating mines, we got 7 joint ventures, we've got 58,000 people. We've got -- if you multiply that by about 10, the numbers of people that we impact on a continuous basis is massive. What we have also said at the outset is that our Platinum is a key differentiator for Anglo American and we believe in the fundamentals and we believe that the outlook for demand is -- in terms of growth is in the neighborhood of 4% to 5% medium to longer-term and turning to supply growth, we're talking about something around 3% -- 3% to 4%. So we do think that there will be a gap that does develop over time in terms of the ability of the industry to satisfy the longer-term demand. Now, the other fact, as you know is, where the ones sitting on the optionality of resource. We've got the choice that we can potentially make. And that's why all of this does take time in terms of the complexity of the business and the time to debate all the issues. Furthermore, with a backdrop of South Africa, where there are calls for job creation, people looking for -- to take position with respect to the labor. So competing labor unions and you saw that with respect to Impalla at the start of the year, where they lost about 150,000 ounces. So we've got to be very thoughtful about how we take this and how we think about all the options and once we make a decision, how we then share those decision. They will not be taken alone or independently. So now, your question about how do we inform the markets, we've got to get Chris on board, where's Chris? Chris is all webbed up and excited to go but he's going to finish some things at Kumba. He'll be in the job, as I said earlier, on the 1st of September. He's got to get his feet on the ground. He's going to be the 1 I bet of the date at the helm of moving this forward and taking those decisions into the implementation mode. So we need to give him some time. It will -- no decisions have been taken yet on where we are. No decisions on asset, ill remind you again, we've taken out 60,000 ounces. We're looking at where those high-cost operations are and what we can do with them and that's really the mode that we're in right now, but nothing is off the table and as I said, it's a broad ranging review from all the way up to the resource base, all the way down to sales and marketing.

So we've actually upgraded both just to a life of mine a standard for the remaining life of the mine. Gets us to the quarter it impacted -- first product mix, so product mix for the first half of the year in terms of total export production was 50% at coking Coal at 29% PCI that will swing around in the second half of the year to about 57% high coking coal and 20% PCI. The second thing that impacted on was obviously was unit cost. Average for the year Australian for the half year Australian operations FOB cost excluding royalties was 111, but the first quarter was 129 and the second quarter was 97. So 2 very different quarters. The rest of the year, we're looking at probably mid-90s again, again the carbon tax just kicked in from July, so there's impact few dollars a ton. We're looking at an average of mid-90s in the second half the year. So the second quarter was very much what we call it a normal quarter but the first quarter very much skewed by the ramp up at.

Just to start, I think the ramp-up of the Los Bronces project has been a huge success. We're sitting sort of throughput rates, which are on a day by day basis, we exiting design capacity and on 1 month basis, we got up to 92% of throughput capacity to-date. I think the challenge that we've got at Los Bronces is the state of mine development. The overall cost about grade, the overall grade for deposits remain exactly as we have forecasted. accessing those grades obviously depends on having sufficient activity with sufficient mining development to be able to get to those in terms of keeping what's now a plant that requires more than double the amount of feed, we've dropped the grade somewhat in terms of making sure that we maintain the feed rates. Obviously, in the longer-term, the key plan is to improve upon the mine development, get to a point where we're back to having sufficient flexibility to be able to do this mining and be able to access those high-grade areas in the near term. Moving onto Collahuasi, there are number of parts to the issues at Collahuasi. I think the first was 2012 was always expected to be a tough year in terms of grades. And those grades are, as we expect them, we are moving through a lower grade zone of the mine. I think from last year, we have 1.03% Copper. The grade for the year-to-date is 0.7% that obviously has a very major impact both of production and on unit cost. But, obviously, there has been some other issues as well. We are impacted in first few months of the year by a very severe winter. The Northern part of Chile suffered severe floods and we had to be flooded damage to varies pieces of infrastructure. During that which caused an impact. Secondly, in March, we had a failure or a crack appear at one the ball mills. That crack has taken some time to repair ultimately going to required in the basement of that shell, but what we're doing is a repair, which can last up until that new shell is constructed. So from March, the expected completion date of that ball mill repair is of the end of August and that of his the asset an impact on our overall throughput. The third factor that expected on us is recoveries and because of the area and the mine where we are going through, having lost the grade I mentioned to 0.79% of total Copper has had higher percentages than we had expected of what's called soluble Copper. So nonrecoverable Copper in our plantation plant our recoveries have dropped as well. Now certain as 1 of the joint venture partners of Collahuasi, we have not been satisfied with this performance. This is not the first year we've suffered issues with infrastructure and issues with production and so what we actually decided to do as a joint venture partner is really engage in a very intensive business improvement plan. We put in place 2 senior segments, 1 from ourselves, 1 from Xstrata as joint CEOs prepared 3 to 6 months. We put in 30 specialist from the shareholders to actually support in. I think we've done a very good diagnosis of what the challenges are. We perform an operational review towards the end of last year, that's given us very clear guidelines as to where the opportunities lie for improvement. What has been lacking at Collahuasi is the capacity to implement a lot of those things and so with this team that we put in place, we do have high expectations that there will be able to resolve a lot of the underlying challenges and sit Collahuasi to the fact to achieve the performance that we expect."

I'll start by giving you the highlights of what we have achieved this year. We'll also look at the operational performance, and",2352,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you very much for making it through the Olympic Game traffic to be here with us this morning. I'll start by giving you the highlights of what we have achieved this year. We'll also look at the operational performance, and René will take you through the financials. I'll then say a few words about the outlook and our disciplined approach to allocating capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value. 
You have heard me talk about the journey we started more than 5 years ago to turn around performance across the group. As a result, we have a performance-driven culture and we strive for continued improvements across all areas of the business. We took the hard decisions early on to restructure our organization, and we've largely completed our divestment program to focus on the right commodities. We've generated almost $4 billion in proceeds, and during the first half of 2012, we absorbed more volatility in the external trending environment. 
Prices eased from last year. René will show you a little later that this reduced operating profit by almost $2 billion. As a result, our operating profit was down by 38% to $3.7 billion. 
Our decision to invest through the cycle, however, positioned us well to continue delivering volume growth at attractive returns. We've been very consistent about supporting and growing Tier 1 assets, and the projects we completed last year are ramping up well. 
At the Los Bronces expansion, mill throughput is already at 92%, an industry-leading performance. Kolomela was completed on budget and 5 months ahead of schedule, and it will produce 6 million tonnes this year, exceeding the previous guidance of 4 million to 5 million tonnes. As I've often highlighted, these projects are very competitive from an operating and capital cost standpoint. Take the Los Bronces expansion project. Its capital intensity is more than 30% lower than a recently announced project in Chile. And beyond organic growth, we've simplified our minority ownership of De Beers by moving on our position of control. 
And we've also acquired an additional 4.5% stake in Kumba, bringing our total holdings to almost 70%.  Increasing our stake in Kumba aligns with our strategic objective of investing in large-scale assets that are long-life, low-cost profiles and have clear expansion potential. This acquisition is a low-risk acquisition and immediately cash-generative transaction that will deliver long-term value. I'll shortly provide you with more detail on Kumba's continuing strong performance. 
Turning to Mozambique, our decision to acquire a stake in Revuboè project aligned with our stated objective of building a global metallurgical coal business. Through this transaction, we're securing a high-quality metallurgical coal resource potential and position in the Moatize coal basin in Mozambique. The project's expected competitive operating cost makes this a compelling long-term opportunity. 
I'll take you through our operating performance a little later, but before doing this, I wish to reiterate that every decision that we have taken and will continue to take has a single objective of maximizing shareholder value. We are achieving this through a disciplined and prudent approach to managing our business and allocating capital. 
In the past few years, we've reduced our workforce worldwide by about 50,000 people. We have turned around performance across our group, including Metallurgical Coal and Iron Ore. And as a result, the majority of our operations are on the lower half of the cost curve, and we will continue to drive down cost. No matter where we are in the cycle, our focus is fixed on delivering value to our shoulders, and that's why given the current volatile market, we're pleased to declare a dividend of $0.32 per share, an increase of 14%, and we are determined to sustain this level of dividend. 
So before I turn to the operating performance, I'd like to say a few words on safety, our #1 priority. 
We've made progress since the start of our journey towards 0 harm 5 years ago. Injury rates have fallen, and there's also been about a 56% reduction in fatality rates over that period. We've shown 0 harm is achievable in all parts of the organization, and about 94% of our operations are fatality-free. 
Kolomela achieved over 25 million man-hours without an LTI. Minas-Rio achieved 30 million man-hours without an LTI. And since the start of the year, however, 7 of our colleagues have lost their lives, which I'm sure you would agree with me is unacceptable, and there is absolutely no room for complacency on safety. So we have reinforced the message in April at our senior leadership safety summit in South Africa, and we've tapped into our collective knowledge to find ways to share best practice and to make what we do on a continuous basis that much more effective. 
Turning to operating performance, starting with Iron Ore and Manganese. Following a record profit in 2011, Iron Ore continue to deliver strong operational performance. Weaker prices and cost inflation have more than offset the operational gains, and despite strong headwinds, Kumba's margins remain healthy at 56%. Kolomela is a world-class iron ore operations. Some of you in Johannesburg can certainly attest to this. It showcases Anglo American's and South Africa's ability to deliver large, complex projects, and let me remind you of a few facts. Kolomela was completed on budget and 5 months ahead of schedule. Capital intensity is as much as 60% lower than other current Iron Ore projects. Cash cost delivered to China is around $55 per tonne, and the payback period is less than 3 years. 
Now turning to our biggest project, Minas-Rio. We've continued to confirm that this is a high-quality iron ore resource with significant expansion potential, and despite the current challenges, Minas-Rio will prove to be a major contributor to the group for many decades to come. 
This is one of the largest and most complex projects in the world and certainly in Brazil. It spans 527 kilometers from the Atlantic coast to the Minas Gerais state. And to deliver Minas-Rio, our team has been managing over 130 licenses. In fact, today, we've achieved close to 200, covering the mine, covering the beneficiation plant, pipeline and port. At the same time, we continue to make headway in meeting our license condition, and around 60% of 1,000 conditions have been completed already. These licenses and permits are granted by different government entities at the state level, at the federal level and at the municipal level. And despite this progress, we are experiencing delays, including legal interruptions and the presence of caves at the beneficiation plant site. 
That said, we're not alone. As you can see, project delays are common in Brazil, impacting both industry as well as government. I discussed this last night with the President of Brazil, the Secretary of State and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. To place this into context, some 40 projects worth approximately $225 billion are currently facing delays averaging 24 months, and they include nongovernment infrastructure projects. We strengthened the projects and permitting teams reporting to Paulo Castellari, who's here with us today, and we transferred Amapa to OMI and freed up the team to focus on the task at hand. 
However, until these hurdles are cleared, we cannot determine with confidence the date of first production. If we manage to clear all current bottlenecks by the end of the year this year and experience no further unexpected interventions, we expect to be in a position to ship first ore in the second half of 2014. The project budget is being reviewed following a detailed assessment of the schedule by a third-party, and I'll provide an update by the end of the year. 
All right. Turning to Metallurgical Coal. Record production was delivered in the first half of the year. Our Queensland business continued its journey of strong performance, particularly in our open cut mines, which delivered record production. This resulted from a proactive rain mitigation program and best-in-class equipment utilization. 
We're also tackling cost inflation through disciplined cost reduction, and we've laid the foundation to outperform our peers. The 5 million-tonne Grosvenor project, the first of 4 underground hard coking coal projects, secured its mining license in the first half, and this project places us on track to more than double our hard coking coal production by 2020. These are high-quality, low-cost brownfield and greenfield operations leveraging existing infrastructure in our own backyard. 
Thermal Coal continued to perform strongly despite weaker prices. Sales from South African operation performed strongly and were up 22%. 
Zibulo is continuing to ramp up, and we are protecting our advantage margin position by closing high-cost sections in South Africa. We've adjusted our export product mix in South Africa in response to changing demand, and in Colombia, Cerrejon delivered record production, up 18% on the previous half. Norman Mbazima has done a great job, and we look forward to Godfrey Gomwe, who's here with us this morning, taking performance to the next level, right, Godfrey, as Norman heads to Kumba. 
Turning to Copper. As I mentioned earlier, the Los Bronces expansion is ramping up strongly. It's achieved 92% of nameplate capacity, and like others in the industry, however, the established part of the mine will continue to be impacted by declining grades. 
Production from Collahuasi fell due to expected lower grades, adverse weather condition and a ball mill failure, and we expect some of these challenges to continue into the second half, with repairs to the ball mill due for completion by the end of August. However, overall copper production at Collahuasi is expected to gradually improve in the second half of the year, and this will be due to the business improvement plan initiated by the joint venture partners in June starting to take effect. We will be giving further updates to the market in due course. 
In Peru, we successfully completed the Quellaveco dialogue table and we've reached agreement on social and environmental contribution to be made as part of the project. This was a first engagement process of its type ever undertaken in Peru involving government, the community and a mining company, and it's a clear demonstration of the value we place on engagement and the development of sustainable communities. We will continue to work with the Peruvian government to secure the outstanding permits prior to submitting the project for board consideration. 
Turning to nickel. Nickel generated an operating profit of $58 million. Production increased by 80% following the completion of the Barro Alto project last year. Barro Alto is ramping up well, and its line 1 is achieving average feed rate of more than 70% of capacity. With improving feed rates, grade and recovery, we expect targeting full capacity in 2013. 
De Beers delivered a sound operating profit of $250 million in the first half. After a very strong start to 2011, difficult trading conditions experienced at the end of that year continued into 2012.  And despite these challenges, rough diamond price levels remain relatively stable. In the meantime, De Beers' mines continue to focus on eliminating waste stripping on -- they were focused on eliminating waste stripping and maintenance backlogs. 
Infrastructure construction Debswana's Jwaneng Cut-8 extension project is now 98% complete, and looking to the future, we see continued strong long-term demand growth for luxury goods, with compound annual growth up to 9%. 
Chinese cement is still expected to show double-digit percentage growth this year alone, supporting moderately positive growth in global diamond jewelry sales. 2/3 of Chinese future wealth creation will come from Tier 3 and Tier 4 areas. 
So we are well positioned with a diverse portfolio to take advantage of this late-cycle development. And I welcome Bruce Cleaver and Gareth Mostyn, who are members of the De Beers team, with us today, and I look forward to the De Beers acquisition reaching its conclusion shortly. 
As you're aware, the platinum industry is facing significant headwinds. Economic uncertainty in Europe continues to have a negative impact on demand. Mining inflation has remained well above the South African consumer price index. As a result, operating profit is to increase by 85%. In the short term, we expect demand to remain subdued, while in the medium to longer term, we expect the market to rebalance. Our response to the situation has been thoughtful and disciplined. We've made significant progress in Platinum since 2008. Productivity between 2008 and 2010 increased by 25%. Safety has significantly improved, and over 60% of our production is now in the low end of the cost curve. However, we are experiencing the same conditions as the rest of the industry, and while our margins of 11% is in line with the rest of the industry, we recognize that it is not acceptable. 
In the short term, what are we doing? First, together with our joint venture partner, we placed the Marikana mine under care and maintenance. Second, we will go beyond our capital reduction target for Platinum and deliver a cut of almost $200 million by the end of the year. Third, we are reviewing our overhead cost, and we also continue to review the shape and the scale of the business. The key objective is to thoroughly assess the options available to establish a long-term portfolio with sustainable competitive advantages that will maximize value, and we will look at the entire value chain from resources to mining to processes, sales and marketing and people. And no option is off the table, and we will retain Platinum as a part of Anglo American. That is a starting point. 
As I've outlined in February, this review will be completed by the end of the year, and as you're aware, Neville resigned as CEO of Anglo Platinum a week ago. Chris has been appointed to secede him from the 1st of September, and Chris, as many of you know, brings a lot of experience. He spent 18 years in the Platinum business with deep knowledge of that business. So I'm looking forward to having Chris as an integral part of that review. 
I'll now turn it over to René, who will take  you through the financials."

For the first half of this year, we are reporting an operating profit of $3.7 billion, a decline of 38%. Obviously, the major impact came from the decline in commodity prices that was somewhat mitigated by the additional production from the 3 projects that we commissioned in 2011.
The level of tax rate for the first half was 30.3%, below last year, 31.8%. For the full year, we are projecting a level of tax rate between 30% and 31%. 
EPS of $1.38. The impact of the Mitsubishi transaction was $0.03 in the first half of this year and the conversion of the convertible, just $0.01. 
Now if you turn to the operating profit waterfall, Cynthia already mentioned close to $2 billion price variance. $1.8 billion, that's the exact number. That was predominantly in the second quarter, $1.4 billion in the second quarter as price started to decline at the end of March. 
Volume increased, a positive volume variance, mostly driven by the ramp-up at Kolomela and the Los Bronces expansion offsetting the shortfall at more predominantly the mines in Chile, the existing mine at Collahuasi and Los Bronces, as well as in Platinum. 
Looking at more detail the various variances. First, starting with the price variance for base and precious. Platinum price in rand was, in fact, flat, around ZAR 20,000, with the rand decline almost offsetting the decline in U.S. dollar. Now that was the case up to end of June. Over the last few weeks, the basket price has declined to ZAR 18,000. 
In the case of Copper, the realized price was $3.70 in the first half of this year compared to $4.22 last year. At end of June, we add 116,000 tonnes of copper, which were provisionally priced at $3.49. 
Turning to bulk, iron ore price declined to $134 a tonne compared to $169 a tonne in the first half of 2011. That's, in fact, very -- that's the FOB price from South Africa, very similar, in fact, to the sea freight in China, with the benefit of the quality of Kumba products and the loan premium offsetting the freight cost between South Africa and China. 
In the case of Met Coal, we had the benefit in terms of prices at the beginning of 2011 of the flooding in Queensland, so an average price last year of $251 a tonne, down to $191 a tonne in the first half of this year, a mix issue also in the first half of this year with the collapse of the Moranbah roof early -- at the end of 2011, which impacted the product mix. 
Turning to the volume variance, except Platinum, all business units reported an increase in volume. Kumba copper and nickel got the benefit of the 3 projects which were commissioned last year. 
In the case of Platinum, the sale volume was down 21%, and we had some problem earlier this year with the platinum converter following the annual methanol shutdown. 
In the case of Met Coal, the volume was up 38% as we got the benefit of higher productivity but also the benefit of the weak -- the rain mitigating investment, which were implemented by the unit at the end of 2011 and early 2012. 
Turning to cash cost, you remember last year, we reported 8% real cash cost increase. So a key issue for us is as we see pressure on prices, how the cost line reacting. We have seen a slowdown to 4% real cash cost increase. We expect a further decline in the second half. Our current projection is it will come down to 2% in the second half of 2012. 
Turning to CapEx and net debt, CapEx of $2.3 billion in the first half. For the full year, we are projecting $5.5 billion. That's down $1.5 billion compared to our guidance at the beginning of the year, and Cynthia will cover later what does that mean in terms of capital allocation and our focus on reducing the level of capital intensity. 
The level of net debt, $3.1 billion at end of June. If you factor the impact of the De Beers acquisition and the Revuboè acquisition in Mozambique on a pro forma basis, $10 billion. Our level of headroom at end of June stood at $19 billion, with $11.3 billion in cash and $8 billion of undrawn committed facilities. Thank you."

There is no doubt that the global economic environment has deteriorated, driven by the crisis in the Eurozone. And there is continuing uncertainty over the sustainability of the U.S. economic recovery. 
 
China's slowdown in growth rate is also contributing to the fragile short-term outlook, but in the longer term, we continue to see resilient commodity demand, and this is driven by rising living standards in emerging countries, such as China and India, and infrastructure replacement in developed countries. 
If current trends are sustained by 2025, cities around the world will build the equivalent of the land mass of Austria in residential and commercial floorspace, and this will require cumulative investment totaling around $80 trillion. 
As development in emerging countries shifts over time from investment to consumption, growth rates in steel demand should moderate, and the expanding middle classes in many emerging countries should boost consumption of platinum and diamonds as that transition occurs. 1 billion people are forecast to enter the consuming classes by 2025, and our diversified and balanced portfolio positions us well to take advantage of the structural changes in the global economy. 
Of course, that's only part of the story. What's happening on supply is just as important. Prices will be underpinned by supply constraint, as well as difficulties producers face to deliver that supply.  As I mentioned earlier, projects are facing significant delays as a result of increasingly complex planning and permitting regimes. 
Developing and developed countries alike are seeking a larger slice of the mining cake, whether it's through joint ventures with mining companies, windfall taxes, increased royalties and in some cases, expropriating mining assets. Remaining resources are located in places that are harder to access and have underdeveloped or nonexistent infrastructure. At the same time, mining itself is becoming more difficult, more challenging, with existing operations facing greater declines and higher waste stripping. 
In an industry that thinks in decades, not in years, capital allocation and balance sheet management required discipline and sound judgment. Our resilient and well-diversified portfolio is the outcome of adhering to a clear and consistent strategy. We have invested in the right commodities, in the right high-quality and low-cost assets at the right time, and we still have the best pipeline of growth options in the industry. Progress to date sees us well positioned to establish a new balance between rewarding our shareholders and investing in growth. 
Shareholders have been very clear with us about the need to strike a balance, and we have listened and we've responded in a way that achieves both objectives. 
Today, we increased our dividend by 14% despite a reported lower earnings, and we're determined to maintain and build on this new base through the cycle. It is a strong signal of our commitment to striking a balance between maintaining a strong investment rating, returns to shareholders and sequencing future investment in line with resulting funding capacity. 
We recognize that future cash flow will be impacted by both economic uncertainty and higher capital and operating cost. To maintain our investment rating and dividend to shareholders, we will stage our investment. 
As guided previously, CapEx budgeted for 2012, as René said, $7 billion is what we said at the beginning of the year. The revised guidance, as you will see from the bottom of this chart, will be $5.5 billion. In addition, we are deferring $200 million in exploration and early-study development expenses in 2012. 
For 2013, we have set a CapEx funding target of $6 billion, and the 2013 funding target for exploration and early studies will be $600 million, down a further $300 million on 2012. Investment will be directed to the most value-accretive and lowest risk options. 
As you know, we have the most diversified and balanced portfolio in the industry. That remains the case. Our operations and project pipeline are, in advantage commodities, at the lower end of the cost curve and offering attractive returns throughout the cycle. We will continue to capitalize on the value inherent in these options, and we will focus on projects aiming to deliver the highest sustainable returns within the shortest and the lowest risk timetable. Our investments will be sequenced to take advantage of all stages of development in emerging countries. In a world of developing -- diminishing Tier 1 assets and with mining becoming ever more challenging, our portfolio truly gives us a competitive advantage. 
With that in mind, I'd like to conclude by reminding you that the journey we started 5 years ago has embedded a high-performance culture in this organization. We deliver on our commitments. Safety has improved. Non-core assets have been largely divested, and we've turned around our businesses. Our decision to invest through the cycle in 2008 positioned us well to continue delivering volume growth. The projects completed last year are ramping up well and generating strong cash flows. 
That has been made possible because we have a clear and consistent strategy. As you know, we invest in commodities with the strongest long-term fundamentals and the most attractive risk return profiles. The bulk of our operations are at the lower end of the cost curve, and we will continue to drive down cost. 
However, challenges remain. With respect to Platinum, clearly, there is no silver bullet. We've come a long way at Platinum, with an improved cost position. While our returns are in line with the industry, they are not acceptable. As I said earlier, they are not acceptable to us for the medium to long term, and we are working through the Platinum review to assess the optimal configuration of the portfolio. This will take time, and it will not be easy. And in light of the current volatile environment, discipline is paramount. 
At a group level, we will also be disciplined and strike the right balance on our capital allocation. We will sequence investment in line with our funding capacity and focus on the most value-accretive and lowest risk options. We are responding to tough times, but let there be no doubt in anyone's mind that we're well positioned to get through them in strong shape. 
That brings me to the end of my presentation, everyone. So we thank you for your attention. We're very happy to take questions. We've got the entire ExCo up with us at the front here, and I'm happy to shoot questions across to them. Let me just start here in London first and then move to South Africa and finally take questions on the phone."

So we've done superbly in that regard. We've got about 92% of land access on the pipeline. We've got -- we've moved about 80% of the earthworks around the mine and beneficiation plant. We've been moving along as much as we could when we have the permits, and as I said earlier, we have 1,000 conditions and we've satisfied 60. So Jason, we are making good progress, and this is a fantastic resource that we're sitting on, probably one of the most unique in the world. Having said that, we have been set back by these unexpected, unanticipated interruptions. You would know that Vale is in exactly the same boat. They have a number of them themselves that they're dealing with. We had -- as an example, we had the permit issued to us in March on the transmission line, and a month later, it was taken away from us and we were told that no, the state could not issue it. The federal government had to issue it. So we're working through all of that. So what I would say to you, I would reiterate that this is -- given the size, the complexity, of course, there are going to be issues that we face. We're working, I can promise you, avidly on every single one on a continuous basis. I mean, this team is absolutely outstanding. We had a third-party assessment, as I mentioned, a few weeks ago. I mean, they said -- these are experts in construction. They said these guys are doing a great job, but we've got the public authorities that are in an evolution mode or environment where they're just trying to set the framework and establish themselves and so therefore, those challenges there. So these were not anticipated, Jason, by any means. And that's what others like Vale are also dealing with. Paul, why don't you stand up and just talk a little more specifically about the process and what we're doing about it?"

I think last time, at the end of the year, we actually shared with you 4 main bottlenecks that the project had, and those included, as Cynthia mentioned, the installation license for the transmission line, regulation around one particular cave that is situated in the beneficiation plant, access to land at the beneficiation plant as well. And all these 3 that we actually shared with yourselves 6 months ago, we actually have been able to clear them all. So just to elaborate on what Cynthia said, actually, the team has managed to, A, being awarded with the transmission line license. We have worked together with the authorities to define the regulation around caves and also managed to successfully acquire 2 very important pieces of land at the beneficiation plant. However, as Cynthia highlighted, we have been facing, not dissimilar to other players in the Brazilian mining industry, with legal stoppages. These have actually tackled exactly those same bottlenecks that we mentioned, and thus, progress was very difficult to be made. Cynthia also highlighted the significant progress on the areas that we had access to land at the pipeline. Similarly, at the board, I mean, we have managed over the last 6 months to complete more than 20% from last 6 months at the filtration plant, for instance, where we have no blockages or any other of these challenges. So it's just really to highlight that we shared with you the 4 key bottlenecks that we had. These have been tackled. We have been suffering with the legal stoppages. We continue to work on them, as shared with you, intensifying the resources on the legal side, on the licensing and permitting side. And again, wherever we had access, progress was made."

We have been working very closely with the government. This has been resolved in early this year that the regulations around caves was to be done at the state. This is also a result of good relationships with the environmental authorities at state level. And as Cynthia shared with you as well, we're also making very good progress around the profiling and making even the federal level, as we said yesterday, with ministers and President Dilma herself around the issues that we're facing with Minas-Rio."

I mean, first of all, I'll just highlight that, I've shared this before and I'll repeat it, that met coal is certainly one of our favored core commodities with attractive long-term fundamentals. We've indicated to the market that we expect -- where is Seamus? We expect to increase our output quite significantly. Last year, we produced about 40 million tonnes of met coal out of Australia, and we're adding, along the way, our Peace River Coal from British Columbia very effectively. But the fact is although we're growing and we're progressing on Grosvenor and expect to reach about 45 million tonnes by 2020, we need to always be thinking about the next basin and the next phase of this business. And so we've been looking around the world at what opportunities there might be and where we can leverage our best-in-class performance out of Australia. And so we have been spending time on the ground the last couple of years or so looking at Mozambique. Mozambique is obviously a neighbor to us in South Africa. We've been thinking about how do we leverage our expertise and our technical group out of South Africa and capitalize on our Nickel group out of Australia. And this is really what it's all about, Peter. If you look at this investment relative to some of our other peers' investments in Mozambique, I think you would know that it's a very, very good return investment on an investment or enterprise value perspective per resource. It's about 1.4 billion tonnes of resource. We can't say right now when exactly we're going to develop. That's really on the basis of development of the infrastructure. I have seen the President. I have seen the Mining Minister, and Seamus has been down there a number of times, and many of our group members also are very familiar with Mozambique. So we think it's an opportunity to leverage a high-quality resource base with our expertise, okay? Thank you very much. Let me take a question from South Africa."

The fact is you're familiar with the Platinum business. It's pretty complex. We've got 12 operating mines. We've got 7 joint ventures. We've got 58,000 people. We've got -- if you multiply that by about 10, the numbers of people that we impact on a continuous basis is massive. What we have also said at the outset is that Platinum is a key differentiator for Anglo American, and we believe in the fundamentals, and we believe that the outlook for demand in terms of growth is in the neighborhood of 4% to 5% medium to longer term. And in terms of supply growth, we're talking about something around 3% , 3% to 4%. So we do think that there will be a gap that does develop over time in terms of the ability of the industry to satisfy the longer-term demand. Now the other fact, as you know, is we're the ones sitting on the optionality of resource. We've got the choices that we can potentially make, and that's why all of this does take time in terms of the complexity of the business and the time to debate all the issues. Furthermore, with the backdrop of South Africa, where there are calls for job creation, people looking to take position with respect to the labor, so competing labor unions. And you saw that with respect to Impala at the start of the year, where they lost about 150,000 ounces. So we've got to be very thoughtful about how we take this and how we think about all the options and once we make a decision, how we then share those decisions. They will not be taken alone or independently. So now your question about how do we inform the market, we've got to get Chris onboard. Where's Chris? Chris is all webbed up and excited to go, but he's going to finish some things at Kumba. He'll be in the job, as I said earlier, on the 1st of September. He's got to get his feet on the ground. He's going to be the one, at the end of the day, at the helm of moving this forward and taking those decisions into the implementation mode. So we need to give him some time. It will -- no decisions have been taken yet on where we are. No decisions on asset. I'll remind you again we've taken out 60,000 ounces. We are looking at where those high-cost operations are and what we can do with them, and that's really the mode that we're in right now. But nothing is on the table, and as I said, it's a broad-ranging review, from all the way up to the resource base all the way down to sales and marketing. And that's about all I'm going to say right now. I'm not going to get into any discussions that we're having with stakeholders or any other groups because, as I said, there's a lot involved, okay?

René mentioned the Moranbah drift issue we had in December of last year. The rehabilitation of that took us through to February, so recommissioning of the Moranbah mine started in February and effectively went through to April. In parallel with the recommencement of production in February, we completed a full life of mine rehabilitation, not just of the conveyor drift but also of the equipment drift as well. So we've actually upgraded both drifts to a life-of-mine standard for the remaining life of the Moranbah mine. But it gave us 2 very different quarters. It impacted 2 things. First, the product mix. So our product mix for the first half of the year in terms of total export production was 50% hard coking coal and 29% PCI. That will swing around in the second half of the year to about 57% hard coking coal and 20% PCI. The second thing it impacted on, obviously, was unit cost. Average for the year Australian -- for the half year Australian operations FOB cost, excluding royalties, was $111, but the first quarter was $129 and the second quarter was $97. So 2 very different quarters. The rest of the year, we're looking at probably mid-90s. Again, the carbon tax just kicked in from July, so there's impact, few dollars a ton. We're looking at an average in the mid-90s for the second half of the year. So the second quarter was very much what we call a normal quarter, but the first quarter, very much skewed by the ramp up at Moranbah. In our costs, too, we have some exceptional items relating to the ongoing divestment of Callide, which we would hope one-offs in the first half of the year as well."

Just to start, I think the ramp-up of the Los Bronces project has been a huge success. We're sitting sort of with throughput rates which are sort of, on a day-by-day basis, were actually exceeding designed capacity, and on a month basis, we got up to 92% of throughput capacity to date. I think the challenge that we've got at Los Bronces is the state of mine development. Once the overall -- you asked about grades. The overall grade for the deposit remains exactly as we have forecasted. Accessing those grades obviously depends on having sufficient flexibility with sufficient mining development to be able to get to those. And in terms of keeping what's now a plant that requires more than double the amount of feed rate, we've dropped the grade somewhat in terms of making sure that we maintain the feed rates. Obviously, in the longer term, the key plan is to improve upon the mine development, get to a point where we're back to having sufficient flexibility to be able to do the selective mining and be able to access those high-grade areas sort of in the near term. Moving on to Collahuasi, there are number of parts to the issues at Collahuasi. I think the first was 2012 was always expected to be a tough year in terms of grades. And those grades are, as we expect them, were moving through a lower-grade zone of the mine. I think from last year, we had 1.03% copper. The grade for the year-to-date is 0.79%. That obviously has a very major impact both on production and on unit cost. But obviously, there have been some other issues as well. We were impacted in first few months of the year by a very severe Altiplanic winter. The whole northern part of Chile suffered severe floods, and we had the pit flooded and various sort of damage to various pieces of infrastructure during that, which caused an impact. Secondly, in March, we had a failure or a crack appear in one of the ball mills. That crack has taken some time to repair. Ultimately, it's going to require the replacement of that shell, but what we're doing is a repair which can last up until that new shell is constructed. So from March, the expected completion date of that ball mill repair is the end of August, and that obviously has had an impact on our overall throughput. The third factor that impacted on us is recoveries, and because of the area in the mine where we're going through having lost the grade, I mentioned the 0.79% is total copper, it's at higher percentages than we had expected of what's called soluble copper. So nonrecoverable copper in our floatation plants. Our recoveries have dropped as well. Now certainly, as one of the joint venture partners of Collahuasi, we've not been satisfied with its performance. This is not the first year we've suffered issues with infrastructure and issues with production, and so what we actually decided to do sort of as a joint venture partners is really engage in a very intensive business improvement plan. We've put in place 2 senior executives, 1 from ourselves, 1 from Xstrata, as joint CEOs for a period of 3 to 6 months. We've put in 30 specialists from the shareholders to actually support in -- I think we've done a very good diagnosis of what the challenges are. We've performed an operational review towards the end of last year. That's given us a very clear guideline as to where the opportunities lie for improvement. What has been lacking at Collahuasi is the capacity to implement a lot of those things, and so with this team that we've put in place, we do have high expectations that they will be able to resolve a lot of these underlying challenges and set Collahuasi on the path to achieve the sort of performance that we expect."

And as far as costs go, we'll give you guidance towards the end of the year on that. Bruce, you want to stand up and comment on diamonds? And then we're going to have to close."

I'll start by giving you the highlights of what we have achieved this year. We'll also look at the operational performance, an",2355,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you very much for making it through the Olympic Games traffic to be here with us this morning. I'll start by giving you the highlights of what we have achieved this year. We'll also look at the operational performance, and René will take you through the financials. I'll then say a few words about the outlook and our disciplined approach to allocating capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value. 
You have heard me talk about the journey we started more than 5 years ago to turn around performance across the group. As a result, we have a performance-driven culture and we strive for continued improvements across all areas of the business. We took the hard decisions early on to restructure our organization, and we've largely completed our divestment program to focus on the right commodities. We've generated almost $4 billion in proceeds, and during the first half of 2012, we absorbed more volatility in the external trending environment. 
Prices eased from last year. René will show you a little later that this reduced operating profit by almost $2 billion. As a result, our operating profit was down by 38% to $3.7 billion. 
Our decision to invest through the cycle, however, positioned us well to continue delivering volume growth at attractive returns. We've been very consistent about supporting and growing Tier 1 assets, and the projects we completed last year are ramping up well. 
At the Los Bronces expansion, mill throughput is already at 92%, an industry-leading performance. Kolomela was completed on budget and 5 months ahead of schedule, and it will produce 6 million tonnes this year, exceeding the previous guidance of 4 million to 5 million tonnes. As I've often highlighted, these projects are very competitive from an operating and capital cost standpoint. Take the Los Bronces expansion project. Its capital intensity is more than 30% lower than a recently announced project in Chile. And beyond organic growth, we've simplified our minority ownership of De Beers by moving on our position of control. 
And we've also acquired an additional 4.5% stake in Kumba, bringing our total holdings to almost 70%. Increasing our stake in Kumba aligns with our strategic objective of investing in large-scale assets that are long-life, low-cost profiles and have clear expansion potential. This acquisition is a low-risk acquisition, an immediately cash-generative transaction that will deliver long-term value. I'll shortly provide you with more detail on Kumba's continuing strong performance. 
Turning to Mozambique, our decision to acquire a stake in Revuboè project aligns with our stated objective of building a global metallurgical coal business. Through this transaction, we're securing a high-quality metallurgical coal resource potential and position in the Moatize coal basin in Mozambique. The project's expected competitive operating cost makes this a compelling long-term opportunity. 
I'll take you through our operating performance a little later, but before doing this, I wish to reiterate that every decision that we have taken and will continue to take has a single objective of maximizing shareholder value. We are achieving this through a disciplined and prudent approach to managing our business and allocating capital. 
In the past few years, we've reduced our workforce worldwide by about 50,000 people. We have turned around performance across our group, including Metallurgical Coal and Iron Ore. And as a result, the majority of our operations are on the lower half of the cost curve, and we will continue to drive down cost. No matter where we are in the cycle, our focus is fixed on delivering value to our shoulders, and that's why, given the current volatile market, we're pleased to declare a dividend of $0.32 per share, an increase of 14%, and we are determined to sustain this level of dividend. 
So before I turn to the operating performance, I'd like to say a few words on safety, our #1 priority. 
We've made progress since the start of our journey towards 0 harm 5 years ago. Injury severity rates have fallen, and there's also been about a 56% reduction in fatality rates over that period. We've shown 0 harm is achievable in all parts of the organization, and about 94% of our operations are fatality-free. 
Kolomela achieved over 25 million man-hours without an LTI. Minas-Rio achieved 30 million man-hours without an LTI. And since the start of the year, however, 7 of our colleagues have lost their lives, which I'm sure you would agree with me is unacceptable, and there is absolutely no room for complacency on safety. So we have reinforced the message in April at our senior leadership safety summit in South Africa, and we've tapped into our collective knowledge to find ways to share our best practice and to make what we do on a continuous basis that much more effective. 
Turning to operating performance. Starting with Iron Ore and Manganese. Following a record profit in 2011, Iron Ore continued to deliver strong operational performance. Weaker prices and cost inflation have more than offset the operational gains, and despite strong headwinds, Kumba's margins remain healthy at 56%. Kolomela is a world-class iron ore operation. Some of you in Johannesburg can certainly attest to this. It showcases Anglo American's and South Africa's ability to deliver large, complex projects, and let me remind you of a few facts. Kolomela was completed on budget and 5 months ahead of schedule. Capital intensity is as much as 60% lower than other current Iron Ore projects. Cash cost delivered to China is around $55 per tonne, and the payback period is less than 3 years. 
Now turning to our biggest project, Minas-Rio. We've continued to confirm that this is a high-quality iron ore resource with significant expansion potential, and despite the current challenges, Minas-Rio will prove to be a major contributor to the group for many decades to come. 
This is one of the largest and most complex projects in the world and certainly in Brazil. It spans 527 kilometers from the Atlantic coast to the Minas Gerais state. And to deliver Minas-Rio, our team has been managing over 130 licenses. In fact, today, we've achieved close to 200, covering the mine, covering the beneficiation plant, pipeline and port. At the same time, we continue to make headway in meeting our license condition, and around 60% of 1,000 conditions have been completed already. These licenses and permits are granted by different government entities at the state level, at the federal level and at the municipal level. And despite this progress, we are experiencing delays, including legal interruptions and the presence of caves at the beneficiation plant site. 
That said, we're not alone. As you can see, project delays are common in Brazil, impacting both industry as well as government. I discussed this last night with the President of Brazil, the Secretary of State and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. To place this into context, some 40 projects worth approximately $225 billion are currently facing delays averaging 24 months, and they include nongovernment infrastructure projects. We strengthened the projects and permitting teams reporting to Paulo Castellari, who's here with us today, and we transferred Amapa to OMI and freed up the team to focus on the task at hand. 
However, until these hurdles are cleared, we cannot determine with confidence the date of first production. If we manage to clear all current bottlenecks by the end of the year this year and experience no further unexpected interventions, we expect to be in a position to ship first ore in the second half of 2014. The project budget is being reviewed following a detailed assessment of the schedule by a third party, and I'll provide an update by the end of the year. 
All right. Turning to Metallurgical Coal. Record production was delivered in the first half of the year. Our Queensland business continued its journey of strong performance, particularly in our open cut mines, which delivered record production. This resulted from a proactive rain mitigation program and best-in-class equipment utilization. 
We're also tackling cost inflation through disciplined cost reduction, and we've laid the foundation to outperform our peers. The 5 million-tonne Grosvenor project, the first of 4 underground hard coking coal projects, secured its mining license in the first half, and this project places us on track to more than double our hard coking coal production by 2020. These are high-quality, low-cost brownfield and greenfield operations leveraging existing infrastructure in our own backyard. 
Thermal Coal continued to perform strongly despite weaker prices. Sales from South African operation performed strongly and were up 22%. 
Zibulo is continuing to ramp up, and we are protecting our advantaged margin position by closing high-cost sections in South Africa. We've adjusted our export product mix in South Africa in response to changing demand, and in Colombia, Cerrejon delivered record production, up 18% on the previous half. Norman Mbazima has done a great job, and we look forward to Godfrey Gomwe, who's here with us this morning, taking performance to the next level, right, Godfrey, as Norman heads to Kumba. 
Turning to Copper. As I mentioned earlier, the Los Bronces expansion is ramping up strongly. It's achieved 92% of nameplate capacity, and like others in the industry, however, the established part of the mine will continue to be impacted by declining grades. 
Production from Collahuasi fell due to expected lower grades, adverse weather condition and a ball mill failure, and we expect some of these challenges to continue into the second half, with repairs to the ball mill due for completion by the end of August. However, overall copper production at Collahuasi is expected to gradually improve in the second half of the year, and this will be due to the business improvement plan initiated by the joint venture partners in June starting to take effect. We will be giving further updates to the market in due course. 
In Peru, we successfully completed the Quellaveco dialogue table and we've reached agreement on social and environmental contribution to be made as part of the project. This was a first engagement process of its type ever undertaken in Peru involving government, the community and a mining company, and it's a clear demonstration of the value we place on engagement and the development of sustainable communities. We will continue to work with the Peruvian government to secure the outstanding permits prior to submitting the project for board consideration. 
Turning to nickel. Nickel generated an operating profit of $58 million. Production increased by 80% following the completion of the Barro Alto project last year. Barro Alto is ramping up well, and its line 1 is achieving average feed rate of more than 70% of capacity. With improving feed rates, grade and recovery, we expect targeting full capacity in 2013. 
De Beers delivered a sound operating profit of $250 million in the first half. After a very strong start to 2011, difficult trading conditions experienced at the end of that year continued into 2012. And despite these challenges, rough diamond price levels remain relatively stable. In the meantime, De Beers' mines continue to focus on eliminating waste stripping on -- they were focused on eliminating waste stripping and maintenance backlogs. 
Infrastructure construction at Debswana's Jwaneng Cut-8 extension project is now 98% complete, and looking to the future, we see continued strong long-term demand growth for luxury goods, with compound annual growth up to 9%. 
Chinese Xiwan is still expected to show double-digit percentage growth this year alone, supporting moderately positive growth in global diamond jewelry sales; 2/3 of Chinese future wealth creation will come from Tier 3 and Tier 4 areas. 
So we are well positioned with a diverse portfolio to take advantage of this late-cycle development. And I welcome Bruce Cleaver and Gareth Mostyn, who are members of the De Beers team, with us today, and I look forward to the De Beers acquisition reaching its conclusion shortly. 
As you're aware, the platinum industry is facing significant headwinds. Economic uncertainty in Europe continues to have a negative impact on demand. Mining inflation has remained well above the South African consumer price index. As a result, operating profit is increased by 85%. In the short term, we expect demand to remain subdued, while in the medium to longer term, we expect the market to rebalance. Our response to the situation has been thoughtful and disciplined. We've made significant progress in Platinum since 2008. Productivity between 2008 and 2010 increased by 25%. Safety has significantly improved, and over 60% of our production is now in the low end of the cost curve. However, we are experiencing the same conditions as the rest of the industry, and while our margins of 11% is in line with the rest of the industry, we recognize that it is not acceptable. 
In the short term, what are we doing? First, together with our joint venture partner, we placed the Marikana mine under care and maintenance. Second, we will go beyond our capital reduction target for Platinum and deliver a cut of almost $200 million by the end of the year. Third, we are reviewing our overhead cost, and we also continue to review the shape and the scale of the business. The key objective is to thoroughly assess the options available to establish a long-term portfolio with sustainable competitive advantages that will maximize value, and we will look at the entire value chain from resources to mining to processes, sales and marketing and people. And no option is off the table, and we will retain Platinum as a part of Anglo American. That is a starting point. 
As I've outlined in February, this review will be completed by the end of the year, and as you're aware, Neville resigned as CEO of Anglo Platinum a week ago. Chris has been appointed to succeed him from the 1st of September, and Chris, as many of you know, brings a lot of experience. He’s spent 18 years in the Platinum business with deep knowledge of that business. So I'm looking forward to having Chris as an integral part of that review. 
I'll now turn it over to René, who will take you through the financials."

For the first half of this year, we are reporting an operating profit of $3.7 billion, a decline of 38%.

For the first half of this year, we are reporting an operating profit of $3.7 billion, a decline of 38%. Obviously, the major impact came from the decline in commodity prices that was somewhat mitigated by the additional production from the 3 projects that we commissioned in 2011.
The level of tax rate for the first half was 30.3%, below last year, 31.8%. For the full year, we are projecting a level of tax rate between 30% and 31%. 
EPS of $1.38. The impact of the Mitsubishi transaction was $0.03 in the first half of this year and the conversion of the convertible, just $0.01. 
Now if you turn to the operating profit waterfall, Cynthia already mentioned close to a $2 billion price variance. $1.8 billion, that's the exact number. That was predominantly in the second quarter, $1.4 billion in the second quarter as price started to decline at the end of March. 
Volume increased, a positive volume variance, mostly driven by the ramp-up at Kolomela and the Los Bronces expansion offsetting the shortfall at more predominantly the mines in Chile, the existing mine at Collahuasi and Los Bronces, as well as in Platinum. 
Looking at in more detail the various variances. First, starting with the price variance for base and precious. Platinum price in rand was, in fact, flat, around ZAR 20,000, with the rand decline almost offsetting the decline in U.S. dollar. Now that was the case up to end of June. Over the last few weeks, the basket price has declined to ZAR 18,000. 
In the case of Copper, the realized price was $3.70 in the first half of this year compared to $4.22 last year. At end of June, we add 116,000 tonnes of copper, which were provisionally priced at $3.49. 
Turning to bulk, iron ore price declined to $134 a tonne compared to $169 a tonne in the first half of 2011. That's, in fact, very -- that's the FOB price from South Africa, very similar, in fact, to the sea freight in China, with the benefit of the quality of Kumba products and the loan premium offsetting the freight cost between South Africa and China. 
In the case of met coal, we had the benefit in terms of prices at the beginning of 2011 of the flooding in Queensland, so an average price last year of $251 a tonne, down to $191 a tonne in the first half of this year, a mix issue also in the first half of this year with the collapse of the Moranbah roof early -- at the end of 2011, which impacted the product mix. 
Turning to the volume variance, except Platinum, all business units reported an increase in volume. Kumba copper and nickel got the benefit of the 3 projects which were commissioned last year. 
In the case of Platinum, the sale volume was down 21%, and we had some problem earlier this year with the platinum converter following the annual methanol shutdown. 
In the case of met coal, the volume was up 38% as we got the benefit of higher productivity but also the benefit of the weak -- the rain mitigating investment, which were implemented by the unit at the end of 2011 and early 2012. 
Turning to cash cost, you remember that last year, we reported 8% real cash cost increase. So a key issue for us is as we see pressure on prices, how are the cost line reacting. We have seen a slowdown to 4% real cash cost increase. We expect a further decline in the second half. Our current projection is it will come down to 2% in the second half of 2012. 
Turning to CapEx and net debt, CapEx of $2.3 billion in the first half. For the full year, we are projecting $5.5 billion. That's down $1.5 billion compared to our guidance at the beginning of the year, and Cynthia will cover later what does that mean in terms of capital allocation and our focus on reducing the level of capital intensity. 
The level of net debt, $3.1 billion at end of June. If you factor the impact of the De Beers acquisition and the Revuboè acquisition in Mozambique on a pro forma basis, $10 billion. Our level of headroom at end of June stood at $19 billion, with $11.3 billion in cash and $8 billion of undrawn committed facilities. Thank you."

There is no doubt that the global economic environment has deteriorated, driven by the crisis in the Eurozone. And there is continuing uncertainty over the sustainability of the U.S. economic recovery. 
 
China's slowdown in growth rate is also contributing to the fragile short-term outlook, but in the longer term, we continue to see resilient commodity demand, and this is driven by rising living standards in emerging countries, such as China and India, and infrastructure replacement in developed countries. 
If current trends are sustained, by 2025, cities around the world will build the equivalent of the land mass of Austria in residential and commercial floorspace, and this will require cumulative investment totaling around $80 trillion. 
As development in emerging countries shifts over time from investment to consumption, growth rates in steel demand should moderate, and the expanding middle classes in many emerging countries should boost consumption of platinum and diamonds as that transition occurs. One billion people are forecast to enter the consuming classes by 2025, and our diversified and balanced portfolio positions us well to take advantage of the structural changes in the global economy. 
Of course, that's only part of the story. What's happening on supply is just as important. Prices will be underpinned by supply constraint, as well as difficulties producers face to deliver that supply.  As I mentioned earlier, projects are facing significant delays as a result of increasingly complex planning and permitting regimes. 
Developing and developed countries alike are seeking a larger slice of the mining cake, whether it's through joint ventures with mining companies, windfall taxes, increased royalties and in some cases, expropriating mining assets. Remaining resources are located in places that are harder to access and have underdeveloped or nonexistent infrastructure. At the same time, mining itself is becoming more difficult, more challenging, with existing operations facing greater declines and higher waste stripping. 
In an industry that thinks in decades, not in years, capital allocation and balance sheet management required discipline and sound judgment. Our resilient and well-diversified portfolio is the outcome of adhering to a clear and consistent strategy. We have invested in the right commodities, in the right high-quality and low-cost assets at the right time, and we still have the best pipeline of growth options in the industry. Progress to date sees us well positioned to establish a new balance between rewarding our shareholders and investing in growth. 
Shareholders have been very clear with us about the need to strike a balance, and we have listened and we've responded in a way that achieves both objectives. 
Today, we increased our dividend by 14% despite a reported lower earnings, and we're determined to maintain and build on this new base through the cycle. It is a strong signal of our commitment to striking a balance between maintaining a strong investment rating, returns to shareholders and sequencing future investment in line with resulting funding capacity. 
We recognize that future cash flow will be impacted by both economic uncertainty and higher capital and operating cost. To maintain our investment rating and dividend to shareholders, we will stage our investment. 
As guided previously, CapEx budgeted for 2012, as René said, $7 billion is what we said at the beginning of the year. The revised guidance, as you will see from the bottom of this chart, will be $5.5 billion. In addition, we are deferring $200 million in exploration and early-study development expenses in 2012. 
For 2013, we have set a CapEx funding target of $6 billion, and the 2013 funding target for exploration and early studies will be $600 million, down a further $300 million on 2012. Investment will be directed to the most value-accretive and lowest risk options. 
As you know, we have the most diversified and balanced portfolio in the industry. That remains the case. Our operations and project pipeline are, in advantage commodities, at the lower end of the cost curve and offering attractive returns throughout the cycle. We will continue to capitalize on the value inherent in these options, and we will focus on projects aiming to deliver the highest sustainable returns within the shortest and the lowest risk timetable. Our investments will be sequenced to take advantage of all stages of development in emerging countries. In a world of developing -- diminishing Tier 1 assets and with mining becoming ever more challenging, our portfolio truly gives us a competitive advantage. 
With that in mind, I'd like to conclude by reminding you that the journey we started 5 years ago has embedded a high-performance culture in this organization. We deliver on our commitments. Safety has improved. Non-core assets have been largely divested, and we've turned around our businesses. Our decision to invest through the cycle in 2008 positioned us well to continue delivering volume growth. The projects completed last year are ramping up well and generating strong cash flows. 
That has been made possible because we have a clear and consistent strategy. As you know, we invest in commodities with the strongest long-term fundamentals and the most attractive risk return profiles. The bulk of our operations are at the lower end of the cost curve, and we will continue to drive down cost. 
However, challenges remain. With respect to Platinum, clearly, there is no silver bullet. We've come a long way at Platinum, with an improved cost position. While our returns are in line with the industry, they are not acceptable. As I said earlier, they are not acceptable to us for the medium to long term, and we are working through the Platinum review to assess the optimal configuration of the portfolio. This will take time, and it will not be easy. And in light of the current volatile environment, discipline is paramount. 
At a group level, we will also be disciplined and strike the right balance on our capital allocation. We will sequence investment in line with our funding capacity and focus on the most value-accretive and lowest risk options. We are responding to tough times, but let there be no doubt in anyone's mind that we're well positioned to get through them in strong shape. 
That brings me to the end of my presentation, everyone. So we thank you for your attention. We're very happy to take questions. We've got the entire ExCo up with us at the front here, and I'm happy to shoot questions across to them. Let me just start here in London first and then move to South Africa and finally take questions on the phone."

We've taken that operation at a starting rate of about 200,000, 400,000 tonnes of iron ore up to close to 500,000 tonnes. Where's Duncan now? You've got it. We're looking at over 500,000 this year, so really outstanding. We started also with cost of around $85 per tonne, and we're now down at the mine level to about $45 or so. I mean, it's a really fantastic position, and really, the team there is doing a great job. We wanted the Minas-Rio group to be absolutely focused on delivering that project. And it was for that reason that we decided to move it off into Duncan's OMI group. We have not taken a decision in terms of what we ultimately do with Amapa, and we're always looking for creation of more shareholder value. And that's the response to that question. In terms of Minas-Rio, look, we are in a very challenging country and environment. It's a developing country. It's developing its regulatory framework. As I said, there are 50 projects or so that have been put into the delay category representing massive amounts. We did emphasize this last night to the President, and she is certainly aware. And we have made incredible progress, where we've got -- where we -- I'm going to ask Paulo to stand up here in a minute. Where we've had access to land, we have actually surpassed the targets. So we've done superbly in that regard. We've got about 92% of land access on the pipeline. We've got -- we've moved about 80% of the earthworks around the mine and beneficiation plant. We've been moving along as much as we could when we have the permits, and as I said earlier, we have 1,000 conditions and we've satisfied 60. So Jason, we are making good progress, and this is a fantastic resource that we're sitting on, probably one of the most unique in the world. Having said that, we have been set back by these unexpected, unanticipated interruptions. You would know that Vale is in exactly the same boat. They have a number of them themselves that they're dealing with. We had -- as an example, we had the permit issued to us in March on the transmission line, and a month later, it was taken away from us and we were told that no, the state could not issue it. The federal government had to issue it. So we're working through all of that. So what I would say to you, I would reiterate that this is -- given the size, the complexity, of course, there are going to be issues that we face. We're working, I can promise you, avidly on every single one on a continuous basis. I mean, this team is absolutely outstanding. We had a third-party assessment, as I mentioned, a few weeks ago. I mean, they said -- these are experts in construction. They said these guys are doing a great job, but we've got the public authorities that are in an evolution mode or environment where they're just trying to set the framework and establish themselves and so therefore, those challenges are there. So these were not anticipated, Jason, by any means. And that's what others like Vale are also dealing with. Paul, why don't you stand up and just talk a little more specifically about the process and what we're doing about it?"

I think last time, at the end of the year, we actually shared with you 4 main bottlenecks that the project had, and those included, as Cynthia mentioned, the installation license for the transmission line, regulation around one particular cave that is situated in the beneficiation plant, access to land at the beneficiation plant as well. And all these 3 that we actually shared with yourselves 6 months ago, we actually have been able to clear them all. So just to elaborate on what Cynthia said, actually, the team has managed to, A, been awarded with the transmission line license. We have worked together with the authorities to define the regulation around caves and also managed to successfully acquire 2 very important pieces of land at the beneficiation plant. However, as Cynthia highlighted, we have been facing, not dissimilar to other players in the Brazilian mining industry, with legal stoppages. These have actually tackled exactly those same bottlenecks that we mentioned, and thus, progress was very difficult to be made. Cynthia also highlighted significant progress on the areas that we had access to land at the pipeline. Similarly, at the board, I mean, we have managed over the last 6 months to complete more than 20% from last 6 months at the filtration plant, for instance, where we have no blockages or any other of these challenges. So it's just really to highlight that we shared with you the 4 key bottlenecks that we had. These have been tackled. We have been suffering with the legal stoppages. We continue to work on them, as shared with you, intensifying resources on the legal side, on the licensing and permitting side. And again, wherever we had access, progress was made."

Along the pipeline, it's the same story and then at the board as well. At the state level, I think I mentioned to you that 6 months ago, in Brazil, the regulation around caves had not been defined. We have been working very closely with the government. This has been resolved in early this year that the regulations around caves was to be done at the state. This is also a result of good relationships with the environmental authorities at state level. And as Cynthia shared with you as well, we're also making very good progress around the profiling and making even the federal level, as we said yesterday, with ministers and President Dilma herself around the issues that we're facing with Minas-Rio."

I mean, first of all, I'll just highlight that, I've shared this before and I'll repeat it, that met coal is certainly one of our favored core commodities with attractive long-term fundamentals. We've indicated to the market that we expect -- where is Seamus? We expect to increase our output quite significantly. Last year, we produced about 14 million tonnes of met coal out of Australia, and we're adding, along the way, our Peace River Coal from British Columbia very effectively. But the fact is although we're growing and we're progressing on Grosvenor and expect to reach about 45 million tonnes by 2020, we need to always be thinking about the next basin and the next phase of this business. And so we've been looking around the world at what opportunities there might be and where we can leverage our best-in-class performance out of Australia. And so we have been spending time on the ground the last couple years or so looking at Mozambique. Mozambique is obviously a neighbor to us in South Africa. We've been thinking about how do we leverage our expertise and our technical group out of South Africa and capitalize on the coal group out of Australia. And this is really what it's all about, Peter. If you look at this investment relative to some of our other peers' investments in Mozambique, I think you would note that it's a very, very good return investment on an investment or enterprise value perspective per resource. It's about 1.4 billion tonnes of resource. We can't say right now when exactly we're going to develop. That's really on the basis of development of infrastructure. I have seen the President. I have seen the Mining Minister, and Seamus has been down there a number of times, and many of our group members also are very familiar with Mozambique. So we think it's an opportunity to leverage a high-quality resource base with our expertise, okay? Thank you very much. Let me take a question from South Africa."

The fact is you're familiar with the Platinum business. It's pretty complex. We've got 12 operating mines. We've got 7 joint ventures. We've got 58,000 people. We've got -- if you multiply that by about 10, the numbers of people that we impact on a continuous basis is massive. What we have also said at the outset is that Platinum is a key differentiator for Anglo American, and we believe in the fundamentals, and we believe that the outlook for demand in terms of growth is in the neighborhood of 4% to 5% medium to longer term. And in terms of supply growth, we're talking about something around 3%, 3% to 4%. So we do think that there will be a gap that does develop over time in terms of the ability of the industry to satisfy the longer-term demand. Now the other fact, as you know, is we're the ones sitting on the optionality of resource. We've got the choices that we can potentially make, and that's why all of this does take time in terms of the complexity of the business and the time to debate all the issues. Furthermore, with the backdrop of South Africa, where there are calls for job creation, people looking to take positions with respect to the labor, so competing labor unions. And you saw that with respect to Impala at the start of the year, where they lost about 150,000 ounces. So we've got to be very thoughtful about how we take this and how we think about all the options and once we make a decision, how we then share those decisions. They will not be taken alone or independently. So now your question about how do we inform the markets, we've got to get Chris onboard. Where's Chris? Chris is all webbed up and excited to go, but he's got to finish some things at Kumba. He'll be in the job, as I said earlier, on the 1st of September. He's got to get his feet on the ground. He's going to be the one, at the end of the day, at the helm of moving this forward and taking those decisions into the implementation mode. So we need to give him some time. It will -- no decisions have been taken yet on where we are. No decisions on asset. I'll remind you again we've taken out 60,000 ounces. We are looking at where those high-cost operations are and what we can do with them, and that's really the mode that we're in right now. But nothing is on the table, and as I said, it's a broad-ranging review, from all the way up to the resource base, all the way down to sales and marketing. And that's about all I'm going to say right now. I'm not going to get into any discussions that we're having with stakeholders or any other groups because, as I said, there's a lot involved, okay?

René mentioned the Moranbah drift issue we had in December of last year. The rehabilitation of that took us through to February, so recommissioning of the Moranbah mine started in February and effectively went through to April. In parallel with the recommencement of production in February, we completed a full life of mine rehabilitation, not just of the conveyor drift but also of the equipment drift as well. So we've actually upgraded both drifts to a life-of-mine standard for the remaining life of the Moranbah mine. But it gave us 2 very different quarters. It impacted 2 things. Firstly, product mix. So product mix for the first half of the year in terms of total export production was 50% hard coking coal and 29% PCI. That will swing around in the second half of the year to about 57% hard coking coal and 20% PCI. The second thing it impacted on, obviously, was unit cost. Average for the year Australian -- for the half year Australian operations FOB cost, excluding royalties, was $111, but the first quarter was $129 and the second quarter was $97. So 2 very different quarters. The rest of the year, we're looking at probably mid 90s. Again, the carbon tax does kick in from July, so there's impact there, a few dollars a ton. We're looking at an average in the mid 90s for the second half of the year. So the second quarter was very much what we call a normal quarter, but the first quarter, very much skewed by that ramp up at Moranbah. In our costs, too, we have some exceptional items relating to the ongoing divestment of Callide, which we would hope are one-offs in the first half of the year as well."

Just to start, I think the ramp-up of the Los Bronces project has been a huge success. We're sitting sort of with throughput rates which are sort of, on a day-by-day basis, we’re actually exceeding designed capacity, and on a month basis, we got up to 92% of throughput capacity to date. I think the challenge that we've got at Los Bronces is the state of mine development. Whilst the overall -- you asked about grades. The overall grade for the deposit remains exactly as we have forecasted. Accessing those grades obviously depends on having sufficient flexibility with sufficient mining development to be able to get to those. And in terms of keeping what's now a plant that requires more than double the amount of feed fed, we've dropped the grade somewhat in terms of making sure that we maintain the feed rates. Obviously, in the longer term, the key plan is to improve upon the mine development, get to a point where we're back to having sufficient flexibility to be able to do the selective mining and be able to access those higher-grade areas sort of in the nearer term. Moving on to Collahuasi, there are a number of parts to the issues at Collahuasi. I think the first was 2012 was always expected to be a tough year in terms of grades. And those grades are, as we expect them, we’re moving through a lower-grade zone of the mine. I think from last year, we had 1.03% copper. The grade for the year-to-date is 0.79%. That obviously has a very major impact both on production and on unit cost. But obviously, there have been some other issues as well. We were impacted in first few months of the year by a very severe altiplanic winter. The whole northern part of Chile suffered severe floods, and we had the pit flooded and various sort of damage to various bits and pieces of infrastructure during that, which caused an impact. Secondly, in March, we had a failure or a crack appear in one of the ball mills. That crack has taken some time to repair. Ultimately, it's going to require the replacement of that shell, but what we're doing is a repair which can last up until that new shell is constructed. So from March, the expected completion date of that ball mill repair is the end of August, and that obviously has had an impact on our overall throughput. The third factor that’s impacted on us is recoveries, and because of the area in the mine where we're going through having lost the grade, I mentioned that 0.79% is total copper; it's at higher percentages than we had expected of what's called soluble copper so nonrecoverable copper in our floatation plants. Our recoveries have dropped as well. Now certainly, as one of the joint venture partners of Collahuasi, we've not been satisfied with this performance. This is not the first year we've suffered issues with infrastructure and issues with production, and so what we actually decided to do as sort of -- as a joint venture partners is really engage in a very intensive business improvement plan. We've put in place 2 senior executives, 1 from ourselves, 1 from Xstrata, as joint CEOs for a period of 3 to 6 months. We've put in 30 specialists from the shareholders to actually support in -- I think we've done a very good diagnosis of what the challenges are. We've performed an operational review towards the end of last year. That's given us a very clear guideline as to where the opportunities lie for improvement. What has been lacking at Collahuasi is the capacity to implement a lot of those things, and so with this team that we've put in place, we do have high expectations that they will be able to resolve a lot of these underlying challenges and set Collahuasi on the path to achieve the sort of performance that we expect."

I'll start by giving you the highlights of what we have achieved this year. We'll also look at the operational performance, and René will take you through the financials. I'll then say a few words about the outlook and our disciplined approach to allocating capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value. 
You have heard me talk about the journey we started more than 5 years ago to turn around performance across the group. As a result, we have a performance-driven culture and we strive for continued improvements across all areas of the business. We took the hard decisions early on to restructure our organization, and we've largely completed our divestment program to focus on the right commodities. We've generated almost $4 billion in proceeds, and during the first half of 2012, we absorbed more volatility in the external trending environment. 
Prices eased from last year. René will show you a little later that this reduced operating profit by almost $2 billion. As a result, our operating profit was down by 38% to $3.7 billion. 
Our decision to invest through the cycle, however, positioned us well to continue delivering volume growth at attractive returns. We've been very consistent about supporting and growing Tier 1 assets, and the projects we completed last year are ramping up well. 
At the Los Bronces expansion, mill throughput is already at 92%, an industry-leading performance. Kolomela was completed on budget and 5 months ahead of schedule, and it will produce 6 million tonnes this year, exceeding the previous guidance of 4 million to 5 million tonnes. As I've often highlighted, these projects are very competitive from an operating and capital cost standpoint. Take the Los Bronces expansion project. Its capital intensity is more than 30% lower than a recently announced project in Chile. And beyond organic growth, we've simplified our minority ownership of De Beers by moving on our position of control. 
And we've also acquired an additional 4.5% stake in Kumba, bringing our total holdings to almost 70%. Increasing our stake in Kumba aligns with our strategic objective of investing in large-scale assets that are long-life, low-cost profiles and have clear expansion potential. This acquisition is a low-risk acquisition, an immediately cash-generative transaction that will deliver long-term value. I'll shortly provide you with more detail on Kumba's continuing strong performance. 
Turning to Mozambique, our decision to acquire a stake in Revuboè project aligns with our stated objective of building a global metallurgical coal business. Through this transaction, we're securing a high-quality metallurgical coal resource potential and position in the Moatize coal basin in Mozambique. The project's expected competitive operating cost makes this a compelling long-term opportunity. 
I'll take you through our operating performance a little later, but before doing this, I wish to reiterate that every decision that we have taken and will continue to take has a single objective of maximizing shareholder value. We are achieving this through a disciplined and prudent approach to managing our business and allocating capital. 
In the past few years, we've reduced our workforce worldwide by about 50,000 people. We have turned around performance across our group, including Metallurgical Coal and Iron Ore. And as a result, the majority of our operations are on the lower half of the cost curve, and we will continue to drive down cost. No matter where we are in the cycle, our focus is fixed on delivering value to our shoulders, and that's why, given the current volatile market, we're pleased to declare a dividend of $0.32 per share, an increase of 14%, and we are determined to sustain this level of dividend. 
So before I turn to the operating performance, I'd like to say a few words on safety, our #1 priority. 
We've made progress since the start of our journey towards 0 harm 5 years ago. Injury severity rates have fallen, and there's also been about a 56% reduction in fatality rates over that period. We've shown 0 harm is achievable in all parts of the organization, and about 94% of our operations are fatality-free. 
Kolomela achieved over 25 million man-hours without an LTI. Minas-Rio achieved 30 million man-hours without an LTI. And since the start of the year, however, 7 of our colleagues have lost their lives, which I'm sure you would agree with me is unacceptable, and there is absolutely no room for complacency on safety. So we have reinforced the message in April at our senior leadership safety summit in South Africa, and we've tapped into our collective knowledge to find ways to share our best practice and to make what we do on a continuous basis that much more effective. 
Turning to operating performance. Starting with Iron Ore and Manganese. Following a record profit in 2011, Iron Ore continued to deliver strong operational performance. Weaker prices and cost inflation have more than offset the operational gains, and despite strong headwinds, Kumba's margins remain healthy at 56%. Kolomela is a world-class iron ore operation. Some of you in Johannesburg can certainly attest to this. It showcases Anglo American's and South Africa's ability to deliver large, complex projects, and let me remind you of a few facts. Kolomela was completed on budget and 5 months ahead of schedule. Capital intensity is as much as 60% lower than other current Iron Ore projects. Cash cost delivered to China is around $55 per tonne, and the payback period is less than 3 years. 
Now turning to our biggest project, Minas-Rio. We've continued to confirm that this is a high-quality iron ore resource with significant expansion potential, and despite the current challenges, Minas-Rio will prove to be a major contributor to the group for many decades to come. 
This is one of the largest and most complex projects in the world and certainly in Brazil. It spans 527 kilometers from the Atlantic coast to the Minas Gerais state. And to deliver Minas-Rio, our team has been managing over 130 licenses. In fact, today, we've achieved close to 200, covering the mine, covering the beneficiation plant, pipeline and port. At the same time, we continue to make headway in meeting our license condition, and around 60% of 1,000 conditions have been completed already. These licenses and permits are granted by different government entities at the state level, at the federal level and at the municipal level. And despite this progress, we are experiencing delays, including legal interruptions and the presence of caves at the beneficiation plant site. 
That said, we're not alone. As you can see, project delays are common in Brazil, impacting both industry as well as government. I discussed this last night with the President of Brazil, the Secretary of State and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. To place this into context, some 40 projects worth approximately $225 billion are currently facing delays averaging 24 months, and they include nongovernment infrastructure projects. We strengthened the projects and permitting teams reporting to Paulo Castellari, who's here with us today, and we transferred Amapa to OMI and freed up the team to focus on the task at hand. 
However, until these hurdles are cleared, we cannot determine with confidence the date of first production. If we manage to clear all current bottlenecks by the end of the year this year and experience no further unexpected interventions, we expect to be in a position to ship first ore in the second half of 2014. The project budget is being reviewed following a detailed assessment of the schedule by a third party, and I'll provide an update by the end of the year. 
All right. Turning to Metallurgical Coal. Record production was delivered in the first half of the year. Our Queensland business continued its journey of strong performance, particularly in our open cut mines, which delivered record production. This resulted from a proactive rain mitigation program and best-in-class equipment utilization. 
We're also tackling cost inflation through disciplined cost reduction, and we've laid the foundation to outperform our peers. The 5 million-tonne Grosvenor project, the first of 4 underground hard coking coal projects, secured its mining license in the first half, and this project places us on track to more than double our hard coking coal production by 2020. These are high-quality, low-cost brownfield and greenfield operations leveraging existing infrastructure in our own backyard. 
Thermal Coal continued to perform strongly despite weaker prices. Sales from South African operation performed strongly and were up 22%. 
Zibulo is continuing to ramp up, and we are protecting our advantaged margin position by closing high-cost sections in South Africa. We've adjusted our export product mix in South Africa in response to changing demand, and in Colombia, Cerrejon delivered record production, up 18% on the previous half. Norman Mbazima has done a great job, and we look forward to Godfrey Gomwe, who's here with us this morning, taking performance to the next level, right, Godfrey, as Norman heads to Kumba. 
Turning to Copper. As I mentioned earlier, the Los Bronces expansion is ramping up strongly. It's achieved 92% of nameplate capacity, and like others in the industry, however, the established part of the mine will continue to be impacted by declining grades. 
Production from Collahuasi fell due to expected lower grades, adverse weather condition and a ball mill failure, and we expect some of these challenges to continue into the second half, with repairs to the ball mill due for completion by the end of August. However, overall copper production at Collahuasi is expected to gradually improve in the second half of the year, and this will be due to the business improvement plan initiated by the joint venture partners in June starting to take effect. We will be giving further updates to the market in due course. 
In Peru, we successfully completed the Quellaveco dialogue table and we've reached agreement on social and environmental contribution to be made as part of the project. This was a first engagement process of its type ever undertaken in Peru involving government, the community and a mining company, and it's a clear demonstration of the value we place on engagement and the development of sustainable communities. We will continue to work with the Peruvian government to secure the outstanding permits prior to submitting the project for board consideration. 
Turning to nickel. Nickel generated an operating profit of $58 million. Production increased by 80% following the completion of the Barro Alto project last year. Barro Alto is ramping up well, and its line 1 is achieving average feed rate of more than 70% of capacity. With improving feed rates, grade and recovery, we expect targeting full capacity in 2013. 
De Beers delivered a sound operating profit of $250 million in the first half. After a very strong start to 2011, difficult trading conditions experienced at the end of that year continued into 2012. And despite these challenges, rough diamond price levels remain relatively stable. In the meantime, De Beers' mines continue to focus on eliminating waste stripping on -- they were focused on eliminating waste stripping and maintenance backlogs. 
Infrastructure construction at Debswana's Jwaneng Cut-8 extension project is now 98% complete, and looking to the future, we see continued strong long-term demand growth for luxury goods, with compound annual growth up to 9%. 
Chinese demand is still expected to show double-digit percentage growth this year alone, supporting moderately positive growth in global diamond jewelry sales; 2/3 of Chinese future wealth creation will come from Tier 3 and Tier 4 areas. 
So we are well positioned with a diverse portfolio to take advantage of this late-cycle development. And I welcome Bruce Cleaver and Gareth Mostyn, who are members of the De Beers team, with us today, and I look forward to the De Beers acquisition reaching its conclusion shortly. 
As you're aware, the platinum industry is facing significant headwinds. Economic uncertainty in Europe continues to have a negative impact on demand. Mining inflation has remained well above the South African consumer price index. As a result, operating profit is increased by 85%. In the short term, we expect demand to remain subdued, while in the medium to longer term, we expect the market to rebalance. Our response to the situation has been thoughtful and disciplined. We've made significant progress in Platinum since 2008. Productivity between 2008 and 2010 increased by 25%. Safety has significantly improved, and over 60% of our production is now in the low end of the cost curve. However, we are experiencing the same conditions as the rest of the industry, and while our margins of 11% is in line with the rest of the industry, we recognize that it is not acceptable. 
In the short term, what are we doing? First, together with our joint venture partner, we placed the Marikana mine under care and maintenance. Second, we will go beyond our capital reduction target for Platinum and deliver a cut of almost $200 million by the end of the year. Third, we are reviewing our overhead cost, and we also continue to review the shape and the scale of the business. The key objective is to thoroughly assess the options available to establish a long-term portfolio with sustainable competitive advantages that will maximize value, and we will look at the entire value chain from resources to mining to processes, sales and marketing and people. And no option is off the table, and we will retain Platinum as a part of Anglo American. That is a starting point. 
As I've outlined in February, this review will be completed by the end of the year, and as you're aware, Neville resigned as CEO of Anglo Platinum a week ago. Chris has been appointed to succeed him from the 1st of September, and Chris, as many of you know, brings a lot of experience. He’s spent 18 years in the Platinum business with deep knowledge of that business. So I'm looking forward to having Chris as an integral part of that review. 
I'll now turn it over to René, who will take you through the financials."
409115,214548558,334176,"Anglo American plc, H1 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2012",2012-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thank you, Cynthia, and good morning, everybody. For the first half of this year, we are reporting an operating profit of $3.7 billion, a decline of 38%.

For the first half of this year, we are reporting an operating profit of $3.7 billion, a decline of 38%. Obviously, the major impact came from the decline in commodity prices that was somewhat mitigated by the additional production from the 3 projects that we commissioned in 2011.
The level of tax rate for the first half was 30.3%, below last year, 31.8%. For the full year, we are projecting a level of tax rate between 30% and 31%. 
EPS of $1.38. The impact of the Mitsubishi transaction was $0.03 in the first half of this year and the conversion of the convertible, just $0.01. 
Now if you turn to the operating profit waterfall, Cynthia already mentioned close to a $2 billion price variance. $1.8 billion, that's the exact number. That was predominantly in the second quarter, $1.4 billion in the second quarter as price started to decline at the end of March. 
Volume increased, a positive volume variance, mostly driven by the ramp-up at Kolomela and the Los Bronces expansion offsetting the shortfall at more predominantly the mines in Chile, the existing mine at Collahuasi and Los Bronces, as well as in Platinum. 
Looking at in more detail the various variances. First, starting with the price variance for base and precious. Platinum price in rand was, in fact, flat, around ZAR 20,000, with the rand decline almost offsetting the decline in U.S. dollar. Now that was the case up to end of June. Over the last few weeks, the basket price has declined to ZAR 18,000. 
In the case of Copper, the realized price was $3.70 in the first half of this year compared to $4.22 last year. At end of June, we add 116,000 tonnes of copper, which were provisionally priced at $3.49. 
Turning to bulk, iron ore price declined to $134 a tonne compared to $169 a tonne in the first half of 2011. That's, in fact, very -- that's the FOB price from South Africa, very similar, in fact, to the sea freight in China, with the benefit of the quality of Kumba products and the loan premium offsetting the freight cost between South Africa and China. 
In the case of met coal, we had the benefit in terms of prices at the beginning of 2011 of the flooding in Queensland, so an average price last year of $251 a tonne, down to $191 a tonne in the first half of this year, a mix issue also in the first half of this year with the collapse of the Moranbah roof early -- at the end of 2011, which impacted the product mix. 
Turning to the volume variance, except Platinum, all business units reported an increase in volume. Kumba copper and nickel got the benefit of the 3 projects which were commissioned last year. 
In the case of Platinum, the sale volume was down 21%, and we had some problem earlier this year with the platinum converter following the annual methanol shutdown. 
In the case of met coal, the volume was up 38% as we got the benefit of higher productivity but also the benefit of the weak -- the rain mitigating investment, which were implemented by the unit at the end of 2011 and early 2012. 
Turning to cash cost, you remember that last year, we reported 8% real cash cost increase. So a key issue for us is as we see pressure on prices, how are the cost line reacting. We have seen a slowdown to 4% real cash cost increase. We expect a further decline in the second half. Our current projection is it will come down to 2% in the second half of 2012. 
Turning to CapEx and net debt. CapEx of $2.3 billion in the first half. For the full year, we are projecting $5.5 billion. That's down $1.5 billion compared to our guidance at the beginning of the year, and Cynthia will cover later what does that mean in terms of capital allocation and our focus on reducing the level of capital intensity. 
The level of net debt, $3.1 billion at end of June. If you factor the impact of the De Beers acquisition and the Revuboè acquisition in Mozambique on a pro forma basis, $10 billion. Our level of headroom at end of June stood at $19 billion, with $11.3 billion in cash and $8 billion of undrawn committed facilities. Thank you."

There is no doubt that the global economic environment has deteriorated, driven by the crisis in the Eurozone. And there is continuing uncertainty over the sustainability of the U.S. economic recovery. 
 
China's slowdown in growth rate is also contributing to the fragile short-term outlook, but in the longer term, we continue to see resilient commodity demand, and this is driven by rising living standards in emerging countries, such as China and India, and infrastructure replacement in developed countries. 
If current trends are sustained, by 2025, cities around the world will build the equivalent of the land mass of Austria in residential and commercial floorspace, and this will require cumulative investment totaling around $80 trillion. 
As development in emerging countries shifts over time from investment to consumption, growth rates in steel demand should moderate, and the expanding middle classes in many emerging countries should boost consumption of platinum and diamonds as that transition occurs. 1 billion people are forecast to enter the consuming classes by 2025, and our diversified and balanced portfolio positions us well to take advantage of the structural changes in the global economy. 
Of course, that's only part of the story. What's happening on supply is just as important. Prices will be underpinned by supply constraint, as well as difficulties producers face to deliver that supply. As I mentioned earlier, projects are facing significant delays as a result of increasingly complex planning and permitting regimes. 
Developing and developed countries alike are seeking a larger slice of the mining cake, whether it's through joint ventures with mining companies, windfall taxes, increased royalties and in some cases, expropriating mining assets. Remaining resources are located in places that are harder to access and have underdeveloped or nonexistent infrastructure. At the same time, mining itself is becoming more difficult, more challenging, with existing operations facing greater declines and higher waste stripping. 
In an industry that thinks in decades, not in years, capital allocation and balance sheet management required discipline and sound judgment. Our resilient and well-diversified portfolio is the outcome of adhering to a clear and consistent strategy. We have invested in the right commodities, in the right high-quality and low-cost assets at the right time, and we still have the best pipeline of growth options in the industry. Progress to date sees us well positioned to establish a new balance between rewarding our shareholders and investing in growth. 
Shareholders have been very clear with us about the need to strike a balance, and we have listened and we've responded in a way that achieves both objectives. 
Today, we increased our dividend by 14% despite a reported lower earnings, and we're determined to maintain and build on this new base through the cycle. It is a strong signal of our commitment to striking a balance between maintaining a strong investment rating, returns to shareholders and sequencing future investment in line with resulting funding capacity. 
We recognize that future cash flow will be impacted by both economic uncertainty and higher capital and operating cost. To maintain our investment rating and dividend to shareholders, we will stage our investment. 
As guided previously, CapEx budgeted for 2012, as René said, $7 billion is what we said at the beginning of the year. The revised guidance, as you will see from the bottom of this chart, will be $5.5 billion. In addition, we are deferring $200 million in exploration and early-study development expenses in 2012. 
For 2013, we have set a CapEx funding target of $6 billion, and the 2013 funding target for exploration and early studies will be $600 million, down a further $300 million on 2012. Investment will be directed to the most value-accretive and lowest risk options. 
As you know, we have the most diversified and balanced portfolio in the industry. That remains the case. Our operations and project pipeline are, in advantage commodities, at the lower end of the cost curve and offering attractive returns throughout the cycle. We will continue to capitalize on the value inherent in these options, and we will focus on projects aiming to deliver the highest sustainable returns within the shortest and the lowest risk timetable. Our investments will be sequenced to take advantage of all stages of development in emerging countries. In a world of developing -- diminishing Tier 1 assets and with mining becoming ever more challenging, our portfolio truly gives us a competitive advantage. 
With that in mind, I'd like to conclude by reminding you that the journey we started 5 years ago has embedded a high-performance culture in this organization. We deliver on our commitments. Safety has improved. Non-core assets have been largely divested, and we've turned around our businesses. Our decision to invest through the cycle in 2008 positioned us well to continue delivering volume growth. The projects completed last year are ramping up well and generating strong cash flows. 
That has been made possible because we have a clear and consistent strategy. As you know, we invest in commodities with the strongest long-term fundamentals and the most attractive risk return profiles. The bulk of our operations are at the lower end of the cost curve, and we will continue to drive down cost. 
However, challenges remain. With respect to Platinum, clearly, there is no silver bullet. We've come a long way at Platinum, with an improved cost position. While our returns are in line with the industry, they are not acceptable. As I said earlier, they are not acceptable to us for the medium to long term, and we are working through the Platinum review to assess the optimal configuration of the portfolio. This will take time, and it will not be easy. And in light of the current volatile environment, discipline is paramount. 
At a group level, we will also be disciplined and strike the right balance on our capital allocation. We will sequence investment in line with our funding capacity and focus on the most value-accretive and lowest risk options. We are responding to tough times, but let there be no doubt in anyone's mind that we're well positioned to get through them in strong shape. 
That brings me to the end of my presentation, everyone. So we thank you for your attention. We're very happy to take questions. We've got the entire ExCo up with us at the front here, and I'm happy to shoot questions across to them. Let me just start here in London first and then move to South Africa and finally take questions on the phone."

We've taken that operation at a starting rate of about 200,000, 400,000 tonnes of iron ore up to close to 500,000. Where's Duncan now? You've got it. We're looking at over 500,000 this year, so really outstanding. We started also with cost of around $85 per tonne, and we're now down at the mine level to about $45 or so. I mean, it's a really fantastic position, and really, the team there is doing a great job. We wanted the Minas-Rio group to be absolutely focused on delivering that project. And it was for that reason that we decided to move it off into Duncan's OMI group. We have not taken a decision in terms of what we ultimately do with Amapa, and we're always looking for creation of more shareholder value. And that's the response to that question. In terms of Minas-Rio, look, we are in a very challenging country and environment. It's a developing country. It's developing its regulatory framework. As I said, there are 50 projects or so that have been put into the delay category representing massive amounts. We did emphasize this last night to the President, and she is certainly aware. And we have made incredible progress, where we've got -- where we -- I'm going to ask Paulo to stand up here in a minute. Where we've had access to land, we have actually surpassed the targets. So we've done superbly in that regard. We've got about 92% of land access on the pipeline. We've got -- we've moved about 80% of the earthworks around the mine and beneficiation plant. We've been moving along as much as we could when we have the permits, and as I said earlier, we have 1,000 conditions and we've satisfied 60. So Jason, we are making good progress, and this is a fantastic resource that we're sitting on, probably one of the most unique in the world. Having said that, we have been set back by these unexpected, unanticipated interruptions. You would know that Vale is in exactly the same boat. They have a number of them themselves that they're dealing with. We had -- as an example, we had the permit issued to us in March on the transmission line, and a month later, it was taken away from us and we were told that no, the state could not issue it. The federal government had to issue it. So we're working through all of that. So what I would say to you, I would reiterate that this is -- given the size, the complexity, of course, there are going to be issues that we face. We're working, I can promise you, avidly on every single one on a continuous basis. I mean, this team is absolutely outstanding. We had a third-party assessment, as I mentioned, a few weeks ago. I mean, they said -- these are experts in construction. They said these guys are doing a great job, but we've got the public authorities that are in an evolution mode or environment where they're just trying to set the framework and establish themselves and so therefore, those challenges are there. So these were not anticipated, Jason, by any means. And that's what others like Vale are also dealing with. Paul, why don't you stand up and just talk a little more specifically about the process and what we're doing about it?"

I think last time, at the end of the year, we actually shared with you 4 main bottlenecks that the project had, and those included, as Cynthia mentioned, the installation license for the transmission line, regulation around one particular cave that is situated in the beneficiation plant, access to land at the beneficiation plant as well. And all these 3 that we actually shared with yourselves 6 months ago, we actually have been able to clear them all. So just to elaborate on what Cynthia said, actually, the team has managed to, A, been awarded with the transmission line license. We have worked together with the authorities to define the regulation around caves and also managed to successfully acquire 2 very important pieces of land at the beneficiation plant. However, as Cynthia highlighted, we have been facing, not dissimilar to other players in the Brazilian mining industry, with legal stoppages. These have actually tackled exactly those same bottlenecks that we mentioned, and thus, progress was very difficult to be made. Cynthia also highlighted significant progress on the areas that we had access to land at the pipeline. Similarly, at the board, I mean, we have managed over the last 6 months to complete more than 20% from last 6 months at the filtration plant, for instance, where we have no blockages or any other of these challenges. So it's just really to highlight that we shared with you the 4 key bottlenecks that we had. These have been tackled. We have been suffering with the legal stoppages.

We have been working very closely with the government. This has been resolved in early this year that the regulations around caves was to be done at the state. This is also a result of good relationships with the environmental authorities at state level. And as Cynthia shared with you as well, we're also making very good progress around the profiling and making even the federal level, as we said yesterday, with ministers and President Dilma herself around the issues that we're facing with Minas-Rio."

I mean, first of all, I'll just highlight that, I've shared this before and I'll repeat it, that met coal is certainly one of our favored core commodities with attractive long-term fundamentals. We've indicated to the market that we expect -- where is Seamus? We expect to increase our output quite significantly. Last year, we produced about 14 million tonnes of met coal out of Australia, and we're adding, along the way, our Peace River Coal from British Columbia very effectively. But the fact is although we're growing and we're progressing on Grosvenor and expect to reach about 45 million tonnes by 2020, we need to always be thinking about the next basin and the next phase of this business. And so we've been looking around the world at what opportunities there might be and where we can leverage our best-in-class performance out of Australia. And so we have been spending time on the ground the last couple years or so looking at Mozambique. Mozambique is obviously a neighbor to us in South Africa. We've been thinking about how do we leverage our expertise and our technical group out of South Africa and capitalize on the coal group out of Australia. And this is really what it's all about, Peter. If you look at this investment relative to some of our other peers' investments in Mozambique, I think you would note that it's a very, very good return investment on an investment or enterprise value perspective per resource. It's about 1.4 billion tonnes of resource. We can't say right now when exactly we're going to develop. That's really on the basis of development of infrastructure. I have seen the President. I have seen the Mining Minister, and Seamus has been down there a number of times, and many of our group members also are very familiar with Mozambique. So we think it's an opportunity to leverage a high-quality resource base with our expertise, okay? Thank you very much. Let me take a question from South Africa."

The fact is you're familiar with the Platinum business. It's pretty complex. We've got 12 operating mines. We've got 7 joint ventures. We've got 58,000 people. We've got -- if you multiply that by about 10, the numbers of people that we impact on a continuous basis is massive. What we have also said at the outset is that Platinum is a key differentiator for Anglo American, and we believe in the fundamentals, and we believe that the outlook for demand in terms of growth is in the neighborhood of 4% to 5% medium to longer term. And in terms of supply growth, we're talking about something around 3%, 3% to 4%. So we do think that there will be a gap that does develop over time in terms of the ability of the industry to satisfy the longer-term demand. Now the other fact, as you know, is we're the ones sitting on the optionality of resource. We've got the choices that we can potentially make, and that's why all of this does take time in terms of the complexity of the business and the time to debate all the issues. Furthermore, with the backdrop of South Africa, where there are calls for job creation, people looking to take positions with respect to the labor, so competing labor unions. And you saw that with respect to Impala at the start of the year, where they lost about 150,000 ounces. So we've got to be very thoughtful about how we take this and how we think about all the options and once we make a decision, how we then share those decisions. They will not be taken alone or independently. So now your question about how do we inform the markets, we've got to get Chris onboard. Where's Chris? Chris is all webbed up and excited to go, but he's got to finish some things at Kumba. He'll be in the job, as I said earlier, on the 1st of September. He's got to get his feet on the ground. He's going to be the one, at the end of the day, at the helm of moving this forward and taking those decisions into the implementation mode. So we need to give him some time. It will -- no decisions have been taken yet on where we are. No decisions on asset. I'll remind you again we've taken out 60,000 ounces. We are looking at where those high-cost operations are and what we can do with them, and that's really the mode that we're in right now. But nothing is on the table, and as I said, it's a broad-ranging review, from all the way up to the resource base, all the way down to sales and marketing. And that's about all I'm going to say right now. I'm not going to get into any discussions that we're having with stakeholders or any other groups because, as I said, there's a lot involved, okay?

René mentioned the Moranbah drift issue we had in December of last year. The rehabilitation of that took us through to February, so recommissioning of the Moranbah mine started in February and effectively went through to April. In parallel with the recommencement of production in February, we completed a full life of mine rehabilitation, not just of the conveyor drift but also of the equipment drift as well. So we've actually upgraded both drifts to a life-of-mine standard for the remaining life of the Moranbah mine. But it gave us 2 very different quarters. It impacted 2 things. Firstly, product mix. So product mix for the first half of the year in terms of total export production was 50% hard coking coal and 29% PCI. That will swing around in the second half of the year to about 57% hard coking coal and 20% PCI. The second thing it impacted on, obviously, was unit cost. Average for the year Australian -- for the half year Australian operations FOB cost, excluding royalties, was $111, but the first quarter was $129 and the second quarter was $97. So 2 very different quarters. The rest of the year, we're looking at probably mid 90s. Again, the carbon tax does kick in from July, so there's impact there, a few dollars a ton. We're looking at an average in the mid 90s for the second half of the year. So the second quarter was very much what we call a normal quarter, but the first quarter, very much skewed by that ramp up at Moranbah. In our costs, too, we have some exceptional items relating to the ongoing divestment of Callide, which we would hope are one-offs in the first half of the year as well."

Just to start, I think the ramp-up of the Los Bronces project has been a huge success. We're sitting sort of with throughput rates which are sort of, on a day-by-day basis, we’re actually exceeding designed capacity, and on a month basis, we got up to 92% of throughput capacity to date. I think the challenge that we've got at Los Bronces is the state of mine development. Whilst the overall -- you asked about grades. The overall grade for the deposit remains exactly as we have forecasted. Accessing those grades obviously depends on having sufficient flexibility with sufficient mining development to be able to get to those. And in terms of keeping what's now a plant that requires more than double the amount of feed fed, we've dropped the grade somewhat in terms of making sure that we maintain the feed rates. Obviously, in the longer term, the key plan is to improve upon the mine development, get to a point where we're back to having sufficient flexibility to be able to do the selective mining and be able to access those higher-grade areas sort of in the nearer term. Moving on to Collahuasi, there are a number of parts to the issues at Collahuasi. I think the first was 2012 was always expected to be a tough year in terms of grades. And those grades are, as we expect them, we’re moving through a lower-grade zone of the mine. I think from last year, we had 1.03% copper. The grade for the year-to-date is 0.79%. That obviously has a very major impact both on production and on unit cost. But obviously, there have been some other issues as well. We were impacted in first few months of the year by a very severe altiplanic winter. The whole northern part of Chile suffered severe floods, and we had the pit flooded and various sort of damage to various bits and pieces of infrastructure during that, which caused an impact. Secondly, in March, we had a failure or a crack appear in one of the ball mills. That crack has taken some time to repair. Ultimately, it's going to require the replacement of that shell, but what we're doing is a repair which can last up until that new shell is constructed. So from March, the expected completion date of that ball mill repair is the end of August, and that obviously has had an impact on our overall throughput. The third factor that’s impacted on us is recoveries, and because of the area in the mine where we're going through having lost the grade, I mentioned that 0.79% is total copper; it's at higher percentages than we had expected of what's called soluble copper so nonrecoverable copper in our floatation plants. Our recoveries have dropped as well. Now certainly, as one of the joint venture partners of Collahuasi, we've not been satisfied with this performance. This is not the first year we've suffered issues with infrastructure and issues with production, and so what we actually decided to do as sort of -- as a joint venture partners is really engage in a very intensive business improvement plan. We've put in place 2 senior executives, 1 from ourselves, 1 from Xstrata, as joint CEOs for a period of 3 to 6 months. We've put in 30 specialists from the shareholders to actually support in -- I think we've done a very good diagnosis of what the challenges are. We've performed an operational review towards the end of last year. That's given us a very clear guideline as to where the opportunities lie for improvement. What has been lacking at Collahuasi is the capacity to implement a lot of those things, and so with this team that we've put in place, we do have high expectations that they will be able to resolve a lot of these underlying challenges and set Collahuasi on the path to achieve the sort of performance that we expect."
