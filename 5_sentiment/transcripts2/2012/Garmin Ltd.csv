As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered strong results in the fourth quarter with consolidated revenues increasing 9% year-over-year to $910 million. This growth was broad-based with each of our",2342,"Thank you, Kerry, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered strong results in the fourth quarter with consolidated revenues increasing 9% year-over-year to $910 million. This growth was broad-based with each of our business segments contributing. Gross margins improved year-over-year, up 240 basis points to 47.7%. Revenue growth combined with improved gross margins resulted in both operating income and EPS growth. Operating income for the quarter grew 8% while pro forma EPS came in at $0.96, a 16% improvement over the prior year.
As a group, our traditional market segments of aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness contributed 61% of our total operating income for the quarter. An revenue from these segments grew nearly 19%. We sold 6.1 million units in the quarter, which was flat year-over-year. Auto PND unit volume was down slightly. However, this was offset by higher volumes in outdoor, fitness and marine.
We generated $213 million in free cash flow during the quarter resulting in a cash balance of just under $2.5 billion.
Looking at highlights for the full year, consolidated revenue increased 3% as new product categories increased market share, and emerging market opportunities delivered results that exceeded the expectations we established at the beginning of the year. 
As a group, our traditional market segments grew 14% contributing $1.2 billion in total revenue for the year. The revenue growth in these segments combined with their strong margin profiles generated 71% of our operating income. We delivered over 15.8 million units and 2011, a decline of only 1% year-over-year. Weakness in the North American PND market was partially offset by stronger PND shipments to the EMEA and APAC markets. Unit growth in the outdoor, fitness and marine markets also helped close the gap.
From a geographical perspective, the EMEA region grew 19%, outpacing all other geographies. All market segments contributed to the growth including PND. We generated $784 million of free cash flow in the year, which was partially used to fund our quarterly dividend and to compete numerous acquisitions aimed at further diversifying our revenue base. Next, we will review each of our business segments highlighting 2011 performance, outlook for 2012 and a summary of long-term strategic initiatives.
Starting with the Marine segment, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 12% driven by improved market conditions and share gains across our product portfolio. We experienced strong market share gains in the OEM segment and expanded our presence in the inland markets with the introduction of our new echo fishfinders. During the year, we expanded our product portfolio with sonar and autopilot solutions that brought new innovation to the marine market and enhanced our ability to serve the sail and large boat market. Throughout the year, we invested heavily in the Marine segment with increased research and development, and we built additional support infrastructure to serve our growing base of OEM customers. This has compressed margins in the near term. However, we're confident that these are investors are critically growing revenue and market share going forward.
For 2012, we are targeting revenue growth of 5% to 10% in the Marine segment as market conditions continue to improve and as recent OEM wins and product introductions provide revenue contributions for the full year. 
At last week's Miami Boat Show, we announced relationships with Teleflex and Viking, both of which will target the larger boat market and will contribute to revenue in 2012. 2012 will also be a year of significant investment as we develop products and opportunities that will contribute to growth in 2013 and beyond. In the coming years, we seek to increase our share in the mid- to large-sized boat category. Leveraging our relationships with, we will create an equipment deeper into the boat with innovative new engine and navigation displays. In addition, we'll be working to expand our share of the inland market through innovative content and technologies, leveraging the recently announced acquisition of interface.
Turning to next to aviation, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 9%, which we view as a significant compliment in light of the ongoing challenges facing the general aviation industry. The General Aviation Manufacturers Association reported a 10% decline in aircraft shipments through the first 3 quarters of 2011. This decline is in addition to the already depressed shipment levels of 2009 and 2010. Despite the ongoing negative trends, revenues generated from OEM customers were relatively flat for the year, outperforming the general market. During 2011, we've made significant considering mentioned the Part 23 and Part 25 business jet market. Cessna selected our G3000 system for the Citation N2, a Part 23 aircraft that will enter the market in 2013. 
Additionally, Cessna selected the G5000 for the Citation Latitude, a Part 25 aircraft that will enter the market in 2015. We also made additional inroads into the OEM helicopter market where our primary flight display system was integrated into the Dell 407GX. Last year, we introduced the GTN 650 and 750, which are the first panel-mounted products to feature touchscreen operation. These new products have been well received by the market and were a significant contributor to the growth we experienced in 2011.
In 2012, we're targeting revenue growth of 5% to 10% in the aviation segment, as recovery for the industry continues to like that of the overall economy. We are hopeful that the OEM market will stabilize in 2012. However, we do not expect to see meaningful growth from OEMs this year. Despite this soft outlook, we see many opportunities in the years ahead, and we will continue to invest in certifications with our business jet partners that will result in significant growth opportunities when the market begins to recover in 2013 and beyond. 
In light of these opportunities, our growth initiatives are focused on continued development of our G3000 and G5000 platforms with OEM partners, which will be the foundation of growth in 2013 and beyond, identifying and capitalizing on additional retrofit opportunities, further expansion into that helicopter market, with recent announcement that the Heli Expo naming remaining Garmin as the standard avionics provider on the Dell Relentless, which will launch in 2016 and the National Avionics Provider on 2 eurocopter models launching in 2013. And we are well-positioned for opportunities created by the FAA's transformation of national airspace system from the ground based system of air traffic control, the satellite-based system of traffic management.
The outdoor segment, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 14%, which is primarily driven by new product introductions, expansion into new categories and contributions from recent acquisitions. A few highlights from the year included the acquisition of Tri-Tronics, which expands our offerings to include training devices for both sport dogs as well as household pets. Capturing significant share in the GPS-enabled golf category with unique products such as our Approach S1 golf launch. And offering range of products and price points was something for every customer. Our new Montana series is a premium device offering advanced features and improved versatility over existing handheld in the market. Our totally refreshed eTrex series is perfect for customers looking for more basic device and has been well received by the market.
Looking at 2012, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 10% driven by ongoing momentum from recently introduced products, and we will leverage opportunities in the dog training market through the Tri-Tronics acquisition. Our growing market share in the GPS-enabled golf category presents an opportunity to expand our distribution channels both domestically and abroad as more shops wish to stock our products. 
Long-term, we will create new opportunities by identifying adjacent markets and product categories as we have done in the past. We will maintain our focus on utility, content and innovative form factors to engage both new and repeat customers in the segment. In the business segment, we recorded year-over-year revenue growth of 24% as the market expanded and we maintained our leadership position in the GPS-enabled fitness category. We remain focused on offering a broad range of products appealing to both elite athletes as well as recreational participants. We're fresh our premium Forerunner product line in 2011 with the 6 10 touchscreen watch. This product offers unmatched utility, ease-of-use and innovation, and has been very well received by athletes around the world. In the cycling market, we introduced the Edge 200, which appeals to value-oriented cyclists who wish to experience the benefits of GPS-enabled cycling computers.
In 2012, we're targeting revenue growth of 20% to 25% in the fitness segment. One of our key initiatives for the year is the completion of the vector power meter, which we expect to deliver this summer. Across each of the fitness categories we serve, we plan to offer a broad range of products that appeal to all athletes.
Looking beyond 2012, we believe the fitness segment will continue to grow as society becomes increasingly aware of the important role the fitness plays in the pursuit of a healthy lifestyle. We will focus on delivering compelling and useful products to the market with a complete solution including devices, wireless conductivity, measurement sensors and a well developed web portal. We will continue to build the Garmin Connect community, which is log over 1.5 billion miles by delivering a satisfying and complete user experience that complements our devices and our mobile applications. We plan to increase our share in the cycling market by offering a broad range of innovative products and by leveraging opportunities created by vector power meter. And longer-term, we seek to capitalize a profitable opportunities within the wellness space where we can leverage our knowledge of hardware, software and connectivity.
Turning to the Auto/Mobile segment, we're pleased with our financial performance in light of the ongoing challenges in the PND market, with revenues up 4% for the quarter. For the year, we posted a 5% revenue decline while maintaining strong profitability. When normalizing for the deferral of high-margin revenue associated with bundled PNDs, our full year 2011 operating margin in this segment was 17%. In addition, we grow our market share during the year thereby strengthening our position. Notably, we exited 2011 with greater than 60% share in North America and approximately 30% share in the EMEA. In 2011, we introduced a simplified family of nüvi products offering something for every lifestyle and budget beginning with the essential series followed by the advanced series and finally, the prestige series. This new product family was well received by both our retail partners and consumers during the holiday shopping season. Also in 2011, we acquired Navigon. We will continue the integration of Navigon in 2012 building from the foundation that made the acquisition important to us, their OEM customer base and well-respected technology, their European in the market share and their strength in the mobile application space.
Looking at highlights from the auto OEM market, we were pleased to be recognized by JD Power & Associates with the highest customer satisfaction with factory-installed navigation during our first year of eligibility. The Garmin Navigation system in the 2011 Dodge charger ranked first, with the Chrysler 300 system ranking third. This recognition confirms consumers value our seamless navigation experience that is intuitive and feature-rich, and experience that Garmin has successfully delivered to our markets for over 20 years. Additional programs announced and deleveraging the past year include the Volkswagen compact vehicle where Navigon was selected as the exclusive provider of navigation and the Suzuki Grand Vitara and SX4, which features a semi-installed version of our new link 2390 connected navigator.
Looking ahead, we expect PND unit deliveries to continue to decline in 2012, driving revenues down 7% to 10%. We will look for opportunities to grow in emerging markets and probably gain market share to offset the continued declines we foresee in North American and European markets. We will continue to invest in Auto OEM opportunities in 2012, leveraging our broad capabilities as an OEM and consumer electronic supplier. 
In addition, mobile applications provide near-term opportunity for growth as the smartphone segment continues to expand. And we will realize the full year of contributions from Navigon's popular smartphone application. Beyond 2012, we will be focusing on expanding our Auto OEM business through additional program wins as navigation becomes an integral part of the dashboard and maximizing profitability on the PND market as a market leader.
Given our revenue outlook and expectations for each segment, we are projecting revenues of $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion in 2012, with gross margins a stable to slightly increasing from 2011 levels. We are projecting operating income between $520 million and $540 million with operating margins of 19% to 20%. The decline in operating margin is a result of increased investments in strategic long-term growth initiatives mentioned earlier. Factoring in an effective tax rate of 13% results in forecasted 2012 earnings per share $2.45 to $2.60.
In summary, we're pleased to have delivered strong results in the fourth quarter highlighted by revenue growth on each business segment and geographical area we serve. During 2011, we were able to increase our share in several key markets. We delivered desirable new products, and we're able to leverage the growing market segments in order to achieve better than anticipated results. Looking forward, we see significant opportunities ahead as we anticipate improving economic conditions, and we are well-positioned to serve with a strong lineup of new products.
With confidence in our business and the improving conditions we see around us, we are pleased to announce a proposal to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share, which will be considered at our annual shareholders meeting in June. Kevin will provide more details in our dividend proposal in just moment. 
Finally, we should take this opportunity to thank our dedicated Associates for their efforts during the past year. While there are many uncertainties around us, you maintained a focus and worked hard to make 2011 a great year. Thanks so much for your contributions. This concludes my remarks, I'll turn the call over to Kevin who will walk us through the financial results in more detail. Kevin?"
598655,153955715,261649,"Garmin Ltd., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2012",2012-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin the financial update with a walk-through of our income statement followed by a review of our margin and to conclude with our balance sheet and cash flow position. During Q4, we posted revenue of $",1829,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin the financial update with a walk-through of our income statement followed by a review of our margin and to conclude with our balance sheet and cash flow position. 
During Q4, we posted revenue of $910 million with net income of $166 million. Our pro forma EPS was $0.96 per share, which excludes the foreign currency loss. Our revenue represents an increase of 9% year-over-year. Gross margin came in at 47.7%, which was a 240 basis point improvement from the prior year. For the first time in 6 quarters, we experienced year-over-year operating income expansion growing from $185 million to $200 million. Operating margin was 22% flat from the prior year. The components of our operating margin were gross margin being 240 basis points favorable, offset by our advertising which was 90 basis points unfavorable, up $12 million on a year-over-year basis as we utilized TV advertising in the holiday quarter combined with increased co-op expenses. SG&A was 80 basis points unfavorable, up $14 million on a year-over-year basis due primarily to the acquisition. R&D, 70 basis points unfavorable, up $13 million on a year-over-year basis due primarily to acquisitions as well.
Our pro forma EPS is $0.96, represents a 16% increase year-over-year driven by increasing revenues and a slightly lower effective tax rate. Our units shipped were flat year-over-year as 6.1 million units were delivered during the quarter, and our total company average selling price was $150 per unit, up 9% from 2010 driven by product mix.
For the full year, we posted revenue of $2.76 billion with net income of $521 million. Our pro forma EPS was $2.73 per share, which also excludes our foreign currency loss. Our revenue increased 3% year-over-year while well our pro forma EPS decreased 5% when excluding FX and a $0.50 per share onetime tax adjustment we posted in 2010. Our gross margin at 48.5% was a 150 basis point decline over the prior year due to warranty adjustments during 2010, which contributed 160 basis points. Operating income fell 13% to $554 million compared to $637 million in 2010. Store operating margin was 20.1%, down 360 basis points, up 23.7 last year. Gross margin was 150 basis points favorable, advertising, 10 basis points favorable and flat on a year-over-year basis. Our SG&A was 170 basis points unfavorable, up $53 million on a year-over-year basis driven primarily by acquisitions, our web-based commissions, product support and legal costs. R&D was 50 basis points unfavorable, up $22 million on a year-over-year basis due primarily to the acquisition.
So our pro forma EPS of $2.73 was a 4% decrease year-over-year on increasing revenue and slightly lower effective tax rate, offset by a declining growth and operating margins. Units shipped were down 1% year-over-year as 15.8 million units were delivered during the year. The decrease in North American PND volume was partially offset by growth in other geographies and our other segments. Our total company average selling price was $175 per unit, up 4% from 2010 due to product mix.
The non-GAAP measures that we reported represent net income per share excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and a onetime tax adjustment both in Q3, as I mentioned. The Q4 2011 GAAP impacts from foreign currency loss was $0.11. The Q4 2010 GAAP impact from foreign currency loss was $0.15. The full year, 2011 GAAP impact from foreign currency loss of $0.06 while the 2010 loss impact was $0.38, offset by a $0.50 gain related to the large onetime tax adjustment.
According to U.S. GAAP, we must defer revenue on certain products. And this stable summarizes net impact of the deferral and amortization of revenue and related costs in the fourth quarter and full year 2011 and 2010. First, in the current quarter, we deferred approximately $0.26 of EPS in the future periods compared to $0.19 in the fourth quarter of 2010. Most of these revenues and costs will be amortized straight line over a 3-year period. For the full year, we deferred approximately $0.66 of EPS in 2011 compared to $0.42 in 2010. While we are deferring revenue according to the U.S. GAAP, we're collecting the cash at time of the sale, which is reflected positively in our statement of cash flows, which I'll review in a minute.
In total, our revenues increased 9% during the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. During Q4, we experienced a 4% revenue increase within the Auto/Mobile segment as volume declines were offset by improved pricing due to product mix. Our outdoor segment posted accelerating growth at 35% due to the pent-up demand for new products and market share gains within the GPS-enabled golf market. The fitness segment continue to grow with a 17% revenue increase when compared to Q4 2010 on the strength of our fitness products during the holiday quarter. Aviation segment revenues increased 1% compared to Q4 2010 as the retrofit growth was largely offset by program contributions related to our business jet cockpit wins. And Marine segment revenues increased 16% compared to Q4 2010 as both the aftermarket and OEM markets improved for Garmin.
During Q4, all geographies were stable or growing with EMEA posting the strongest growth at 28%. For the full year, EMEA grew 19% while Asia-Pacific grew 13%. Eastern geographies were partially offset by a 7% decline in the Americas driven by the PND volume declines. For 2011, the Americas represent 55% of revenue. EMEA increased to 31% of total revenue in 2010 to 36% in 2011 and Asia, from 8% to 9% in the same period.
So the Auto/Mobile segment represented 64% of our total revenue during the fourth quarter, down from 67% in Q4 2010. Outdoor grew to 13% of revenues in the quarter, an increased from 11% a year ago. The operating income contribution of the outdoor and fitness segments increased to 30% and 20%, respectively or 50% of our total business. In total, the traditional segment contributed 61% of our fourth quarter operating income.
On a full-year basis, Auto/Mobile revenue contribution declined from 62% to 58% in 2011 with gains in outdoor, fitness and marine which contributed 13%, 11% and 8%, respectively. The operating income contribution of the Auto/Mobile segment shrank at 29% in 2011 compared to 39% a year ago. Our traditional segment contributed 71% of the full-year operating income with strong gains in both our outdoor and fitness segment.
Looking next at the margin by segment, our fourth quarter Auto/Mobile gross margin and operating margin were 38% and 13%, respectively. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin is primarily driven by improved average selling price due to product mix shifting towards higher-priced bundled offerings. Operating margins in the quarter were 13% or 20% when adjusted for deferrals. This is slightly higher than the normalized operating margin of 19% fourth quarter of 2010. Q4 outdoor gross margin was 68% consistent with Q4 of 2010. Operating margin was 49%, a decline from 53% in the year ago quarter due to increased allocation of advertising and SG&A expenses for this segment. Q4 fitness gross margin was 54% stable from the year ago quarter, and operating margin was 43%, again consistent to the year ago quarter is both revenue and expense growth were evenly paid.
Q4 Marine gross margin was 60% compared to 63% in the year-ago quarter, as product mix shifted towards lower margin products. Operating margin was 23%, down from 29% year ago, driven by the gross margin declines and increased R&D and SG&A expenses to support our long-term Marine OEM strategy.
Finally, Q4 aviation gross margin was 65%, down from 70% in Q4 of 2010 due to the OEM program contributions. Operating margin was 18% for the quarter, down from 26% in the prior year due to the declining gross margin and increased R&D expense associated with our new OEM programs that will begin to contribute to revenue in 2013.
Moving next to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of almost $2.5 billion. Our accounts receivable balance increased sequentially to $607 million due to sales growth during the holiday quarter. Accounts receivable accounted for approximately 81 days of sales when calculated on a trailing 4 quarters compared to 101 days of sales in the fourth quarter of 2010. We've already collected approximately $350 million of our year-end balance.
Our inventory balance has decreased to $398 million a sequential basis at the close of the fourth quarter. Our days of inventory metric was 102 days compared to 119 in the fourth quarter of 2010. We ended the quarter with the following amounts a number of days of inventory: $129 million in raw materials representing 31 days; $52 million work in process and assemblies or 13 days; and $246 million in finished goods or 58 days of inventory. And we closed the year with $29 million in inventory reserves.
We also noticed on our balance sheet that we show $78 million dividend payable to be paid on March 31, 2012.
We continue to generate strong cash flow across our businesses, cash from operations was $225 million during the quarter. Our CapEx spending was $12 million during Q4. Therefore, we generated free cash flow of $213 million. Cash flow invested during the fourth quarter was $164 million including the $12 million CapEx and the $157 million net purchase of marketable securities offset by a $4 million gain on the sale of property, plant and equipment. Financing activities were $160 million use of cash during Q4 due primarily to the dividend payments we made on the September 30 and December 31. We earned an average of 1.5% on all cash and marketable securities balances during the quarter, and our full-year operating cash was $822 million with free cash flow of $784 million.
We expect our strong free cash flow generation to continue in 2012 and with that, we plan to continue to fund the strong dividend. As Cliff mentioned, we will ask shareholders to approve a $0.45 per share quarterly dividend in our June annual meeting representing a 4% yield of the stock price of $45. We will also continue to pursue acquisitions in adjacent niche markets or tuck-in technology, which fit with our core markets. As has been our practice, acquisitions will be evaluated by technology, value compatibility and strategic that with Garmin. Our tax rate for the full year 2011 was 10.8%. We do expect the 2012 rate to be approximately 13% and the increase in the forecast effective tax rate is attributable revenue mix by different tax jurisdictions.
And finally, Cliff was reviewed our 2012 guidance, but I will just further highlight that we have 4 solid growth segments, and we will continue to invest for long-term growth across the entire business. Our strong profitability and market diversity position us well for both 2012 and the future. This concludes our formal remarks for the morning. We will now move to appear to Q&A."

So we built to the primarily reasons that we want to continue to and we need to continue to invest in some new opportunities primarily in the Auto OEM and the aviation and marine OEM segment. So that will pull us to be roughly $2.45 to $2.60 EPS number we commented on. In terms of PND strength, I think primarily, we saw a market share gains in Europe.

598655,153955715,261787,"Garmin Ltd., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2012",2012-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, with consolidated revenues increasing 9% year-over-year to $910 million. This growth was broad-based, with each of o",2365,"Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, with consolidated revenues increasing 9% year-over-year to $910 million. This growth was broad-based, with each of our business segments contributing.
Gross margins improved year-over-year, up 240 basis points to 47.7%. Revenue growth combined with improved gross margins resulted in both operating income and EPS growth. Operating income for the quarter grew 8%, while pro forma EPS came in at $0.96, a 16% improvement over the prior year.
As a group, our traditional market segments of Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness contributed 61% of our total operating income for the quarter, and revenue from these segments grew nearly 19%. We sold 6.1 million units in the quarter, which was flat year-over-year. Auto PND unit volume was down slightly. However, this was offset by higher volumes in Outdoor, Fitness and Marine. We generated $213 million in free cash flow during the quarter, resulting in a cash balance of just under $2.5 billion.
Looking at highlights for the full year, consolidated revenue increased 3% as new product categories increased market share, and emerging market opportunities delivered results that exceeded the expectations we established at the beginning of the year.
As a group, our traditional market segments grew 14%, contributing $1.2 billion in total revenue for the year. The revenue growth in these segments combined with their strong margin profiles generated 71% of our operating income.
We delivered over 15.8 million units in 2011, a decline of only 1% year-over-year. Weakness in the North American PND market was partially offset by stronger PND shipments to the EMEA and APAC markets. Unit growth in the outdoor, fitness and marine markets also helped close the gap.
From a geographical perspective, the EMEA region grew 19%, outpacing all other geographies. All market segments contributed to the growth, including PND. We generated $784 million of free cash flow in the year, which was partially used to fund our quarterly dividend and to complete numerous acquisitions aimed at further diversifying our revenue base.
Next, we will review each of our business segments highlighting 2011 performance, outlook for 2012 and a summary of long-term strategic initiatives.
Starting with the Marine segment, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 12%, driven by improved market conditions and share gains across our product portfolio. We experienced strong market share gains in the OEM segment and expanded our presence in the inland markets with the introduction of our new echo fishfinders.
During the year, we expanded our product portfolio with sonar and autopilot solutions that brought new innovation to the marine market and enhanced our ability to serve the sail and large boat market. Throughout the year, we invested heavily in the Marine segment with increased research and development, and we built additional support infrastructure to serve our growing base of OEM customers. This has compressed margins in the near term. However, we are confident that these investments are critical to growing revenue and market share going forward.
For 2012, we are targeting revenue growth of 5% to 10% in the Marine segment as market conditions continue to improve and as recent OEM wins and product introductions provide revenue contributions for the full year. At last week's Miami Boat Show, we announced relationships with Teleflex and Viking, both of which will target the larger boat market and will contribute to revenue in 2012. 2012 will also be a year of significant investment as we develop products and opportunities that will contribute to growth in 2013 and beyond.
In the coming years, we seek to increase our share in the mid- to large-sized boat category. Leveraging our relationships with Volvo Penta, we will create equipment that will embed us deeper into the boat, with innovative new engine and navigation displays. In addition, we will be working to expand our share of the inland market through innovative content and technologies, leveraging the recently announced acquisition of Interphase.
Turning next to Aviation, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 9%, which we view as a significant accomplishment in light of the ongoing challenges facing the general aviation industry. The General Aviation Manufacturers Association reported a 10% decline in aircraft shipments through the first 3 quarters of 2011. This decline is in addition to the already depressed shipment levels of 2009 and 2010.
Despite the ongoing negative trends, revenues generated from OEM customers were relatively flat for the year, outperforming the general market. During 2011, we've made significant progress in securing wins in the Part 23 and Part 25 business jet market. Cessna selected our G3000 system for the Citation M2, a Part 23 aircraft that will enter the market in 2013. Additionally, Cessna selected the G5000 for the Citation Latitude, a Part 25 aircraft that will enter the market in 2015.
We also made additional inroads into the OEM helicopter market, where our primary flight display system was integrated into the Bell 407GX. Last year, we introduced the GTN 650 and 750, which are the first panel-mounted products to feature touchscreen operation. These new products have been well received by the market and were a significant contributor to the growth we experienced in 2011.
In 2012, we are targeting revenue growth of 5% to 10% in the Aviation segment as recovery for the industry continues to lag that of the overall economy. We are hopeful that the OEM market will stabilize in 2012. However, we do not expect to see meaningful growth from OEMs this year. Despite this soft outlook, we see many opportunities in the years ahead, and we will continue to invest in certifications with our business jet partners that will result in significant growth opportunities when the market begins to recover in 2013 and beyond.
In light of these opportunities, our growth initiatives are focused on: continued development of our G3000 and G5000 platforms with OEM partners, which will be the foundation of growth in 2013 and beyond; identifying and capitalizing on additional retrofit opportunities; further expansion into the helicopter market, with recent announcements at the Heli-Expo naming Garmin as the standard avionics provider on the Bell Relentless which will launch in 2016 and an optional avionics provider on 2 Eurocopter models launching in 2013; and we are well positioned for opportunities created by the FAA's transformation of National Airspace System from a ground-based system of air traffic control to a satellite-based system of air traffic management.
In the Outdoor segment, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 14%, which was primarily driven by new product introductions, expansion into new categories and contributions from recent acquisitions. A few highlights from the year include the acquisition of Tri-Tronics, which expands our offerings to include training devices for both sport dogs as well as household pets; capturing significant share in the GPS-enabled golf category, with unique products such as our Approach S1 golf launch; and offering a range of products and price points with something for every customer. Our new Montana series is a premium device offering advanced features and improved versatility over existing handhelds in the market. Our totally refreshed eTrex series is perfect for customers looking for a more basic device and has been well received by the market.
Looking at 2012, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 10%, driven by ongoing momentum from recently introduced products, and we will leverage opportunities in the dog training market through the Tri-Tronics acquisition. Our growing market share in the GPS-enabled golf category presents an opportunity to expand our distribution channels both domestically and abroad as more shops wish to stock our products.
Long term, we will create new opportunities by identifying adjacent markets and product categories as we have done in the past. We will maintain our focus on utility, content and innovative form factors to engage both new and repeat customers in this segment.
In the Fitness segment, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 24% as the market expanded, and we maintained our leadership position in the GPS-enabled fitness category. We remain focused on offering a broad range of products appealing to both elite athletes as well as recreational participants. We refreshed our premium Forerunner product line in 2011 with the 610 touchscreen launch. This product offers unmatched utility, ease-of-use and innovation and has been very well received by athletes around the world. In the cycling market, we introduced the Edge 200, which appeals to value-oriented cyclists who wish to experience the benefits of GPS-enabled cycling computers.
In 2012, we are targeting revenue growth of 20% to 25% in the Fitness segment. One of our key initiatives for the year is the completion of the Vector power meter, which we expect to deliver this summer. Across each of the fitness categories we serve, we plan to offer a broad range of products that appeal to all athletes.
Looking beyond 2012, we believe the Fitness segment will continue to grow as society becomes increasingly aware of the important role that fitness plays in the pursuit of a healthy lifestyle. We will focus on delivering compelling and useful products to the market with a complete solution, including devices, wireless connectivity, measurement sensors and a well-developed web portal. We will continue to build the Garmin Connect community, which has logged over 1.5 billion miles, by delivering a satisfying and complete user experience that complements our devices and our mobile applications. We plan to increase our share in the cycling market by offering a broad range of innovative products and by leveraging opportunities created by the Vector power meter. And longer term, we seek to capitalize on the profitable opportunities within the wellness space where we can leverage our knowledge of hardware, software and connectivity.
Turning to the Auto/Mobile segment, we are pleased with our financial performance in light of the ongoing challenges in the PND market, with revenues up 4% for the quarter. For the year, we posted a 5% revenue decline while maintaining strong profitability.
When normalizing for the deferral of high-margin revenue associated with bundled PNDs, our full year 2011 operating margin in this segment was 17%. In addition, we grew our market share during the year, thereby strengthening our position. Notably, we exited 2011 with greater than 60% share in North America and approximately 30% share in the EMEA. In 2011, we introduced a simplified family of nüvi products offering something for every lifestyle and budget, beginning with the Essential series followed by the Advanced series and finally, the Prestige series. This new product family was well received by both our retail partners and consumers during the holiday shopping season. Also, in 2011, we acquired Navigon. We will continue the integration of Navigon in 2012, building from the foundation that made the acquisition important to us: their OEM customer base and well-respected technology, their European PND market share, and their strength in the mobile application space.
Looking at highlights from the auto OEM market, we were pleased to be recognized by J.D. Power and Associates with the highest customer satisfaction with factory-installed navigation during our first year of eligibility. The Garmin navigation system in the 2011 Dodge Charger ranked first, with the Chrysler 300 system ranking third. This recognition confirms consumers value a seamless navigation experience that is intuitive and feature-rich, an experience that Garmin has successfully delivered to our markets for over 20 years. Additional programs announced and delivered during the past year include the Volkswagen up! compact vehicle, where Navigon was selected as the exclusive provider of navigation; and the Suzuki Grand Vitara and SX4, which features a semi-installed version of our new nüLink 2390 connected navigator.
Looking ahead, we expect PND unit deliveries to continue to decline in 2012, driving revenues down 7% to 10%. We will look for opportunities to grow in emerging markets and to profitably gain market share to offset the continued declines we foresee in the North American and European markets. We will continue to invest in Auto OEM opportunities in 2012, leveraging our broad capabilities as an OEM and consumer electronic supplier.
In addition, mobile applications provide a near-term opportunity for growth as the smartphone segment continues to expand. And we will realize a full year of contributions from Navigon's popular smartphone applications. Beyond 2012, we will be focusing on expanding our Auto OEM business through additional program wins as navigation becomes an integral part of the dashboard and maximizing profitability on the PND market as the market leader.
Given our revenue outlook and expectations for each segment, we are projecting revenues of $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion in 2012, with gross margins stable to slightly increasing from 2011 levels. We are projecting operating income between $520 million and $540 million, with operating margins of 19% to 20%. The decline in operating margin is a result of increased investments in strategic long-term growth initiatives mentioned earlier. Factoring in an effective tax rate of 13% results in forecasted 2012 earnings per share $2.45 to $2.60.
In summary, we are pleased to have delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, highlighted by revenue growth in each business segment and geographical area we serve. During 2011, we were able to increase our share in several key markets. We delivered desirable new products, and we were able to leverage the growing market segments in order to achieve better-than-anticipated results.
Looking forward, we see significant opportunities ahead as we anticipate improving economic conditions. And we are well positioned to serve with a strong lineup of new products.
With confidence in our business and the improving conditions we see around us, we are pleased to announce a proposal to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share, which will be considered at our annual shareholders' meeting in June. Kevin will provide more details on our dividend proposal in just a moment.
Finally, I wish to take this opportunity to thank our dedicated associates for their efforts during the past year. While there were many uncertainties around us, you maintained a focus and worked hard to make 2011 a great year. Thanks so much for your contributions.
This concludes my remarks. I'll turn the call over to Kevin who will walk us through the financial results in more detail. Kevin?"
598655,153955715,261787,"Garmin Ltd., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2012",2012-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin the financial update with a walk-through of our income statement followed by a review of our margins and then conclude with our balance sheet and cash flow position.During Q4, we posted revenue of",1831,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin the financial update with a walk-through of our income statement followed by a review of our margins and then conclude with our balance sheet and cash flow position.
During Q4, we posted revenue of $910 million, with net income of $166 million. Our pro forma EPS was $0.96 per share, which excludes the foreign currency loss. Our revenue represents an increase of 9% year-over-year. Gross margin came in at 47.7%, which was a 240-basis-point improvement from the prior year.
For the first time in 6 quarters, we experienced year-over-year operating income expansion, growing from $185 million to $200 million. Operating margin was 22%, flat from the prior year.
The components of our operating margin were: gross margin being 240 basis points favorable, offset by our advertising which was 90 basis points unfavorable, up $12 million on a year-over-year basis as we utilized TV advertising in the holiday quarter combined with increased co-op expenses; SG&A was 80 basis points unfavorable, up $14 million on a year-over-year basis due primarily to the acquisitions; R&D, 70 basis points unfavorable, up $13 million on a year-over-year basis due primarily to acquisitions as well.
Our pro forma EPS of $0.96 represents a 16% increase year-over-year, driven by increasing revenues and a slightly lower effective tax rate. Our units shipped were flat year-over-year as 6.1 million units were delivered during the quarter. And our total company average selling price was $150 per unit, up 9% from 2010, driven by product mix.
For the full year, we posted revenue of $2.76 billion, with net income of $521 million. Our pro forma EPS was $2.73 per share, which also excludes our foreign currency losses. Our revenue increased 3% year-over-year while our pro forma EPS decreased 5% when excluding FX and a $0.50 per share one-time tax adjustment we posted in 2010.
Our gross margin at 48.5% was a 150-basis-point decline over the prior year due to warranty adjustments during 2010, which contributed 160 basis points. Operating income fell 13% to $554 million compared to $637 million in 2010.
So our operating margin was 20.1%, down 360 basis points, up 23.7 last year; gross margin was 150 basis points favorable; advertising, 10 basis points favorable and flat on a year-over-year basis; our SG&A was 170 basis points unfavorable, up $53 million on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by acquisitions, our web-based commissions, product support and legal costs; r&D was 50 basis points unfavorable, up $22 million on a year-over-year basis, due primarily to the acquisitions.
So our pro forma EPS of $2.73 was a 4% decrease year-over-year on increasing revenue and slightly lower effective tax rate, offset by declining growth and operating margins. Units shipped were down 1% year-over-year as 15.8 million units were delivered during the year. The decrease in North American PND volume was partially offset by growth in other geographies in our other segments. Our total company average selling price was $175 per unit, up 4% from 2010 due to product mix.
The non-GAAP measure that we reported represent net income per share excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and a one-time tax adjustment booked in Q3, as I mentioned. The Q4 2011 GAAP impact from foreign currency loss was $0.11. The Q4 2010 GAAP impact from foreign currency loss was $0.15. The full year 2011 GAAP impact from foreign currency loss was $0.06, while the 2010 loss impact was $0.38, offset by a $0.50 gain related to the large one-time tax adjustment.
According to U.S. GAAP, we must defer revenue on certain products, and this stable summarizes the net impact of the deferral and amortization of revenue and related costs in the fourth quarter and full year 2011 and 2010. First, in the current quarter, we deferred approximately $0.26 of EPS in the future periods compared to $0.19 in the fourth quarter of 2010. Most of these revenues and costs will be amortized straight line over a 3-year period. For the full year, we deferred approximately $0.66 of EPS in 2011 compared to $0.42 in 2010. While we are deferring revenue according to U.S. GAAP, we are collecting the cash at time of sale, which has reflected positively in our statement of cash flows, which I'll review in a minute.
In total, our revenues increased 9% during the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. During Q4, we experienced a 4% revenue increase within the Auto/Mobile segment as volume declines were offset by improved pricing due to product mix. Our Outdoor segment posted accelerating growth at 35% due to pent up demand for new products and market share gains within the GPS-enabled golf market. The Fitness segment continue to grow with a 17% revenue increase when compared to Q4 2010 on the strength of our fitness products during the holiday quarter. Aviation segment revenues increased 1% compared to Q4 2010 as retrofit growth was largely offset by program contributions related to our business jet cockpit wins. And Marine segment revenues increased 16% compared to Q4 2010 as both the aftermarket and OEM markets improved for Garmin.
During Q4, all geographies were stable or growing, with EMEA posting the strongest growth at 28%. For the full year, EMEA grew 19% while Asia Pacific grew 13%. These geographies were partially offset by a 7% decline in the Americas, driven by the PND volume declines. And for 2011, the Americas represent 55% of revenue. EMEA increased to 31% of total revenue in 2010 to 36% in 2011; and Asia, from 8% to 9% in the same period.
So the Auto/Mobile segment represented 64% of our total revenue during the fourth quarter, down from 67% in Q4 2010. Outdoor grew to 13% of revenues in the quarter, an increased from 11% a year ago. The operating income contribution of the Outdoor and Fitness segments increased to 30% and 20%, respectively, or 50% of our total business. In total, the traditional segments contributed 61% of our fourth quarter operating income.
On a full year basis, Auto/Mobile revenue contribution declined from 62% to 58% in 2011, with gains in Outdoor, Fitness and Marine, which contributed 13%, 11% and 8%, respectively. The operating income contribution of the Auto/Mobile segment shrank 29% in 2011 compared to 39% a year ago. Our traditional segments contributed 71% of the full year operating income, with strong gains in both our Outdoor and Fitness segment.
Looking next at the margin by segment. Our fourth quarter Auto/Mobile gross margin and operating margin were 38% and 13%, respectively. The year-over-year improvement in gross margins was primarily driven by improved average selling prices due to product mix shifting toward higher-priced bundled offerings. Operating margins in the quarter were 13%, or 20% when adjusted for deferrals. This is slightly higher than the normalized operating margin of 19% fourth quarter of 2010.
Q4 Outdoor gross margin was 68%, consistent with Q4 2010. Operating margin was 49%, a decline from 53% in the year-ago quarter due to increased allocation of advertising and SG&A expenses for this segment.
Q4 Fitness gross margin was 64%, stable from the year-ago quarter. And operating margin was 43%, again consistent to the year-ago quarter as both revenue and expense growth were evenly paced.
Q4 Marine gross margin was 60% compared to 63% in the year-ago quarter as product mix shifted toward lower-margin products. Operating margin was 22%, down from 29% a year ago, driven by the gross margin decline and the increased R&D and SG&A expenses to support our long-term marine OEM strategy.
Finally, Q4 Aviation gross margin was 65%, down from 70% in Q4 of 2010 due to OEM program contributions. Operating margin was 18% for the quarter, down from 26% in the prior year due to the declining gross margins and increased R&D expense associated with our new OEM programs that will begin to contribute to revenue in 2013.
Moving next to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of almost $2.5 billion. Our accounts receivable balance increased sequentially to $607 million due to sales growth during the holiday quarter.
Accounts receivable accounted for approximately 81 days of sales when calculated on a trailing 4 quarters compared to 101 days of sales in the fourth quarter of 2010. We have already collected approximately $350 million of our year-end balance.
Our inventory balances decreased to $398 million on a sequential basis at the close of the fourth quarter. Our days of inventory metric was 102 days compared to 119 in the fourth quarter of 2010. We ended the quarter with the following amounts and number of days of inventory: $129 million in raw materials, representing 31 days; $52 million in work in process and assemblies, or 13 days; and $246 million in finished goods, or 58 days of inventory. And we closed the year with $29 million in inventory reserves. You also notice on our balance sheet that we show a $78 million dividend payable to be paid on March 31, 2012.
We continue to generate strong cash flow across our business as cash from operations was $225 million during the quarter. Our CapEx spending was $12 million during Q4. Therefore, we generated free cash flow of $213 million. Cash flow invested during the fourth quarter was $164 million, including the $12 million in CapEx and $157 million net purchase of marketable securities offset by a $4 million gain on the sale of property, plant and equipment.
Financing activities were a $160 million use of cash during Q4, due primarily to the dividend payments we made on both September 30 and December 31. We earned an average of 1.5% on all cash and marketable securities balances during the quarter. And our full year operating cash was $822 million, with free cash flow of $784 million.
We expect our strong free cash flow generation to continue in 2012, and with it, we plan to continue to fund the strong dividend. As Cliff mentioned, we will ask shareholders to approve a $0.45 per share quarterly dividend in our June annual meeting, representing a 4% yield of the stock price of $45.
We will also continue to pursue acquisitions in adjacent niche markets or tuck-in technology which fit with our core markets. As has been our practice, acquisitions will be evaluated by technology, values compatibility and strategic fit within Garmin.
Our tax rate for the full year 2011 was 10.8%. We do expect the 2012 rate to be approximately 13%. And the increase in this forecast of effective tax rate is attributable to revenue mix by different tax jurisdictions.
And finally, Cliff has reviewed our 2012 guidance, but I would just further highlight that we have 4 solid growth segments, and we will continue to invest for long-term growth across the entire business. Our strong profitability and market diversity position us well for both 2012 and the future.
This concludes our formal remarks for the morning. We will now move to a period of Q&A."

As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, with consolidated revenues increasing 9% year-over-year to $910 million. This growth was broad-based, with each of o",2367,"Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, with consolidated revenues increasing 9% year-over-year to $910 million. This growth was broad-based, with each of our business segments contributing.
Gross margins improved year-over-year, up 240 basis points to 47.7%. Revenue growth combined with improved gross margins resulted in both operating income and EPS growth. Operating income for the quarter grew 8%, while pro forma EPS came in at $0.96, a 16% improvement over the prior year.
As a group, our traditional market segments of Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness contributed 61% of our total operating income for the quarter, and revenue from these segments grew nearly 19%. We sold 6.1 million units in the quarter, which was flat year-over-year. Auto PND unit volume was down slightly. However, this was offset by higher volumes in Outdoor, Fitness and Marine. We generated $213 million in free cash flow during the quarter, resulting in a cash balance of just under $2.5 billion.
Looking at highlights for the full year, consolidated revenue increased 3% as new product categories increased market share, and emerging market opportunities delivered results that exceeded the expectations we established at the beginning of the year.
As a group, our traditional market segments grew 14%, contributing $1.2 billion in total revenue for the year. The revenue growth in these segments combined with their strong margin profiles generated 71% of our operating income.
We delivered over 15.8 million units in 2011, a decline of only 1% year-over-year. Weakness in the North American PND market was partially offset by stronger PND shipments to the EMEA and APAC markets. Unit growth in the outdoor, fitness and marine markets also helped close the gap.
From a geographical perspective, the EMEA region grew 19%, outpacing all other geographies. All market segments contributed to the growth, including PND. We generated $784 million of free cash flow in the year, which was partially used to fund our quarterly dividend and to complete numerous acquisitions aimed at further diversifying our revenue base.
Next, we will review each of our business segments highlighting 2011 performance, outlook for 2012 and a summary of long-term strategic initiatives.
Starting with the Marine segment, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 12%, driven by improved market conditions and share gains across our product portfolio. We experienced strong market share gains in the OEM segment and expanded our presence in the inland markets with the introduction of our new echo fishfinders.
During the year, we expanded our product portfolio with sonar and autopilot solutions that brought new innovation to the marine market and enhanced our ability to serve the sail and large boat market. Throughout the year, we invested heavily in the Marine segment with increased research and development, and we built additional support infrastructure to serve our growing base of OEM customers. This has compressed margins in the near term. However, we are confident that these investments are critical to growing revenue and market share going forward.
For 2012, we are targeting revenue growth of 5% to 10% in the Marine segment as market conditions continue to improve and as recent OEM wins and product introductions provide revenue contributions for the full year. At last week's Miami Boat Show, we announced relationships with Teleflex and Viking, both of which will target the larger boat market and will contribute to revenue in 2012. 2012 will also be a year of significant investment as we develop products and opportunities that will contribute to growth in 2013 and beyond.
In the coming years, we seek to increase our share in the mid- to large-sized boat category. Leveraging our relationships with Volvo Penta, we will create equipment that will embed us deeper into the boat, with innovative new engine and navigation displays. In addition, we will be working to expand our share of the inland market through innovative content and technologies, leveraging the recently announced acquisition of Interphase.
Turning next to Aviation, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 9%, which we view as a significant accomplishment in light of the ongoing challenges facing the general aviation industry. The General Aviation Manufacturers Association reported a 10% decline in aircraft shipments through the first 3 quarters of 2011. This decline is in addition to the already depressed shipment levels of 2009 and 2010.
Despite the ongoing negative trends, revenues generated from OEM customers were relatively flat for the year, outperforming the general market. During 2011, we've made significant progress in securing wins in the Part 23 and Part 25 business jet market. Cessna selected our G3000 system for the Citation M2, a Part 23 aircraft that will enter the market in 2013. Additionally, Cessna selected the G5000 for the Citation Latitude, a Part 25 aircraft that will enter the market in 2015.
We've also made additional inroads into the OEM helicopter market, where our primary flight display system was integrated into the Bell 407GX. Last year, we introduced the GTN 650 and 750, which are the first panel-mounted products to feature touchscreen operation. These new products have been well received by the market and were a significant contributor to the growth we experienced in 2011.
In 2012, we are targeting revenue growth of 5% to 10% in the Aviation segment as recovery for the industry continues to lag that of the overall economy. We are hopeful that the OEM market will stabilize in 2012. However, we do not expect to see meaningful growth from OEMs this year. Despite this soft outlook, we see many opportunities in the years ahead, and we will continue to invest in certifications with our business jet partners that will result in significant growth opportunities when the market begins to recover in 2013 and beyond.
In light of these opportunities, our growth initiatives are focused on: continued development of our G3000 and G5000 platforms with OEM partners, which will be the foundation of growth in 2013 and beyond; identifying and capitalizing on additional retrofit opportunities; further expansion into the helicopter market, with recent announcements at the Heli-Expo naming Garmin as the standard avionics provider on the Bell Relentless which will launch in 2016 and an optional avionics provider on 2 Eurocopter models launching in 2013; and we are well positioned for opportunities created by the FAA's transformation of the National Airspace System from a ground-based system of air traffic control to a satellite-based system of air traffic management.
In the Outdoor segment, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 14%, which was primarily driven by new product introductions, expansion into new categories and contributions from recent acquisitions. A few highlights from the year include: The acquisition of Tri-Tronics, which expands our offerings to include training devices for both sport dogs as well as household pets; capturing significant share in the GPS-enabled golf category, with unique products such as our Approach S1 golf launch; and offering a range of products and price points with something for every customer. Our new Montana series is a premium device offering advanced features and improved versatility over existing handhelds in the market. Our totally refreshed eTrex series is perfect for customers looking for a more basic device and has been well received by the market.
Looking at 2012, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 10%, driven by ongoing momentum from recently introduced products, and we will leverage opportunities in the dog training market through the Tri-Tronics acquisition. Our growing market share in the GPS-enabled golf category presents an opportunity to expand our distribution channels both domestically and abroad as more shops wish to stock our products.
Long term, we will create new opportunities by identifying adjacent markets and product categories as we have done in the past. We will maintain our focus on utility, content and innovative form factors to engage both new and repeat customers in this segment.
In the Fitness segment, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 24% as the market expanded, and we maintained our leadership position in the GPS-enabled fitness category. We remain focused on offering a broad range of products appealing to both elite athletes as well as recreational participants. We refreshed our premium Forerunner product line in 2011 with the 610 touchscreen launch. This product offers unmatched utility, ease-of-use and innovation and has been very well received by athletes around the world. In the cycling market, we introduced the Edge 200, which appeals to value-oriented cyclists who wish to experience the benefits of GPS-enabled cycling computers.
In 2012, we are targeting revenue growth of 20% to 25% in the Fitness segment. One of our key initiatives for the year is the completion of the Vector power meter, which we expect to deliver this summer. Across each of the fitness categories we serve, we plan to offer a broad range of products that appeals to all athletes.
Looking beyond 2012, we believe the Fitness segment will continue to grow as society becomes increasingly aware of the important role that fitness plays in the pursuit of a healthy lifestyle. We will focus on delivering compelling and useful products to the market with a complete solution, including devices, wireless connectivity, measurement sensors and a well-developed web portal. We will continue to build the Garmin Connect community, which has logged over 1.5 billion miles, by delivering a satisfying and complete user experience that complements our devices and our mobile applications. We plan to increase our share in the cycling market by offering a broad range of innovative products and by leveraging opportunities created by the Vector power meter. And longer term, we seek to capitalize on the profitable opportunities within the wellness space where we can leverage our knowledge of hardware, software and connectivity.
Turning to the Auto/Mobile segment, we are pleased with our financial performance in light of the ongoing challenges in the PND market, with revenues up 4% for the quarter. For the year, we posted a 5% revenue decline while maintaining strong profitability.
When normalizing for the deferral of high-margin revenue associated with bundled PNDs, our full year 2011 operating margin in this segment was 17%. In addition, we grew our market share during the year, thereby strengthening our position. Notably, we exited 2011 with greater than 60% share in North America and approximately 30% share in the EMEA. In 2011, we introduced a simplified family of nüvi products offering something for every lifestyle and budget, beginning with the Essential series followed by the Advanced series and finally, the Prestige series. This new product family was well received by both our retail partners and consumers during the holiday shopping season. Also, in 2011, we acquired Navigon. We will continue the integration of Navigon in 2012, building from the foundation that made the acquisition important to us: their OEM customer base and well-respected technology, their European PND market share, and their strength in the mobile application space.
Looking at highlights from the auto OEM market, we were pleased to be recognized by J.D. Power and Associates for the highest customer satisfaction with factory-installed navigation during our first year of eligibility. The Garmin navigation system in the 2011 Dodge Charger ranked first, with the Chrysler 300 system ranking third. This recognition confirms consumers value a seamless navigation experience that is intuitive and feature-rich, an experience that Garmin has successfully delivered to our markets for over 20 years. Additional programs announced and delivered during the past year include the Volkswagen up! compact vehicle, where Navigon was selected as the exclusive provider of navigation; and the Suzuki Grand Vitara and SX4, which features a semi-installed version of our new nüLink 2390 connected navigator.
Looking ahead, we expect PND unit deliveries to continue to decline in 2012, driving revenues down 7% to 10%. We will look for opportunities to grow in emerging markets and to profitably gain market share to offset the continued declines we foresee in the North American and European markets. We will continue to invest in Auto OEM opportunities in 2012, leveraging our broad capabilities as an OEM and consumer electronics supplier.
In addition, mobile applications provide a near-term opportunity for growth as the smartphone segment continues to expand. And we will realize a full year of contributions from Navigon's popular smartphone application. Beyond 2012, we will be focusing on expanding our Auto OEM business through additional program wins as navigation becomes an integral part of the dashboard and maximizing profitability on the PND market as the market leader.
Given our revenue outlook and expectations for each segment, we are projecting revenues of $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion in 2012, with gross margins stable to slightly increasing from 2011 levels. We are projecting operating income between $520 million and $540 million, with operating margins of 19% to 20%. The decline in operating margin is a result of increased investments in strategic long-term growth initiatives mentioned earlier. Factoring in an effective tax rate of 13% results in forecasted 2012 earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.60.
In summary, we are pleased to have delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, highlighted by revenue growth in each business segment and geographical area we serve. During 2011, we were able to increase our share in several key markets. We delivered desirable new products, and we were able to leverage the growing market segments in order to achieve better-than-anticipated results.
Looking forward, we see significant opportunities ahead as we anticipate improving economic conditions. And we are well positioned to serve with a strong lineup of new products.
With confidence in our business and the improving conditions we see around us, we are pleased to announce a proposal to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share, which will be considered at our annual shareholders' meeting in June. Kevin will provide more details on our dividend proposal in just a moment.
Finally, I wish to take this opportunity to thank our dedicated associates for their efforts during the past year. While there were many uncertainties around us, you maintained a focus and worked hard to make 2011 a great year. Thanks so much for your contributions.
This concludes my remarks. I'll turn the call over to Kevin who will walk us through the financial results in more detail. Kevin?"
598655,153955715,261842,"Garmin Ltd., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2012",2012-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin the financial update with a walk-through of our income statement followed by a review of our margins and then conclude with our balance sheet and cash flow position.During Q4, we posted revenue of",1830,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin the financial update with a walk-through of our income statement followed by a review of our margins and then conclude with our balance sheet and cash flow position.
During Q4, we posted revenue of $910 million, with net income of $166 million. Our pro forma EPS was $0.96 per share, which excludes the foreign currency loss. Our revenue represents an increase of 9% year-over-year. Gross margin came in at 47.7%, which was a 240-basis-point improvement from the prior year.
For the first time in 6 quarters, we experienced year-over-year operating income expansion, growing from $185 million to $200 million. Operating margin was 22%, flat from the prior year.
The components of our operating margin were: gross margin being 240 basis points favorable, offset by our advertising which was 90 basis points unfavorable, up $12 million on a year-over-year basis as we utilized TV advertising in the holiday quarter combined with increased co-op expenses; SG&A was 80 basis points unfavorable, up $14 million on a year-over-year basis due primarily to the acquisitions; R&D, 70 basis points unfavorable, up $13 million on a year-over-year basis due primarily to acquisitions as well.
Our pro forma EPS of $0.96 represents a 16% increase year-over-year, driven by increasing revenues and a slightly lower effective tax rate. Our units shipped were flat year-over-year as 6.1 million units were delivered during the quarter. And our total company average selling price was $150 per unit, up 9% from 2010, driven by product mix.
For the full year, we posted revenue of $2.76 billion, with net income of $521 million. Our pro forma EPS was $2.73 per share, which also excludes our foreign currency losses. Our revenue increased 3% year-over-year while our pro forma EPS decreased 5% when excluding FX and a $0.50 per share one-time tax adjustment we posted in 2010.
Our gross margin at 48.5% was a 150-basis-point decline over the prior year due to warranty adjustments during 2010, which contributed 160 basis points. Operating income fell 13% to $554 million compared to $637 million in 2010.
So our operating margin was 20.1%, down 360 basis points, up 23.7 last year; gross margin was 150 basis points favorable; advertising, 10 basis points favorable and flat on a year-over-year basis; our SG&A was 170 basis points unfavorable, up $53 million on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by acquisitions, our web-based commissions, product support and legal costs; R&D was 50 basis points unfavorable, up $22 million on a year-over-year basis, due primarily to the acquisition.
So our pro forma EPS of $2.73 was a 4% decrease year-over-year on increasing revenue and slightly lower effective tax rate, offset by declining growth and operating margins. Units shipped were down 1% year-over-year as 15.8 million units were delivered during the year. The decrease in North American PND volume was partially offset by growth in other geographies in our other segments. Our total company average selling price was $175 per unit, up 4% from 2010 due to product mix.
The non-GAAP measure that we reported represent net income per share excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and a one-time tax adjustment booked in Q3, as I mentioned. The Q4 2011 GAAP impact from foreign currency loss was $0.11. The Q4 2010 GAAP impact from foreign currency loss was $0.15. The full year 2011 GAAP impact from foreign currency loss was $0.06, while the 2010 loss impact was $0.38, offset by a $0.50 gain related to the large one-time tax adjustment.
According to U.S. GAAP, we must defer revenue on certain products, and this table summarizes the net impact of the deferral and amortization of revenue and related costs in the fourth quarter and full year 2011 and 2010. First, in the current quarter, we deferred approximately $0.26 of EPS in the future periods compared to $0.19 in the fourth quarter of 2010. Most of these revenues and costs will be amortized straight line over a 3-year period. For the full year, we deferred approximately $0.66 of EPS in 2011 compared to $0.42 in 2010. While we are deferring revenue according to U.S. GAAP, we are collecting the cash at time of sale, which has reflected positively in our statement of cash flows, which I'll review in a minute.
In total, our revenues increased 9% during the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. During Q4, we experienced a 4% revenue increase within the Auto/Mobile segment as volume declines were offset by improved pricing due to product mix. Our Outdoor segment posted accelerating growth at 35% due to pent up demand for new products and market share gains within the GPS-enabled golf market. The Fitness segment continue to grow with a 17% revenue increase when compared to Q4 2010 on the strength of our fitness products during the holiday quarter. Aviation segment revenues increased 1% compared to Q4 2010 as retrofit growth was largely offset by program contributions related to our business jet cockpit wins. And Marine segment revenues increased 16% compared to Q4 2010 as both the aftermarket and OEM markets improved for Garmin.
During Q4, all geographies were stable or growing, with EMEA posting the strongest growth at 28%. For the full year, EMEA grew 19% while Asia Pacific grew 13%. These geographies were partially offset by a 7% decline in the Americas, driven by the PND volume declines. And for 2011, the Americas represent 55% of revenue. EMEA increased to 31% of total revenue in 2010 to 36% in 2011; and Asia, from 8% to 9% in the same period.
So the Auto/Mobile segment represented 64% of our total revenue during the fourth quarter, down from 67% in Q4 2010. Outdoor grew to 13% of revenues in the quarter, an increased from 11% a year ago. The operating income contribution of the Outdoor and Fitness segments increased to 30% and 20%, respectively, or 50% of our total business. In total, the traditional segments contributed 61% of our fourth quarter operating income.
On a full year basis, Auto/Mobile revenue contribution declined from 62% to 58% in 2011, with gains in Outdoor, Fitness and Marine, which contributed 13%, 11% and 8%, respectively. The operating income contribution of the Auto/Mobile segment shrank 29% in 2011 compared to 39% a year ago. Our traditional segments contributed 71% of the full year operating income, with strong gains in both our Outdoor and Fitness segment.
Looking next at the margin by segment. Our fourth quarter Auto/Mobile gross margin and operating margin were 38% and 13%, respectively. The year-over-year improvement in gross margins was primarily driven by improved average selling prices due to product mix shifting toward higher-priced bundled offerings. Operating margins in the quarter were 13%, or 20% when adjusted for deferrals. This is slightly higher than the normalized operating margin of 19% fourth quarter of 2010.
Q4 Outdoor gross margin was 68%, consistent with Q4 2010. Operating margin was 49%, a decline from 53% in the year-ago quarter due to increased allocation of advertising and SG&A expenses for this segment.
Q4 Fitness gross margin was 64%, stable from the year-ago quarter. And operating margin was 43%, again consistent to the year-ago quarter as both revenue and expense growth were evenly paced.
Q4 Marine gross margin was 60% compared to 63% in the year-ago quarter as product mix shifted towards lower-margin products. Operating margin was 22%, down from 29% a year ago, driven by the gross margin decline and increased R&D and SG&A expenses to support our long-term marine OEM strategy.
Finally, Q4 Aviation gross margin was 65%, down from 70% in Q4 of 2010 due to OEM program contributions. Operating margin was 18% for the quarter, down from 26% in the prior year due to the declining gross margins and increased R&D expense associated with our new OEM programs that will begin to contribute to revenue in 2013.
Moving next to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of almost $2.5 billion. Our accounts receivable balance increased sequentially to $607 million due to sales growth during the holiday quarter.
Accounts receivable accounted for approximately 81 days of sales when calculated on a trailing 4 quarters compared to 101 days of sales in the fourth quarter of 2010. We have already collected approximately $350 million of our year-end balance.
Our inventory balances decreased to $398 million on a sequential basis at the close of the fourth quarter. Our days of inventory metric was 102 days compared to 119 in the fourth quarter of 2010. We ended the quarter with the following amounts and number of days of inventory: $129 million in raw materials, representing 31 days; $52 million in work in process and assemblies, or 13 days; and $246 million in finished goods, or 58 days of inventory. And we closed the year with $29 million in inventory reserves. You also notice on our balance sheet that we show a $78 million dividend payable to be paid on March 31, 2012.
We continue to generate strong cash flow across our business as cash from operations was $225 million during the quarter. Our CapEx spending was $12 million during Q4. Therefore, we generated free cash flow of $213 million. Cash flow invested during the fourth quarter was $164 million, including the $12 million in CapEx and $157 million net purchase of marketable securities offset by a $4 million gain on the sale of property, plant and equipment.
Financing activities were a $160 million use of cash during Q4, due primarily to the dividend payments we made on both September 30 and December 31. We earned an average of 1.5% on all cash and marketable securities balances during the quarter. And our full year operating cash was $822 million, with free cash flow of $784 million.
We expect our strong free cash flow generation to continue in 2012, and with it, we plan to continue to fund the strong dividend. As Cliff mentioned, we will ask shareholders to approve a $0.45 per share quarterly dividend in our June annual meeting, representing a 4% yield of the stock price of $45.
We will also continue to pursue acquisitions in adjacent niche markets or tuck-in technology which fit with our core markets. As has been our practice, acquisitions will be evaluated by technology, values, compatibility and strategic fit within Garmin.
Our tax rate for the full year 2011 was 10.8%. We do expect the 2012 rate to be approximately 13%. And the increase in this forecast of effective tax rate is attributable to revenue mix by different tax jurisdictions.
And finally, Cliff has reviewed our 2012 guidance, but I would just further highlight that we have 4 solid growth segments, and we will continue to invest for long-term growth across the entire business. Our strong profitability and market diversity position us well for both 2012 and the future.
This concludes our formal remarks for the morning. We will now move to a period of Q&A."

So I mean, those are the primary reasons that we want to continue to and we need to continue to invest in some new opportunities, primarily in the Auto OEM and the Aviation and Marine OEM segments.

598655,183392318,294923,"Garmin Ltd., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 02, 2012",2012-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered revenue and pro forma EPS growth in the first quarter. Consolidated revenues increased 10% year-over-year to $557 million, with each of our business segme",1015,"Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered revenue and pro forma EPS growth in the first quarter. Consolidated revenues increased 10% year-over-year to $557 million, with each of our business segments contributing. Our traditional markets of Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness attributed 14% revenue growth and 50% of the total revenue mix.
Gross margins improved to 51% from 47% in the prior year. Operating margins also improved 150 basis points to 16%, with our traditional markets providing 80% of the operating income mix in the quarter.
Revenue growth, combined with improved margins, resulted in both operating income and pro forma EPS growth. Operating income for the quarter grew 21% or $16 million. Our pro forma EPS came in at $0.45, a 5% improvement over the prior year. We sold 2.7 million units in the quarter, up 7% year-over-year.
Next, I'll walk you through the financial and strategic highlights segment by segment. 
Starting in the Marine segment, revenue grew 9% as the overall industry showed sign of improvement. The mild winter experienced throughout much of the U.S. may have triggered an early start to the Marine season. Growth was broad-based across our product portfolio.
An area of strategic focus in the Marine segment is to strengthen our position in the OEM space through product portfolio expansion and strategic alliances. As we have mentioned in the past, 2012 will be a year of significant investment, as we pursue opportunities that we believe will lead to growth in 2013 and beyond. Near-term impact will result in some level of margin compression. However, we expect to see this reverse as revenue growth accelerates in the future.
In Aviation, we posted revenue growth of 5% with both the retrofit and OEM markets contributing. However, OEM recovery still lags the broader economy, and we expect this condition to continue throughout the year. During the quarter, we supported the successful first flight of the Cessna M2, which includes the Garmin G3000 cockpit system. This certification project, along with several others, continue to make good progress. And we anticipate the program will contribute revenue growth in 2013 and beyond. These programs are very complex and require a higher level of R&D investment compared to what we have seen in the past. While this investment thus comprise our margins in the near term, we're confident that the investments we are making now will lead to growth in the future.
The Outdoor segment performed well in the first quarter with 16% revenue growth and 4% operating income growth. As the improvement was primarily driven by new categories such as GPS enabled golf products, as well as the tracking and training. In the golf market, we continue to expand our product offerings with the new Approach S3. This touchscreen watch provides an integrated score card and shows the layout of the greens and the ability to easily relocate the pin.
For 2012, we will focus on creating opportunities in adjacent markets and product categories as we have done in the past. We will also pursue utility, content and innovative form factors to capture both new and repeat customers.
Turning now to the Fitness segment. Revenue grew 26% and operating income grew 34% on a year-over-year basis. This strong performance was partially driven by the successful launch of our latest, multisport device, Forerunner 910 XT. This product has been well received and is expected to continue to perform well at the high end of the market as we enter the triathlon season.
We continue to believe the Fitness category offers significant opportunity for growth going forward. In response to this opportunity, we are focused on delivering innovation in both running and cycling to drive brother adoption of GPS technologies across a range of price points.
Our Auto/Mobile segment was strong again in the first quarter, delivering revenue growth of 6%. This growth was primarily related to global market share gains in PND. Sales of mobile applications and amortization of previously deferred revenues that Kevin will discuss in a moment.
During the quarter, we announced our first installed entertainment relationship with Suzuki. We will be providing a complete entertainment hedge units with enhanced features and an intuitive user interface to a number of Suzuki models in both North America and Europe, along with a number of additional regions. This represents a significant milestone for Garmin, as we seek to build relationships and credibility in the Auto OEM industry.
While we are pleased with the first quarter results in the Auto/Mobile segment, we don't expect this trend to continue into longer term, as PND represents a substantial portion of the revenue mix and the size of the PND market continues to shrink. We anticipate that the PND market will decline approximately 10% on a global basis for the full year. 
However, we expect our margins to improve throughout the remainder of the year as volumes increase from the seasonally low first quarter. Our strategic focus in the PND market is approximately aggregated additional market share through innovation and by delivering the best navigation service in the vehicle. 
With the Suzuki announcement, we took another step forward in building our OEM presence. However, we also recognize that this is just the beginning, as it relates to broader OEM market opportunities. We will continue to develop these opportunities, which will can't tribute to revenue growth in the years to come.
Before turning the call over to Kevin, I wanted to highlight another important milestone that was announced this morning. We are pleased to report we have surpassed the 100 million units sold mark. With our humble beginning to 1989, we have delivered quality products to motorists, pilots, runners, cyclists, hunters and geocaching around the world. We sold our first product in 1991, our millionth in 1997, 25 million in 2007 and now, over 100 million in 2012. It has been an incredible journey so far, and we are excited about our future. 
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin who will walk us through the financial details. Kevin?"
598655,183392318,294923,"Garmin Ltd., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 02, 2012",2012-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our income statement and margin results, then move to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, and then conclude with a few comments regarding our full year 2012 expectations. First,",1538,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our income statement and margin results, then move to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, and then conclude with a few comments regarding our full year 2012 expectations. First, we posted revenue of $557 million for the quarter with net income of $87 million. And our pro forma EPS was $0.45 per share, which excludes the foreign currency loss. The revenue represents an increase of 10% year-over-year and our gross margin came in at 51%. It was a 410 basis point improvement from the prior year. Operating margin was 16%, up 150 basis points from the prior year. Key components of this were the favorable gross margin of 410 basis points offset by advertising, which was 30 basis points of unfavorable and up $4 million on a year-over-year basis.
SG&A was 180 basis points unfavorable, up $17 million on the year-over-year basis. Our R&D was 40 basis points unfavorable, up $10 million on a year-over-year basis. And each of these expense categories will be discussed further on a later slide.
Our pro forma EPS of $0.45 represents a 5% increase year-over-year driven by increasing revenues, improved growth and operating margins offset by a higher effective tax rate. The first quarter 2011 effective tax rate of 1.5% provided an additional $0.06 of diluted EPS. 
Finally, units shipped increased 7% year-over-year as 2.7 million units were delivered during the quarter. Our total company average selling price was $205 per unit, up 2% from Q1 of 2011 driven primarily by our segment mix.
According to the U.S. GAAP, we must approve revenue in certain products. And this table summarizes the net impact for the deferral and amortization of revenue and related costs in the first quarter of 2012 and 2011. In the current quarter, we recognized on a net basis approximately $1 million of previously amortized revenues, resulting in no EPS impact during the quarter. 
In the first quarter of 2011, we deferred net revenue of $22 million or $0.09 of tax effective EPS. While there are differing revenue according to U.S. GAAP, we are collecting cash at the same time of sale as reflected in our statement of cash flows. We now expect to have a negative revenue and EPS impacts due to deferrals in the upcoming quarters but do not expect the impact to be as significant as the amounts that we deferred in 2011.
In total, our revenues increased 10% during the first quarter with all segments contributing to the growth. In Q1, we generated a 6% revenue increase within the Auto/Mobile segment, with volumes increased due to our 2011 acquisition of Navigon and we continue to gain market share. This piece also increased slightly driven by the recognition of previously deferred revenues.
Outdoor segment posted strong revenue growth of 16% due primarily to market share gains within the GPS-enabled golf market and the acquisition of Tri-Tronics in the back half of 2011. The Fitness segment continued to grow with a 26% revenue increase when compared to Q1 of 2011 on the strength of new product introductions, particularly the Forerunner 910 XT for the triathlete market.
Aviation segment revenues increased 5% compared to Q1 2011 with a single-digit growth in both aftermarket and OEM. In our Marine segment, revenues increased 9% compared to Q1 of 2011, as both the aftermarket and OEM markets improved for Garmin.
During Q1, all geographies posted growth. EMEA posting the strongest growth at 16%. Q1 2012, the Americas represented 53% of revenue compared to 55% in Q1 of 2011. EMEA increased from 34% of total revenue a year ago to 36% in Q1 of this 12 while Asia was consistent at 11% of total.
The Auto/Mobile segment represented 50% of our total revenue during the quarter, down 52% from Q1 of 2011, and Fitness grew to 13% of revenues in the quarter that increased from 11% in 2011.
Due to the improved profitability of Auto/Mobile in Q1 of 2012, the operating income contribution of this segment increased to 20% from only 2% in the prior year. Traditional segments of Outdoor, Fitness, Aviation and marine contributed 80% of our Q1 total 2012 operating income.
Looking next at margins. Q1 Auto/Mobile gross margin and operating margin were 39% and 6%, respectively. This year-over-year in gross margin was primarily driven by the amortization of previously deferred high-margin revenue and product mix. Operating margin in the quarter was 6%, with gross margin improvement offset by increased SG&A and R&D expenses, focused on Auto OEM.
Q1 Outdoor gross margin was 61%, down slightly from Q1 of 2011. Operating margin was 34%, a decline from 37% of the year ago quarter due primarily to the increased allocations of our SG&A expenses to the segment.
Q1 Fitness gross margin was 61%, up slightly from the year ago quarter. Our operating margin in the segment was 29%, again up slightly to the year-ago quarter as the revenue growth outpaced our expense increases.
Q1 marine gross margin was 60% compared to 65% in the year-ago quarter, as product mix shifted toward lower margin products. Operating margin was 16%, down 20 -- down from 29% a year ago, driven by the gross margin decline, increased R&D expenses to support our long-term Marine OEM strategy, as well as cooperative advertising within our -- with our Marine partners.
And finally, the Q1 Aviation gross margin came in at 68%, down slightly from 69% a year ago. Operating margin was 23% for the quarter, down from 26% in the prior year due primarily to the decline in gross margin, an increased R&D expense associated with our new OEM programs that will begin to contribute revenue in 2013.
Q1 operating expenses increased by $30 million on a year-over-year basis from $164 million up to $193 million in Q1 of 2012, an increased 260 basis points as a percentage of sales. A large portion of the increase was due to the acquisitions that I will highlight. Sequentially, operating expenses declined in all 3 categories.
First, R&D increased $10 million year-over-year in the quarter and 40 basis points to 14% of sales, as headcount increased with our recent acquisitions and we continue to invest in several OEM opportunities. Our as that being increased $4 million of the very ago quarter with an increase of 30 basis points as a percentage of sales to 4% in Q1 of 2012. This was largely driven by additional costs associated with our acquired entities and cooperative advertising and promotional activities in our Marine and Aviation segments.
SG&A increased $17 million compared to the year-ago quarter, an increase of 180 basis points to 16% of sales, increased his primarily attributable to our acquisitions and to increased legal fees.
Moving next to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.5 billion. Our accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $430 million due to the seasonality in the first quarter. AR accounted for approximately 56 days in sales when calculated on the trailing 4 quarters compared to 81 days of sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 58 days of sales in the year-ago quarter.
Our inventory balances increased slightly to $407 million on a sequential basis at the close of first quarter. The days of inventory metric was 102 days compared to 102 in the fourth quarter and 119 days in the first quarter of 2011. We do not currently show a dividend payable at the $1.80 per share requires approval of our shareholders on June 1 at our annual meeting.
We continue to generate free cash flow across our business as cash from operations is $122 million during Q1. We spent $6 million on CapEx during Q1. Therefore, our fee cash flow during the quarter was $116 million. Cash flow invested during Q1 was $55 million, including the $6 million in CapEx and $43 million net purchase of marketable securities. Our financing activities were $74 million use of cash during the quarter, due primarily to the dividend payment on March 31. And overall, we earned an average of 1.5% in all of our cash and marketable security balances during the quarter.
We expect our strong free cash flow generation to continue in 2012. And with it, we plan to continue o fund stronger dividend. We will ask shareholders to approve a 45% share of quarterly dividend at our June annual meeting. We'll also continue to pursue acquisitions and adjacent niche markets, or tuck0in technologies, which that our markets. As it has been our practice in the past, acquisitions will be evaluated by technology, value compatibility and a strategic fit within our company.
Tax rate for the quarter was 12.8%, and we expect our 2012 rate to be approximately 13% for the full year.
Finally, as a reminder, we provided our full year 2012 guidance in February. And we are in not updating guidance at this time, as our Q1 trends were generally in line with our own expectations and is the seasonally the weakest quarter of our fiscal year. We will plan to review and update 2012 guidance following our Q2 results. 
This concludes our formal remarks. We will now move to the period of Q&A."

So we are able to ramp up production up and it does take some time to get the field up to the field. Some of the retailers are small independence and that does take some time to fill their needs. In terms of the Vector, we are testing prototypes at this point and so we do have systems that are being filed and proven.

As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered revenue and pro forma EPS growth in the first quarter. Consolidated revenues increased 10% year-over-year to $557 million, with each of our business segme",1020,"Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered revenue and pro forma EPS growth in the first quarter. Consolidated revenues increased 10% year-over-year to $557 million, with each of our business segments contributing. Our traditional markets of Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness attributed 14% revenue growth and 50% of the total revenue mix.
Gross margins improved to 51% from 47% in the prior year. Operating margins also improved 150 basis points to 16%, with our traditional markets providing 80% of the operating income mix in the quarter.
Revenue growth, combined with improved margins, resulted in both operating income and pro forma EPS growth. Operating income for the quarter grew 21% or $16 million, while pro forma EPS came in at $0.45, a 5% improvement over the prior year. We sold 2.7 million units in the quarter, up 7% year-over-year.
Next, I'll walk you through the financial and strategic highlights, segment by segment. 
Starting in the Marine segment, revenue grew 9% as the overall industry showed signs of improvement. The mild winter experienced throughout much of the U.S. may have triggered an early start to the marine season. Growth was broad-based across our product portfolio.
An area of strategic focus in the Marine segment is to strengthen our position in the OEM space through product portfolio expansion and strategic alliances. As we have mentioned in the past, 2012 will be a year of significant investment, as we pursue opportunities that we believe will lead to growth in 2013 and beyond. The near-term impact will result in some level of margin compression. However, we expect to see this reverse as revenue growth accelerates in the future.
In Aviation, we posted revenue growth of 5%, with both the retrofit and OEM markets contributing. However, OEM recovery still lags the broader economy, and we expect this condition to continue throughout the year. During the quarter, we supported the successful first flight of the Cessna M2, which includes the Garmin G3000 cockpit system. This certification project, along with several others, continue to make good progress, and we anticipate the program will contribute to revenue growth in 2013 and beyond. These programs are very complex and require a higher level of R&D investment compared to what we have seen in the past. While this investment does compress our margins in the near term, we are confident that the investments we are making now will lead to growth in the future.
The Outdoor segment performed well in the first quarter with 16% revenue growth and 4% operating income growth. Revenue improvement was primarily driven by new categories such as GPS-enabled golf products, as well as dog tracking and training. In the golf market, we continue to expand our product offerings with the new Approach S3. This touchscreen watch provides an integrated digital scorecard and shows the layout of the greens with the ability to easily relocate the pin.
Throughout 2012, we will focus on creating new opportunities in adjacent markets and product categories as we have done in the past. We will also pursue utility, content and innovative form factors to capture both new and repeat customers.
Turning now to the Fitness segment. Revenue grew 26% and operating income grew 34% on a year-over-year basis. This strong performance was partially driven by the successful launch of our latest, multisport device, the Forerunner 910XT. This product has been well received and is expected to continue to perform well at the high end of the market as we enter triathlon season.
We continue to believe the Fitness category offers significant opportunity for growth going forward. In response to this opportunity, we are focused on delivering innovation in both running and cycling to drive broader adoption of GPS technology across a range of price points.
Our Auto/Mobile segment was strong again in the first quarter, delivering revenue growth of 6%. This growth was primarily related to global market share gains in PND sales of automobile -- mobile applications and amortization of previously deferred revenues that Kevin will discuss in a moment.
During the quarter, we announced our first factory-installed infotainment relationship with Suzuki. We will be providing a complete entertainment head unit with enhanced features and an intuitive user-interface to a number of Suzuki models in both North America and Europe, along with a number of additional regions. This represents a significant milestone for Garmin, as we seek to build relationships and credibility in the auto OEM industry.
While we are pleased with the first quarter results in the Auto/Mobile segment, we don't expect this trend to continue in the longer term as PND represents a substantial portion of the revenue mix, and the size of the PND market continues to shrink. We anticipate that the PND market will decline approximately 10% on a global basis for the full year. 
However, we expect our margins to improve throughout the remainder of the year as volumes increase from the seasonally low first quarter. Our strategic focus in the PND market is to possibly aggregate additional market share through innovation and by delivering the best navigation experience in the vehicle. 
With the Suzuki announcement, we took another step forward in building our OEM presence. However, we also recognize that this is just the beginning, as it relates to broader OEM market opportunities. We will continue to develop these opportunities, which will contribute to revenue growth in the years to come.
Before turning the call over to Kevin, I wanted to highlight another important milestone that was announced this morning. We are pleased to report we have surpassed the 100 million units sold mark. Since our humble beginnings in 1989, we have delivered quality products to motorists, pilots, loaders, runners, cyclists, bikers, hunters and geocachers around the globe. We sold our first product in 1991, our millionth in 1997, 25 million in 2007 and now, over 100 million in 2012. It has been an incredible journey so far, and we are excited about our future. 
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin, who will walk us through the financial details. Kevin?"
598655,183392318,295123,"Garmin Ltd., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 02, 2012",2012-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our income statement and margin results, then move to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, and then conclude with a few comments regarding our full year 2012 expectations. So fi",1537,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our income statement and margin results, then move to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, and then conclude with a few comments regarding our full year 2012 expectations. 
So first, we posted revenue of $557 million for the quarter with net income of $87 million. And our pro forma EPS was $0.45 per share, which excludes the foreign currency loss. Our revenue represents an increase of 10% year-over-year and our gross margin came in at 51%, which was a 410-basis point improvement from the prior year. Operating margin was 16%, up 150 basis points from the prior year. The key components of this were the favorable gross margin of 410 basis points offset by advertising, which was 30 basis points of unfavorable and up $4 million on a year-over-year basis.
SG&A was 180 basis points unfavorable, up $17 million on a year-over-year basis. Our R&D was 40 basis points unfavorable, up $10 million on a year-over-year basis. And each of these expense categories will be discussed further on a later slide.
Our pro forma EPS of $0.45 represents a 5% increase year-over-year, driven by increasing revenues, improved growth and operating margins offset by a higher effective tax rate. The first quarter 2011 effective tax rate of 1.5% provided an additional $0.06 of diluted EPS. 
And finally, units shipped increased 7% year-over-year as 2.7 million units were delivered during the quarter. Our total company average selling price was $205 per unit, up 2% from Q1 of 2011, driven primarily by our segment mix.
According to the U.S. GAAP, we must defer revenue on certain products, and this table summarizes the net impact of the deferral and amortization of revenue and related costs in the first quarter of 2012 and 2011. In the current quarter, we recognized, on a net basis, approximately $1 million of previously amortized revenues, resulting in no EPS impact during the quarter. 
In the first quarter of 2011, we deferred net revenue of $22 million or $0.09 of tax-affected EPS. While we are deferring revenue according to U.S. GAAP, we are collecting cash at the same time of sale, as reflected in our statement of cash flows. We now expect to have a negative revenue and EPS impacts due to deferrals in the upcoming quarters, but do not expect the impact to be as significant as the amounts that we deferred in 2011.
In total, our revenues increased 10% during the first quarter, with all segments contributing to the growth. In Q1, we generated a 6% revenue increase within the Auto/Mobile segment, as volumes increased due to our 2011 acquisition of Navigon, and we continue to gain market share. ASP also increased slightly, driven by the recognition of previously deferred revenues.
Our Outdoor segment posted strong revenue growth at 16%, due primarily to market share gains within the GPS-enabled golf market and the acquisition of Tri-Tronics in the back half of 2011. 
The Fitness segment continued to grow with a 26% revenue increase when compared to Q1 of 2011 on the strength of new product introductions, particularly the Forerunner 910XT for the triathlete market.
Aviation segment revenues increased 5% compared to Q1 2011 with a single-digit growth in both aftermarket and OEM. In our Marine segment, revenues increased 9% compared to Q1 of 2011, as both the aftermarket and OEM markets improved for Garmin.
During Q1, all geographies posted growth, with EMEA posting the strongest growth at 16%. For Q1 2012, the Americas represented 53% of revenue compared to 55% in Q1 of 2011. EMEA increased from 34% of total revenue a year ago to 36% in Q1 of 2012, while Asia was consistent at 11% of total.
The Auto/Mobile segment represented 50% of our total revenue during the quarter, down 52% from Q1 of 2011. And Fitness grew to 13% of revenues in the quarter, an increase from 11% in 2011.
Due to the improved profitability of Auto/Mobile in Q1 of 2012, the operating income contribution of the segment increased to 20% from only 2% in the prior year. The traditional segments of Outdoor, Fitness, Aviation and Marine contributed 80% of our Q1 total 2012 operating income.
Looking next at margins. Q1 Auto/Mobile gross margin and operating margin were 39% and 6%, respectively. This year-over-year improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the amortization of previously deferred high-margin revenue and product mix. Operating margin in the quarter was 6%, with gross margin improvement offset by increased SG&A and R&D expenses, focused on auto OEM.
Q1 Outdoor gross margin was 61%, down slightly from Q1 of 2011. Operating margin was 34%, a decline from 37% in the year-ago quarter, due primarily to increased allocation of our SG&A expenses to this segment.
Q1 Fitness gross margin, 61%, up slightly from the year-ago quarter. Our operating margin in this segment was 29%, again, up slightly to the year-ago quarter as the revenue growth outpaced our expense increases.
Q1 marine gross margin was 60% compared to 65% in the year-ago quarter, as product mix shifted toward lower margin products. Operating margin was 16%, down 20 -- down from 29% a year ago, driven by the gross margin decline, increased R&D expenses to support our long-term marine OEM strategy, as well as cooperative advertising within our -- with our marine partners.
And finally, the Q1 Aviation gross margin came in at 68%, down slightly from 69% a year ago. Operating margin was 23% for the quarter, down from 26% in the prior year, due primarily to the decline in gross margin and increased R&D expense associated with our new OEM programs that will begin to contribute revenue in 2013.
Q1 operating expenses increased by $30 million on a year-over-year basis from $164 million, up to $193 million in Q1 of 2012, an increase to 260 basis points as a percentage of sales. A large portion of the increase was due to the acquisitions that I will highlight. Sequentially, operating expenses declined in all 3 categories.
First, R&D increased $10 million year-over-year in the quarter and 40 basis points to 14% of sales, as headcount increased with our recent acquisitions, and we continue to invest in several OEM opportunities. Our ad spending increased $4 million over the year-ago quarter, with an increase of 30 basis points as a percentage of sales to 4% in Q1 of 2012. This was largely driven by additional costs associated with our acquired entities and cooperative advertising and promotional activities in our Marine and Aviation segments.
SG&A increased $17 million compared to the year-ago quarter, with an increase of 180 basis points to 16% of sales. The increase was primarily attributable to our acquisitions and increased legal fees.
Moving next to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.5 billion. Our accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $430 million due to the seasonality of the first quarter. AR accounted for approximately 56 days of sales when calculated on the trailing 4 quarters, compared to 81 days of sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 58 days of sales in the year-ago quarter.
Our inventory balances increased slightly to $407 million on a sequential basis at the close of the first quarter. Our days of inventory metric was 102 days, compared to 102 in the fourth quarter and 119 days in the first quarter of 2011. We do not currently show a dividend payable as the $1.80 per share requires approval of our shareholders on June 1 at our annual meeting.
We continue to generate free cash flow across our business as cash from operations was $122 million during Q1. We spent $6 million on CapEx during Q1, therefore, our free cash flow during the quarter was $116 million. Cash flow invested during Q1 was $55 million, including the $6 million in CapEx and $43 million net purchase of marketable securities. Our financing activities were $74 million use of cash during the quarter, due primarily to the dividend payment on March 31. And overall, we earned an average of 1.5% in all of our cash and marketable security balances during the quarter.
We expect our strong free cash flow generation to continue in 2012. And with it, we plan to continue to fund the strong dividend. We will ask shareholders to approve a 45% share quarterly dividend at our June annual meeting. We'll also continue to pursue acquisitions in adjacent niche markets or tuck-in technologies, which fit our core markets. As has been our practice in the past, acquisitions will be evaluated by technology, value compatibility and a strategic fit within our company.
Tax rate for the quarter was 12.8%, and we expect our 2012 rate to be approximately 13% for the full year.
Finally, as a reminder, we provided our full year 2012 guidance in February. And we are not updating guidance at this time, as our Q1 trends were generally in line with our own expectations and is the seasonally weakest quarter of our fiscal year. We will plan to review and update 2012 guidance following our Q2 results. 
This concludes our formal remarks, and we will now move to a period of Q&A."

So we are able to ramp that production up, but it does take some time to get those fed out to the field. Some of the retailers are small independents and it does take some time to fill their needs. In terms of the Vector, we are testing prototypes at this point and so we do have systems that are being filed and proven. As we mentioned in our update recently, we weren't happy with what we felt was the performance required for the cycling market.

598655,183392318,295244,"Garmin Ltd., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 02, 2012",2012-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered revenue and pro forma EPS growth in the first quarter. Consolidated revenues increased 10% year-over-year to $557 million, with each of our business segme",1020,"Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered revenue and pro forma EPS growth in the first quarter. Consolidated revenues increased 10% year-over-year to $557 million, with each of our business segments contributing. Our traditional markets of Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness attributed 14% revenue growth and 50% of the total revenue mix.
Gross margins improved to 51% from 47% in the prior year. Operating margins also improved 150 basis points to 16%, with our traditional markets providing 80% of the operating income mix in the quarter.
Revenue growth, combined with improved margins, resulted in both operating income and pro forma EPS growth. Operating income for the quarter grew 21% or $16 million, while pro forma EPS came in at $0.45, a 5% improvement over the prior year. We sold 2.7 million units in the quarter, up 7% year-over-year.
Next, I'll walk you through the financial and strategic highlights, segment by segment. 
Starting in the Marine segment, revenue grew 9% as the overall industry showed signs of improvement. The mild winter experienced throughout much of the U.S. may have triggered an early start to the marine season. Growth was broad-based across our product portfolio.
An area of strategic focus in the Marine segment is to strengthen our position in the OEM space through product portfolio expansion and strategic alliances. As we have mentioned in the past, 2012 will be a year of significant investment, as we pursue opportunities that we believe will lead to growth in 2013 and beyond. The near-term impact will result in some level of margin compression. However, we expect to see this reverse as revenue growth accelerates in the future.
In Aviation, we posted revenue growth of 5%, with both the retrofit and OEM markets contributing. However, OEM recovery still lags the broader economy, and we expect this condition to continue throughout the year. During the quarter, we supported the successful first flight of the Cessna M2, which includes the Garmin G3000 cockpit system. This certification project, along with several others, continue to make good progress, and we anticipate the program will contribute to revenue growth in 2013 and beyond. These programs are very complex and require a higher level of R&D investment compared to what we have seen in the past. While this investment does compress our margins in the near term, we are confident that the investments we are making now will lead to growth in the future.
The Outdoor segment performed well in the first quarter with 16% revenue growth and 4% operating income growth. Revenue improvement was primarily driven by new categories such as GPS-enabled golf products, as well as dog tracking and training. In the golf market, we continued to expand our product offerings with the new Approach S3. This touchscreen watch provides an integrated digital scorecard and shows the layout of the greens with the ability to easily relocate the pin.
Throughout 2012, we will focus on creating new opportunities in adjacent markets and product categories as we have done in the past. We will also pursue utility, content and innovative form factors to capture both new and repeat customers.
Turning now to the Fitness segment. Revenue grew 26% and operating income grew 34% on a year-over-year basis. This strong performance was partially driven by the successful launch of our latest, multisport device, the Forerunner 910XT. This product has been well received and is expected to continue to perform well at the high end of the market as we enter triathlon season.
We continue to believe the Fitness category offers significant opportunity for growth going forward. In response to this opportunity, we are focused on delivering innovation in both running and cycling to drive broader adoption of GPS technology across a range of price points.
Our Auto/Mobile segment was strong again in the first quarter, delivering revenue growth of 6%. This growth was primarily related to global market share gains in PND, sales of automobile -- mobile applications and amortization of previously deferred revenues that Kevin will discuss in a moment.
During the quarter, we announced our first factory-installed infotainment relationship with Suzuki. We will be providing a complete entertainment head unit with enhanced features and an intuitive user-interface to a number of Suzuki models in both North America and Europe, along with a number of additional regions. This represents a significant milestone for Garmin, as we seek to build relationships and credibility in the auto OEM industry.
While we are pleased with the first quarter results in the Auto/Mobile segment, we don't expect this trend to continue in the longer term as PND represents a substantial portion of the revenue mix, and the size of the PND market continues to shrink. We anticipate that the PND market will decline approximately 10% on a global basis for the full year. 
However, we expect our margins to improve throughout the remainder of the year as volumes increase from the seasonally low first quarter. Our strategic focus in the PND market is to profitably aggregate additional market share through innovation and by delivering the best navigation experience in the vehicle. 
With the Suzuki announcement, we took another step forward in building our OEM presence. However, we also recognize that this is just the beginning, as it relates to broader OEM market opportunities. We will continue to develop these opportunities, which will contribute to revenue growth in the years to come.
Before turning the call over to Kevin, I wanted to highlight another important milestone that was announced this morning. We are pleased to report we have surpassed the 100 million units sold mark. Since our humble beginnings in 1989, we have delivered quality products to motorists, pilots, boaters, runners, cyclists, bikers, hunters and geocachers around the globe. We sold our first product in 1991, our millionth in 1997, 25 million in 2007 and now, over 100 million in 2012. It has been an incredible journey so far, and we are excited about our future. 
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin, who will walk us through the financial details. Kevin?"
598655,183392318,295244,"Garmin Ltd., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 02, 2012",2012-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our income statement and margin results, then move to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, and then conclude with a few comments regarding our full year 2012 expectations. So fi",1538,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our income statement and margin results, then move to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, and then conclude with a few comments regarding our full year 2012 expectations. 
So first, we posted revenue of $557 million for the quarter with net income of $87 million. And our pro forma EPS was $0.45 per share, which excludes the foreign currency loss. Our revenue represents an increase of 10% year-over-year and our gross margin came in at 51%, which was a 410-basis point improvement from the prior year. Operating margin was 16%, up 150 basis points from the prior year. The key components of this were the favorable gross margin of 410 basis points offset by advertising, which was 30 basis points unfavorable and up $4 million on a year-over-year basis.
SG&A was 180 basis points unfavorable, up $17 million on a year-over-year basis. Our R&D was 40 basis points unfavorable, up $10 million on a year-over-year basis. And each of these expense categories will be discussed further on a later slide.
Our pro forma EPS of $0.45 represents a 5% increase year-over-year, driven by increasing revenues, improved growth and operating margins offset by a higher effective tax rate. The first quarter 2011 effective tax rate of 1.5% provided an additional $0.06 of diluted EPS. 
And finally, units shipped increased 7% year-over-year as 2.7 million units were delivered during the quarter. Our total company average selling price was $205 per unit, up 2% from Q1 of 2011, driven primarily by our segment mix.
According to the U.S. GAAP, we must defer revenue on certain products, and this table summarizes the net impact of the deferral and amortization of revenue and related costs in the first quarter of 2012 and 2011. In the current quarter, we recognized, on a net basis, approximately $1 million of previously amortized revenues, resulting in no EPS impact during the quarter. 
In the first quarter of 2011, we deferred net revenue of $22 million or $0.09 of tax-affected EPS. While we are deferring revenue according to U.S. GAAP, we are collecting cash at the same time of sale, as reflected in our statement of cash flows. We now expect to have a negative revenue and EPS impacts due to deferrals in the upcoming quarters, but do not expect the impact to be as significant as the amounts that we deferred in 2011.
In total, our revenues increased 10% during the first quarter, with all segments contributing to the growth. In Q1, we generated a 6% revenue increase within the Auto/Mobile segment, as volumes increased due to our 2011 acquisition of Navigon, and we continued to gain market share. ASP also increased slightly, driven by the recognition of previously deferred revenues.
Our Outdoor segment posted strong revenue growth at 16%, due primarily to market share gains within the GPS-enabled golf market and the acquisition of Tri-Tronics in the back half of 2011. 
The Fitness segment continued to grow with a 26% revenue increase when compared to Q1 of 2011 on the strength of new product introductions, particularly the Forerunner 910XT for the triathlete market.
Aviation segment revenues increased 5% compared to Q1 2011 with a single-digit growth in both aftermarket and OEM. In our Marine segment, revenues increased 9% compared to Q1 of 2011, as both the aftermarket and OEM markets improved for Garmin.
During Q1, all geographies posted growth, with EMEA posting the strongest growth at 16%. For Q1 2012, the Americas represented 53% of revenue compared to 55% in Q1 of 2011. EMEA increased from 34% of total revenue a year ago to 36% in Q1 of 2012, while Asia was consistent at 11% of total.
The Auto/Mobile segment represented 50% of our total revenue during the quarter, down 52% from Q1 of 2011. And Fitness grew to 13% of revenues in the quarter, an increase from 11% in 2011.
Due to the improved profitability of Auto/Mobile in Q1 of 2012, the operating income contribution of the segment increased to 20% from only 2% in the prior year. The traditional segments of Outdoor, Fitness, Aviation and Marine contributed 80% of our Q1 total 2012 operating income.
Looking next at margins. Q1 Auto/Mobile gross margin and operating margin were 39% and 6%, respectively. This year-over-year improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the amortization of previously deferred high-margin revenue and product mix. Operating margin in the quarter was 6%, with gross margin improvement offset by increased SG&A and R&D expenses, focused on auto OEM.
Q1 Outdoor gross margin was 61%, down slightly from Q1 of 2011. Operating margin was 34%, a decline from 37% in the year-ago quarter, due primarily to increased allocation of our SG&A expenses to this segment.
Q1 Fitness gross margin, 61%, up slightly from the year-ago quarter. Our operating margin in this segment was 29%, again, up slightly to the year-ago quarter as the revenue growth outpaced our expense increases.
Q1 marine gross margin was 60% compared to 65% in the year-ago quarter, as product mix shifted toward lower margin products. Operating margin was 16%, down 20 -- down from 29% a year ago, driven by the gross margin decline, increased R&D expenses to support our long-term marine OEM strategy, as well as cooperative advertising within our -- with our marine partners.
And finally, the Q1 Aviation gross margin came in at 68%, down slightly from 69% a year ago. Operating margin was 23% for the quarter, down from 26% in the prior year, due primarily to the decline in gross margin and increased R&D expense associated with our new OEM programs that will begin to contribute revenue in 2013.
Q1 operating expenses increased by $30 million on a year-over-year basis from $164 million, up to $193 million in Q1 of 2012, an increase to 260 basis points as a percentage of sales. A large portion of the increase was due to the acquisitions as I will highlight. Sequentially, operating expenses declined in all 3 categories.
First, R&D increased $10 million year-over-year in the quarter and 40 basis points to 14% of sales, as headcount increased with our recent acquisitions, and we continue to invest in several OEM opportunities. Our ad spending increased $4 million over the year-ago quarter, with an increase of 30 basis points as a percentage of sales to 4% in Q1 of 2012. This was largely driven by additional costs associated with our acquired entities and cooperative advertising and promotional activities in our Marine and Aviation segments.
SG&A increased $17 million compared to the year-ago quarter, an increase of 180 basis points to 16% of sales. The increase was primarily attributable to our acquisitions and to increased legal fees.
Moving next to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.5 billion. Our accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $430 million due to the seasonality of the first quarter. AR accounted for approximately 56 days of sales when calculated on a trailing 4 quarters, compared to 81 days of sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 58 days of sales in the year-ago quarter.
Our inventory balances increased slightly to $407 million on a sequential basis at the close of the first quarter. Our days of inventory metric was 102 days, compared to 102 in the fourth quarter and 119 days in the first quarter of 2011. We do not currently show a dividend payable as the $1.80 per share requires approval of our shareholders on June 1 at our annual meeting.
We continued to generate free cash flow across our business as cash from operations was $122 million during Q1. We spent $6 million on CapEx during Q1, therefore, our free cash flow during the quarter was $116 million. Cash flow invested during Q1 was $55 million, including the $6 million in CapEx and $43 million net purchase of marketable securities. Our financing activities were a $74 million use of cash during the quarter, due primarily to the dividend payment on March 31. And overall, we earned an average of 1.5% in all of our cash and marketable security balances during the quarter.
We expect our strong free cash flow generation to continue in 2012. And with it, we plan to continue to fund a strong dividend. We will ask shareholders to approve a 45% share quarterly dividend at our June annual meeting. We'll also continue to pursue acquisitions in adjacent niche markets or tuck-in technologies, which fit our core markets. As has been our practice in the past, acquisitions will be evaluated by technology, value compatibility and a strategic fit within our company.
Tax rate for the quarter was 12.8%, and we expect our 2012 rate to be approximately 13% for the full year.
Finally, as a reminder, we provided our full year 2012 guidance in February. And we are not updating guidance at this time, as our Q1 trends were generally in line with our own expectations and it is the seasonally weakest quarter of our fiscal year. We will plan to review and update 2012 guidance following our Q2 results. 
This concludes our formal remarks, and we will now move to a period of Q&A."

In terms of the Vector, we are testing prototypes at this point and so we do have systems that are being filed and proven.

As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered strong revenue and margin performance resulting in a pro forma EPS growth of 56% in the second quarter. Consolidated revenues increased 7% year-over-yea",1222,"Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered strong revenue and margin performance resulting in a pro forma EPS growth of 56% in the second quarter. 
Consolidated revenues increased 7% year-over-year to $718 million with growth in Outdoor pacing all of the segments at 24%. Our traditional markets of Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness contributed 45% of the total revenue mix. Gross margins improved to 59% from 48% in the prior year. Kevin will discuss specific items impacting margin performance later during his remarks. 
Operating margins also improved significantly to 28% with our traditional markets posting 10% operating income growth in the quarter. Revenue growth combined with improved margins resulted in both operating income and pro forma EPS growth. 
Operating income for the quarter grew 55% to $204 million while pro forma EPS was $0.98, a 56% improvement over the prior year. We sold 3.9 million units in the quarter, up 4% year-over-year. Next I'll walk you through the financial and strategic highlights segment by segment.
Starting first with Marine. Revenue in the Marine segment declined 14%, driven by weak economic conditions around the world. However, better gross margins largely offset the impact of lower sales. Sales in Europe were down sharply while sales in other regions were comparatively better but still soft during the normally robust second quarter selling season. 
While the industry statistics indicated that boating sales have improved, the trend seems to be towards low end boats where there's little to no Marine electronics content. We maintain a high level of confidence in our long-term opportunities in the Marine segment and are continuing to invest in new product development and strategic alliances that position us for market share gains. As we have mentioned previously, these investments will create near-term operating margin compressions.
In Aviation, we posted revenue growth of 4% as improvements in OEM deliveries were partially offset by weakness in the aftermarket. In recent quarters, operating margin has trended below historical norms as new programs require a higher level of R&D investment compared to what we have seen in the past. We remain confident that these investments will lead to stronger revenue and operating margin growth for the future. 
During the quarter, we made additional announcements that demonstrate the progress we are making to expand our presence in the business jet market. Selected are G5000 integrated flight deck where the new Citation Longitude, which is the longest range business jet operating in the Cessna lineup. This expands upon the already successful relationship we have had with Cessna for many years now. 
In addition, we announced a new relationship with Bombardier. We selected the G5000 for the new Learjet 70 and 75, which are scheduled for delivery in 2013.
Due to the steady increasing number of new confident certifications that are in progress, we thought it would be helpful to provide a summary of the major wins that has been announced so far and projected entry into service based on publicly available information from the aircraft manufacturers. In 2013, we anticipate entry into service of the Citation M2 with the G3000 integrated cockpit system. The Citation Ten with the G5000 integrated cockpit system and the Learjet 70 and 75 also with the G5000 system. 
In 2015, we anticipate entry into service for the Citation Latitude, which will be equipped with the G5000 system. And finally, in 2017, we anticipate entering into service where the Citation Longitude, which will be equipped with the G5000 system. 
We expect these wins along with other initiatives to deliver revenue growth in Aviation that outpaces that of the overall industry. 
Turning next to Outdoor. The Outdoor segment continue to perform well in the quarter with 24% revenue growth and 23% operating income growth, driven by new products and category expansion. In the golf market, we are experiencing growth across our product offerings with our high-end wristwatch the Approach S3 and our newest handheld, the Approach G6, both contributing to the strong results. 
In early July, we introduced yet another innovative product in the Outdoor category, which is the fenix, this rugged yet stylish wristwatch integrates best-in-class Outdoor watch functionality with GPS navigation. In addition to the GPS functionality, which we are known for, the built-in sensors include an altimeter for elevation, a barometer for providing weather information and a compass for navigation and tracking. The watch can also be paired with additional sensors to provide temperature, heart rate and cadence. We believe this is a highly attractive offering at a value price of $400.
Looking next at the Fitness segment. Revenue grew 5% while operating income grew 35% on a year-over-year basis. The slower revenue growth but strong margin performance are attributable to a variety -- variability in our product cycle during the past year. 
In 2011, we delivered the Forerunner 610, which positively impacted revenue through channel sale, while discounts on the end-of-life Forerunner 305 drove additional volumes, but that negatively impacted margins. So far in 2012, there have been no major product announcements. However, we have experienced good demand for our high-end products including the Forerunner 910XT, the Forerunner 610 and the Edge 500. We anticipate revenue growth rates will improve later this year as we launch new products in time for the holiday season. 
Late in the quarter, we launched the Garmin Swim, our first fitness product that targets the swimming market. This training watch tracks stroke type, stroke count, distance, pace and lengths. This information can be uploaded to Garmin Connect for post-workout analysis. Garmin Swim was introduced at the U.S. Masters summer swimming championships where it was well received by the swimming community, including both former Olympians and Olympic hopefuls. 
Our Automotive/Mobile segment experienced another strong quarter with revenue growth of 8% along with strong margins. Our strong margin performance was partially due to a onetime benefit of $21 million due to an overpayment of certain royalties. Kevin will provide additional details in a moment. We gained additional market share in the second quarter, and now estimate that our market share in North America exceeds 70% with European market share of approximately 35%. 
While we have posted 3 consecutive quarters of revenue growth in the segment, we continue to expect that the overall PND market will decline approximately 10% to 15% in units and value for the year. This decline is consistent with our prior expectations for the market. 
During the quarter, we introduced an update to our zumo product family, which is designed specifically for the motorcycle market and represents an important customer base for us. We remain focused on OEM market opportunities and are excited to partner with Suzuki as they launch their 2013 models with the Garmin-branded entertainment system.
Turning next to guidance. Having passed the halfway point for 2012, we are updating our full year guidance. In light of our solid first half performance, we are narrowing our revenue range to $2.75 billion to $2.8 billion, which is at the high end of prior guidance. 
Additionally, we have raised our margin expectations for both gross and operating margins. As a result, we are increasing our pro forma EPS guidance to a range of $2.70 to $2.85, an increase of approximately 10%. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Kevin will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Kevin?"
598655,213704726,336440,"Garmin Ltd., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2012",2012-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our income statement and margin results then move to the balance sheet and cash flow statement and conclude with a few comments regarding our full year 2012 expectations. You saw that",1810,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our income statement and margin results then move to the balance sheet and cash flow statement and conclude with a few comments regarding our full year 2012 expectations. 
You saw that we posted revenue of $718 million for the quarter with pro forma net income of $193 million. Our pro forma EPS was $0.98 per share, which excludes the foreign currency loss. Our revenue represents an increase of 7% year-over-year. 
Gross margin came in at 59%, which was an 1,100 basis point improvement from the prior year. I will discuss this in further detail by segment a little bit later. Operating margin was 28%, up 890 basis points from the prior year. The components of this increase were gross margin being favorable by 1,100 basis points, offset by advertising 20 basis points unfavorable, which was up $4 million on a year-over-year basis, SG&A, 110 basis points unfavorable, up $13 million on a year-over-year basis. Our R&D was 70 points -- 70 basis points unfavorable, up $9 million on a year-over-year basis. Each of these expense categories will be discussed further on a later slide. 
Our pro forma EPS of $0.98 represents a 56% increase year-over-year driven by increasing revenues, good growth and operating margins. Units shipped increased 4% year-over-year at 3.9 million units were delivered during the quarter. And our total company average selling price was $184 per unit, up 3% from Q2 of 2011.
According to U.S. GAAP we must defer revenue on certain products in this table summarizes the net impact of the deferral and amortization of revenue and related costs in the second quarter of 2012 and 2011. In the current quarter, we deferred on a net basis approximately $16 million of revenues resulting in a $0.05 of tax affected deferred earnings per share during the quarter. In the second quarter of 2011, we deferred net revenue of $62 million or $0.23 of tax affected EPS. 
While we are deferring revenue according to U.S. GAAP, we are collecting the cash at time of sale as reflected in the statement of cash flows. We expect to have a negative revenue and EPS impact due to deferrals in the upcoming quarters but do not expect the impact to be as significant as the amounts we deferred in 2011. 
As I said, in total, our revenues increased 7% during the second quarter, and with all segments within all segments, excluding Marine, contributing to the growth. During the second quarter, we generated an 8% revenue increase within the Auto/Mobile segment as volume increased due to our 2011 acquisition of Navigon. We continue to gain market share, and we benefited from a reduction in deferred revenue. 
Our Outdoor segment posted the strongest revenue growth at 24% due primarily to market share gains within the GPS-enabled golf market, strong consumer reception for our recent product refreshes and the acquisition of Tri-Tronics in the back half of 2011.
The Fitness segment continues to grow with 5% revenue increase when compared to Q2 of 2011. The slower growth resulted from an exceptional Q2 2011 when we were heavily promoting the Forerunner 305 and had just began to leverage the Forerunner 610. We will have new Fitness products at the back half of 2012.
Aviation segment revenues increased 4% compared to Q2 of 2011 with growth in OEM, partially offset by a slowdown in the aftermarket. And finally, Marine segment revenues decreased 14% compared to Q2 last year as both the aftermarket and OEM markets slowed down due to a global decline in Marine Electronics markets.
During Q2, both the Americas and EMEA posted revenue growth with a slight decline in APAC. The decline in APAC was a result of a change in shipment location for a major OEM customer. Without the impact of this change, our APAC region would have grown approximately 10%. 
For Q2 of this year, the Americas represent 55% of revenue compared to 53% in Q2 of 2011. EMEA decreased from 38% of total in Q2 to 38% while Asia decreased from 9% to 8% in the same period. 
The Auto/Mobile segment represented 55% of our total revenue during Q2, up slightly from 53% at Q2 2011 due to the contribution from our acquisition of Navigon. Outdoor grew to 14% of revenues in the quarter, an increase from 12% in 2011. And due to the improved profitability of Auto/Mobile in the second quarter, the operating income contribution of the segment increased to 43% from only 19% in the prior year. 
In absolute dollars, our traditional segments of Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness contributed $117 million of operating income in the quarter, a 10% increase over the second quarter of 2011.
Moving next to the margin analysis. Our second quarter Auto/Mobile gross margin and operating margin were 51% and 22%, respectively. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the amortization of previously deferred high-margin revenue, which contributed 590 basis points, a onetime royalty adjustment of $21 million contributing 510 basis points and product mix shifting towards more full-featured large screen devices. 
Operating margin improvement resulted from the strong gross margins with only a slight offset in SG&A expenses due to a legal settlement during the period. Q2 Outdoor gross margin was 67%, up from 65% year-ago quarter. Operating margin was 44%, flat to the year-ago quarter as improved gross margins were offset by a slight increase in operating expenses. 
Q2 Fitness gross margin of 69%, up from 58% in the year-ago quarter when we were heavily discounting the Forerunner 305 product. Operating margin was 42%, again up significantly from the year-ago quarter as improved gross margins were only slightly offset by increased advertising costs in the segment. 
Q2 Marine gross margin was 64% compared to 56% a year ago as product mix shifted towards higher-margin products. Operating margin was 27%, down from 30% a year ago as the gross margin improvement was offset by increased R&D expenses to support our long-term Marine OEM strategy and cooperative advertising with our Marine partners. 
Our second quarter Aviation gross margin was 71%, up from 69% in Q2 2011. Operating margin was 27% for the quarter, down from 30% in the prior year due primarily to increased R&D expense associated with new OEM programs that will begin to contribute to revenue in 2013 and increased SG&A cost due to a bad debt credit that we booked in Q2 of last year.
Our second quarter operating expenses increased by $27 million on a year-over-year basis from $191 million in Q2 2011 to $218 million in Q2 2012, an increase of 200 basis points as a percentage of sales. R&D increased $9 million year-over-year in the second quarter and 70 basis points to 11% of sales as headcount increased with our recent acquisitions, and we continue to invest in OEM opportunities. 
Our and spending increased $4 million over the year-ago quarter and increased 20 basis points as a percentage of sales to 5% in Q2 of 2012. This was largely driven by additional cost associated with acquired entities and cooperative advertising and promotional activities in our Outdoor, Fitness and Marine segment. And SG&A increased by $13 million compared to the year-ago quarter, which was a 110 basis point increase to 14% of sales. The increase is primarily attributable to acquisitions and $9 million legal settlement. 
Moving next to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.6 billion. Our accounts receivable increased sequentially to $486 million due to seasonal strength in the second quarter. 
Accounts receivable accounted for approximately 62 days of sales when calculated on a trailing 4 quarters compared to 66 days of sales in the second quarter last year. Our inventory balance has decreased to $384 million on a sequential basis at the close of the second quarter, and our days of inventory metric was 98 days compared to 106 days in the second quarter of 2011. 
The dividend payable now reflects 3 remaining quarterly payments of $0.45 per share, which was approved by our shareholders on June 1 at the annual meeting.
We continue to generate significant free cash flow across our business as cash from operations was $223 million during the second quarter. CapEx was $12 million during Q2. Therefore, we generated free cash flow of $211 million during the quarter. Cash flow invested during Q2 was $146 million, which was including $12 million in CapEx and $132 million net purchase of marketable securities. 
Financing activities were $86 million use of cash during Q2 due primarily to the dividend payment on June 29. And we earned an average of 1.3% on all cash and marketable securities balances during the second quarter.
With our strong free cash flow generation year-to-date, we are making good progress to our forecast of $650 million, which will fund our annualized dividend of $1.80 per share or approximately $350 million. We also continue to pursue acquisitions in adjacent niche markets and tuck-in technologies, which fit with our core markets as active acquisitions will continue to be evaluated by technology, value, compatibility and strategic fit. 
Our tax rate for Q1 -- Q2 was at 10.4% due to the release of reserves following the expiration of the statute of limitations. We expect the full year 2012 tax rate to be approximately 13%.
Finally, as Cliff mentioned, we are updating our full year 2012 guidance given current trends across our segments. Let's review the total company guidance, so here we just provide additional detail on revenue by segment. 
At a high level, we have increased our growth expectations for Auto/Mobile and Outdoor, our 2 largest segments while Fitness and Marine expectations have been reduced. The upside in Auto/Mobile is the result of better-than-expected market share gains and product mix. Deferred revenue has also proven to be less of a headwind than expected. 
Outdoor revenue guidance is being raised due to the continued strength we are achieving in golf and dog-related products. Offsetting these positives, we've reduced our Fitness forecast due to new product delays and our Marine forecast due to a weak Marine environment, which we view as a macroeconomic problem. 
While on the surface, this revised guidance may appear conservative given our strong first half performance, we do have a number of contributing factors to consider. First, first half revenue growth was positively impacted by our acquisitions of Navigon and Tri-Tronics, which were completed in the third quarter of 2011. Our Outdoor segment had very strong fourth quarter 2011 due to new product introductions and a strong holiday season for our golf devices. Also the European macroeconomic situation and subsequent weakening of the euro brings possible headwinds for us in the back half of the year. 
This concludes our formal remarks this morning. We will now move to a period of questions."

First of all, we're delivering units under the Navigon brand, which has increased our deliveries. And along with that, we have market share gains, both when considering the Navigon brand, as well as organically in the Garmin brand. So we've been able to essentially avoid the trends in the market, which is a clear downsizing of the market that's going on right now. So as we comp against Navigon in the third and fourth quarter, we would expect our unit deliveries to level out and follow the market after that. And the market trend again is down 10% to 15% or so this year we estimate. As far as Apple goes, of course, everyone knows about the announcement that was made, turn-by-turn navigation on the next version of the OS. I would say that we've been through this before on the Android side of things, and Android does offer that on all their devices right now. So we don't see that as being a big change in terms of customers' perceptions. It just means that there's a choice now on the Apple platform that people didn't have before."

Kevin will discuss specific items impacting margin performance later during his remarks. 
Operating margins also improved significantly to 28%, with our traditional markets posting 10% operating income growth in the quarter. Revenue growth combined with improved margins resulted in both operating income and pro forma EPS growth. 
Operating income for the quarter grew 55% to $204 million, while pro forma EPS was $0.98, a 56% improvement over the prior year. We sold 3.9 million units in the quarter, up 4% year-over-year. Next I'll walk you through the financial and strategic highlights segment by segment.
Starting first with Marine. Revenue in the Marine segment declined 14%, driven by weak economic conditions around the world. However, better gross margins largely offset the impact of lower sales. Sales in Europe were down sharply, while sales in other regions were comparatively better but still soft during the normally robust second quarter selling season. 
While industry statistics indicating that boating sales have improved, the trend seems to be towards low-end boats where there's little to no Marine Electronics content. We maintain a high level of confidence in our long-term opportunities in the Marine segment and are continuing to invest in new product development and strategic alliances that position us for market share gains. As we have mentioned previously, these investments will create near-term operating margin compressions.
In Aviation, we posted revenue growth of 4% as improvements in OEM deliveries were partially offset by weakness in the aftermarket. In recent quarters, operating margin has trended below historical norms as new programs require a higher level of R&D investment compared to what we have seen in the past. We remain confident that these investments will lead to stronger revenue and operating margin growth for the future. 
During the quarter, we made additional announcements that demonstrate the progress we are making to expand our presence in the business jet market. Cessna selected are G5000 integrated flight deck where the new Citation Longitude, which is the longest range business jet operating in the Cessna lineup. This expands upon the already successful relationship we have had with Cessna for many years now. 
In addition, we announced a new relationship with Bombardier. We selected the G5000 for the new Learjet 70 and 75, which are scheduled for delivery in 2013.
Due to the steady increasing number of new confident certifications that are in progress, we thought it would be helpful to provide a summary of the major wins that have been announced so far and projected entry into service based on publicly available information from the aircraft manufacturers. 
In 2013, we anticipate entry into service of the Citation M2 with the G3000 integrated cockpit system. The Citation Ten with the G5000 integrated cockpit system and the Learjet 70 and 75 also with the G5000 system. 
In 2015, we anticipate entry into service for the Citation Latitude, which will be equipped with the G5000 system. And finally, in 2017, we anticipate entry into service where the Citation Longitude, which will be equipped with the G5000 system. 
We expect these wins along with other initiatives to deliver revenue growth in Aviation that outpaces that of the overall industry. 
Turning next to Outdoor. The Outdoor segment continue to perform well in the quarter with 24% revenue growth and 23% operating income growth, driven by new products and category expansion. In the golf market, we are experiencing growth across our product offerings with our high-end wristwatch, the Approach S3, and our newest handheld, the Approach G6, both contributing to the strong results. 
In early July, we introduced yet another innovative product in the Outdoor category, which is the fenix. This rugged yet stylish wristwatch integrates best-in-class outdoor watch functionality with GPS navigation. In addition to the GPS functionality, which we are known for, the built-in sensors include an altimeter for elevation, a barometer for providing weather information and a compass for navigation and tracking. The watch can also be paired with additional sensors to provide temperature, heart rate and cadence. We believe this is a highly attractive offering at a value price of $400.
Looking next at the Fitness segment. Revenue grew 5%, while operating income grew 35% on a year-over-year basis. The slower revenue growth but strong margin performance are attributable to a variety -- variability in our product cycle during the past year. 
In 2011, we delivered the Forerunner 610, which positively impacted revenue through channel sale, while discounts on the end-of-life Forerunner 305 drove additional volumes, but that negatively impacted margins. So far in 2012, there have been no major product announcements. However, we have experienced good demand for our high-end products including the Forerunner 910XT, the Forerunner 610 and the Edge 500. We anticipate revenue growth rates will improve later this year as we launch new products in time for the holiday season. 
Late in the quarter, we launched the Garmin Swim, our first fitness product that targets the swimming market. This training watch tracks stroke type, stroke count, distance, pace and lengths. This information can be uploaded to Garmin Connect for post-workout analysis. Garmin Swim was introduced at the U.S. Masters Summer Swimming Championships where it was well received by the swimming community, including both former Olympians and Olympic hopefuls. 
Our Automotive/Mobile segment experienced another strong quarter with revenue growth of 8% along with strong margins. Our strong margin performance was partially due to a onetime benefit of $21 million due to an overpayment of certain royalties. Kevin will provide additional details in a moment. We gained additional market share in the second quarter and now estimate that our market share in North America exceeds 70% with European market share of approximately 35%. 
While we have posted 3 consecutive quarters of revenue growth in the segment, we continue to expect that the overall PND market will decline approximately 10% to 15% in units and value for the year. This decline is consistent with our prior expectations for the market. 
During the quarter, we introduced an update to our zumo product family, which is designed specifically for the motorcycle market and represents an important customer base for us. We remain focused on OEM market opportunities and are excited to partner with Suzuki as they launch their 2013 models with the Garmin-branded entertainment system.
Turning next to guidance. Having passed the halfway point for 2012, we are updating our full year guidance. In light of our solid first half performance, we are narrowing our revenue range to $2.75 billion to $2.8 billion, which is at the high end of prior guidance. 
Additionally, we have raised our margin expectations for both gross and operating margins. As a result, we are increasing our pro forma EPS guidance to a range of $2.70 to $2.85, an increase of approximately 10%. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Kevin will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Kevin?"
598655,213704726,336634,"Garmin Ltd., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2012",2012-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone.

I'd like to begin by reviewing our income statement and margin results, then move to the balance sheet and cash flow statement and conclude with a few comments regarding our full year 2012 expectations. 
You saw that we posted revenue of $718 million for the quarter with pro forma net income of $193 million. Our pro forma EPS was $0.98 per share, which excludes the foreign currency loss. Our revenue represents an increase of 7% year-over-year. 
Gross margin came in at 59%, which was an 1,100-basis point improvement from the prior year. I will discuss this in further detail by segment a little bit later. Operating margin was 28%, up 890 basis points from the prior year. The components of this increase were gross margin being favorable by 1,100 basis points; offset by advertising, 20 basis points unfavorable, which was up $4 million on a year-over-year basis; SG&A, 110 basis points unfavorable, up $13 million on a year-over-year basis; our R&D was 70 points -- 70 basis points unfavorable, up $9 million on a year-over-year basis. Each of these expense categories will be discussed further on a later slide. 
Our pro forma EPS of $0.98 represents a 56% increase year-over-year, driven by increasing revenues, good growth and operating margins. Units shipped increased 4% year-over-year at 3.9 million units were delivered during the quarter. And our total company average selling price was $184 per unit, up 3% from Q2 of 2011.
According to U.S. GAAP, we must defer revenue on certain products, and this table summarizes the net impact of the deferral and amortization of revenue and related costs in the second quarter of 2012 and 2011. In the current quarter, we deferred on a net basis approximately $16 million of revenues, resulting in a $0.05 of tax affected deferred earnings per share during the quarter. In the second quarter of 2011, we deferred net revenue of $62 million or $0.23 of tax affected EPS. 
While we are deferring revenue according to U.S. GAAP, we are collecting the cash at time of sale as reflected in the statement of cash flows. We expect to have a negative revenue and EPS impact due to deferrals in the upcoming quarters, but do not expect the impact to be as significant as the amounts that we deferred in 2011. 
As I said, in total, our revenues increased 7% during the second quarter, and with all segments -- within all segments excluding Marine contributing to the growth. During the second quarter, we generated an 8% revenue increase within the Auto/Mobile segment as volumes increased due to our 2011 acquisition of Navigon. We continue to gain market share and we benefited from a reduction in deferred revenue. 
Our Outdoor segment posted the strongest revenue growth at 24% due primarily to market share gains within the GPS-enabled golf market, strong consumer reception for our recent product refreshes and the acquisition of Tri-Tronics in the back half of 2011.
The Fitness segment continued to grow with 5% revenue increase when compared to Q2 of 2011. The slower growth resulted from an exceptional Q2 2011 when we were heavily promoting the Forerunner 305 and has just begun deliveries of the Forerunner 610. We will have new Fitness products at the back half of 2012.
Aviation segment revenues increased 4% compared to Q2 of 2011 with growth in OEM, partially offset by a slowdown in the aftermarket. 
And finally, Marine segment revenues decreased 14% compared to Q2 last year as both the aftermarket and OEM markets slowed down due to a global decline in the Marine Electronics markets.
During Q2, both the Americas and EMEA posted revenue growth with a slight decline in APAC. The decline in APAC is the result of a change in shipment location for a major OEM customer. Without the impact of this change, our APAC region would have grown approximately 10%. 
For Q2 of this year, the Americas represent 55% of revenue compared to 53% in Q2 of 2011. EMEA decreased from 38% of total in Q2 to 38%, while Asia decreased from 9% to 8% in the same period. 
The Auto/Mobile segment represented 55% of our total revenue during Q2, up slightly from 53% in Q2 2011 due to the contribution from our acquisition of Navigon. Outdoor grew to 14% of revenues in the quarter, an increase from 12% in 2011. And due to the improved profitability of Auto/Mobile in the second quarter, the operating income contribution of the segment increased to 43% from only 19% in the prior year. 
In absolute dollars, our traditional segments of Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness contributed $117 million of operating income in the quarter, a 10% increase over the second quarter of 2011.
Moving next to the margin analysis. Our second quarter Auto/Mobile gross margin and operating margin were 51% and 22%, respectively. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the amortization of previously deferred high-margin revenue, which contributed 590 basis points, a onetime royalty fee adjustment of $21 million contributing 510 basis points and product mix shifting toward more full-featured large screen devices. 
Operating margin improvement resulted from the strong gross margins with only a slight offset in SG&A expenses due to a legal settlement during the period. Q2 Outdoor gross margin was 67%, up from 65% year-ago quarter. Operating margin was 44%, flat to the year-ago quarter as improved gross margins were offset by a slight increase in operating expenses. 
Q2 Fitness gross margin of 69%, up from 58% in the year-ago quarter when we were heavily discounting the Forerunner 305 product. Operating margin was 42%, again up significantly from the year-ago quarter as improved gross margins were only slightly offset by increased advertising costs in the segment. 
Q2 Marine gross margin was 64% compared to 56% a year ago as product mix shifted towards higher-margin products. Operating margin was 27%, down from 30% a year ago as the gross margin improvement was offset by increased R&D expenses to support our long-term Marine OEM strategy and cooperative advertising with our Marine partners. 
Our second quarter Aviation gross margin was 71%, up from 69% in Q2 2011. Operating margin was 27% for the quarter, down from 30% in the prior year due primarily to increased R&D expense associated with new OEM programs that will begin to contribute to revenue in 2013 and increased SG&A cost due to a bad debt credit that we booked in Q2 of last year.
Our second quarter operating expenses increased by $27 million on a year-over-year basis from $191 million in Q2 2011 to $218 million in Q2 2012 and increased 200 basis points as a percentage of sales. R&D increased $9 million year-over-year in the second quarter and 70 basis points to 11% of sales as headcount increased with our recent acquisitions, and we continue to invest in OEM opportunities. 
Our ad spending increased $4 million over the year-ago quarter and increased 20 basis points as a percentage of sales to 5% in Q2 of 2012. This was largely driven by additional costs associated with acquired entities and cooperative advertising and promotional activities in our Outdoor, Fitness and Marine segments. And SG&A increased $13 million compared to the year-ago quarter, which was a 110-basis point increase to 14% of sales. The increase is primarily attributable to acquisitions and a $9 million legal settlement. 
Moving next to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.6 billion. Our accounts receivable increased sequentially to $486 million due to seasonal strength in the second quarter. 
Accounts receivable accounted for approximately 62 days of sales when calculated on a trailing 4 quarters compared to 66 days of sales in the second quarter last year. Our inventory balance has decreased to $384 million on a sequential basis at the close of the second quarter, and our days of inventory metric was 98 days compared to 106 days in the second quarter of 2011. 
The dividend payable now reflects 3 remaining quarterly payments of $0.45 per share, which was approved by our shareholders on June 1 at the Annual Meeting.
We continue to generate significant free cash flow across our business as cash from operations was $223 million during the second quarter. CapEx was $12 million during Q2. Therefore, we generated free cash flow of $211 million during the quarter. Cash flow invested during Q2 was $146 million, which was including $12 million in CapEx and $132 million net purchase of marketable securities. 
Financing activities were $86 million use of cash during Q2 due primarily to the dividend payment on June 29, and we earned an average of 1.3% on all cash and marketable security balances during the second quarter.
With our strong free cash flow generation year-to-date, we are making good progress to our forecast of $650 million, which will fund our annualized dividend of $1.80 per share or approximately $350 million. We also continue to pursue acquisitions in adjacent niche markets and tuck-in technologies, which fit with our core markets. As has been Garmin's practice, acquisitions will continue to be evaluated by technology, value, compatibility and strategic fit. 
Our tax rate for Q1 -- Q2 was at 10.4% due to the release of reserves following the expiration of the statute of limitations. We expect the full year 2012 tax rate to be approximately 13%.
Finally, as Cliff mentioned, we are updating our full year 2012 guidance given current trends across our segments. Let's review the total company guidance, so here we just provide additional detail on revenue by segment. 
At a high level, we have increased our growth expectations for Auto/Mobile and Outdoor, our 2 largest segments, while Fitness and Marine expectations have been reduced. The upside in Auto/Mobile is the result of better-than-expected market share gains and product mix. Deferred revenue has also proven to be less of a headwind than expected. 
Outdoor revenue guidance is being raised due to the continued strength we are achieving in golf and dog-related products. Offsetting these positives, we reduced our Fitness forecast due to new product delays and our Marine forecast due to a weak Marine environment, which we view as a macroeconomic problem. 
While on the surface, this revised guidance may appear conservative given our strong first half performance, we do have a number of contributing factors to consider. First, first half revenue growth was positively impacted by our acquisitions of Navigon and Tri-Tronics, which were completed in the third quarter of 2011. Our Outdoor segment had very strong fourth quarter 2011 due to new product introduction and a strong holiday season for our golf devices. Also, the European macroeconomic situation and subsequent weakening of the euro brings possible headwinds for us in the back half of the year. 
This concludes our formal remarks this morning. We will now move to a period of questions."

First of all, we're delivering units under the Navigon brand, which has increased our deliveries. And along with that, we have market share gains, both when considering the Navigon brand, as well as organically in the Garmin brand. So we've been able to essentially avoid the trends in the market, which is a clear downsizing of the market that's going on right now. So as we comp against Navigon in the third and fourth quarter, we would expect our unit deliveries to level out and follow the market after that. And the market trend, again, is down 10% to 15% or so this year we estimate. As far as Apple goes, of course, everyone knows about the announcement that was made, turn-by-turn navigation on the next version of the OS. I would say that we've been through this before on the Android side of things, and Android does offer that on all their devices right now, so we don't see that as being a big change in terms of customers' perceptions.

As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered strong revenue and margin performance, resulting in pro forma EPS growth of 56% in the second quarter. Consolidated revenues increased 7% year-over-year",1221,"Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered strong revenue and margin performance, resulting in pro forma EPS growth of 56% in the second quarter. 
Consolidated revenues increased 7% year-over-year to $718 million with growth in Outdoor outpacing all of the segments at 24%. Our traditional markets of Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness contributed 45% of the total revenue mix. Gross margins improved to 59% from 48% in the prior year. Kevin will discuss specific items impacting margin performance later during his remarks. 
Operating margins also improved significantly to 28%, with our traditional markets posting 10% operating income growth in the quarter. Revenue growth combined with improved margins resulted in both operating income and pro forma EPS growth. 
Operating income for the quarter grew 55% to $204 million, while pro forma EPS was $0.98, a 56% improvement over the prior year. We sold 3.9 million units in the quarter, up 4% year-over-year. Next I'll walk you through the financial and strategic highlights segment by segment.
Starting first with Marine. Revenue in the Marine segment declined 14%, driven by weak economic conditions around the world. However, better gross margins largely offset the impact of lower sales. Sales in Europe were down sharply, while sales in other regions were comparatively better but still soft during the normally robust second quarter selling season. 
While industry statistics indicating that boating sales have improved, the trend seems to be towards low-end boats where there's little to no Marine Electronics content. We maintain a high level of confidence in our long-term opportunities in the Marine segment and are continuing to invest in new product development and strategic alliances that position us for market share gains. As we have mentioned previously, these investments will create near-term operating margin compressions.
In Aviation, we posted revenue growth of 4% as improvements in OEM deliveries were partially offset by weakness in the aftermarket. In recent quarters, operating margin has trended below historical norms as new programs require a higher level of R&D investment compared to what we have seen in the past. We remain confident that these investments will lead to stronger revenue and operating margin growth for the future. 
During the quarter, we made additional announcements that demonstrate the progress we are making to expand our presence in the business jet market. Cessna selected are G5000 integrated flight deck for the new Citation Longitude, which is the longest range business jet operating, offering in the Cessna lineup. This expands upon the already successful relationship we have had with Cessna for many years now. 
In addition, we announced a new relationship with Bombardier who selected the G5000 for the new Learjet 70 and 75, which are scheduled for delivery in 2013.
Due to the steady increasing number of new cockpit certifications that are in progress, we thought it would be helpful to provide a summary of the major wins that have been announced so far and projected entry into service based on publicly available information from the aircraft manufacturers. 
In 2013, we anticipate entry into service of the Citation M2 with the G3000 integrated cockpit system. The Citation Ten with the G5000 integrated cockpit system and the Learjet 70 and 75 also with the G5000 system. 
In 2015, we anticipate entry into service for the Citation Latitude, which will be equipped with the G5000 system. And finally, in 2017, we anticipate entry into service with the Citation Longitude, which will be equipped with the G5000 system. 
We expect these wins along with other initiatives to deliver revenue growth in Aviation that outpaces that of the overall industry. 
Turning next to Outdoor. The Outdoor segment continued to perform well in the quarter with 24% revenue growth and 23% operating income growth, driven by new products and category expansion. In the golf market, we are experiencing growth across our product offerings with our high-end wristwatch, the Approach S3, and our newest handheld, the Approach G6, both contributing to the strong results. 
In early July, we introduced yet another innovative product in the Outdoor category, which is the fenix. This rugged yet stylish wristwatch integrates best-in-class outdoor watch functionality with GPS navigation. In addition to the GPS functionality, which we are known for, the built-in sensors include an altimeter for elevation, a barometer for providing weather information and a compass for navigation and tracking. The watch can also be paired with additional sensors to provide temperature, heart rate and cadence. We believe this is a highly attractive offering at a value price of $400.
Looking next at the Fitness segment. Revenue grew 5%, while operating income grew 35% on a year-over-year basis. The slower revenue growth but strong margin performance are attributable to a variety -- variability in our product cycle during the past year. 
In 2011, we delivered the Forerunner 610, which positively impacted revenue through channel fill, while discounts on the end-of-life Forerunner 305 drove additional volumes, but that negatively impacted margins. So far in 2012, there have been no major product announcements. However, we have experienced good demand for our high-end products including the Forerunner 910XT, the Forerunner 610 and the Edge 500. We anticipate revenue growth rates will improve later this year as we launch new products in time for the holiday season. 
Late in the quarter, we launched the Garmin Swim, our first fitness product that targets the swimming market. This training watch tracks stroke type, stroke count, distance, pace and lengths. This information can be uploaded to Garmin Connect for post-workout analysis. Garmin Swim was introduced at the U.S. Masters Summer Swimming Championships where it was well received by the swimming community, including both former Olympians and Olympic hopefuls. 
Our Automotive/Mobile segment experienced another strong quarter with revenue growth of 8% along with strong margins. Our strong margin performance was partially due to a onetime benefit of $21 million due to an overpayment of certain royalties. Kevin will provide additional details in a moment. We gained additional market share in the second quarter and now estimate that our market share in North America exceeds 70% with European market share of approximately 35%. 
While we have posted 3 consecutive quarters of revenue growth in the segment, we continue to expect that the overall PND market will decline approximately 10% to 15% in units and value for the year. This decline is consistent with our prior expectations for the market. 
During the quarter, we introduced an update to our zumo product family, which is designed specifically for the motorcycle market and represents an important customer base for us. We remain focused on OEM market opportunities and are excited to partner with Suzuki as they launch their 2013 models with the Garmin-branded entertainment system.
Turning next to guidance. Having passed the halfway point for 2012, we are updating our full year guidance. In light of our solid first half performance, we are narrowing our revenue range to $2.75 billion to $2.8 billion, which is at the high end of prior guidance. 
Additionally, we have raised our margin expectations for both gross and operating margins. As a result, we are increasing our pro forma EPS guidance to a range of $2.70 to $2.85, an increase of approximately 10%. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Kevin will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Kevin?"
598655,213704726,337191,"Garmin Ltd., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2012",2012-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone.

You saw tha",1815,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our income statement and margin results, then move to the balance sheet and cash flow statement and conclude with a few comments regarding our full year 2012 expectations. 
You saw that we posted revenue of $718 million for the quarter with pro forma net income of $193 million. Our pro forma EPS was $0.98 per share, which excludes the foreign currency loss. Our revenue represents an increase of 7% year-over-year. 
Gross margin came in at 59%, which was an 1,100-basis point improvement from the prior year. I will discuss this in further detail by segment a little bit later. Operating margin was 28%, up 890 basis points from the prior year. The components of this increase were gross margin being favorable by 1,100 basis points; offset by advertising, 20 basis points unfavorable, which was up $4 million on a year-over-year basis; SG&A, 110 basis points unfavorable, up $13 million on a year-over-year basis; our R&D was 70 points -- 70 basis points unfavorable, up $9 million on a year-over-year basis. Each of these expense categories will be discussed further on a later slide. 
Our pro forma EPS of $0.98 represents a 56% increase year-over-year, driven by increasing revenues, good gross and operating margins. Units shipped increased 4% year-over-year as 3.9 million units were delivered during the quarter. And our total company average selling price was $184 per unit, up 3% from Q2 of 2011.
According to U.S. GAAP, we must defer revenue on certain products, and this table summarizes the net impact of the deferral and amortization of revenue and related costs in the second quarter of 2012 and 2011. In the current quarter, we deferred on a net basis approximately $16 million of revenues, resulting in a $0.05 of tax affected deferred earnings per share during the quarter. In the second quarter of 2011, we deferred net revenue of $62 million or $0.23 of tax affected EPS. 
While we are deferring revenue according to U.S. GAAP, we are collecting the cash at time of sale as reflected in the statement of cash flows. We expect to have a negative revenue and EPS impact due to deferrals in the upcoming quarters, but do not expect the impact to be as significant as the amounts that we deferred in 2011. 
As I said, in total, our revenues increased 7% during the second quarter, and with all segments -- within all segments excluding Marine contributing to the growth. During the second quarter, we generated an 8% revenue increase within the Auto/Mobile segment as volumes increased due to our 2011 acquisition of Navigon. We continue to gain market share and we benefited from a reduction in deferred revenue. 
Our Outdoor segment posted the strongest revenue growth at 24% due primarily to market share gains within the GPS-enabled golf market, strong consumer reception for our recent product refreshes and the acquisition of Tri-Tronics in the back half of 2011.
The Fitness segment continued to grow with a 5% revenue increase when compared to Q2 of 2011. The slower growth resulted from an exceptional Q2 2011 when we were heavily promoting the Forerunner 305 and has just begun deliveries of the Forerunner 610. We will have new Fitness products at the back half of 2012.
Aviation segment revenues increased 4% compared to Q2 of 2011 with growth in OEM, partially offset by a slowdown in the aftermarket. 
And finally, Marine segment revenues decreased 14% compared to Q2 last year as both the aftermarket and OEM markets slowed down due to a global decline in the Marine Electronics markets.
During Q2, both the Americas and EMEA posted revenue growth with a slight decline in APAC. The decline in APAC is the result of a change in shipment location for a major OEM customer. Without the impact of this change, our APAC region would have grown approximately 10%. 
For Q2 of this year, the Americas represent 55% of revenue compared to 53% in Q2 of 2011. EMEA decreased from 38% of total in Q2 to 38%, while Asia decreased from 9% to 8% in the same period. 
The Auto/Mobile segment represented 55% of our total revenue during Q2, up slightly from 53% in Q2 2011 due to the contribution from our acquisition of Navigon. Outdoor grew to 14% of revenues in the quarter, an increase from 12% in 2011. And due to the improved profitability of Auto/Mobile in the second quarter, the operating income contribution of the segment increased to 43% from only 19% in the prior year. 
In absolute dollars, our traditional segments of Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness contributed $117 million of operating income in the quarter, a 10% increase over the second quarter of 2011.
Moving next to the margin analysis. Our second quarter Auto/Mobile gross margin and operating margin were 51% and 22%, respectively. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the amortization of previously deferred high-margin revenue, which contributed 590 basis points, a onetime royalty fee adjustment of $21 million contributing 510 basis points and product mix shifting toward more full-featured large screen devices. 
Operating margin improvement resulted from the strong gross margins with only a slight offset in SG&A expenses due to a legal settlement during the period. Q2 Outdoor gross margin was 67%, up from 65% year-ago quarter. Operating margin was 44%, flat to the year-ago quarter as improved gross margins were offset by a slight increase in operating expenses. 
Q2 Fitness gross margin of 69%, up from 58% in the year-ago quarter when we were heavily discounting the Forerunner 305 product. Operating margin was 42%, again up significantly from the year-ago quarter as improved gross margins were only slightly offset by increased advertising costs in the segment. 
Q2 Marine gross margin was 64% compared to 56% a year ago as product mix shifted towards higher-margin products. Operating margin was 27%, down from 30% a year ago as the gross margin improvement was offset by increased R&D expenses to support our long-term Marine OEM strategy and cooperative advertising with our Marine partners. 
Our second quarter Aviation gross margin was 71%, up from 69% in Q2 2011. Operating margin was 27% for the quarter, down from 30% in the prior year due primarily to increased R&D expense associated with new OEM programs that will begin to contribute to revenue in 2013 and increased SG&A cost due to a bad debt credit that we booked in Q2 of last year.
Our second quarter operating expenses increased by $27 million on a year-over-year basis from $191 million in Q2 2011 to $218 million in Q2 2012 and increased 200 basis points as a percentage of sales. R&D increased $9 million year-over-year in the second quarter and 70 basis points to 11% of sales as headcount increased with our recent acquisitions, and we continue to invest in OEM opportunities. 
Our ad spending increased $4 million over the year-ago quarter and increased 20 basis points as a percentage of sales to 5% in Q2 of 2012. This was largely driven by additional costs associated with acquired entities and cooperative advertising and promotional activities in our Outdoor, Fitness and Marine segments. And SG&A increased $13 million compared to the year-ago quarter, which was a 110-basis point increase to 14% of sales. The increase is primarily attributable to acquisitions and a $9 million legal settlement. 
Moving next to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.6 billion. Our accounts receivable increased sequentially to $486 million due to seasonal strength in the second quarter. 
Accounts receivable accounted for approximately 62 days of sales when calculated on a trailing 4 quarters compared to 66 days of sales in the second quarter last year. Our inventory balance has decreased to $384 million on a sequential basis at the close of the second quarter, and our days of inventory metric was 98 days compared to 106 days in the second quarter of 2011. 
The dividend payable now reflects 3 remaining quarterly payments of $0.45 per share, which was approved by our shareholders on June 1 at the Annual Meeting.
We continue to generate significant free cash flow across our business as cash from operations was $223 million during the second quarter. CapEx was $12 million during Q2. Therefore, we generated free cash flow of $211 million during the quarter. Cash flow invested during Q2 was $146 million, which was including $12 million in CapEx and $132 million net purchase of marketable securities. 
Financing activities were $86 million use of cash during Q2 due primarily to the dividend payment on June 29, and we earned an average of 1.3% on all cash and marketable security balances during the second quarter.
With our strong free cash flow generation year-to-date, we are making good progress to our forecast of $650 million, which will fund our annualized dividend of $1.80 per share or approximately $350 million. We also continue to pursue acquisitions in adjacent niche markets and tuck-in technologies, which fit with our core markets. As has been Garmin's practice, acquisitions will continue to be evaluated by technology, value, compatibility and strategic fit. 
Our tax rate for Q1 -- Q2 was at 10.4% due to the release of reserves following the expiration of the statute of limitations. We expect the full year 2012 tax rate to be approximately 13%.
Finally, as Cliff mentioned, we are updating our full year 2012 guidance given current trends across our segments. Let's review the total company guidance, so here we just provide additional detail on revenue by segment. 
At a high level, we have increased our growth expectations for Auto/Mobile and Outdoor, our 2 largest segments, while Fitness and Marine expectations have been reduced. The upside in Auto/Mobile is the result of better-than-expected market share gains and product mix. Deferred revenue has also proven to be less of a headwind than expected. 
Outdoor revenue guidance is being raised due to the continued strength we are achieving in golf and dog-related products. Offsetting these positives, we reduced our Fitness forecast due to new product delays and our Marine forecast due to a weak Marine environment, which we view as a macroeconomic problem. 
While on the surface, this revised guidance may appear conservative given our strong first half performance, we do have a number of contributing factors to consider. First, first half revenue growth was positively impacted by our acquisitions of Navigon and Tri-Tronics, which were completed in the third quarter of 2011. Our Outdoor segment had very strong fourth quarter 2011 due to new product introduction and a strong holiday season for our golf devices. Also, the European macroeconomic situation and subsequent weakening of the euro brings possible headwinds for us in the back half of the year. 
This concludes our formal remarks this morning. We will now move to a period of questions."

And along with that, we have market share gains, both when considering the Navigon brand, as well as organically in the Garmin brand. So we've been able to essentially avoid the trends in the market, which is a clear downsizing of the market that's going on right now. So as we comp against Navigon in the third and fourth quarter, we would expect our unit deliveries to level out and follow the market after that. And the market trend, again, is down 10% to 15% or so this year we estimate. As far as Apple goes, of course, everyone knows about the announcement that was made, turn-by-turn navigation on the next version of the OS. I would say that we've been through this before on the Android side of things, and Android does offer that on all their devices right now, so we don't see that as being a big change in terms of customers' perceptions. It just means that there's a choice now on the Apple platform that people didn't have before."

As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered revenue growth and strong margin performance, resulting in pro forma EPS growth in the third quarter. Consolidated revenues increased 1% year-over-year to",1178,"Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered revenue growth and strong margin performance, resulting in pro forma EPS growth in the third quarter. Consolidated revenues increased 1% year-over-year to $672 million, driven by gains in the Outdoor and Aviation segments. Our traditional markets are the Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness, contributed 43% of the total revenue mix and 59% of the total operating income for the quarter.
Gross margins improved to 53% in the quarter. Operating margins also improved to 24% from 22% in the prior year, as operating expenses were essentially flat. Revenue growth, combined with improved margins, resulted in both operating income and pro forma EPS growth.
Operating income for the quarter grew 9% to $160 million, while pro forma EPS was $0.74, a 4% improvement over the prior year.
We sold approximately 3.7 million units in the quarter, which was up 7% year-over-year as Auto OEM and Outdoor volumes increased. In light of our third quarter results, we are increasing our full year pro forma EPS guidance. We now expect our EPS to fall in the range of $2.75 on the low end to $2.90 on the high end. Kevin will provide additional insights later.
First, I'll walk you through the financial and strategic highlights for each segment. In the Marine segment, revenue declined 7%, driven by weak conditions outside of the Americas, particularly in the European market. In contrast, we experienced modest growth in the Americas. Favorable product mix led to higher gross margin and gross profit, which more than offset the impact of lower sales. The high-end growth market continues to struggle due to weak economic around the world. We anticipate these conditions will persist into 2013, dampening the near-term growth prospects in the Marine market. However, we are not allowing the poor conditions to distract us from our growth strategy in the segment. 
In the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of Nexus Marine, giving us an intermediate presence in the sailboat instrumentation market where Nexus is a highly respected brand. Additionally, we continue to invest in new product development in order to gain share and to better position ourselves for growth when economic conditions improve.
In Aviation, we posted revenue growth of 3%, as improved OEM deliveries offset weakness in retrofit and portable products. As we have highlighted in prior quarters, operating margin is trending below historical norms, as we invest in aircraft certification programs that will reach the market in 2013 and beyond. We currently have 6 announced cockpits slated for delivery in the coming year, which will generate new revenue and growth for the future. Note that this morning's press release mentioned 5 programs that will be completed in 2013. But with the recent announcements factored in, the number is now 6.
During the quarter, we announced 2 additional cockpit wins that highlight the progress we're making to expand our presence in the OEM market. Just this week, we announced that our G5000 integrated flight deck has been chosen for the upgraded citation sovereign. And earlier in the quarter, we announced a new relationship with Augusta Westland who selected the G1000H for the updated 119 model helicopter. Both the sovereign and the 119 are scheduled for certification in 2013.
I also want to mention that Garmin was ranked #1 in product support by Aviation International News for the ninth consecutive year. This is an incredible accomplishment and highlights that outstanding product support as one of our strongest differentiators as we compete against incumbents in the segment. I want to congratulate our Aviation product support team. The recognition by Aviation International News is certainly well-deserved.
Outdoor segment continue to deliver strong results in the quarter with 11% revenue growth and 17% operating income growth. Improved results can be attributed to our golf lineup, dog tracking and training portfolio and our recently introduced fenix, which is a GPS-enabled watch for hunters, hikers and outdoor enthusiasts who generally like to blaze their own trails.
In the third quarter, we delivered our Alpha Track and Train System, which combines robust GPS tracking and mapping capabilities from Garmin with a proven electronic training from our Tri-Tronics division. Initial reviews and field tests have been positive, and we anticipate the product will do well throughout this hunting season.
Looking next to the Fitness segment. Revenue declined 6%, though we were able to generate gross margin and operating income growth on a year-over-year basis. As we have mentioned in the past, revenue and margin performance are linked to variability in our product cycle. Both the second and third quarter of 2011 experienced strong demand for the newly released Forerunner 610, while discounts on the end-of-life Forerunner 305 drove additional volumes on the low end of the market dat negatively impacted margins. This year, we saw continued growth in our cycling and multisport product lines. However, it was not enough to offset the year-over-year decline in running products.
During the quarter, we launched our latest running watch, the Forerunner 10. Forerunner 10 is a value-priced watch at $ and 29 and is an affordable and intuitive solution for runners, joggers and walkers of all levels. Early response to the product has been positive with great reviews and strong initial orders. We are confident that the Forerunner 10 will help us close the gap left by the Forerunner 305 at the low end of the market.
Now Auto/Mobile segment, revenue was flat. However, strong margin performance and lower expenses in the segment resulted in a 16% increase in operating profit. Market share also improved in the third quarter when compared to 2011. We estimate our share in North America exceeds 70%, while European market share is in the low- to mid-30% range.
Our outlook in the PND market remains unchanged with units and value declining approximately 10% to 15% for the year. While the broader market has continued decline, share gains have allowed us to significantly outperform the market.
During the quarter, we introduced a new member of our dezl product family with a large 7-inch display designed specifically for trucks and RVs who's specialized needs to drive higher ASPs and stronger margins. We also updated our StreetPilot and Navigon mobile applications with public transit features, providing mobile phone users with a complete solution for both automotive and pedestrian navigation. These additional features serve to further differentiate our applications and drive consumer adoption.
Before turning the call over to Kevin, I would like to provide a brief update on the Auto OEM market. We launched the next-generation navigation solution with Chrysler incorporating advanced features such as 3D mapping, trip planning and multi-read views. These enhancements will be available in select 2013 Chrysler and Dodge models. Also in the third quarter, we shipped our first fully integrated infotainment solution to Suzuki with 2013 FX4 Grand Vitara and models. We're excited to see these models reach Suzuki dealers in markets around the world, including North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Russia.
Now Kevin will walk us through the financial results. Kevin?"

The revenue represents an increase of 1% year-over-year. Gross margin came in at 53%, which was a 180-basis-point improvement from prior year. I will discuss margin result in further detail by segment.
Operating margin was 24%, up 170 basis points from the prior year. The components of this for the gross margin favorability of 180 basis points offset by an unfavorable operating expense impact of 10 basis points. Total operating expenses increased by only $2 million in the current quarter, with a $10 million increase in R&D offset by improvements in advertising and SG&A. Each of these expense categories will be discussed further on a later slide.
Our pro forma EPS of $0.74 represents a 4% increase year-over-year, driven by the increasing revenues and improved gross and operating margins. Units shipped increased to 7% year-over-year as 3.7 million units were delivered during the quarter.
According to U.S. GAAP, we must refer revenue on certain products, and this table summarizes the net impact of the deferral and amortization of revenue and related costs from third quarter 2012 and 2011. In the current quarter, we deferred on a net basis approximately $20 million revenues resulting in $0.07 of tax affect deferred EPS during the quarter.
In the third quarter of 2011, we deferred net revenue of $24 million or $0.08 of tax affected EPS. While we are deferring revenue according to U.S. GAAP, we are collecting the cash at time of sale as reflected in the statement of cash flows. We expect to have a negative revenue and EPS impact due to deferrals in the fourth quarter, but do not expect the impact to be as significant as the amounts that we deferred during the same period in 2011.
In total, our revenues increased 1% during the third quarter with Outdoor and Aviation contributing most of the growth. During Q3, the Auto/Mobile segment revenues were flat as volumes growth was offset by a slight decline in average selling price. Volume growth was driven by market share gains and strengthening results with our Auto OEM partners.
Our Outdoor segment posted the strongest revenue growth at 11%, due primarily to our GPS-enabled golf products, growth in our dog tracking and training portfolio and strong consumer reception for our fenix product.
Fitness segment posted a 6% revenue decreased when compared to Q3 2011. This slowdown resulted from a strong Q3 2011 when we were heavily promoting the Forerunner 305 as de product reached the end of its life cycle. We're also fulfilling orders for the Forerunner 610. We hope to see improving results in Q4, driven primarily -- partially by the launch of the Forerunner 10.
Aviation segment revenues increased 3% compared to Q3 2011 with growth in OEM partially offset by a slowdown in retrofit and portable products. The Marine segment revenues decreased 7% compared to Q3 2011 as both the aftermarket and OEM markets slowed down due to a global decline in the marine electronics market.
During Q3, both the Americas and APAC both posted revenue growth with a partial offset due to the decline in EMEA. Decline in EMEA is the result of difficult macroeconomic conditions in most of the region. For Q3 2012, the Americas represented 57% of revenue compared to 53% in Q3 2011. EMEA decreased from 39% of total revenue in Q3 to 33% in Q3 2012, while APAC increased from 8% to 10% at the same period.
The Auto/Mobile segment represented 57% of our total revenue during Q3 2012, down slightly from 58%. Outdoor grew 16% of revenues in the quarter, an increase from 14% in 2011. Due to the improved profitability of Auto/Mobile in the third quarter of 2012, the operating income contribution of this segment increased to 41% from 38% of the prior year. In absolute dollars, our traditional segments of Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness contributed $95 million of operating income in the quarter, a 4% increase over third quarter of 2011, even as we invest heavily in future OEM opportunities in Marine and Aviation.
Looking next at margins. Q3 Auto/Mobile gross margin and operating margin were 43% and 17%, respectively. Gross margins were stable as deferred revenues became less of a year-over-year impact in the quarter. Operating margin improvement resulted from decreasing advertising and SG&A expenses in the segment.
Q3 Outdoor gross margin was 69%, up from 66% in Q3 2011. Operating margin was 46%, an improvement from 44% in the year-ago quarter where improved gross margin was partially offset by a slight increase in operating expenses.
Q3 Fitness gross margin was 65%, up from 60% of the year-ago quarter when we were heavily discounting the Forerunner 305. Operating margin was 33%, again, up from 30% in the year-ago quarter where improved gross margins was partially offset by increased advertising and R&D costs.
Q3 Marine gross margin was 64% compared to 55% a year-ago quarter, as product mix shifted toward higher-margin products and we participated in fewer commercial activities.
Our operating margin was 19%, down 21% a year ago, as the gross margin improvement continue to be offset by increased R&D expenses to support our long-term Marine OEM strategy and new-product launches scheduled for next year.
Finally, our Q3 Aviation gross margin was 69%, up from 66% in Q3 2011. The operating margin was 23% for the quarter, down from 27% in the prior year as gross margin improvement was offset by increased R&D expense associated with the new OEM programs that will begin to contribute to revenue in 2013, as well as increased SG&A cost due to a bad debt credit booked in Q3 2011.
Q3 operating expenses increased by $2 million on a year-over-year basis from $197 million in Q3 2011 to $199 million in Q3 2012, an increase of only 10 basis points as a percentage of sales. R&D increased $10 million year-over-year in Q3 and 130 basis points to 12% of sales as headcount increased and we continue to invest in OEM opportunities.
Our advertising spending decreased $5 million with a year-ago quarter and decreased 80 basis points as a percent of sales to 4% in Q3 of 2012. This is largely driven by decreasing cooperative advertising.
SG&A decreased $2 million compared to the year-ago quarter and 40 basis points to 13% of sales. This decrease is primarily attributable to reduced commission expenses. We have now anniversary our major acquisitions in 2011 and are pleased to see this flattening of SG&A expense.
Moving next to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.7 billion. Our accounts receivable increased sequentially to $509 million, which fell slightly on a year-over-year basis due to continued sales strength in the third quarter. Accounts receivable accounted for approximately 65 days of sale when calculated on trailing 4 quarters compared to 74 days of sales in the third quarter of 2011. Our inventory balances increased to $443 million on a sequential basis at the close of Q3 as we prepare for the seasonally strong fourth quarter. Our days of inventory metric was 125 days, which was flat to the third quarter 2011.
The dividend payable now reflects 2 remaining quarterly payments of $0.45 per share, which was approved by our shareholders on June 1 at the annual meeting. Our deferred revenue balance has continued to grow, net of deferred cost, it prevents approximately $1.43 of deferred EPS.
We continue to generate free cash flow across our business as cash from operations was $165 million during Q3. CapEx was $9 million during the quarter, therefore, we generated free cash flow during Q3 of $155 million. Cash flow invested during Q3 was $104 million, which includes the $9 million of CapEx and $93 million of net purchases of marketable securities.
Financing activities were $87 million use of cash during Q3 due primarily to the dividend payment for September. And we are in an average of 1.2% on all cash and marketable securities balances during the quarter.
With our strong free cash flow generation year-to-date, we are making good progress towards our forecast of $650 million to continue fund our annualized dividend of $1.80 per share or approximately $350 million use of cash. We also continue to pursue acquisitions and adjacent niche markets and tuck-in technologies which fit with our core markets. As has been Garmin's practices, acquisitions will be evaluated the technology, value to compatibility and strategic fit within Garmin.
Our tax rate for Q3 2012 was 13.7% due to the revenue mix by geography and segment. We expect the full year 2012 rate to be approximately 13%.
And finally, given our strong EPS performance in Q3, we again are raising our full year EPS guidance to $2.75 to $2.90. This continues to incorporate some uncertainties regarding the European markets and consumer spending as we head into the holiday season.
This ends our formal comments for the quarter. We will now enter a period for you to ask questions."

598655,222542929,374214,"Garmin Ltd., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2012",2012-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered revenue growth and strong margin performance, resulting in pro forma EPS growth in the third quarter. Consolidated revenues increased 1% year-over-year",1180,"Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered revenue growth and strong margin performance, resulting in pro forma EPS growth in the third quarter. 
Consolidated revenues increased 1% year-over-year to $672 million, driven by gains in the Outdoor and Aviation segments. Our traditional markets of Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness contributed 43% of the total revenue mix and 59% of the total operating income for the quarter.
Gross margins improved to 53% in the quarter. Operating margins also improved to 24% from 22% in the prior year, as operating expenses were essentially flat. Revenue growth, combined with improved margins, resulted in both operating income and pro forma EPS growth.
Operating income for the quarter grew 9% to $160 million, while pro forma EPS was $0.74, a 4% improvement over the prior year.
We sold approximately 3.7 million units in the quarter, which is up 7% year-over-year, as Auto OEM and Outdoor volumes increased. In light of our third quarter results, we are increasing our full year pro forma EPS guidance. We now expect our EPS to fall in the range of $2.75 on the low end to $2.90 on the high end. Kevin will provide additional insights later.
Next, I'll walk you through the financial and strategic highlights for each segment. In the Marine segment, revenue declined 7%, driven by weak conditions outside of the Americas, particularly in the European market. In contrast, we experienced modest growth in the Americas. Favorable product mix led to higher gross margin and gross profit, which more than offset the impact of lower sales. The high-end boat market continues to struggle due to weak economic conditions around the world. We anticipate these conditions will persist into 2013, dampening the near-term growth prospects in the Marine market. However, we are not allowing the poor conditions to distract us from our growth strategy in the segment. 
In the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of Nexus Marine, giving us an immediate presence in the sailboat instrumentation market where Nexus is a highly respected brand. Additionally, we continue to invest in new product development in order to gain share and to better position ourselves for growth when economic conditions improve.
In Aviation, we posted revenue growth of 3%, as improved OEM deliveries offset weakness in retrofit and portable products. As we have highlighted in prior quarters, operating margin is trending below historical norms, as we invest in aircraft certification programs that will reach the market in 2013 and beyond. We currently have 6 announced cockpits slated for delivery in the coming year, which will generate new revenue and growth for the future. Note that this morning's press release mentioned 5 programs that will be completed in 2013, but with the recent announcements factored in, the number is now 6.
During the quarter, we announced 2 additional cockpit wins that highlight the progress we are making to expand our presence in the OEM market. Just this week, Cessna announced that our G5000 integrated flight deck has been chosen for the upgraded citation sovereign. And earlier in the quarter, we announced a new relationship with AgustaWestland, who selected the G1000H for the updated 119 model helicopter. Both the sovereign and the 119 are scheduled for certification in 2013.
I also want to mention that Garmin was ranked #1 in product support by Aviation International News for the ninth consecutive year. This is an incredible accomplishment and highlights that outstanding product support is one of our strongest differentiators as we compete against incumbents in the segment. I want to congratulate our Aviation product support team. The recognition by Aviation International News is certainly well-deserved.
Outdoor segment continued to deliver strong results in the quarter, with 11% revenue growth and 17% operating income growth. Improved results can be attributed to our golf lineup, our dog tracking and training portfolio and our recently introduced fenix, which is a GPS-enabled watch for hunters, hikers and outdoor enthusiasts who generally like to blaze their own trails.
In the third quarter, we delivered our Alpha Track and Train System, which combines robust GPS tracking and mapping capability from Garmin, with a proven electronic training from our Tri-Tronics division. Initial reviews and field tests have been positive, and we anticipate the product will do well throughout this hunting season.
Looking next to the Fitness segment. Revenue declined 6%, though we were able to generate gross margin and operating income growth on a year-over-year basis. As we have mentioned in the past, revenue and margin performance are linked to variability in our product cycle. In both the second and third quarter of 2011, we experienced strong demand for the newly released Forerunner 610, while discounts on the end-of-life Forerunner 305 drove additional volumes at the low end of the market that negatively impacted margins. This year, we saw continued growth in our cycling and multisport product lines. However, it was not enough to offset the year-over-year decline in running products.
During the quarter, we launched our latest running watch, the Forerunner 10. Forerunner 10 is a value-priced watch at $129 and is an affordable and intuitive solution for runners, joggers and walkers of all levels. Early response to the product has been positive with great reviews and strong initial orders. We are confident that the Forerunner 10 will help us close the gap left by the Forerunner 305 at the low end of the market.
In our Auto/Mobile segment, revenue was flat. However, strong margin performance and lower expenses in the segment resulted in a 16% increase in operating profit. Market share also improved in the third quarter when compared to 2011. We estimate our share in North America exceeds 70%, while European market share is in the low-to-mid 30% range.
Our outlook in the PND market remains unchanged, with units and value declining approximately 10% to 15% for the year. While the broader market has continued to decline, share gains have allowed us to significantly outperform the market.
During the quarter, we introduced a new member of our dezl product family with a large 7-inch display designed specifically for trucks and RVs, where specialized needs drive higher ASPs and stronger margins. We also updated our StreetPilot and Navigon mobile applications with public transit features, providing mobile phone users with a complete solution for both automotive and pedestrian navigation. These additional features serve to further differentiate our applications and drive consumer adoption.
Before turning the call over to Kevin, I want to provide a brief update on the Auto OEM market. We launched the next-generation navigation solution with Chrysler, incorporating advanced features such as 3D mapping, trip planning and multi-route views. These enhancements will be available in select 2013 Chrysler and Dodge models. Also in the third quarter, we shipped our first fully integrated infotainment solution to Suzuki with their 2013 SX4 Grand Vitara and Kizashi models. We're excited to see these models reach Suzuki dealers in markets around the world, including North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Russia.
Now Kevin will walk us through the financial results. Kevin?"
598655,222542929,374214,"Garmin Ltd., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2012",2012-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Well, thank you, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our income statement. I'll move to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, finally concluding with comments regarding our full year 2012 expectations.As Cliff mentioned, w",1563,"Well, thank you, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our income statement. I'll move to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, finally concluding with comments regarding our full year 2012 expectations.
As Cliff mentioned, we posted revenue of $672 million for the quarter, with pro forma net income of $146 million. Our pro forma EPS was $0.74 per share, which excludes the foreign currency loss. Our revenue represents an increase of 1% year-over-year. 
Gross margin came in at 53%, which was an 180-basis-point improvement from prior year. I will discuss margin results in further detail by segment.
Operating margin was 24%, up 170 basis points from the prior year. The components of this were the gross margin favorability of 180 basis points, offset by an unfavorable operating expense impact of 10 basis points. 
Total operating expenses increased by only $2 million in the current quarter, with a $10 million increase in R&D, offset by improvements in advertising and SG&A. Each of these expense categories will be discussed further on a later slide.
Our pro forma EPS of $0.74 represents a 4% increase year-over-year, driven by the increasing revenues and improved gross and operating margins. 
Units shipped increased 7% year-over-year, as 3.7 million units were delivered during the quarter.
According to U.S. GAAP, we must defer revenue on certain products, and this table summarizes the net impact of the deferral and amortization of revenue and related costs from third quarter 2012 and 2011. In the current quarter, we deferred on a net basis approximately $20 million of revenues, resulting in $0.07 of tax affected deferred EPS during the quarter.
In the third quarter of 2011, we deferred net revenue of $24 million or $0.08 of tax affected EPS. While we are deferring revenue according to U.S. GAAP, we are collecting the cash at time of sale as reflected in the statement of cash flows. We expect to have a negative revenue and EPS impact due to deferrals in the fourth quarter but do not expect the impact to be as significant as the amounts that we deferred during the same period in 2011.
In total, our revenues increased 1% during the third quarter, with Outdoor and Aviation contributing most of the growth. During Q3, the Auto/Mobile segment revenues were flat, as volumes growth was offset by a slight decline in average selling price. Volume growth was driven by market share gains and strengthening results with our Auto OEM partners.
Our Outdoor segment posted the strongest revenue growth at 11%, due primarily to our GPS-enabled golf products, growth in our dog tracking and training portfolio and strong consumer reception for our fenix product.
Fitness segment posted a 6% revenue decrease when compared to Q3 2011. This slowdown resulted from a strong Q3 2011 when we were heavily promoting the Forerunner 305 as the product reached the end of its life cycle. We're also fulfilling orders for the Forerunner 610. We hope to see improving results in Q4, driven primarily -- partially by the launch of the Forerunner 10.
Aviation segment revenues increased 3% compared to Q3 2011, with growth in OEM, partially offset by a slowdown in retrofit and portable products. 
Marine segment revenues decreased 7% compared to Q3 2011, as both the aftermarket and OEM markets slowed down due to a global decline in the marine electronics market.
During Q3, both the Americas and APAC both posted revenue growth, with a partial offset due to the decline in EMEA. Decline in EMEA is the result of difficult macroeconomic conditions in most of the region. For Q3 2012, the Americas represented 57% of revenue compared to 53% in Q3 2011. EMEA decreased from 39% of total revenue in Q3 to 33% in Q3 2012, while APAC increased from 8% to 10% at the same period.
Auto/Mobile segment represented 57% of our total revenue during Q3 2012, down slightly from 58%. Outdoor grew to 16% of revenues in the quarter, an increase from 14% in 2011. Due to the improved profitability of Auto/Mobile in the third quarter of 2012, the operating income contribution of this segment increased to 41% from 38% of the prior year. In absolute dollars, our traditional segments of Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness contributed $95 million of operating income in the quarter, a 4% increase over third quarter of 2011, even as we invest heavily in future OEM opportunities in Marine and Aviation.
Looking next at margins. Q3 Auto/Mobile gross margin and operating margin were 43% and 17%, respectively. Gross margins were stable, as deferred revenues became less of a year-over-year impact in the quarter. Operating margin improvement resulted from decreasing advertising and SG&A expenses in the segment.
Q3 Outdoor gross margin was 69%, up from 66% in Q3 2011. Operating margin was 46%, an improvement from 44% in the year-ago quarter, as improved gross margins were partially offset by a slight increase in operating expenses.
Q3 Fitness gross margin was 65%, up from 60% in the year-ago quarter when we were heavily discounting the Forerunner 305. Operating margin was 33%, again, up from 30% in the year-ago quarter, as improved gross margins were partially offset by increased advertising and R&D costs.
Q3 Marine gross margin was 64% compared to 55% in the year-ago quarter, as product mix shifted toward higher-margin products and we participated in fewer promotional activities. Our operating margin was 19%, down 21% a year ago, as the gross margin improvement continued to be offset by increased R&D expenses to support our long-term Marine OEM strategy and new product launches scheduled for next year.
And finally, our Q3 Aviation gross margin was 69%, up from 66% in Q3 2011. The operating margin was 23% for the quarter, down from 27% in the prior year, as gross margin improvement was offset by increased R&D expense associated with the new OEM programs that will begin to contribute to revenue in 2013, as well as increased SG&A costs due to a bad debt credit booked in Q3 2011.
Q3 operating expenses increased by $2 million on a year-over-year basis from $197 million in Q3 2011 to $199 million in Q3 2012, an increase of only 10 basis points as a percentage of sales. R&D increased $10 million year-over-year in Q3 and 130 basis points to 12% of sales, as headcount increased and we continue to invest in OEM opportunities.
Our advertising spending decreased $5 million over the year-ago quarter and decreased 80 basis points as a percent of sales to 4% in Q3 of 2012. This was largely driven by decreasing cooperative advertising.
SG&A decreased $2 million compared to the year-ago quarter and 40 basis points to 13% of sales. This decrease was primarily attributable to reduced commission expenses. We have now anniversaried our major acquisitions in 2011 and are pleased to see this flattening of SG&A expense.
Moving next to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.7 billion. Our accounts receivable increased sequentially to $509 million but fell slightly on a year-over-year basis due to continued sales strength in the third quarter. Accounts receivable accounted for approximately 65 days of sales when calculated on a trailing 4 quarters compared to 74 days of sales in the third quarter of 2011. 
Our inventory balances increased to $443 million on a sequential basis at the close of Q3, as we prepare for the seasonally strong fourth quarter. Our days of inventory metric was 125 days, which was flat to the third quarter of 2011.
The dividend payable now reflects 2 remaining quarterly payments of $0.45 per share, which was approved by our shareholders on June 1 at the annual meeting. 
Our deferred revenue balance has continued to grow. Net of deferred cost, it represents approximately $1.43 of deferred EPS.
We continue to generate free cash flow across our business, as cash from operations was $165 million during Q3. CapEx was $9 million during the quarter, therefore, we generated free cash flow during Q3 of $155 million. Cash flow invested during Q3 was $104 million, which includes the $9 million of CapEx and $93 million of net purchases of marketable securities.
Financing activities were $87 million use of cash during Q3, due primarily to the dividend payment for September, and we are in an average of 1.2% on all cash and marketable securities balances during the quarter.
With our strong free cash flow generation year-to-date, we are making good progress toward our forecast of $650 million, which will continue to fund our annualized dividend of $1.80 per share or approximately $350 million use of cash. We also continue to pursue acquisitions in adjacent niche markets and tuck-in technologies, which fit with our core markets. As has been Garmin's practices, acquisitions will be evaluated by technology, values compatibility and strategic fit within Garmin.
Our tax rate for Q3 2012 was 13.7% due to the revenue mix by geography and segment. We expect the full year 2012 rate to be approximately 13%.
And finally, given our strong EPS performance in Q3, we again are raising our full year EPS guidance to $2.75 to $2.90. This continues to incorporate some uncertainties regarding the European markets and consumer spending as we head into the holiday season.
This ends our formal comments for the quarter. We will now enter a period for you to ask questions."

As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered revenue growth and strong margin performance, resulting in pro forma EPS growth in the third quarter. 
Consolidated revenues increased 1% year-over-year to $672 million, driven by gains in the Outdoor and Aviation segments. Our traditional markets of Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness contributed 43% of the total revenue mix and 59% of the total operating income for the quarter.
Gross margins improved to 53% in the quarter. Operating margins also improved to 24% from 22% in the prior year, as operating expenses were essentially flat. Revenue growth, combined with improved margins, resulted in both operating income and pro forma EPS growth.
Operating income for the quarter grew 9% to $160 million, while pro forma EPS was $0.74, a 4% improvement over the prior year.
We sold approximately 3.7 million units in the quarter, which is up 7% year-over-year, as Auto OEM and Outdoor volumes increased. In light of our third quarter results, we are increasing our full year pro forma EPS guidance. We now expect our EPS to fall in the range of $2.75 on the low end to $2.90 on the high end. Kevin will provide additional insights later.
Next, I'll walk you through the financial and strategic highlights for each segment. In the Marine segment, revenue declined 7%, driven by weak conditions outside of the Americas, particularly in the European market. In contrast, we experienced modest growth in the Americas. Favorable product mix led to higher gross margin and gross profit, which more than offset the impact of lower sales. The high-end boat market continues to struggle due to weak economic conditions around the world. We anticipate these conditions will persist into 2013, dampening the near-term growth prospects in the Marine market. However, we are not allowing the poor conditions to distract us from our growth strategy in the segment. 
In the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of Nexus Marine, giving us an immediate presence in the sailboat instrumentation market where Nexus is a highly respected brand. Additionally, we continue to invest in new product development in order to gain share and to better position ourselves for growth when economic conditions improve.
In Aviation, we posted revenue growth of 3%, as improved OEM deliveries offset weakness in retrofit and portable products. As we have highlighted in prior quarters, operating margin is trending below historical norms, as we invest in aircraft certification programs that will reach the market in 2013 and beyond. We currently have 6 announced cockpits slated for delivery in the coming year, which will generate new revenue and growth for the future. Note that this morning's press release mentioned 5 programs that will be completed in 2013, but with the recent announcements factored in, the number is now 6.
During the quarter, we announced 2 additional cockpit wins that highlight the progress we are making to expand our presence in the OEM market. Just this week, Cessna announced that our G5000 integrated flight deck has been chosen for the upgraded Citation Sovereign. And earlier in the quarter, we announced a new relationship with AgustaWestland, who selected the G1000H for the updated 119 model helicopter. Both the Sovereign and the 119 are scheduled for certification in 2013.
I also want to mention that Garmin was ranked #1 in product support by Aviation International News for the ninth consecutive year. This is an incredible accomplishment and highlights that outstanding product support is one of our strongest differentiators as we compete against incumbents in the segment. I want to congratulate our Aviation product support team. The recognition by Aviation International News is certainly well-deserved.
The Outdoor segment continued to deliver strong results in the quarter, with 11% revenue growth and 17% operating income growth. Improved results can be attributed to our golf lineup, our dog tracking and training portfolio and our recently introduced fenix, which is a GPS-enabled watch for hunters, hikers and outdoor enthusiasts who generally like to blaze their own trails.
In the third quarter, we delivered our Alpha Track and Train System, which combines robust GPS tracking and mapping capability from Garmin, with proven electronic training from our Tri-Tronics division. Initial reviews and field tests have been positive, and we anticipate the product will do well throughout this hunting season.
Looking next to the Fitness segment. Revenue declined 6%, though we were able to generate gross margin and operating income growth on a year-over-year basis. As we have mentioned in the past, revenue and margin performance are linked to variability in our product cycle. In both the second and third quarter of 2011, we experienced strong demand for the newly released Forerunner 610, while discounts on the end-of-life Forerunner 305 drove additional volumes at the low end of the market that negatively impacted margins. This year, we saw continued growth in our cycling and multisport product lines. However, it was not enough to offset the year-over-year decline in running products.
During the quarter, we launched our latest running watch, the Forerunner 10. Forerunner 10 is a value-priced watch at $129 and is an affordable and intuitive solution for runners, joggers and walkers of all levels. Early response to the product has been positive, with great reviews and strong initial orders. We are confident that the Forerunner 10 will help us close the gap left by the Forerunner 305 at the low end of the market.
In our Auto/Mobile segment, revenue was flat. However, strong margin performance and lower expenses in the segment resulted in a 16% increase in operating profit. Market share also improved in the third quarter when compared to 2011. We estimate our share in North America exceeds 70%, while European market share is in the low-to-mid 30% range.
Our outlook in the PND market remains unchanged, with units and value declining approximately 10% to 15% for the year. While the broader market has continued to decline, share gains have allowed us to significantly outperform the market.
During the quarter, we introduced a new member of our dezl product family with a large 7-inch display designed specifically for trucks and RVs, where specialized needs drive higher ASPs and stronger margins. We also updated our StreetPilot and Navigon mobile applications with public transit features, providing mobile phone users with a complete solution for both automotive and pedestrian navigation. These additional features serve to further differentiate our applications and drive consumer adoption.
Before turning the call over to Kevin, I want to provide a brief update on the Auto OEM market. We launched the next-generation navigation solution with Chrysler, incorporating advanced features such as 3D mapping, trip planning and multi-route views. These enhancements will be available in select 2013 Chrysler and Dodge models. Also in the third quarter, we shipped our first fully integrated infotainment solution to Suzuki with their 2013 SX4 Grand Vitara and Kizashi models. We're excited to see these models reach Suzuki dealers in markets around the world, including North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Russia.
Now Kevin will walk us through the financial results. Kevin?"
598655,222542929,374611,"Garmin Ltd., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2012",2012-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Well, thank you, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our income statement, then move to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, finally concluding with comments regarding our full year 2012 expectations.As Cliff mentioned, w",1563,"Well, thank you, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our income statement, then move to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, finally concluding with comments regarding our full year 2012 expectations.
As Cliff mentioned, we posted revenue of $672 million for the quarter, with pro forma net income of $146 million. Our pro forma EPS was $0.74 per share, which excludes the foreign currency loss. Our revenue represents an increase of 1% year-over-year. 
Gross margin came in at 53%, which was an 180-basis-point improvement from prior year. I will discuss margin results in further detail by segment.
Operating margin was 24%, up 170 basis points from the prior year. The components of this were the gross margin favorability of 180 basis points, offset by an unfavorable operating expense impact of 10 basis points. 
Total operating expenses increased by only $2 million in the current quarter, with a $10 million increase in R&D, offset by improvements in advertising and SG&A. Each of these expense categories will be discussed further on a later slide.
Our pro forma EPS of $0.74 represents a 4% increase year-over-year, driven by the increasing revenues and improved gross and operating margins. 
Units shipped increased 7% year-over-year, as 3.7 million units were delivered during the quarter.
According to U.S. GAAP, we must defer revenue on certain products, and this table summarizes the net impact of the deferral and amortization of revenue and related costs in third quarter 2012 and 2011. In the current quarter, we deferred on a net basis approximately $20 million of revenues, resulting in $0.07 of tax affected deferred EPS during the quarter.
In the third quarter of 2011, we deferred net revenue of $24 million or $0.08 of tax affected EPS. While we are deferring revenue according to U.S. GAAP, we are collecting the cash at time of sale as reflected in the statement of cash flows. We expect to have a negative revenue and EPS impact due to deferrals in the fourth quarter, but do not expect the impact to be as significant as the amounts that we deferred during the same period in 2011.
In total, our revenues increased 1% during the third quarter, with Outdoor and Aviation contributing most of the growth. During Q3, the Auto/Mobile segment revenues were flat, as volume growth was offset by a slight decline in average selling price. Volume growth was driven by market share gains and strengthening results with our Auto OEM partners.
Our Outdoor segment posted the strongest revenue growth at 11%, due primarily to our GPS-enabled golf products, growth in our dog tracking and training portfolio and strong consumer reception for our fenix product.
Fitness segment posted a 6% revenue decrease when compared to Q3 2011. This slowdown resulted from a strong Q3 2011 when we were heavily promoting the Forerunner 305 as the product reached the end of its life cycle. We're also fulfilling orders for the Forerunner 610. We hope to see improving results in Q4, driven primarily -- partially by the launch of the Forerunner 10.
Aviation segment revenues increased 3% compared to Q3 2011, with growth in OEM partially offset by a slowdown in retrofit and portable products. 
Marine segment revenues decreased 7% compared to Q3 2011, as both the aftermarket and OEM markets slowed down due to a global decline in the marine electronics market.
During Q3, both the Americas and APAC both posted revenue growth, with a partial offset due to the decline in EMEA. Decline in EMEA is the result of difficult macroeconomic conditions in most of the region. For Q3 2012, the Americas represented 57% of revenue compared to 53% in Q3 2011. EMEA decreased from 39% of total revenue in Q3 to 33% in Q3 2012, while APAC increased from 8% to 10% in the same period.
Auto/Mobile segment represented 57% of our total revenue during Q3 2012, down slightly from 58%. Outdoor grew to 16% of revenues in the quarter, an increase from 14% in 2011. Due to the improved profitability of Auto/Mobile in the third quarter of 2012, the operating income contribution of this segment increased to 41% from 38% of the prior year. In absolute dollars, our traditional segments of Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness contributed $95 million of operating income in the quarter, a 4% increase over third quarter of 2011, even as we invest heavily in future OEM opportunities in Marine and Aviation.
Looking next at margins. Q3 Auto/Mobile gross margin and operating margin were 43% and 17%, respectively. Gross margins were stable, as deferred revenues became less of a year-over-year impact in the quarter. Operating margin improvement resulted from decreasing advertising and SG&A expenses in the segment.
Q3 Outdoor gross margin was 69%, up from 66% in Q3 2011. Operating margin was 46%, an improvement from 44% in the year-ago quarter, as improved gross margins were partially offset by a slight increase in operating expenses.
Q3 Fitness gross margin was 65%, up from 60% in the year-ago quarter when we were heavily discounting the Forerunner 305. Operating margin was 33%, again, up from 30% in the year-ago quarter, as improved gross margins were partially offset by increased advertising and R&D costs.
Q3 Marine gross margin was 64%, compared to 55% in the year-ago quarter, as product mix shifted toward higher-margin products and we participated in fewer promotional activities. Our operating margin was 19%, down 21% a year ago, as the gross margin improvement continued to be offset by increased R&D expenses to support our long-term Marine OEM strategy and new product launches scheduled for next year.
And finally, our Q3 Aviation gross margin was 69%, up from 66% in Q3 2011. The operating margin was 23% for the quarter, down from 27% in the prior year, as gross margin improvement was offset by increased R&D expense associated with the new OEM programs that will begin to contribute to revenue in 2013, as well as increased SG&A costs due to a bad debt credit booked in Q3 2011.
Q3 operating expenses increased by $2 million on a year-over-year basis from $197 million in Q3 2011 to $199 million in Q3 2012, an increase of only 10 basis points as a percentage of sales. R&D increased $10 million year-over-year in Q3 and 130 basis points to 12% of sales, as headcount increased and we continue to invest in OEM opportunities.
Our advertising spending decreased $5 million over the year-ago quarter and decreased 80 basis points as a percent of sales to 4% in Q3 of 2012. This was largely driven by decreasing cooperative advertising.
SG&A decreased $2 million compared to the year-ago quarter and 40 basis points to 13% of sales. This decrease is primarily attributable to reduced commission expenses. We have now anniversaried our major acquisitions in 2011 and are pleased to see this flattening of SG&A expense.
Moving next to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.7 billion. Our accounts receivable increased sequentially to $509 million, but fell slightly on a year-over-year basis due to continued sales strength in the third quarter. Accounts receivable accounted for approximately 65 days of sales when calculated on a trailing 4 quarters compared to 74 days of sales in the third quarter of 2011. 
Our inventory balances increased to $443 million on a sequential basis at the close of Q3 as we prepare for the seasonally strong fourth quarter. Our days of inventory metric was 125 days, which was flat to the third quarter of 2011.
The dividend payable now reflects 2 remaining quarterly payments of $0.45 per share, which was approved by our shareholders on June 1 at the annual meeting. 
Our deferred revenue balance has continued to grow. Net of deferred cost, it represents approximately $1.43 of deferred EPS.
We continue to generate free cash flow across our business, as cash from operations was $165 million during Q3. CapEx was $9 million during the quarter, therefore, we generated free cash flow during Q3 of $155 million. Cash flow invested during Q3 was $104 million, which includes the $9 million of CapEx and $93 million of net purchases of marketable securities.
Financing activities were $87 million use of cash during Q3, due primarily to the dividend payment for September, and we earned an average of 1.2% on all cash and marketable securities balances during the quarter.
With our strong free cash flow generation year-to-date, we are making good progress toward our forecast of $650 million, which will continue to fund our annualized dividend of $1.80 per share or approximately $350 million use of cash. We also continue to pursue acquisitions in adjacent niche markets and tuck-in technologies, which fit with our core markets. As has been Garmin's practices, acquisitions will be evaluated by technology, value of compatibility and strategic fit within Garmin.
Our tax rate for Q3 2012 was 13.7% due to the revenue mix by geography and segment. We expect the full year 2012 rate to be approximately 13%.
And finally, given our strong EPS performance in Q3, we again are raising our full year EPS guidance to $2.75 to $2.90. This continues to incorporate some uncertainties regarding the European markets and consumer spending as we head into the holiday season.
This ends our formal comments for the quarter. We will now enter a period for you to ask questions."
