25933,145610626,265854,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2012",2012-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Pat, and good morning. 2011 marked the substantial completion of the multiyear, multistep process to enhance shareholder value.

As most of you may recall, in August of 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized management to explore several options to enhance the value of Cablevision for its shareholders. The spin-off of AMC last year marked another significant milestone in this process, which also included the spin-off of MSG, as well as the initiation of a quarterly dividend and a share repurchase program. Since that time, we have also refinanced, extended the maturities of much of our debt portfolio and completed the acquisition of the Bresnan properties, an acquisition that we continue to believe will be accretive to shareholder value. 
We remain focused on striking the right balance between returning capital to our shareholders and investing capital in the business as this balance is a critical component of our future success. It is worth noting that since 2008, despite substantially reducing the size and cash flows of the company by spinning off AMC and MSG, Cablevision has not only maintained its quarterly dividend but we have increased it twice to its current level of $0.15 per share. And last week, our Board of Directors approved another $0.15 per share dividend payable at the end of March. 
In 2011, Cablevision also remain committed to its share repurchase program, buying back more than 20 million shares of Class A stock during the year. 
Now turning to our operating results. Despite a tough economy and competitive pressures, we continue to grow our high-speed data and voice customers and our overall average revenue per subscriber. While we lost video subscribers in the quarter, we are taking steps to maintain or increase our video subbase in the future. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, Cablevision's consolidated revenue grew 7.3% and AOCF increased 21%. The company's results reflect a number of unusual items, which Gregg will talk more about shortly. Excluding these items, revenue was up 1% and AOCF grew 0.8% for the quarter. 
During our last call, we talked about the emergence of some underlying trends with regard to certain subscriber metrics, including healthy increases in high-speed data and voice customers as well as reduced video subscriber losses. This continued with our fourth quarter results. 
We also saw a positive momentum with our Bresnan properties, which we are now calling Optimum West. For the fourth quarter, these properties reported subscriber increases across Basic Video Customer, high-speed data and voice services. 
Cablevision generated approximately $583 million in free cash flow in 2011 and an 8.7% improvement over 2010. Over the course of the year, we also continue to rollout new products and service offerings to enhance our customers experience such as our in-home mobile apps and Ultimate Triple Play offer. At the same time, we remain focused on enhancing our existing products. 
As you know, we were disappointed in the results of the FCC test conducted last spring on broadband speeds. Since then, we have invested the necessary time and resources to make significant improvements. As a result, according to our recent test conducted by the same broadband testing firm, our broadband speeds now exceed our advertised speeds throughout all periods of the day. Maintaining an industry-leading level of service is critical for Cablevision. Today, our customers expect more from us than ever before. 
And in 2012, we will strive to do 2 things. One, meet and more importantly, exceed the expectations of our existing customers. Two, prove to those who are making choices about a new provider that no one offers better products or better service than Cablevision. We will achieve this by continuing to focus on improving the product experience for our customers, whether it's adding more content to our VOD offering or rolling out our RS-DVR product, we have one goal, to ensure that our products are better than anything else on the market. 
Looking ahead, one very important product for the company is Wi-Fi. Wireless data usage is growing as more and more of our customers want to take their television and computer experience in mobile with devices such as iPads and smartphones. We think our Wi-Fi network is better equipped to handle this usage and that this wireless expansion of our Optimum Online service will provide a real advantage for the company as we continue to expand our Wi-Fi coverage. Another product that has experienced increased usages our optimum apps for iPad, iPad Touch and iPhone devices. 
In the fourth quarter alone, uses of the app increased 70% and now, exceed 500,000. Cablevision will soon launch the HBO GO and Max GO products throughout our footprint, which will allow our customers to enjoy this programming on mobile devices in and out of the home. And we expect more and more programming services to be added in the coming months. 
In addition to improving our products, we want to improve our relationship with our existing customers and ensure that they know that we value them and their business. We will also continue to explore fresh ways to attract new customers. 
One quick example of this is a new program that offers people who are moving into Cablevision areas the opportunity for next day installation. The early results from the pilot tests reflect higher completed sales than the prior company average. This program will be rolled out across our East footprint by the end of the first quarter. 
I want to emphasize that at its core, our business is strong. Our suite of products is in high demand and we will work to continue to grow these products to meet our customers' evolving needs. This means that 2012 will be a year of investment, both in capital spending and in operating execution. In fact, we expect to accelerate certain 2013 projects into this current year, resulting in higher capital expenditures in 2012. We will be smart and efficient in this process, which should set us on the path towards a stronger 2013 and beyond. We will also remain focused on pricing, packaging and the overall quality of our service. 
Cablevision has not announced a 2012 rate increase. While in the short term, this is expected to impact our revenue and AOCF growth, we believe that actions like this will not go unnoticed by our customers and ultimately, are healthy for the long term. Our intention is to maintain discipline in our pricing and packaging. So though we may not have a rate increase this year, we have eliminated the very low price offers that have been in the market in the past few years. 
Cablevision has been in the business for nearly 40 years. Our ability to change and adapt with the times has insured our position as the leading media and telecommunications company. 
Looking ahead, we have an excellent management team with decades in cable experience and I have tremendous confidence that together, we will build on this already strong foundation to continue delivering value for both our customers and our shareholders. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Seibert."
25933,145610626,265854,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2012",2012-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we gained 20,300 high-speed data customers and 30,500 voice customers, while Basic Video Customer declined by 14,000. Of these amounts, the Optimum West contribution was 7,000 high-speed d",1480,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we gained 20,300 high-speed data customers and 30,500 voice customers, while Basic Video Customer declined by 14,000. Of these amounts, the Optimum West contribution was 7,000 high-speed data customers, 8,000 voice customers and 600 Basic Video Customer'. All of these quarterly changes and total company customer accounts compared favorably with both third quarter of 2011 as well as the fourth quarter at 2010. 
Average revenue per video customer across all properties was $154.10 in the fourth quarter, a sequential increase of $2.39. RPS in the Eastern properties rose by more than $2 in the quarter and the West property saw an increase in RPS of over $5. 
Turning to our financials. Most of you will recall that we acquired Bresnan Communications in December of 2010. As a result, while our 2011 fourth quarter numbers contain results from these properties for the entire quarter, the 2010 fourth quarter reflects approximately 2 weeks of their results. 
That said, Cable revenue for the quarter was up 8% over the prior year, 1.2% after excluding Bresnan. AOCF for the Cable segment grew by 17% versus the prior year and would have been up 8% excluding Bresnan. As Jim mentioned, there were a number of unusual items, which affected the quarter. 
Page 4 of the earnings release contains these details, which included the impacts from the October snowstorm, compensation and executive separation adjustments and the favorable programming adjustment. If we were to exclude each of these items as well as the impact of Optimum West, the Cable segment AOCF would have reflected a decline of 1.8% in the quarter and the total company consolidated AOCF would have been higher by 0.8%. 
The Cable operating margin after adjusting for these items was 39.1%, down slightly from prior year primarily due to programming cost increases. 
Advertising revenue in the fourth quarter was flat compared with last year's fourth quarter.  Add sales in the East were down by roughly 7%, reflecting the strong political advertising market in the fourth quarter of 2010. Nonpolitical add sales were up 8% in the quarter in the core Cablevision footprint. The SME business continues to withstand pressure from a tough economy as well as competition. The SME product typically includes data and voice services and today's new SME customers taking both products are paying more than $140 per month on average. 
Our Small Business customers are enjoying more and more benefits in their product bundle. We have developed partnerships with top suppliers such as FedEx, Sprint and ADP to provide pre-negotiated offers on services that are essential to small businesses. In doing so, we've enhanced what was already considered an attractive proposition towards Small Business customers. 
At Optimum Lightpath, we reached the milestone in the fourth quarter by connecting to our 5,000th building. Revenue in the quarter was up 9.6% and AOCF increased 24% over the prior year period. Excluding the unusual items I referenced earlier, AOCF was up 12% versus the prior year period. 
Optimum West is making progress. At year end, digital penetration reached 77% of basic subs, high-speed data subs as a percent of passings reached 40% and voice subs ended the year with 23% of passings. The average revenue per sub for the West properties was $134.60 in the fourth quarter, which I mentioned is over $5 sequentially. So we are seeing progress but believe that there is potential for more top line growth as we continue to sell in more product to existing customers as well as add new customers. The AOCF margin for the West properties was 31.1% in the fourth quarter. As we've mentioned in the past, we are currently disputing a property tax assessment but have to make certain protest payments in the meantime. We have made a $5.5 million protest payment, which adversely affected our margins. Capital spending for the West was $40 million in the quarter as we purchased CPE to support our unit growth and extend the fiber ring, which now connects about 85% of our Optimum West customers. 
Cable capital spending in the fourth quarter was $177 million including the Optimum West properties. For the full year, total Cable capital spending was $654 million. In better than our 2011 capital amounts are expenditures needed to pursue more and better products for our customers as well as a better customer experience. 
Certain of these expenditures are expected to continue into 2012, including the all-digital rollout in the East, which is currently scheduled to be complete by this summer; the continuing rollout of DVR Plus; our broadband network augmentation project intended to enhance broadband speeds, which should be completed by the end of the first quarter. And Jim mentioned our focus on Wi-Fi. We have the largest Wi-Fi network in the country with 35,000 locations throughout our footprint. Usage has increased by over 300% in the past year and over 1 million devices have been registered through automatic sign-in. So as Jim noted, 2012 will be a year of investment for Cablevision. I will reiterate that we're accelerating several capital projects and expect to see higher capital spending in 2012 than we incurred in 2011, and we expect the free cash flow will be lower in 2012 than what was generated in 2011. 
Now turning to the company's financial position. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the 12 months ended December 31 was $583 million and compares with the 2010 full year free cash flow of $536 million, an increase of 8.7%. Free cash flow per share for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, was $2.05, a 15% increase compared with free cash flow per share of $1.78 in the prior year period. At year end, the company's consolidated cash position was $612 million and net debt was $10.1 billion. We have $1.35 billion undrawn and available under the $1.41 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings. 
In the fourth quarter, we executed a number of successful financing transactions to continue to extend our debt maturity profile. First, we entered into an extended term loan A facility, which provided $600 million of term loans priced at LIBOR plus 200 basis points for the final maturity date of December 2016. The proceeds from the term loan A facility were used to make a voluntary payment of the $339 million of the unextended term loan A and B loans, which are ending in 2012, 2013 timeframe. 
We then issued $1 billion of 6 3/4% senior notes due 2021. Proceeds from this issuance, we'll use to tender for approximately $682 million of CSC Holdings senior notes during 2012, 2014 and 2015. In addition to the tender transaction, we repurchased approximately $86 million of the 6 3/4% senior notes in an open market transaction. 
In calculating our total company leverage ratio, annual AOCF is determined using the latest core annualized. There were no exclusions for the items which I addressed earlier. As a result, at December 31, the company's consolidated leverage net ratio was 4.1 times. Without the unusual items, the consolidated ratio would have been approximately 4.5x, which we consider to be a more representative measure of our total company financial leverage. 
The CSC Holdings restricted leverage ratio was 3.6x. At year end, Bresnan net debt was approximately $1 billion with $75 million undrawn and available on its revolving credit facility. The leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.9x, down from third quarter ratio of 7x. We have mentioned in the past that our target leverage ratio for the total company has been roughly 4.5x going to size 5x under certain circumstances. 
As we look at our 2012 initiatives coupled with higher programming costs, we do not anticipate AOCF growth in 2012. As a result, at times, we can see leverage in 2012 exceeding 5x. While this is higher than our previous target, we are confident that we can manage our operations with this level of debt and we'll continue to monitor our debt levels closely. 
The Cablevision NOL was $1.7 billion at December 31. We have taken advantage of the bonus depreciation provision in 2010 and 2011 and intend to do so again in 2012 to the extent we can, which lengthens the timing of our NOL utilization. 
Turning to the company's stock repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares of Cablevision stock, totaling $67.4 million. This represents approximately 2% of the company's outstanding Class A shares. 
From inception of the program through the end of 2011, we have repurchased 31.7 million shares. And our total outstanding Class A shares have decreased from $251 million to $220 million or roughly 12.6%. At December 31, we had $144 million remaining under our existing repurchase authorization. We currently expect to continue our repurchase program in the coming quarter.

So going forward, obviously expect programming costs to be going up certainly mid- to high-single digit percentages. And this year in particular, and I'll walk you through the programming amortization adjustment we had. This year, in particular, our programming expenses for 2011 are reduced by the amount of the programming adjustment, the $42.9 million. So that will make the year-to-year comparisons seem more draconian than they actually are. The programming adjustment is very simple. We were out of contract with several programmers and we entered into new agreements with those programmers this year. Over the period of time that we were out of contract, we accrued our programming expenses at higher rates than we actually ultimately ended up paying for that programming so that resulted in the reversal of $42.9 million."

And again, these increases in capital expenditures are primarily in Cable leased. To a lesser extent, we expect the increases to be in CPE. It's a continuation of the digitization process, purchasing boxes and routers. Our box inventories got quite low at the end of last year and we're just investing in the business for growth."

Add sales in the East were down by roughly 7%, reflecting the strong political advertising market in the fourth quarter of 2010. Nonpolitical add sales were up 8% in the quarter in the core Cablevision footprint. The SME business continues to withstand pressure from a tough economy as well as competition. The SME product typically includes data and voice services and today's new SME customers taking both products are paying more than $140 per month on average. 
Our Small Business customers are enjoying more and more benefits in their product bundle. We have developed partnerships with top suppliers such as FedEx, Sprint and ADP to provide pre-negotiated offers on services that are essential to small businesses. In doing so, we've enhanced what was already considered an attractive proposition towards Small Business customers. 
At Optimum Lightpath, we reached the milestone in the fourth quarter by connecting to our 5,000th building. Revenue in the quarter was up 9.6% and AOCF increased 24% over the prior year period. Excluding the unusual items I referenced earlier, AOCF was up 12% versus the prior year period. 
Optimum West is making progress. At year end, digital penetration reached 77% of basic subs, high-speed data subs as a percent of passings reached 40% and voice subs ended the year with 23% of passings. The average revenue per sub for the West properties was $134.60 in the fourth quarter, which I mentioned is over $5 sequentially. So we are seeing progress but believe that there is potential for more top line growth as we continue to sell in more product to existing customers as well as add new customers. The AOCF margin for the West properties was 31.1% in the fourth quarter. As we've mentioned in the past, we are currently disputing a property tax assessment but have to make certain protest payments in the meantime. We have made a $5.5 million protest payment in the fourth quarter, which adversely affected our margins."

25933,145610626,265912,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2012",2012-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Pat, and good morning. 2011 marked the substantial completion of a multiyear, multistep process to enhance shareholder value. As most of you may recall, in August of 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized management to ex",1191,"Thank you, Pat, and good morning. 2011 marked the substantial completion of a multiyear, multistep process to enhance shareholder value. As most of you may recall, in August of 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized management to explore several options to enhance the value of Cablevision for its shareholders. The spinoff of AMC last year marked another significant milestone in this process, which also included the spinoff of MSG, as well as the initiation of a quarterly dividend and a share repurchase program. Since that time, we have also refinanced and extended the maturities of much of our debt portfolio and completed the acquisition of the Bresnan  properties, an acquisition that we continue to believe will be accretive to shareholder value. 
We remain focused on striking the right balance between returning capital to our shareholders and investing capital in the business as this balance is a critical component of our future success. It is worth noting that since 2008, despite substantially reducing the size and cash flows of the company by spinning off AMC and MSG, Cablevision has not only maintained its quarterly dividend but we have increased it twice to its current level of $0.15 per share. And last week, our Board of Directors approved another $0.15 per share dividend payable at the end of March. 
In 2011, Cablevision also remain committed to its share repurchase program, buying back more than 20 million shares of Class A stock during the year. 
Now turning to our operating results. Despite a tough economy and competitive pressures, we continue to grow our high-speed data and voice customers and our overall average revenue per subscriber. While we lost video subscribers in the quarter, we are taking steps to maintain or increase our video sub base in the future. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, Cablevision's consolidated revenue grew 7.3% and AOCF increased 21%. The company's results reflect a number of unusual items, which Gregg will talk more about shortly. Excluding these items, revenue was up 1% and AOCF grew 0.8% for the quarter. 
During our last call, we talked about the emergence of some underlying trends with regard to certain subscriber metrics, including healthy increases in high-speed data and voice customers, as well as reduced video subscriber losses. This continued with our fourth quarter results. 
We also saw a positive momentum with our Bresnan properties, which we are now calling Optimum West. For the fourth quarter, these properties reported subscriber increases across basic video, high-speed data and voice services. 
Cablevision generated approximately $583 million in free cash flow in 2011 and an 8.7% improvement over 2010. Over the course of the year, we also continue to rollout new products and service offerings to enhance our customers experience such as our in-home mobile apps and Ultimate Triple Play offer. At the same time, we remain focused on enhancing our existing products. 
As you know, we were disappointed in the results of an FCC test conducted last spring on broadband speeds. Since then, we have invested the necessary time and resources to make significant improvements. As a result, according to a recent test conducted by the same broadband testing firm, our broadband speeds now exceed our advertised speeds throughout all periods of the day. Maintaining an industry-leading level of service is critical for Cablevision. Today, our customers expect more from us than ever before. 
And in 2012, we will strive to do 2 things: one, meet and more importantly, exceed the expectations of our existing customers. Two, prove to those who are making choices about a new provider that no one offers better products or better service than Cablevision. We will achieve this by continuing to focus on improving the product experience for our customers, whether it's adding more content to our VOD offering or rolling out our RS-DVR product, we have one goal, to ensure that our products are better than anything else on the market. 
Looking ahead, one very important product for the company is WiFi. Wireless data usage is growing as more and more of our customers want to take their television and computer experience mobile with devices such as iPads and smartphones. We think our WiFi network is better equipped to handle this usage, and that this wireless expansion of our Optimum Online service will provide a real advantage for the company as we continue to expand our WiFi coverage. Another product that has experienced increased usage is our Optimum app for iPad, iPod Touch and iPhone devices. 
In the fourth quarter alone, uses of the app increased 70% and now exceed 500,000. Cablevision will soon launch the HBO GO and MAX GO products throughout our footprint, which will allow our customers to enjoy this programming on mobile devices in or out of the home. And we expect more and more programming services to be added in the coming months. 
In addition to improving our products, we want to improve our relationship with our existing customers and ensure that they know that we value them and their business. We will also continue to explore fresh ways to attract new customers. 
One quick example of this is a new program that offers people, who are moving into Cablevision areas, the opportunity for next day installation. The early results from the pilot tests reflect higher completed sales than the prior company average. This program will be rolled out across our East footprint by the end of the first quarter. 
I want to emphasize that at its core, our business is strong. Our suite of products is in high demand and we will work to continue to grow these products to meet our customers' evolving needs. This means that 2012 will be a year of investment, both in capital spending and in operating execution. In fact, we expect to accelerate certain 2013 projects into this current year, resulting in higher capital expenditures in 2012. We will be smart and efficient in this process, which should set us on a path towards a stronger 2013 and beyond. We will also remain focused on pricing, packaging and the overall quality of our service. 
Cablevision has not announced the 2012 rate increase. While in the short term, this is expected to impact our revenue and AOCF growth, we believe that actions like this will not go unnoticed by our customers and ultimately, are healthy for the long term. Our intention is to maintain discipline in our pricing and packaging. So though you may not have a rate increase this year, we have eliminated the very low price offers that have been in the market in the past few years. 
Cablevision has been in the business for nearly 40 years. Our ability to change and adapt with the times has insured our position as the leading media and telecommunications company. 
Looking ahead, we have an excellent management team with decades of cable experience and I have tremendous confidence that, together, we will build on this already strong foundation to continue delivering value for both our customers and our shareholders. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Seibert."
25933,145610626,265912,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2012",2012-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we gained 20,300 high-speed data customers and 30,500 voice customers, while Basic Video Customers declined by 14,000. Of these amounts, the Optimum West contribution was 7,000 high-speed",1487,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we gained 20,300 high-speed data customers and 30,500 voice customers, while Basic Video Customers declined by 14,000. Of these amounts, the Optimum West contribution was 7,000 high-speed data customers, 8,000 voice customers and 600 Basic Video Customers. All of these quarterly changes in total company customer accounts compared favorably with both third quarter of 2011, as well as the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Average revenue per video customer across all properties was $154.10 in the fourth quarter, a sequential increase of $2.39. RPS in the Eastern properties rose by more than $2 in the quarter and the West property saw an increase in RPS of over $5. 
Turning to our financials. Most of you will recall that we acquired Bresnan Communications in December of 2010. As a result, while our 2011 fourth quarter numbers contain results from these properties for the entire quarter, the 2010 fourth quarter reflects approximately 2 weeks of their results. 
That said, Cable revenue for the quarter was up 8% over the prior year, 1.2% after excluding Bresnan. AOCF for the Cable segment grew by 17% versus the prior year and would have been up 8% excluding Bresnan. As Jim mentioned, there were a number of unusual items, which affected the quarter. 
Page 4 of the earnings release contains these details, which included the impacts from the October snowstorm, compensation and executive separation adjustments and the favorable programming adjustment. If we were to exclude each of these items, as well as the impact of Optimum West, the Cable segment AOCF would have reflected a decline of 1.8% in the quarter and the total company consolidated AOCF would have been higher by 0.8%. 
The Cable operating margin after adjusting for these items was 39.1%, down slightly from prior year primarily due to programming cost increases. 
Advertising revenue in the fourth quarter was flat compared with last year's fourth quarter. Ad sales in the East were down by roughly 7%, reflecting the strong political advertising market in the fourth quarter of 2010. Nonpolitical ad sales were up 8% in the quarter in the core Cablevision footprint. The SME business continues to withstand pressure from the tough economy, as well as competition. The SME product bundle typically includes data and voice services, and today's new SME customers taking both products are paying more than $140 per month on average. 
Our Small Business customers are enjoying more and more benefits in their product bundle. We have developed partnerships with top suppliers such as FedEx, Sprint and ADP to provide pre-negotiated offers on services that are essential to small businesses. In doing so, we have enhanced what was already considered an attractive proposition to our Small Business customers. 
At Optimum Lightpath, we reached a milestone in the fourth quarter by connecting to our 5,000th building. Revenue in the quarter was up 9.6%, and AOCF increased 24% over the prior year period. Excluding the unusual items I referenced earlier, AOCF was up 12% versus the prior year period. 
Optimum West is making progress. At year end, digital penetration reached 77% of basic subs, high-speed data subs as a percent of passings reached 40%, and voice subs ended the year with 23% of passings. The average revenue per sub for the West properties was $134.60 in the fourth quarter which, as I mentioned, is up over $5 sequentially. So we are seeing progress but believe that there is potential for more top line growth as we continue to sell in more products to existing customers, as well as add new customers. The AOCF margin for the West properties was 31.1% in the fourth quarter. As we've mentioned in the past, we are currently disputing a property tax assessment but have to make certain protest payments in the meantime. We made a $5.5 million protest payment in the fourth quarter, which adversely affected our margins. Capital spending for the West was $24 million in the quarter as we purchased CPE to support our unit growth and extended the fiber ring, which now connects about 85% of our Optimum West customers. 
Cable capital spending in the fourth quarter was $177 million including the Optimum West properties. For the full year, total Cable capital spending was $654 million. Embedded in our 2011 capital amounts are expenditures needed to pursue more and better products for our customers, as well as a better customer experience. 
Certain of these expenditures are expected to continue into 2012, including the all-digital rollout in the East, which is currently scheduled to be complete by this summer; the continuing rollout of DVR Plus; our broadband network augmentation project intended to enhance broadband speeds, which should be completed by the end of the first quarter. And Jim mentioned our focus on WiFi. We have the largest WiFi network in the country with 35,000 locations throughout our footprint. Usage has increased by over 300% in the past year and over 1 million devices have been registered through automatic sign-in. So as Jim noted, 2012 will be a year of investment for Cablevision. I will reiterate that we are accelerating several capital projects and expect to see higher capital spending in 2012 than we incurred in 2011, and we expect that free cash flow will be lower in 2012 than what was generated in 2011. 
Now turning to the company's financial position. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the 12 months ended December 31 was $583 million and compares with the 2010 full year free cash flow of $536 million, an increase of 8.7%. Free cash flow per share for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, was $2.05, a 15% increase compared with free cash flow per share of $1.78 in the prior year period. At year end, the company's consolidated cash position was $612 million and net debt was $10.1 billion. We have $1.35 billion undrawn and available under the $1.41 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings. 
In the fourth quarter, we executed a number of successful financing transactions to continue to extend our debt maturity profile. First, we entered into an extended term loan A facility, which provided $600 million of term loans priced at LIBOR plus 200 basis points with a final maturity date of December 2016. The proceeds from the term loan A facility were used to make a voluntary prepayment of $339 million of the unextended term loan A and B loans maturing during the 2012-2013 time frame. 
We then issued $1 billion of 6 3/4% senior notes due 2021. Proceeds from this issuance were used to tender for approximately $682 million of CSC Holdings senior notes due in 2012, 2014 and 2015. In addition to the tender transaction, we repurchased approximately $86 million of the 6 3/4% senior notes in an open market transaction. 
In calculating our total company leverage ratio, annual AOCF is determined using the latest core annualized. There are no exclusions for the items, which I addressed earlier. As a result, at December 31, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.1x. Without the unusual items, the consolidated ratio would have been approximately 4.5x, which we consider to be a more representative measure of our total company financial leverage. 
The CSC Holdings restricted group leverage ratio was 3.6x. At year end, Bresnan net debt was approximately $1 billion, with $75 million undrawn and available on its revolving credit facility. The leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.9x, down from third quarter ratio of 7x. We have mentioned in the past, that our target leverage ratio for the total company has been roughly 4.5x, going as high 5x under certain circumstances. 
As we look at our 2012 initiatives coupled with higher programming costs, we do not anticipate AOCF growth in 2012. As a result, at times, we could see leverage in 2012 exceeding 5x. While this is higher than our previous target, we are confident that we can manage our operations with this level of debt and we'll continue to monitor our debt levels closely. 
The Cablevision NOL was $1.7 billion at December 31. We have taken advantage of the bonus depreciations provision in 2010 and 2011, and intend to do so again in 2012 to the extent we can, which lengthens the timing for our NOL utilization. 
Turning to the company's stock repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares of Cablevision stock, totaling $67.4 million. This represents approximately 2% of the company's outstanding Class A shares. 
From inception of the program through the end of 2011, we have repurchased 31.7 million shares. And our total outstanding Class A shares have decreased from $251 million to $220 million or roughly 12.6%. At December 31, we had $144 million remaining under our existing repurchase authorization. We currently expect to continue our repurchase program in the coming quarter.

So going forward, obviously, expect programming costs to be going up certainly mid- to high-single digit percentages. And this year in particular, and I'll walk you through the programming amortization adjustment we had. This year, in particular, our programming expenses for 2011 are reduced by the amount of the programming adjustment, the $42.9 million. So that will make the year-to-year comparisons seem more draconian than they actually are. And the programming adjustment is very simple. We were out of contract with several programmers and we entered into new agreements with those programmers this year. Over the period of time that we were out of contract, we accrued our programming expenses at higher rates than we actually ultimately ended up paying for that programming, so that resulted in the reversal of $42.9 million."

25933,145610626,266092,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2012",2012-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Pat, and good morning. 2011 marked the substantial completion of a multiyear, multistep process to enhance shareholder value.

As most of you may recall, in August of 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized management to explore several options to enhance the value of Cablevision for its shareholders. The spinoff of AMC last year marked another significant milestone in this process, which also included the spinoff of MSG, as well as the initiation of a quarterly dividend and a share repurchase program. Since that time, we have also refinanced and extended the maturities of much of our debt portfolio and completed the acquisition of the Bresnan properties, an acquisition that we continue to believe will be accretive to shareholder value. 
We remain focused on striking the right balance between returning capital to our shareholders and investing capital in the business as this balance is a critical component of our future success. It is worth noting that since 2008, despite substantially reducing the size and cash flows of the company by spinning off AMC and MSG, Cablevision has not only maintained its quarterly dividend but we have increased it twice to its current level of $0.15 per share. And last week, our Board of Directors approved another $0.15 per share dividend payable at the end of March. 
In 2011, Cablevision also remain committed to its share repurchase program, buying back more than 20 million shares of Class A stock during the year. 
Now turning to our operating results. Despite a tough economy and competitive pressures, we continue to grow our high speed data and voice customers and our overall average revenue per subscriber. While we lost video subscribers in the quarter, we are taking steps to maintain or increase our video sub base in the future. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, Cablevision's consolidated revenue grew 7.3% and AOCF increased 21%. The company's results reflect a number of unusual items, which Gregg will talk more about shortly. Excluding these items, revenue was up 1% and AOCF grew 0.8% for the quarter. 
During our last call, we talked about the emergence of some underlying trends with regard to certain subscriber metrics, including healthy increases in high speed data and voice customers, as well as reduced video subscriber losses. This continued with our fourth quarter results. 
We also saw a positive momentum with our Bresnan properties, which we are now calling Optimum West. For the fourth quarter, these properties reported subscriber increases across basic video, high speed data and voice services. 
Cablevision generated approximately $583 million in free cash flow in 2011 and an 8.7% improvement over 2010. Over the course of the year, we also continued to rollout new products and service offerings to enhance our customers experience such as our in home mobile apps and Ultimate Triple Play offer. At the same time, we remain focused on enhancing our existing products. 
As you know, we were disappointed in the results of an FCC test conducted last spring on broadband speeds. Since then, we have invested the necessary time and resources to make significant improvements. As a result, according to a recent test conducted by the same broadband testing firm, our broadband speeds now exceed our advertised speeds throughout all periods of the day. Maintaining an industry leading level of service is critical for Cablevision. Today, our customers expect more from us than ever before. 
And in 2012, we will strive to do 2 things: One, meet and more importantly, exceed the expectations of our existing customers. Two, prove to those who are making choices about a new provider that no one offers better products or better service than Cablevision. We will achieve this by continuing to focus on improving the product experience for our customers, whether it's adding more content to our VOD offering or rolling out our RS DVR product, we have one goal, to ensure that our products are better than anything else on the market. 
Looking ahead, one very important product for the company is WiFi. Wireless data usage is growing as more and more of our customers want to take their television and computer experience mobile with devices such as iPads and smartphones. We think our WiFi network is better equipped to handle this usage, and that this wireless extension of our Optimum Online service will provide a real advantage for the company as we continue to expand our WiFi coverage. Another product that has experienced increased usage is our Optimum app for iPad, iPod Touch and iPhone devices. 
In the fourth quarter alone, users of the app increased 70% and now exceed 500,000. Cablevision will soon launch the HBO GO and MAX GO products throughout our footprint, which will allow our customers to enjoy this programming on mobile devices in or out of the home. And we expect more and more programming services to be added in the coming months. 
In addition to improving our products, we want to improve our relationship with our existing customers and ensure that they know that we value them and their business. We will also continue to explore fresh ways to attract new customers. 
One quick example of this is a new program that offers people, who are moving into Cablevision areas, the opportunity for next day installation. The early results from the pilot tests reflect higher completed sales than the prior company average. This program will be rolled out across our East footprint by the end of the first quarter. 
I want to emphasize that at its core, our business is strong. Our suite of products is in high demand and we will work to continue to grow these products to meet our customers' evolving needs. This means that 2012 will be a year of investment, both in capital spending and in operating execution. In fact, we expect to accelerate certain 2013 projects into this current year, resulting in higher capital expenditures in 2012. We will be smart and efficient in this process, which should set us on a path towards a stronger 2013 and beyond. We will also remain focused on pricing, packaging and the overall quality of our service. 
Cablevision has not announced a 2012 rate increase. While in the short term, this is expected to impact our revenue and AOCF growth, we believe that actions like this will not go unnoticed by our customers and ultimately, are healthy for the long term. Our intention is to maintain discipline in our pricing and packaging. So though you may not have a rate increase this year, we have eliminated the very low price offers that have been in the market in the past few years. 
Cablevision has been in the business for nearly 40 years. Our ability to change and adapt with the times has ensured our position as a leading media and telecommunications company. 
Looking ahead, we have an excellent management team with decades of cable experience and I have tremendous confidence that, together, we will build on this already strong foundation to continue delivering value for both our customers and our shareholders. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Seibert."
25933,145610626,266092,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2012",2012-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we gained 20,300 high speed data customers and 30,500 voice customers, while Basic Video Customers declined by 14,000. Of these amounts, the Optimum West contribution was 7,000 high speed",1489,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we gained 20,300 high speed data customers and 30,500 voice customers, while Basic Video Customers declined by 14,000. Of these amounts, the Optimum West contribution was 7,000 high speed data customers, 8,000 voice customers and 600 Basic Video Customers. All of these quarterly changes in total company customer accounts compared favorably with both third quarter of 2011, as well as the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Average revenue per video customer across all properties was $154.10 in the fourth quarter, a sequential increase of $2.39. RPS in the Eastern properties rose by more than $2 in the quarter and the West property saw an increase in RPS of over $5. 
Turning to our financials. Most of you will recall that we acquired Bresnan Communications in December of 2010. As a result, while our 2011 fourth quarter numbers contain results from these properties for the entire quarter, the 2010 fourth quarter reflects approximately 2 weeks of their results. 
That said, Cable revenue for the quarter was up 8% over the prior year, 1.2% after excluding Bresnan. AOCF for the Cable segment grew by 17% versus the prior year and would have been up 8% excluding Bresnan. As Jim mentioned, there were a number of unusual items, which affected the quarter. 
Page 4 of the earnings release contains these details, which include the impacts from the October snowstorm, compensation and executive separation adjustments and a favorable programming adjustment. If we were to exclude each of these items, as well as the impact of Optimum West, the Cable segment AOCF would have reflected a decline of 1.8% in the quarter and the total company consolidated AOCF would have been higher by 0.8%. 
The Cable operating margin after adjusting for these items was 39.1%, down slightly from prior year primarily due to programming cost increases.  
Advertising revenue in the fourth quarter was flat compared with last year's fourth quarter. Ad sales in the East were down by roughly 7%, reflecting the strong political advertising market in the fourth quarter of 2010. Nonpolitical ad sales were up 8% in the quarter in the core Cablevision footprint. The SME business continues to withstand pressure from the tough economy, as well as competition. The SME product bundle typically includes data and voice services, and today's new SME customers taking both products are paying more than $140 per month on average. 
Our Small Business customers are enjoying more and more benefits in their product bundle. We have developed partnerships with top suppliers such as FedEx, Sprint and ADP to provide pre-negotiated offers on services that are essential to small businesses. In doing so, we have enhanced what was already considered an attractive proposition to our Small Business customers. 
At Optimum Lightpath, we reached a milestone in the fourth quarter by connecting to our 5,000th building. Revenue in the quarter was up 9.6%, and AOCF increased 24% over the prior year period. Excluding the unusual items I referenced earlier, AOCF was up 12% versus the prior year period. 
Optimum West is making progress. At year end, digital penetration reached 77% of basic subs, high-speed data subs as a percent of passings reached 40% and voice subs ended the year with 23% of passings. The average revenue per sub for the West properties was $134.60 in the fourth quarter which, as I mentioned, is up over $5 sequentially. So we are seeing progress but believe that there is potential for more top line growth as we continue to sell in more products to existing customers, as well as add new customers. The AOCF margin for the West properties was 31.1% in the fourth quarter. As we've mentioned in the past, we are currently disputing a property tax assessment but have to make certain protest payments in the meantime. We made a $5.5 million protest payment in the fourth quarter, which adversely affected our margins. Capital spending for the West was $24 million in the quarter as we purchased CPE to support our unit growth and extended a fiber ring, which now connects about 85% of our Optimum West customers. 
Cable capital spending in the fourth quarter was $177 million including the Optimum West properties. For the full year, total Cable capital spending was $654 million. Embedded in our 2011 capital amounts are expenditures needed to pursue more and better products for our customers, as well as a better customer experience. 
Certain of these expenditures are expected to continue into 2012, including the all-digital rollout in the East, which is currently scheduled to be complete by this summer; the continuing rollout of DVR Plus; our broadband network augmentation project intended to enhance broadband speeds, which should be completed by the end of the first quarter. And Jim mentioned our focus on WiFi. We have the largest WiFi network in the country with 35,000 locations throughout our footprint. Usage has increased by over 300% in the past year and over 1 million devices have been registered through automatic sign-in. So as Jim noted, 2012 will be a year of investment for Cablevision. I will reiterate that we are accelerating several capital projects and expect to see higher capital spending in 2012 than we incurred in 2011, and we expect that free cash flow will be lower in 2012 than what was generated in 2011. 
Now turning to the company's financial position. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the 12 months ended December 31 was $583 million and compares with the 2010 full year free cash flow of $536 million, an increase of 8.7%. Free cash flow per share for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, was $2.05, a 15% increase compared with free cash flow per share of $1.78 in the prior year period. At year end, the company's consolidated cash position was $612 million and net debt was $10.1 billion. We had $1.35 billion undrawn and available under the $1.41 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings. 
In the fourth quarter, we executed a number of successful financing transactions to continue to extend our debt maturity profile. First, we entered into an extended term loan A facility, which provided $600 million of term loans priced at LIBOR plus 200 basis points with a final maturity date of December 2016. The proceeds from the term loan A facility were used to make a voluntary prepayment of $339 million of the unextended term loan A and B loans maturing during the 2012-2013 time frame. 
We then issued $1 billion of 6 3/4% senior notes due 2021. Proceeds from this issuance were used to tender for approximately $682 million of CSC Holdings senior notes due in 2012, 2014 and 2015. In addition to the tender transaction, we repurchased approximately $86 million of the 6 3/4% senior notes in an open market transaction. 
In calculating our total company leverage ratio, annual AOCF is determined using the latest quarter annualized. There are no exclusions for the items, which I addressed earlier. As a result, at December 31, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.1x. Without the unusual items, the consolidated ratio would have been approximately 4.5x, which we consider to be a more representative measure of our total company financial leverage. 
The CSC Holdings restricted group leverage ratio was 3.6x. At year end, Bresnan net debt was approximately $1 billion, with $75 million undrawn and available on its revolving credit facility. The leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.9x, down from third quarter ratio of 7x. We have mentioned in the past, that our target leverage ratio for the total company has been roughly 4.5x, going as high 5x under certain circumstances. 
As we look at our 2012 initiatives coupled with higher programming costs, we do not anticipate AOCF growth in 2012. As a result, at times, we could see leverage in 2012 exceeding 5x. While this is higher than our previous target, we are confident that we can manage our operations with this level of debt and we'll continue to monitor our debt levels closely. 
The Cablevision NOL was $1.7 billion at December 31. We have taken advantage of the bonus depreciations provision in 2010 and 2011, and intend to do so again in 2012 to the extent we can, which lengthens the timing for our NOL utilization. 
Turning to the company's stock repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares of Cablevision stock, totaling $67.4 million. This represents approximately 2% of the company's outstanding Class A shares. 
From inception of the program through the end of 2011, we have repurchased 31.7 million shares. And our total outstanding Class A shares have decreased from $251 million to $220 million or roughly 12.6%. At December 31, we had $144 million remaining under our existing repurchase authorization. We currently expect to continue our repurchase program in the coming quarter.

And this year in particular, and I'll walk you through the programming amortization adjustment we had. This year, in particular, our programming expenses for 2011 are reduced by the amount of the programming adjustment, the $42.9 million. So that will make the year-to-year comparisons seem more draconian than they actually are. And the programming adjustment is very simple. We were out of contract with several programmers and we entered into new agreements with those programmers this year. Over the period of time that we were out of contract, we accrued our programming expenses at higher rates than we actually ultimately ended up paying for that programming, so that resulted in the reversal of $42.9 million."

25933,145610626,266601,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2012",2012-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Pat, and good morning. 2011 marked the substantial completion of a multiyear, multistep process to enhance shareholder value.

As most of you may recall, in August of 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized management to explore several options to enhance the value of Cablevision for its shareholders. The spinoff of AMC last year marked another significant milestone in this process, which also included the spinoff of MSG, as well as the initiation of a quarterly dividend and a share repurchase program. Since that time, we have also refinanced and extended the maturities of much of our debt portfolio and completed the acquisition of the Bresnan properties, an acquisition that we continue to believe will be accretive to shareholder value. 
We remain focused on striking the right balance between returning capital to our shareholders and investing capital in the business as this balance is a critical component of our future success. It is worth noting that since 2008, despite substantially reducing the size and cash flows of the company by spinning off AMC and MSG, Cablevision has not only maintained its quarterly dividend but we have increased it twice to its current level of $0.15 per share. And last week, our Board of Directors approved another $0.15 per share dividend payable at the end of March. 
In 2011, Cablevision also remain committed to its share repurchase program, buying back more than 20 million shares of Class A stock during the year. 
Now turning to our operating results. Despite a tough economy and competitive pressures, we continue to grow our high speed data and voice customers and our overall average revenue per subscriber. While we lost video subscribers in the quarter, we are taking steps to maintain or increase our video sub base in the future. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, Cablevision's consolidated revenue grew 7.3% and AOCF increased 21%. The company's results reflect a number of unusual items, which Gregg will talk more about shortly. Excluding these items, revenue was up 1% and AOCF grew 0.8% for the quarter. 
During our last call, we talked about the emergence of some underlying trends with regard to certain subscriber metrics, including healthy increases in high speed data and voice customers, as well as reduced video subscriber losses. This continued with our fourth quarter results. 
We also saw a positive momentum with our Bresnan properties, which we are now calling Optimum West. For the fourth quarter, these properties reported subscriber increases across basic video, high speed data and voice services. 
Cablevision generated approximately $583 million in free cash flow in 2011 and an 8.7% improvement over 2010. Over the course of the year, we also continued to rollout new products and service offerings to enhance our customers experience such as our in home mobile apps and Ultimate Triple Play offer. At the same time, we remain focused on enhancing our existing products. 
As you know, we were disappointed in the results of an FCC test conducted last spring on broadband speeds. Since then, we have invested the necessary time and resources to make significant improvements. As a result, according to a recent test conducted by the same broadband testing firm, our broadband speeds now exceed our advertised speeds throughout all periods of the day. Maintaining an industry leading level of service is critical for Cablevision. Today, our customers expect more from us than ever before. 
And in 2012, we will strive to do 2 things: one, meet and more importantly, exceed the expectations of our existing customers. Two, prove to those who are making choices about a new provider that no one offers better products or better service than Cablevision. We will achieve this by continuing to focus on improving the product experience for our customers, whether it's adding more content to our VOD offering or rolling out our RS DVR product, we have one goal, to ensure that our products are better than anything else on the market. 
Looking ahead, one very important product for the company is WiFi. Wireless data usage is growing as more and more of our customers want to take their television and computer experience mobile with devices such as iPads and smartphones. We think our WiFi network is better equipped to handle this usage, and that this wireless extension of our Optimum Online service will provide a real advantage for the company as we continue to expand our WiFi coverage. Another product that has experienced increased usage is our Optimum app for iPad, iPod Touch and iPhone devices. 
In the fourth quarter alone, users of the app increased 70% and now exceed 500,000. Cablevision will soon launch the HBO GO and MAX GO products throughout our footprint, which will allow our customers to enjoy this programming on mobile devices in or out of the home. And we expect more and more programming services to be added in the coming months. 
In addition to improving our products, we want to improve our relationship with our existing customers and ensure that they know that we value them and their business. We will also continue to explore fresh ways to attract new customers. 
One quick example of this is a new program that offers people, who are moving into Cablevision areas, the opportunity for next day installation. The early results from the pilot tests reflect higher completed sales than the prior company average. This program will be rolled out across our East footprint by the end of the first quarter. 
I want to emphasize that at its core, our business is strong. Our suite of products is in high demand and we will work to continue to grow these products to meet our customers' evolving needs. This means that 2012 will be a year of investment, both in capital spending and in operating execution. In fact, we expect to accelerate certain 2013 projects into this current year, resulting in higher capital expenditures in 2012. We will be smart and efficient in this process, which should set us on a path towards a stronger 2013 and beyond. We will also remain focused on pricing, packaging and the overall quality of our service. 
Cablevision has not announced a 2012 rate increase. While in the short term, this is expected to impact our revenue and AOCF growth, we believe that actions like this will not go unnoticed by our customers and ultimately, are healthy for the long term. Our intention is to maintain discipline in our pricing and packaging. So though you may not have a rate increase this year, we have eliminated the very low price offers that have been in the market in the past few years. 
Cablevision has been in the business for nearly 40 years. Our ability to change and adapt with the times has ensured our position as a leading media and telecommunications company. 
Looking ahead, we have an excellent management team with decades of cable experience and I have tremendous confidence that, together, we will build on this already strong foundation to continue delivering value for both our customers and our shareholders. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Seibert."
25933,145610626,266601,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2012",2012-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we gained 20,300 high speed data customers and 30,500 voice customers, while Basic Video Customers declined by 14,000. Of these amounts, the Optimum West contribution was 7,000 high speed",1489,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we gained 20,300 high speed data customers and 30,500 voice customers, while Basic Video Customers declined by 14,000. Of these amounts, the Optimum West contribution was 7,000 high speed data customers, 8,000 voice customers and 600 Basic Video Customers. All of these quarterly changes in total company customer accounts compared favorably with both third quarter of 2011, as well as the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Average revenue per video customer across all properties was $154.10 in the fourth quarter, a sequential increase of $2.39. RPS in the Eastern properties rose by more than $2 in the quarter and the West property saw an increase in RPS of over $5. 
Turning to our financials. Most of you will recall that we acquired Bresnan Communications in December of 2010. As a result, while our 2011 fourth quarter numbers contain results from these properties for the entire quarter, the 2010 fourth quarter reflects approximately 2 weeks of their results. 
That said, Cable revenue for the quarter was up 8% over the prior year, 1.2% after excluding Bresnan. AOCF for the Cable segment grew by 17% versus the prior year and would have been up 8% excluding Bresnan. As Jim mentioned, there were a number of unusual items, which affected the quarter. 
Page 4 of the earnings release contains these details, which include the impacts from the October snowstorm, compensation and executive separation adjustments and a favorable programming adjustment. If we were to exclude each of these items, as well as the impact of Optimum West, the Cable segment AOCF would have reflected a decline of 1.8% in the quarter and the total company consolidated AOCF would have been higher by 0.8%. 
The Cable operating margin after adjusting for these items was 39.1%, down slightly from prior year primarily due to programming cost increases.  
Advertising revenue in the fourth quarter was flat compared with last year's fourth quarter. Ad sales in the East were down by roughly 7%, reflecting the strong political advertising market in the fourth quarter of 2010. Nonpolitical ad sales were up 8% in the quarter in the core Cablevision footprint. The SME business continues to withstand pressure from the tough economy, as well as competition. The SME product bundle typically includes data and voice services, and today's new SME customers taking both products are paying more than $140 per month on average. 
Our Small Business customers are enjoying more and more benefits in their product bundle. We have developed partnerships with top suppliers such as FedEx, Sprint and ADP to provide pre-negotiated offers on services that are essential to small businesses. In doing so, we have enhanced what was already considered an attractive proposition to our Small Business customers. 
At Optimum Lightpath, we reached a milestone in the fourth quarter by connecting to our 5,000th building. Revenue in the quarter was up 9.6%, and AOCF increased 24% over the prior year period. Excluding the unusual items I referenced earlier, AOCF was up 12% versus the prior year period. 
Optimum West is making progress. At year end, digital penetration reached 77% of basic subs, high-speed data subs as a percent of passings reached 40% and voice subs ended the year with 23% of passings. The average revenue per sub for the West properties was $134.60 in the fourth quarter which, as I mentioned, is up over $5 sequentially. So we are seeing progress but believe that there is potential for more top line growth as we continue to sell in more products to existing customers, as well as add new customers. The AOCF margin for the West properties was 31.1% in the fourth quarter. As we've mentioned in the past, we are currently disputing a property tax assessment but have to make certain protest payments in the meantime. We made a $5.5 million protest payment in the fourth quarter, which adversely affected our margins. Capital spending for the West was $24 million in the quarter as we purchased CPE to support our unit growth and extended a fiber ring, which now connects about 85% of our Optimum West customers. 
Cable capital spending in the fourth quarter was $177 million including the Optimum West properties. For the full year, total Cable capital spending was $654 million. Embedded in our 2011 capital amounts are expenditures needed to pursue more and better products for our customers, as well as a better customer experience. 
Certain of these expenditures are expected to continue into 2012, including the all-digital rollout in the East, which is currently scheduled to be complete by this summer; the continuing rollout of DVR Plus; our broadband network augmentation project intended to enhance broadband speeds, which should be completed by the end of the first quarter. And Jim mentioned our focus on WiFi. We have the largest WiFi network in the country with 35,000 locations throughout our footprint. Usage has increased by over 300% in the past year and over 1 million devices have been registered through automatic sign-in. So as Jim noted, 2012 will be a year of investment for Cablevision. I will reiterate that we are accelerating several capital projects and expect to see higher capital spending in 2012 than we incurred in 2011, and we expect that free cash flow will be lower in 2012 than what was generated in 2011. 
Now turning to the company's financial position. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the 12 months ended December 31 was $583 million and compares with the 2010 full year free cash flow of $536 million, an increase of 8.7%. Free cash flow per share for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, was $2.05, a 15% increase compared with free cash flow per share of $1.78 in the prior year period. At year end, the company's consolidated cash position was $612 million and net debt was $10.1 billion. We had $1.35 billion undrawn and available under the $1.41 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings. 
In the fourth quarter, we executed a number of successful financing transactions to continue to extend our debt maturity profile. First, we entered into an extended term loan A facility, which provided $600 million of term loans priced at LIBOR plus 200 basis points with a final maturity date of December 2016. The proceeds from the term loan A facility were used to make a voluntary prepayment of $339 million of the unextended term loan A and B loans maturing during the 2012-2013 time frame. 
We then issued $1 billion of 6 3/4% senior notes due 2021. Proceeds from this issuance were used to tender for approximately $682 million of CSC Holdings senior notes due in 2012, 2014 and 2015. In addition to the tender transaction, we repurchased approximately $86 million of the 6 3/4% senior notes in an open market transaction. 
In calculating our total company leverage ratio, annual AOCF is determined using the latest quarter annualized. There are no exclusions for the items, which I addressed earlier. As a result, at December 31, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.1x. Without the unusual items, the consolidated ratio would have been approximately 4.5x, which we consider to be a more representative measure of our total company financial leverage. 
The CSC Holdings restricted group leverage ratio was 3.6x. At year end, Bresnan net debt was approximately $1 billion, with $75 million undrawn and available on its revolving credit facility. The leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.9x, down from third quarter ratio of 7x. We have mentioned in the past, that our target leverage ratio for the total company has been roughly 4.5x, going as high 5x under certain circumstances. 
As we look at our 2012 initiatives coupled with higher programming costs, we do not anticipate AOCF growth in 2012. As a result, at times, we could see leverage in 2012 exceeding 5x. While this is higher than our previous target, we are confident that we can manage our operations with this level of debt and we'll continue to monitor our debt levels closely. 
The Cablevision NOL was $1.7 billion at December 31. We have taken advantage of the bonus depreciations provision in 2010 and 2011, and intend to do so again in 2012 to the extent we can, which lengthens the timing for our NOL utilization. 
Turning to the company's stock repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares of Cablevision stock, totaling $67.4 million. This represents approximately 2% of the company's outstanding Class A shares. 
From inception of the program through the end of 2011, we have repurchased 31.7 million shares. And our total outstanding Class A shares have decreased from $251 million to $220 million or roughly 12.6%. At December 31, we had $144 million remaining under our existing repurchase authorization. We currently expect to continue our repurchase program in the coming quarter.

And this year in particular, and I'll walk you through the programming amortization adjustment we had. This year, in particular, our programming expenses for 2011 are reduced by the amount of the programming adjustment, the $42.9 million. So that will make the year-to-year comparisons seem more draconian than they actually are. And the programming adjustment is very simple. We were out of contract with several programmers and we entered into new agreements with those programmers this year. Over the period of time that we were out of contract, we accrued our programming expenses at higher rates than we actually ultimately ended up paying for that programming, so that resulted in the reversal of $42.9 million."

25933,145610626,275648,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2012",2012-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Pat, and good morning. 2011 marked the substantial completion of a multiyear, multistep process to enhance shareholder value. As most of you may recall, in August of 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized management to ex",1197,"Thank you, Pat, and good morning. 2011 marked the substantial completion of a multiyear, multistep process to enhance shareholder value. As most of you may recall, in August of 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized management to explore several options to enhance the value of Cablevision for its shareholders. The spinoff of AMC last year marked another significant milestone in this process, which also included the spinoff of MSG, as well as the initiation of a quarterly dividend and a share repurchase program. Since that time, we have also refinanced and extended the maturities of much of our debt portfolio and completed the acquisition of the Bresnan properties, an acquisition that we continue to believe will be accretive to shareholder value. 
We remain focused on striking the right balance between returning capital to our shareholders and investing capital in the business as this balance is a critical component of our future success. It is worth noting that since 2008, despite substantially reducing the size and cash flows of the company by spinning off AMC and MSG, Cablevision has not only maintained its quarterly dividend but we have increased it twice to its current level of $0.15 per share. And last week, our Board of Directors approved another $0.15 per share dividend payable at the end of March. 
In 2011, Cablevision also remain committed to its share repurchase program, buying back more than 20 million shares of Class A stock during the year. 
Now turning to our operating results. Despite a tough economy and competitive pressures, we continue to grow our high speed data and voice customers and our overall average revenue per subscriber. While we lost video subscribers in the quarter, we are taking steps to maintain or increase our video sub base in the future. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, Cablevision's consolidated revenue grew 7.3% and AOCF increased 21%. The company's results reflect a number of unusual items, which Gregg will talk more about shortly. Excluding these items, revenue was up 1% and AOCF grew 0.8% for the quarter. 
During our last call, we talked about the emergence of some underlying trends with regard to certain subscriber metrics, including healthy increases in high speed data and voice customers, as well as reduced video subscriber losses. This continued with our fourth quarter results. 
We also saw a positive momentum with our Bresnan properties, which we are now calling Optimum West. For the fourth quarter, these properties reported subscriber increases across basic video, high speed data and voice services. 
Cablevision generated approximately $583 million in free cash flow in 2011 and an 8.7% improvement over 2010. Over the course of the year, we also continued to rollout new products and service offerings to enhance our customers experience such as our in home mobile apps and Ultimate Triple Play offer. At the same time, we remain focused on enhancing our existing products. 
As you know, we were disappointed in the results of an FCC test conducted last spring on broadband speeds. Since then, we have invested the necessary time and resources to make significant improvements. As a result, according to a recent test conducted by the same broadband testing firm, our broadband speeds now exceed our advertised speeds throughout all periods of the day. Maintaining an industry leading level of service is critical for Cablevision. Today, our customers expect more from us than ever before. 
And in 2012, we will strive to do 2 things: one, meet and more importantly, exceed the expectations of our existing customers. Two, prove to those who are making choices about a new provider that no one offers better products or better service than Cablevision. We will achieve this by continuing to focus on improving the product experience for our customers, whether it's adding more content to our VOD offering or rolling out our RS DVR product, we have one goal, to ensure that our products are better than anything else on the market. 
Looking ahead, one very important product for the company is WiFi. Wireless data usage is growing as more and more of our customers want to take their television and computer experience mobile with devices such as iPads and smartphones. We think our WiFi network is better equipped to handle this usage, and that this wireless extension of our Optimum Online service will provide a real advantage for the company as we continue to expand our WiFi coverage. Another product that has experienced increased usage is our Optimum app for iPad, iPod Touch and iPhone devices. 
In the fourth quarter alone, users of the app increased 70% and now exceed 500,000. Cablevision will soon launch the HBO GO and MAX GO products throughout our footprint, which will allow our customers to enjoy this programming on mobile devices in or out of the home. And we expect more and more programming services to be added in the coming months. 
In addition to improving our products, we want to improve our relationship with our existing customers and ensure that they know that we value them and their business. We will also continue to explore fresh ways to attract new customers. 
One quick example of this is a new program that offers people, who are moving into Cablevision areas, the opportunity for next day installation. The early results from the pilot tests reflect higher completed sales than the prior company average. This program will be rolled out across our East footprint by the end of the first quarter. 
I want to emphasize that at its core, our business is strong. Our suite of products is in high demand and we will work to continue to grow these products to meet our customers' evolving needs. This means that 2012 will be a year of investment, both in capital spending and in operating execution. In fact, we expect to accelerate certain 2013 projects into this current year, resulting in higher capital expenditures in 2012. We will be smart and efficient in this process, which should set us on a path towards a stronger 2013 and beyond. We will also remain focused on pricing, packaging and the overall quality of our service. 
Cablevision has not announced a 2012 rate increase. While in the short term, this is expected to impact our revenue and AOCF growth, we believe that actions like this will not go unnoticed by our customers and ultimately, are healthy for the long term. Our intention is to maintain discipline in our pricing and packaging. So though you may not have a rate increase this year, we have eliminated the very low price offers that have been in the market in the past few years. 
Cablevision has been in the business for nearly 40 years. Our ability to change and adapt with the times has ensured our position as a leading media and telecommunications company. 
Looking ahead, we have an excellent management team with decades of cable experience and I have tremendous confidence that, together, we will build on this already strong foundation to continue delivering value for both our customers and our shareholders. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Seibert."
25933,145610626,275648,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2012",2012-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we gained 20,300 high speed data customers and 30,500 voice customers, while Basic Video Customers declined by 14,000. Of these amounts, the Optimum West contribution was 7,000 high speed",1489,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we gained 20,300 high speed data customers and 30,500 voice customers, while Basic Video Customers declined by 14,000. Of these amounts, the Optimum West contribution was 7,000 high speed data customers, 8,000 voice customers and 600 Basic Video Customers. All of these quarterly changes in total company customer accounts compared favorably with both third quarter of 2011, as well as the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Average revenue per video customer across all properties was $154.10 in the fourth quarter, a sequential increase of $2.39. RPS in the Eastern properties rose by more than $2 in the quarter and the West property saw an increase in RPS of over $5. 
Turning to our financials. Most of you will recall that we acquired Bresnan Communications in December of 2010. As a result, while our 2011 fourth quarter numbers contain results from these properties for the entire quarter, the 2010 fourth quarter reflects approximately 2 weeks of their results. 
That said, Cable revenue for the quarter was up 8% over the prior year, 1.2% after excluding Bresnan. AOCF for the Cable segment grew by 17% versus the prior year and would have been up 8% excluding Bresnan. As Jim mentioned, there were a number of unusual items, which affected the quarter. 
Page 4 of the earnings release contains these details, which include the impacts from the October snowstorm, compensation and executive separation adjustments and a favorable programming adjustment. If we were to exclude each of these items, as well as the impact of Optimum West, the Cable segment AOCF would have reflected a decline of 1.8% in the quarter and the total company consolidated AOCF would have been higher by 0.8%. 
The Cable operating margin after adjusting for these items was 39.1%, down slightly from prior year primarily due to programming cost increases.  
Advertising revenue in the fourth quarter was flat compared with last year's fourth quarter. Ad sales in the East were down by roughly 7%, reflecting the strong political advertising market in the fourth quarter of 2010. Nonpolitical ad sales were up 8% in the quarter in the core Cablevision footprint. The SME business continues to withstand pressure from the tough economy, as well as competition. The SME product bundle typically includes data and voice services, and today's new SME customers taking both products are paying more than $140 per month on average. 
Our Small Business customers are enjoying more and more benefits in their product bundle. We have developed partnerships with top suppliers such as FedEx, Sprint and ADP to provide pre-negotiated offers on services that are essential to small businesses. In doing so, we have enhanced what was already considered an attractive proposition to our Small Business customers. 
At Optimum Lightpath, we reached a milestone in the fourth quarter by connecting to our 5,000th building. Revenue in the quarter was up 9.6%, and AOCF increased 24% over the prior year period. Excluding the unusual items I referenced earlier, AOCF was up 12% versus the prior year period. 
Optimum West is making progress. At year end, digital penetration reached 77% of basic subs, high-speed data subs as a percent of passings reached 40% and voice subs ended the year with 23% of passings. The average revenue per sub for the West properties was $134.60 in the fourth quarter which, as I mentioned, is up over $5 sequentially. So we are seeing progress but believe that there is potential for more top line growth as we continue to sell in more products to existing customers, as well as add new customers. The AOCF margin for the West properties was 31.1% in the fourth quarter. As we've mentioned in the past, we are currently disputing a property tax assessment but have to make certain protest payments in the meantime. We made a $5.5 million protest payment in the fourth quarter, which adversely affected our margins. Capital spending for the West was $24 million in the quarter as we purchased CPE to support our unit growth and extended a fiber ring, which now connects about 85% of our Optimum West customers. 
Cable capital spending in the fourth quarter was $177 million including the Optimum West properties. For the full year, total Cable capital spending was $654 million. Embedded in our 2011 capital amounts are expenditures needed to pursue more and better products for our customers, as well as a better customer experience. 
Certain of these expenditures are expected to continue into 2012, including the all-digital rollout in the East, which is currently scheduled to be complete by this summer; the continuing rollout of DVR Plus; our broadband network augmentation project intended to enhance broadband speeds, which should be completed by the end of the first quarter. And Jim mentioned our focus on WiFi. We have the largest WiFi network in the country with 35,000 locations throughout our footprint. Usage has increased by over 300% in the past year and over 1 million devices have been registered through automatic sign-in. So as Jim noted, 2012 will be a year of investment for Cablevision. I will reiterate that we are accelerating several capital projects and expect to see higher capital spending in 2012 than we incurred in 2011, and we expect that free cash flow will be lower in 2012 than what was generated in 2011. 
Now turning to the company's financial position. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the 12 months ended December 31 was $583 million and compares with the 2010 full year free cash flow of $536 million, an increase of 8.7%. Free cash flow per share for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, was $2.05, a 15% increase compared with free cash flow per share of $1.78 in the prior year period. At year end, the company's consolidated cash position was $612 million and net debt was $10.1 billion. We had $1.35 billion undrawn and available under the $1.41 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings. 
In the fourth quarter, we executed a number of successful financing transactions to continue to extend our debt maturity profile. First, we entered into an extended term loan A facility, which provided $600 million of term loans priced at LIBOR plus 200 basis points with a final maturity date of December 2016. The proceeds from the term loan A facility were used to make a voluntary prepayment of $339 million of the unextended term loan A and B loans maturing during the 2012-2013 time frame. 
We then issued $1 billion of 6 3/4% senior notes due 2021. Proceeds from this issuance were used to tender for approximately $682 million of CSC Holdings senior notes due in 2012, 2014 and 2015. In addition to the tender transaction, we repurchased approximately $86 million of the 6 3/4% senior notes in an open market transaction. 
In calculating our total company leverage ratio, annual AOCF is determined using the latest quarter annualized. There are no exclusions for the items, which I addressed earlier. As a result, at December 31, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.1x. Without the unusual items, the consolidated ratio would have been approximately 4.5x, which we consider to be a more representative measure of our total company financial leverage. 
The CSC Holdings restricted group leverage ratio was 3.6x. At year end, Bresnan net debt was approximately $1 billion, with $75 million undrawn and available on its revolving credit facility. The leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.9x, down from third quarter ratio of 7x. We have mentioned in the past, that our target leverage ratio for the total company has been roughly 4.5x, going as high 5x under certain circumstances. 
As we look at our 2012 initiatives coupled with higher programming costs, we do not anticipate AOCF growth in 2012. As a result, at times, we could see leverage in 2012 exceeding 5x. While this is higher than our previous target, we are confident that we can manage our operations with this level of debt and we'll continue to monitor our debt levels closely. 
The Cablevision NOL was $1.7 billion at December 31. We have taken advantage of the bonus depreciations provision in 2010 and 2011, and intend to do so again in 2012 to the extent we can, which lengthens the timing for our NOL utilization. 
Turning to the company's stock repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares of Cablevision stock, totaling $67.4 million. This represents approximately 2% of the company's outstanding Class A shares. 
From inception of the program through the end of 2011, we have repurchased 31.7 million shares. And our total outstanding Class A shares have decreased from $251 million to $220 million or roughly 12.6%. At December 31, we had $144 million remaining under our existing repurchase authorization. We currently expect to continue our repurchase program in the coming quarter.

So going forward, obviously, expect programming costs to be going up certainly mid- to high-single digit percentages. And this year in particular, and I'll walk you through the programming amortization adjustment we had. This year, in particular, our programming expenses for 2011 are reduced by the amount of the programming adjustment, the $42.9 million. So that will make the year-to-year comparisons seem more draconian than they actually are. And the programming adjustment is very simple. We were out of contract with several programmers and we entered into new agreements with those programmers this year. Over the period of time that we were out of contract, we accrued our programming expenses at higher rates than we actually ultimately ended up paying for that programming, so that resulted in the reversal of $42.9 million."

25933,145610626,283690,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2012",2012-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Pat, and good morning. 2011 marked the substantial completion of a multiyear, multistep process to enhance shareholder value.

As most of you may recall, in August of 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized management to explore several options to enhance the value of Cablevision for its shareholders. The spinoff of AMC last year marked another significant milestone in this process, which also included the spinoff of MSG, as well as the initiation of a quarterly dividend and a share repurchase program. Since that time, we have also refinanced and extended the maturities of much of our debt portfolio and completed the acquisition of the Bresnan properties, an acquisition that we continue to believe will be accretive to shareholder value. 
We remain focused on striking the right balance between returning capital to our shareholders and investing capital in the business as this balance is a critical component of our future success. It is worth noting that since 2008, despite substantially reducing the size and cash flows of the company by spinning off AMC and MSG, Cablevision has not only maintained its quarterly dividend but we have increased it twice to its current level of $0.15 per share. And last week, our Board of Directors approved another $0.15 per share dividend payable at the end of March. 
In 2011, Cablevision also remained committed to its share repurchase program, buying back more than 20 million shares of Class A stock during the year. 
Now turning to our operating results. Despite a tough economy and competitive pressures, we continue to grow our high speed data and voice customers and our overall average revenue per subscriber. While we lost video subscribers in the quarter, we are taking steps to maintain or increase our video sub base in the future. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, Cablevision's consolidated revenue grew 7.3% and AOCF increased 21%. The company's results reflect a number of unusual items, which Gregg will talk more about shortly. Excluding these items, revenue was up 1% and AOCF grew 0.8% for the quarter. 
During our last call, we talked about the emergence of some underlying trends with regard to certain subscriber metrics, including healthy increases in high speed data and voice customers, as well as reduced video subscriber losses. This continued with our fourth quarter results. 
We also saw positive momentum with our Bresnan properties, which we are now calling Optimum West. For the fourth quarter, these properties reported subscriber increases across basic video, high speed data and voice services. 
Cablevision generated approximately $583 million in free cash flow in 2011, an 8.7% improvement over 2010. Over the course of the year, we also continued to roll out new products and service offerings to enhance our customers' experience, such as our in-home mobile apps and Ultimate Triple Play offer. At the same time, we remain focused on enhancing our existing products. 
As you know, we were disappointed in the results of an FCC test conducted last spring on broadband speeds. Since then, we have invested the necessary time and resources to make significant improvements. As a result, according to a recent test conducted by the same broadband testing firm, our broadband speeds now exceed our advertised speeds throughout all periods of the day. Maintaining an industry-leading level of service is critical for Cablevision. Today, our customers expect more from us than ever before. 
And in 2012, we will strive to do 2 things: one, meet and more importantly, exceed the expectations of our existing customers; two, prove to those who are making choices about a new provider that no one offers better products or better service than Cablevision. We will achieve this by continuing to focus on improving the product experience for our customers, whether it's adding more content to our VOD offering or rolling out our RS DVR product, we have one goal, to ensure that our products are better than anything else on the market. 
Looking ahead, one very important product for the company is WiFi. Wireless data usage is growing as more and more of our customers want to take their television and computer experience mobile with devices such as iPads and smartphones. We think our WiFi network is better equipped to handle this usage, and that this wireless extension of our Optimum Online service will provide a real advantage for the company as we continue to expand our WiFi coverage. Another product that has experienced increased usage is our Optimum app for iPad, iPod Touch and iPhone devices. 
In the fourth quarter alone, users of the app increased 70% and now exceed 500,000. Cablevision will soon launch the HBO GO and MAX GO products throughout our footprint, which will allow our customers to enjoy this programming on mobile devices in or out of the home. And we expect more and more programming services to be added in the coming months. 
In addition to improving our products, we want to improve our relationship with our existing customers and ensure that they know that we value them and their business. We will also continue to explore fresh ways to attract new customers. 
One quick example of this is a new program that offers people who are moving into Cablevision areas the opportunity for next day installation. The early results from the pilot tests reflect higher completed sales than the prior company average. This program will be rolled out across our East footprint by the end of the first quarter. 
I want to emphasize that at its core, our business is strong. Our suite of products is in high demand and we will work to continue to grow these products to meet our customers' evolving needs. This means that 2012 will be a year of investment, both in capital spending and in operating execution. In fact, we expect to accelerate certain 2013 projects into this current year, resulting in higher capital expenditures in 2012. We will be smart and efficient in this process, which should set us on a path towards a stronger 2013 and beyond. We will also remain focused on pricing, packaging and the overall quality of our service. 
Cablevision has not announced a 2012 rate increase. While in the short term, this is expected to impact our revenue and AOCF growth, we believe that actions like this will not go unnoticed by our customers and ultimately, are healthy for the long term. Our intention is to maintain discipline in our pricing and packaging. So though you may not have a rate increase this year, we have eliminated the very low price offers that have been in the market in the past few years. 
Cablevision has been in the business for nearly 40 years. Our ability to change and adapt with the times has ensured our position as a leading media and telecommunications company. 
Looking ahead, we have an excellent management team with decades of cable experience and I have tremendous confidence that, together, we will build on this already strong foundation to continue delivering value for both our customers and our shareholders. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Seibert."
25933,145610626,283690,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2012",2012-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we gained 20,300 high speed data customers and 30,500 voice customers, while Basic Video Customers declined by 14,000. Of these amounts, the Optimum West contribution was 7,000 high speed",1489,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we gained 20,300 high speed data customers and 30,500 voice customers, while Basic Video Customers declined by 14,000. Of these amounts, the Optimum West contribution was 7,000 high speed data customers, 8,000 voice customers and 600 Basic Video Customers. All of these quarterly changes in total company customer accounts compared favorably with both third quarter of 2011, as well as the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Average revenue per video customer across all properties was $154.10 in the fourth quarter, a sequential increase of $2.39. RPS in the Eastern properties rose by more than $2 in the quarter and the West property saw an increase in RPS of over $5. 
Turning to our financials. Most of you will recall that we acquired Bresnan Communications in December of 2010. As a result, while our 2011 fourth quarter numbers contain results from these properties for the entire quarter, the 2010 fourth quarter reflects approximately 2 weeks of their results. 
That said, Cable revenue for the quarter was up 8% over the prior year, 1.2% after excluding Bresnan. AOCF for the Cable segment grew by 17% versus the prior year and would have been up 8% excluding Bresnan. As Jim mentioned, there were a number of unusual items, which affected the quarter. 
Page 4 of the earnings release contains these details, which include the impacts from the October snowstorm, compensation and executive separation adjustments and a favorable programming adjustment. If we were to exclude each of these items, as well as the impact of Optimum West, the Cable segment AOCF would have reflected a decline of 1.8% in the quarter and the total company consolidated AOCF would have been higher by 0.8%. 
The Cable operating margin after adjusting for these items was 39.1%, down slightly from prior year primarily due to programming cost increases.  
Advertising revenue in the fourth quarter was flat compared with last year's fourth quarter. Ad sales in the East were down by roughly 7%, reflecting the strong political advertising market in the fourth quarter of 2010. Nonpolitical ad sales were up 8% in the quarter in the core Cablevision footprint. The SME business continues to withstand pressure from the tough economy, as well as competition. The SME product bundle typically includes data and voice services, and today's new SME customers taking both products are paying more than $140 per month on average. 
Our Small Business customers are enjoying more and more benefits in their product bundle. We have developed partnerships with top suppliers such as FedEx, Sprint and ADP to provide pre-negotiated offers on services that are essential to small businesses. In doing so, we have enhanced what was already considered an attractive proposition to our Small Business customers. 
At Optimum Lightpath, we reached a milestone in the fourth quarter by connecting to our 5,000th building. Revenue in the quarter was up 9.6%, and AOCF increased 24% over the prior year period. Excluding the unusual items I referenced earlier, AOCF was up 12% versus the prior year period. 
Optimum West is making progress. At year end, digital penetration reached 77% of basic subs, high-speed data subs as a percent of passings reached 40% and voice subs ended the year with 23% of passings. The average revenue per sub for the West properties was $134.60 in the fourth quarter which, as I mentioned, is up over $5 sequentially. So we are seeing progress but believe that there is potential for more top line growth as we continue to sell in more products to existing customers, as well as add new customers. The AOCF margin for the West properties was 31.1% in the fourth quarter. As we've mentioned in the past, we are currently disputing a property tax assessment but have to make certain protest payments in the meantime. We made a $5.5 million protest payment in the fourth quarter, which adversely affected our margins. Capital spending for the West was $24 million in the quarter as we purchased CPE to support our unit growth and extended a fiber ring, which now connects about 85% of our Optimum West customers. 
Cable capital spending in the fourth quarter was $177 million including the Optimum West properties. For the full year, total Cable capital spending was $654 million. Embedded in our 2011 capital amounts are expenditures needed to pursue more and better products for our customers, as well as a better customer experience. 
Certain of these expenditures are expected to continue into 2012, including the all-digital rollout in the East, which is currently scheduled to be complete by this summer; the continuing rollout of DVR Plus; our broadband network augmentation project intended to enhance broadband speeds, which should be completed by the end of the first quarter. And Jim mentioned our focus on WiFi. We have the largest WiFi network in the country with 35,000 locations throughout our footprint. Usage has increased by over 300% in the past year and over 1 million devices have been registered through automatic sign-in. So as Jim noted, 2012 will be a year of investment for Cablevision. I will reiterate that we are accelerating several capital projects and expect to see higher capital spending in 2012 than we incurred in 2011, and we expect that free cash flow will be lower in 2012 than what was generated in 2011. 
Now turning to the company's financial position. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the 12 months ended December 31 was $583 million and compares with the 2010 full year free cash flow of $536 million, an increase of 8.7%. Free cash flow per share for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, was $2.05, a 15% increase compared with free cash flow per share of $1.78 in the prior year period. At year end, the company's consolidated cash position was $612 million and net debt was $10.1 billion. We had $1.35 billion undrawn and available under the $1.41 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings. 
In the fourth quarter, we executed a number of successful financing transactions to continue to extend our debt maturity profile. First, we entered into an extended term loan A facility, which provided $600 million of term loans priced at LIBOR plus 200 basis points with a final maturity date of December 2016. The proceeds from the term loan A facility were used to make a voluntary prepayment of $339 million of the unextended term loan A and B loans maturing during the 2012-2013 time frame. 
We then issued $1 billion of 6 3/4% senior notes due 2021. Proceeds from this issuance were used to tender for approximately $682 million of CSC Holdings senior notes due in 2012, 2014 and 2015. In addition to the tender transaction, we repurchased approximately $86 million of the 6 3/4% senior notes in an open market transaction. 
In calculating our total company leverage ratio, annual AOCF is determined using the latest quarter annualized. There are no exclusions for the items, which I addressed earlier. As a result, at December 31, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.1x. Without the unusual items, the consolidated ratio would have been approximately 4.5x, which we consider to be a more representative measure of our total company financial leverage. 
The CSC Holdings restricted group leverage ratio was 3.6x. At year end, Bresnan net debt was approximately $1 billion, with $75 million undrawn and available on its revolving credit facility. The leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.9x, down from third quarter ratio of 7x. We have mentioned in the past, that our target leverage ratio for the total company has been roughly 4.5x, going as high 5x under certain circumstances. 
As we look at our 2012 initiatives coupled with higher programming costs, we do not anticipate AOCF growth in 2012. As a result, at times, we could see leverage in 2012 exceeding 5x. While this is higher than our previous target, we are confident that we can manage our operations with this level of debt and we'll continue to monitor our debt levels closely. 
The Cablevision NOL was $1.7 billion at December 31. We have taken advantage of the bonus depreciations provision in 2010 and 2011, and intend to do so again in 2012 to the extent we can, which lengthens the timing for our NOL utilization. 
Turning to the company's stock repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares of Cablevision stock, totaling $67.4 million. This represents approximately 2% of the company's outstanding Class A shares. 
From inception of the program through the end of 2011, we have repurchased 31.7 million shares. And our total outstanding Class A shares have decreased from $251 million to $220 million or roughly 12.6%. At December 31, we had $144 million remaining under our existing repurchase authorization. We currently expect to continue our repurchase program in the coming quarter. 
Operator, we'd now like to open the call for questions."

So going forward, obviously, expect programming costs to be going up certainly mid- to high-single digit percentages. And this year in particular, and I'll walk you through the programming amortization adjustment we had. This year, in particular, our programming expenses for 2011 are reduced by the amount of the programming adjustment, the $42.9 million. So that will make the year-to-year comparisons seem more draconian than they actually are. And the programming adjustment is very simple. We were out of contract with several programmers and we entered into new agreements with those programmers this year. Over the period of time that we were out of contract, we accrued our programming expenses at higher rates than we actually ultimately ended up paying for that programming, so that resulted in the reversal of $42.9 million."

During the first quarter of 2012, we made progress on our plans to improve the overall product and service experience for our customers. These plans are changing the way we approach our business and they are positioning the company for long-term success. 
As you will recall, during our 2011 fourth quarter earnings call, we explained that 2012 would be a year of investment, in terms of both capital spending and operate the execution. Our first quarter 2012 operating metrics reflect the first positive results of these efforts. Many of our key operating statistics reflect significant improvements to recent trends, including an increase in basic subscribers in Optimum Ease for the quarter.
These achievements did not come without a cost, or more properly stated, an investment. The quarter's financial performance principally reflects the near-term impact of the operating and capital investments that we are in the process of making. Only a portion of this investment is a form of capital expenditures. For example, as most of you are aware, Cablevision has not announced the 2012 rate increase, an action that would typically be reflected in our first quarter revenue.
Partly as a result of this position, first quarter 2012 total revenue was flat as compared with first quarter 2011. AOCF declined 7.6% versus the prior year period, primarily reflecting lower margins in our core Cable business.
As we discussed last quarter, we remain focused on striking the right balance between returning capital to our shareholders and investing in the business. As expected, our first quarter results reflect the decision to dedicate more of our resources to our infrastructure and other capital investments. This resulted in a significant year-over-year increase in capital expenditures for the quarter.
After accounting for this increase level investment and certain movements in working capital that Gregg will discuss in more detail, Cablevision generated approximately $18 million in free cash flow during the quarter. We continue to dedicate a portion of our resources to return on capital initiatives. We repurchased 4.1 million shares of stock in the first quarter, and today we announced that our board has authorized a $500 million increase in our stock repurchase program. The board also declared a $0.15 per share quarterly dividend, which is payable next month.
Turning to operations. Product -- turning to operations, product service operational improvements and enhancements continue to progress throughout the business. We completed our data network augmentation project at the end of the first quarter. This investment of over $140 million, which began in mid-2011, has more than doubled our broadband capacity. It also enhanced product performance, and most importantly, it positioned our network for future growth.
As you all know, WiFi is an important component of our overall broadband strategy. As of the end of the first quarter, nearly 30% of our Optimum Online customers have utilized our WiFi network, registering more than 1.3 million devices for automatic sign on. Over 50% of these devices are smartphones, a strong indication that our subscribers recognize the superior speed and value that our Optimum WiFi service provides versus their wireless data plans.
Our capital expenditure plans for 2012 include a substantial expansion of our WiFi network. This includes a rollout of additional indoor and outdoor hotspots that will expand both capacity and coverage in geographically targeted areas.
We are also continuing to enhance our mobile TV and TV to go offerings. The Optimum app for laptops was launched last month, and we are working to expand our Android app to include live TV viewing. Our goal is to enable live television viewing on all the screens within our customers homes. With our launch of HBO GO and MAX GO in March, we now offer 13 TV to go products with more launches planned for the coming months. We continue to work with our programming partners to extend our customers viewing experience beyond the home because we know that is what they desire, entertainment anywhere, anytime on the screen of their choice.
We plan to continue to evolve our services to meet this demand.
On the content side, we are substantially expanding our video-on-demand titles with plans in place to add titles throughout the year. We are currently testing our new user interface in employee homes, which will not only enhance the ability to search the growing library of titles, but substantially improve the overall Optimum viewing experience.
The conversion of our entire network to digital is on track to be completed later this year. This will allow us to rollout our RS-DVR products across our entire footprint, a product that we are continuing to improve as it's deployed.
The digitization of our network is a major strategic step for our company. Not only will this conversion free up tremendous bandwidth throughout our network and enable products like RS-DVR, that has the potential to improve the way we conduct our business.
Simply put, a fully digital network is an intelligent network. It enables a level of communication with and mothering network components that we have never had before. It allows us to reconsider how we identify and rectify network issues and outages, and how we respond to and resolve customer problems. These changes are neither simple nor entirely visible today, but I'm excited by the opportunities we have to make changes in the way we conduct our business and serve our customers.
Some changes will come quickly, others are going to take more time, but we expect them all to make a meaningful difference in the experience we provide our customers. And that this our goal: To develop a great relationship with our customers and by providing them with the best products and the best service possible.
As we pursue our plans to achieve this goal, there have been changes in our organization. Certain roles have changed, some have expanded, others are no longer needed. As a result, some executives have the departed the company but we've also hired a few senior level executives who will bringing fresh ideas in renewed energy to our efforts. These types of changes are inevitable as we continue to grow and transform the company.
I have a tremendous confidence in our management team and in our entire organization strongly believe that we have the right plan on a path to set this company on a path towards long-term success, delivering greater value for our customers and for our shareholders.
With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Seibert."
25933,184409662,296111,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we added over 7,000 video subscribers, including over 4,600 video subscribers in Optimum IS, our highest quarterly increase since the second quarter of 2008. We added approximately 42,000 h",926,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we added over 7,000 video subscribers, including over 4,600 video subscribers in Optimum IS, our highest quarterly increase since the second quarter of 2008. We added approximately 42,000 high-speed data customers and 42,000 voice customers companywide, levels last achieved in the first quarter of 2010. 
Average revenue per video customer, across all properties, was $152.53 in the first quarter, an increase of $2.78 as compared to the prior year period. RPS and Optimum IS increased by approximately $2. However, Optimum East RPS declined sequentially. This decline was principally related to seasonally lower first quarter advertising revenue, lower pay-per-view boxing revenue and the impact of certain promotional pricing.
As compared to the prior year, Cable revenue for the quarter was essentially flat. Cable revenue was down 1.5% at Optimum East, principally reflecting the year-over-year reduction in video subscribers, the absence of a rate increase and the impact of certain promotional pricing, partially offset by additional data and voice subscribers. In addition, total Cable advertising revenue in the first quarter was up 4.1% compared with last year's first quarter, reflecting a 5% increase in Optimum East.
AOCF for the Cable business declined by 8.2% overall, declining 9.8% in Optimum East. As Jim mentioned, the decline in Optimum East AOCF principally reflects the modest decline in revenue and a decline in AOCF margin. The principal elements of the margin decline were an increase in programming cost and an increase in certain operating expenses.
The first quarter of Optimum East AOCF margin was 36.1%, down from 39.8% during the prior year quarter. Optimum West has continued to make progress. Each of Optimum West subscriber metrics reflects the highest level of quarterly net additions since the acquisition. Average revenue per sub for the West properties was $135.52 in the first quarter, up over $10 since the first quarter of last year. 
Revenue was up 7.5% in Optimum West and AOCF increased by 15.8%. The AOCF margin for the West properties was 33.8% in the first quarter.
Total capital spending in the first quarter was $216 million, reflecting a $55 million increase in Optimum East. The increase in first quarter capital expenditures in Optimum East principally reflects investments in our broadband data network, purchases of set-top boxes and other equipment primarily related to the digitization of our Cable network, investments in equipment to enhance our ability to monitor our network and investments in a number of software projects.
Capital spending for Optimum West was $27.7 million in the quarter, including over $10 million related to our investment in the fiber ring connecting our systems.
We expect 2012 quarterly capital expenditures to continue to be significantly higher than during the comparable 2011 period, at least through the third quarter of this year.
At Optimum way past, revenue increased 2.9% as compared to the first quarter of last year. Ethernet revenue grew 11.1% and overall revenue growth was dampened by declines in other revenue. Operating expenses increased 4.6%, principally to support the growth in Ethernet revenues. Overall AOCF increased by 7/10 of a percent over the prior year period.
Now turning to the company's financial position. Free cash flow from operations for the 3 months ended March 31 was $18 million, a substantial decline from prior year period. As Jim noted, this quarter's financial performance reflects a reallocation of resources to internal investments. In addition, first quarter free cash flow was also impacted by a significant change in working capital. The first quarter, was typically characterized by a large use of working capital, including cash payments relating to our compensation plans. However, the first quarter of 2012 also included a number of other uses of working capital, including payments relating to certain programming settlements as well as certain pension and severance payments.
The company's first quarter consolidated cash position was $494 million, and net debt was $10.2 billion. We had $1.1 billion under the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings. During the quarter the $159 million undrawn on extended component of our revolving credit facility. 
In calculating our total company leverage ratio, annual AOCF is determined using the latest quarter annualized. As a result, March 31, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 5x. The CSC Holdings Restricted Group leverage ratio was 3.7x. 
At year end, present net debt was approximately $1 billion with $75 million undrawn and available on its revolving credit facility. The leverage ratio from for the quarter was 6.7x down from fourth quarter ratio of 6.9x. We continue to be confident that we can manage our operations with this level of debt and we'll continue to monitor our debt levels closely.
Turning to Cablevision's stock repurchase program, in the first quarter we purchased approximately 4.1 million shares for a $59.2 million. From inception of the program through the end of the first quarter, we have repurchased $35.7 million Class A shares, significantly reducing the total outstanding shares by approximately 14%. At March 31, we had $85 million remaining under the program and as Jim has discussed, our board is authorized $500 million increase in program. We currently expect to continue our repurchase program in the current quarter.
Finally, as we execute in our plan to position Cablevision for future success, we have determined that it is an appropriate time to explore potential strategic alternatives for our Clearview sentiments business this process is in an early stage. We plan to conduct a thorough review of all potential alternatives.
Operator, we're now prepared to open the call to questions."

Next year, our amortization is $150 million on the term loans, and the next real maturity of any significance that we have to deal with is the new state maturity, which I believe is the end of July or beginning of August of next year. It's roughly $650 million in size. We have the ability to refinance it at a lower level than $650 million under the orders of the agreement that we have with that we have with Tribune. And those are significant maturities over the next few years. And I have no present concern about any issues in refinancing those. As I think you were pointing out our liquidity position is very strong. We have over $400 million worth of cash on the back as of the end of the last quarter, in fact closer to $500 million and most of our $1.25 billion revolver is undrawn. And I don't see any revolver draws coming in the immediate future. So liquidity is quite strong. On Clearview, we have 45 locations for Clearview with a total of 230 screens. And we don't disclose the EBITDA on Clearview. But overall, including corporate allocations, it's a negative number and it's one of the reasons we're looking at the alternatives for it. We think there are others looking at more of the asset."

And as we look forward, we're quite hopeful about being able to continue that type of the type of success. In terms of the capital expenditure side of the equation, we have some projects, which as Jim's pointed out, we needed a network augmentation. We've got the Sandoz data from the SEC that was really a bit of a wake-up call in terms of the network. We now completed that augmentation. Our network is up and efficient in a way that it should be. But as we're looking forward, as we're looking quarter-over-quarter changes and when we're spending the capital it's going into customer premises equipment, which is higher as going into support and. Additionally, as we get further into the year, it's going to be going into increases on the RS-DVR side and to support the digitization effort.

The reason for re-upping now is that we continued our purchases into the beginning of this quarter during our winter period. And our actual authorization as of today is down to around $70 million. I believe it's best practice to discuss repurchases at the time of earnings calls as opposed to just showing up on a random day with an increase in the authorization. So I think that we are committed to having an authorization in place and provides us with the flexibility to continue the current program or potentially to reduce the current program or to increase the current program. So it management an opportunity based upon where the stock price is and our views as to leverage, et cetera. So it was just the right time to do it. Normally, in this quarter we have raised our dividend in the past. The board made a decision this year not to do that. We've spun off AMC with a very substantial amount of AOCF, which is not here with a higher dividend. So in effect, there's actually been an effective dividend increase because of the AMC spent. So our balance goes back again to something Jim talked about a lot on our calls, which is a balance between investing in the business and returning capital to our shareholders. We're trying to be balanced in that regard. But at this point in time, the pendulum has shifted and we're investing on our business. And in terms of the year-over-year one-time costs, there was equal to about one point would be the approach. And in terms of cost reductions, we did mention before Clearview. I think we continued to look at our operations and Jim used the word a few minutes ago, efficiency. We are continuing to do is to look for efficiencies in our business, things like truck rolls, the way that we approach our work rules and business rules. But we're not embarking on any type of the organized cost-cutting at this point."

During the first quarter of 2012, we made progress on our plans to improve the overall product and service experience to our customers. These plans are changing the way we approach our business and they are positioning the company for long-term success. 
As you will recall, during our 2011 fourth quarter earnings call, we explained that 2012 would be a year of investment, in terms of both capital spending and operating execution. Our first quarter 2012 operating metrics reflect the first positive results of these efforts. Many of our key operating statistics reflect significant improvements to recent trends, including an increase in basic subscribers in Optimum East for the quarter.
Admittedly, these achievements did not come without a cost, or more properly stated, an investment. The quarter's financial performance principally reflects the near-term impact of the operating and capital investments that we are in the process of making. Only a portion of this investment took the form of capital expenditures. For example, as most of you are aware, Cablevision has not announced the 2012 rate increase, an action that would typically be reflected in our first quarter revenue. Partly as a result of this decision, first quarter 2012 total revenue was flat as compared with the first quarter 2011. AOCF declined 7.6% versus the prior year period, primarily reflecting lower margins in our core cable business.
As we discussed last quarter, we remain focused on striking the right balance between returning capital to our shareholders and investing in the business. As expected, our first quarter results reflect the decision to dedicate more of our resources to our infrastructure and other capital investments. This resulted in a significant year-over-year increase in capital expenditures for the quarter.
After accounting for this increased level investment and certain movements in working capital that Gregg will discuss in more detail, Cablevision generated approximately $18 million in free cash flow during the quarter. We continue to dedicate a portion of our resources to return of capital initiatives. We repurchased 4.1 million shares of stock in the first quarter. And today, we announced that our board has authorized a $500 million increase in our stock repurchase program. The board also declared a $0.15 per share quarterly dividend, which is payable next month.
Turning to operations. Product -- turning to operations. Product service operational improvements and enhancements continue to progress throughout the business. We completed our data network augmentation project at the end of the first quarter. This investment of over $140 million, which began in mid-2011, has more than doubled our broadband capacity. It also enhanced product performance. And most importantly, it positions our network for future growth.
As you all know, WiFi is an important component of our overall broadband strategy. As of the end of the first quarter, nearly 30% of our Optimum Online customers have utilized our WiFi network, registering more than 1.3 million devices for automatic sign-on. Over 50% of these devices are smartphones, a strong indication that our subscribers recognize the superior speed and value that our Optimum WiFi service provides versus their wireless data plans. Our capital expenditure plans for 2012 include a substantial expansion of our WiFi network. This includes a rollout of additional indoor and outdoor hotspots that will expand both capacity and coverage in geographically targeted areas.
We are also continuing to enhance our mobile TV and TV to GO offerings. The Optimum app for laptops was launched last month, and we are working to expand our Android app to include live TV viewing. Our goal is to enable live television viewing on all the screens within our customers' homes. With our launch of HBO GO and MAX GO in March, we now offer 13 TV to GO products with more launches planned for the coming months. We continue to work with our programming partners to extend our customers' viewing experience beyond the home because we know that is what they desire, entertainment anywhere, anytime on the screen of their choice. We plan to continue to evolve our services to meet this demand.
On the content side, we are substantially expanding our Video On Demand titles with plans in place to add titles throughout the year. We are currently testing our new user interface in employee homes, which will not only enhance the ability to search the growing library of titles, but substantially improve the overall Optimum viewing experience. The conversion of our entire network to digital is on track to be completed later this year. This will allow us to rollout our RS-DVR products across our entire footprint, a product that we are continuing to improve as it's deployed.
The digitization of our network is a major strategic step for our company. Not only will this conversion free up tremendous bandwidth throughout our network and enable products, like RS-DVR, that has the potential to improve the way we conduct our business. Simply put, a fully digital network is an intelligent network. It enables a level of communication width and monitoring of network components that we have never had before. It allows us to reconsider how we identify and rectify network issues and outages, and how we respond to and resolve customer problems. 
These changes are neither simple nor entirely visible today, but I'm excited by the opportunities we have to make changes in the way we conduct our business and serve our customers.  Some changes will come quickly, others are going to take more time, but we expect them all to make a meaningful difference in the experience we provide our customers. And that this our goal, to develop a great relationship with our customers by providing them with the best products and the best service possible.
As we pursue our plans to achieve this goal, there have been changes in our organization. Certain roles have changed, some have expanded, others are no longer needed. As a result, some executives have departed the company, but we've also hired a few senior-level executives, who are bringing fresh ideas and renewed energy to our efforts. These types of changes are inevitable as we continue to grow and transform the company.
I have a tremendous confidence in our management team and in our entire organization and strongly believe that we have the right plan in place to set this company on a path towards long-term success, delivering greater value for our customers and for our shareholders.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Seibert."
25933,184409662,296362,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we added over 7,000 video subscribers, including over 4,600 video subscribers in Optimum East, our highest quarterly increase since the second quarter of 2008. We added approximately 42,000",928,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we added over 7,000 video subscribers, including over 4,600 video subscribers in Optimum East, our highest quarterly increase since the second quarter of 2008. We added approximately 42,000 high-speed data customers and 42,000 voice customers company-wide, levels last achieved in the first quarter of 2010. 
Average revenue per video customer across all properties was $152.53 in the first quarter, an increase of $2.78 as compared to the prior year period. RPS and Optimum East increased by approximately $2. However, Optimum East RPS declined sequentially. This decline was principally related to seasonally lower first quarter advertising revenue, lower pay-per-view boxing revenue and the impact of certain promotional pricing.
As compared to the prior year, cable revenue for the quarter was essentially flat. Cable revenue was down 1.5% in Optimum East, principally reflecting the year-over-year reduction in video subscribers, the absence of a rate increase and the impact of certain promotional pricing, partially offset by additional data and voice subscribers. In addition, total cable advertising revenue in the first quarter was up 4.1% compared with last year's first quarter, reflecting a 5% increase in Optimum East.
AOCF for the cable business declined by 8.2% overall, declining 9.8% in Optimum East. As Jim mentioned, the decline in Optimum East AOCF principally reflects the modest decline in revenue and the decline in AOCF margin. The principal elements of the margin decline were an increase in programming cost and an increase in certain operating expenses. The first quarter of Optimum East AOCF margin was 36.1%, down from 39.8% during the prior year quarter. 
Optimum West has continued to make progress. Each of Optimum West subscriber metrics reflects the highest level of quarterly net additions since the acquisition. Average revenue per sub for the West properties was $135.52 in the first quarter, up over $10 since the first quarter of last year. Revenue was up 7.5% in Optimum West and AOCF increased by 15.8%. The AOCF margin for the West properties was 33.8% in the first quarter.
Total capital spending in the first quarter was $216 million, reflecting a $55 million increase in Optimum East. The increase in first quarter capital expenditures in Optimum East principally reflects investments in our broadband data network, purchases of set-top boxes and other equipment primarily related to the digitization of our cable network, investments in equipment to enhance our ability to monitor our network and investments in a number of software projects. Capital spending for Optimum West was $27.7 million in the quarter, including over $10 million related to our investment in the fiber ring connecting our systems. We expect 2012 quarterly capital expenditures to continue to be significantly higher than during the comparable 2011 period, at least through the third quarter of this year.
At Optimum Lightpath, revenue increased 2.9% as compared to the first quarter of last year. Ethernet revenue grew 11.1% and overall revenue growth was dampened by declines in other revenue. Operating expenses increased 4.6%, principally to support the growth in Ethernet revenues. Overall AOCF increased by 0.7% over the prior year period.
Now turning to the company's financial position. Free cash flow from operations for the 3 months ended March 31 was $18 million, a substantial decline from the prior year period. As Jim noted, this quarter's financial performance reflects a reallocation of resources to internal investments. In addition, first quarter free cash flow was also impacted by a significant change in working capital. The first quarter was typically characterized by a large use of working capital, including cash payments relating to our compensation plans. However, the first quarter of 2012 also included a number of other uses of working capital, including payments relating to certain programming settlements as well as certain pension and severance payments.
The company's first quarter consolidated cash position was $494 million and net debt was $10.2 billion. We had $1.19 billion undrawn and available under the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings. During the quarter, the $159 million undrawn nonextended component of our revolving credit facility matured.
In calculating our total company leverage ratio, annual AOCF is determined using the latest quarter annualized. As a result, of March 31, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 5x. The CSC Holdings Restricted Group leverage ratio was 3.7x.  At year end, present [ph] net debt was approximately $1 billion with $75 million undrawn and available on its revolving credit facility. The leverage ratio from for the quarter was 6.7x, down from fourth quarter ratio of 6.9x. We continue to be confident that we can manage our operations with this level of debt and we'll continue to monitor our debt levels closely.
Turning to Cablevision's stock repurchase program. In the first quarter, we purchased approximately 4.1 million shares for a $59.2 million. From inception of the program through the end of the first quarter, we have repurchased $35.7 million Class A shares, significantly reducing our total outstanding shares by approximately 14%. At March 31, we had $85 million remaining under the program. And as Jim has discussed, our board is authorized $500 million increase in program. We currently expect to continue our repurchase program in the current quarter.
Finally, as we execute on our plan to position Cablevision for future success, we have determined that it is an appropriate time to explore potential strategic alternatives for our Clearview Cinemas business. This process is in an early stage. We plan to conduct a thorough review of all potential alternatives.
Operator, we're now prepared to open the call for questions."

And maybe lastly for Jim, on cable, a year ago I think we would have all -- if you had polled people in the industry, they would've said Cablevision's -- one of Cablevision's many clear advantages is the network. It's probably got the best network in the country. And now we're seeing significant investments to that network. And I'm wondering if you think we were incorrect last year in the view of your sort of network advantage in the marketplace and if you think you're going to see an improvement in the EBITDA of the company as a result of these investments sometime in 2012 or this is probably more a 2013 event."

Over the balance of this year, all that we have is term loan amortization that approximates $70 million. Next year, our amortization is $150 million on the term loans. And the next real maturity of any significance that we have to deal with is the Newsday maturity, which I believe is at the end of July or beginning of August of next year. It's roughly $650 million in size. We have the ability to refinance it at a lower level than $650 million under the partnership agreement that we have with Tribune. And those are our significant maturities over the next 2 years. And I have no present concern about any issues in refinancing those. As I think you were pointing out, our liquidity position is very strong. We have over $400 million worth of cash in the bank as of the end of the last quarter, in fact, closer to $500 million. And most of our $1.25 billion revolver is undrawn. And I don't see any revolver draws coming in the immediate future. So liquidity is quite strong."

And as we look forward, we're quite hopeful about being able to continue that type of the type of success. In terms of the capital expenditure side of the equation, we have some projects, which as Jim has pointed out, we needed a network augmentation. When we got the SamKnows data from the FCC, it was really a little bit of a wake-up call in terms of the network. We've now completed that augmentation. Our network is up and efficient in the way that it should be. But as we're looking forward, if you look at quarter-over-quarter changes and where we're spending the capital, it's going into customer premises equipment, which is higher. It's going into support. And additionally, as we get further into the year, it's going to be going into increases on the RS-DVR side and to support the digitization effort.

The reason for reupping now is that we continued our purchases into the beginning of this quarter during our window period. And our actual authorization as of today is down to around $70 million. I believe it's best practice to discuss repurchases at the time of earnings calls as opposed to just showing up on a random day with an increase in the authorization. So I think that we are committed to having an authorization in place. It provides us with the flexibility to continue the current program or potentially to reduce the current program or to increase the current program. So it gives management an opportunity based upon where the stock price is and our views as to leverage, et cetera. So it was just the right time to do it. Normally, in this quarter, we have raised our dividend in the past. The board made a decision this year not to do that. We've spun off AMC with a very substantial amount of AOCF, which is not here to support a higher dividend. So in effect, there's actually been an effective dividend increase because of the AMC spin. So our balance comes back again to something Jim has talked about a lot on our calls, which is a balance between investing in the business and returning capital to our shareholders. We're trying to be balanced in that regard. But at this point in time, the pendulum has shifted and we're investing on our business. And in terms of the year-over-year one-time costs, it was equal to about 1 point would be the approach. And in terms of cost reductions, we did mention before Clearview. I think we continued to look at our operations, and Jim used a word a few minutes ago, efficiency. And what we are continuing to do is to look for efficiencies in our business, things like truck rolls, the way that we approach our work rules and business rules. But we're not embarking on any type of an organized cost-cutting at this point in time."

During the first quarter of 2012, we made progress on our plans to improve the overall product and service experience to our customers. These plans are changing the way we approach our business and they are positioning the company for long-term success. 
As you will recall, during our 2011 fourth quarter earnings call, we explained that 2012 would be a year of investment, in terms of both capital spending and operating execution. Our first quarter 2012 operating metrics reflect the first positive results of these efforts. Many of our key operating statistics reflect significant improvements to recent trends, including an increase in basic subscribers in Optimum East for the quarter.
Admittedly, these achievements did not come without a cost, or more properly stated, an investment. The quarter's financial performance principally reflects the near-term impact of the operating and capital investments that we are in the process of making. Only a portion of this investment took the form of capital expenditures. For example, as most of you are aware, Cablevision has not announced the 2012 rate increase, an action that would typically be reflected in our first quarter revenue. Partly as a result of this decision, first quarter 2012 total revenue was flat as compared with first quarter 2011. AOCF declined 7.6% versus the prior year period, primarily reflecting lower margins in our core cable business.
As we discussed last quarter, we remain focused on striking the right balance between returning capital to our shareholders and investing in the business. As expected, our first quarter results reflect the decision to dedicate more of our resources to our infrastructure and other capital investments. This resulted in a significant year-over-year increase in capital expenditures for the quarter.
After accounting for this increased level of investment and certain movements in working capital that Gregg will discuss in more detail, Cablevision generated approximately $18 million in free cash flow during the quarter. We continue to dedicate a portion of our resources to return of capital initiatives. We repurchased 4.1 million shares of stock in the first quarter. And today, we announced that our board has authorized a $500 million increase in our stock repurchase program. The board also declared a $0.15 per share quarterly dividend, which is payable next month.
Turning to operations. Product -- turning to operations. Product service operational improvements and enhancements continue to progress throughout the business. We completed our data network augmentation project at the end of the first quarter. This investment of over $140 million, which began in mid-2011, has more than doubled our broadband capacity. It also enhanced product performance, and most importantly, it positions our network for future growth.
As you all know, WiFi is an important component of our overall broadband strategy. As of the end of the first quarter, nearly 30% of our Optimum Online customers have utilized our WiFi network, registering more than 1.3 million devices for automatic sign-on. Over 50% of these devices are smartphones, a strong indication that our subscribers recognize the superior speed and value that our Optimum WiFi service provides versus their wireless data plans. Our capital expenditure plans for 2012 include a substantial expansion of our WiFi network. This includes a rollout of additional indoor and outdoor hotspots that will expand both capacity and coverage in geographically targeted areas.
We are also continuing to enhance our mobile TV and TV to GO offerings. The Optimum app for laptops was launched last month, and we are working to expand our Android app to include live TV viewing. Our goal is to enable live television viewing on all the screens within our customers' homes. With our launch of HBO GO and MAX GO in March, we now offer 13 TV to GO products, with more launches planned for the coming months. We continue to work with our programming partners to extend our customers' viewing experience beyond the home because we know that is what they desire, entertainment anywhere, anytime, on the screen of their choice. We plan to continue to evolve our services to meet this demand.
On the content side, we are substantially expanding our Video On Demand titles with plans in place to add titles throughout the year. We are currently testing our new user interface in employee homes, which will not only enhance the ability to search the growing library of titles, but substantially improve the overall Optimum viewing experience. The conversion of our entire network to digital is on track to be completed later this year. This will allow us to roll out our RS-DVR products across our entire footprint, a product that we are continuing to improve as it's deployed.
The digitization of our network is a major strategic step for our company. Not only will this conversion free up tremendous bandwidth throughout our network and enable products, like RS-DVR, it has the potential to improve the way we conduct our business. Simply put, a fully digital network is an intelligent network. It enables a level of communication with and monitoring of network components that we have never had before. It allows us to reconsider how we identify and rectify network issues and outages, and how we respond to and resolve customer problems. 
These changes are neither simple nor entirely visible today, but I'm excited by the opportunities we have to make changes in the way we conduct our business and serve our customers.  Some changes will come quickly, others are going to take more time, but we expect them all to make a meaningful difference in the experience we provide our customers. And that is our goal, to develop a great relationship with our customers by providing them with the best products and the best service possible.
As we pursue our plans to achieve this goal, there have been changes in our organization. Certain roles have changed, some have expanded, others are no longer needed. As a result, some executives have departed the company, but we've also hired a few senior-level executives who are bringing fresh ideas and renewed energy to our efforts. These types of changes are inevitable as we continue to grow and transform the company.
I have a tremendous confidence in our management team and in our entire organization. I strongly believe that we have the right plan in place to set this company on a path towards long-term success, delivering greater value for our customers and for our shareholders.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Seibert."
25933,184409662,296517,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we added over 7,000 video subscribers, including over 4,600 video subscribers in Optimum East, our highest quarterly increase since the second quarter of 2008. We added approximately 42,000",928,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we added over 7,000 video subscribers, including over 4,600 video subscribers in Optimum East, our highest quarterly increase since the second quarter of 2008. We added approximately 42,000 high-speed data customers and 42,000 voice customers company-wide, levels last achieved in the first quarter of 2010. 
Average revenue per video customer across all properties was $152.53 in the first quarter, an increase of $2.78 as compared to the prior year period. RPS in Optimum East increased by approximately $2. However, Optimum East RPS declined sequentially. This decline was principally related to seasonally lower first quarter advertising revenue, lower pay-per-view boxing revenue and the impact of certain promotional pricing.
As compared to the prior year, cable revenue for the quarter was essentially flat. Cable revenue was down 0.5% in Optimum East, principally reflecting the year-over-year reduction in video subscribers, the absence of a rate increase and the impact of certain promotional pricing, partially offset by additional data and voice subscribers. In addition, total cable advertising revenue in the first quarter was up 4.1% compared with last year's first quarter, reflecting a 5% increase in Optimum East.
AOCF for the cable business declined by 8.2% overall, declining 9.8% in Optimum East. As Jim mentioned, the decline in Optimum East AOCF principally reflects the modest decline in revenue and the decline in AOCF margin. The principal elements of the margin decline were an increase in programming cost and an increase in certain operating expenses. The first quarter Optimum East AOCF margin was 36.1%, down from 39.8% during the prior year quarter. 
Optimum West has continued to make progress. Each of Optimum West's subscriber metrics reflects the highest level of quarterly net additions since the acquisition. Average revenue per sub for the West properties was $135.52 in the first quarter, up over $10 since the first quarter of last year. Revenue was up 7.5% in Optimum West and AOCF increased by 15.8%. The AOCF margin for the West properties was 33.8% in the first quarter.
Total capital spending in the first quarter was $216 million, reflecting a $55 million increase in Optimum East. The increase in first quarter capital expenditures in Optimum East principally reflects investments in our broadband data network, purchases of set-top boxes and other equipment primarily related to the digitization of our cable network, investments in equipment to enhance our ability to monitor our network and investments in a number of software projects. Capital spending for Optimum West was $27.7 million in the quarter, including over $10 million related to our investment in the fiber ring connecting our systems. We expect 2012 quarterly capital expenditures to continue to be significantly higher than during the comparable 2011 period, at least through the third quarter of this year.
At Optimum Lightpath, revenue increased 2.9% as compared to the first quarter of last year. Ethernet revenue grew 11.1% and overall revenue growth was dampened by declines in other revenue. Operating expenses increased 4.6%, principally to support the growth in Ethernet revenues. Overall AOCF increased by 0.7% over the prior year period.
Now turning to the company's financial position. Free cash flow from operations for the 3 months ended March 31 was $18 million, a substantial decline from the prior year period. As Jim noted, this quarter's financial performance reflects a reallocation of resources to internal investments. In addition, first quarter free cash flow was also impacted by a significant change in working capital. The first quarter is typically characterized by a large use of working capital, including cash payments relating to our compensation plans. However, the first quarter of 2012 also included a number of other uses of working capital, including payments relating to certain programming settlements, as well as certain pension and severance payments.
The company's first quarter consolidated cash position was $494 million and net debt was $10.2 billion. We had $1.19 billion undrawn and available under the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings. During the quarter, the $159 million undrawn nonextended component of our revolving credit facility matured.
In calculating our total company leverage ratio, annual AOCF is determined using the latest quarter annualized. As a result, at March 31, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 5x. The CSC Holdings Restricted Group leverage ratio was 3.7x.  At year end, present [ph] net debt was approximately $1 billion with $75 million undrawn and available on its revolving credit facility. The leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.7x, down from the fourth quarter ratio of 6.9x. We continue to be confident that we can manage our operations with this level of debt and we'll continue to monitor our debt levels closely.
Turning to Cablevision's stock repurchase program. In the first quarter, we purchased approximately 4.1 million shares for $59.2 million. From inception of the program through the end of the first quarter, we have repurchased 35.7 million Class A shares, significantly reducing our total outstanding shares by approximately 14%. At March 31, we had $85 million remaining under the program. And as Jim has discussed, our board has authorized a $500 million increase in the program. We currently expect to continue our repurchase program in the current quarter.
Finally, as we execute on our plan to position Cablevision for future success, we have determined that it is an appropriate time to explore potential strategic alternatives for our Clearview Cinemas business. This process is in an early stage. We plan to conduct a thorough review of all potential alternatives.
Operator, we're now prepared to open the call for questions."

And maybe lastly for Jim, on cable, a year ago, I think we would have all -- if you had polled people in the industry, you would've said Cablevision's -- one of Cablevision's many clear advantages is the network. It's probably got the best network in the country. And now we're seeing significant investments to that network.

And as we look forward, we're quite hopeful about being able to continue that type of success. In terms of the capital expenditure side of the equation, we have some projects, which as Jim has pointed out, we needed a network augmentation. When we got the SamKnows data from the FCC, it was really a little bit of a wake-up call in terms of the network. We've now completed that augmentation. Our network is up and efficient in the way that it should be. But as we're looking forward, if you look at quarter-over-quarter changes and where we're spending the capital, it's going into customer premises equipment, which is higher. It's going into support. And additionally, as we get further into the year, it's going to be going into increases on the RS-DVR side and to support the digitization effort. So as you look at 2012, anticipate that our capital expenditures are going up and we're making the investments we need to make in our business."

The reason for reupping now is that we continued our purchases into the beginning of this quarter during our window period. And our actual authorization as of today is down to around $70 million. I believe it's best practice to discuss repurchases at the time of earnings calls as opposed to just showing up on a random day with an increase in the authorization. So I think that we are committed to having an authorization in place. It provides us with the flexibility to continue the current program or potentially to reduce the current program or to increase the current program. So it gives management an opportunity, based upon where the stock price is and our views as to leverage, et cetera. So it was just the right time to do it. Normally, in this quarter, we have raised our dividend in the past. The board made a decision this year not to do that. We've spun off AMC with a very substantial amount of AOCF, which is not here [indiscernible] to support a higher dividend. So in effect, there's actually been an effective dividend increase because of the AMC spin. So our balance comes back again to something Jim has talked about a lot on our calls, which is a balance between investing in the business and returning capital to our shareholders. We're trying to be balanced in that regard. But at this point in time, the pendulum has shifted and we're investing in our business. And in terms of the year-over-year one-time costs, it was equal to about 1 point would be the approach. And in terms of cost reductions, we did mention before Clearview. I think we continue to look at our operations, and Jim used a word a few minutes ago, efficiency. And what we are continuing to do is to look for efficiencies in our business, things like truck rolls, the way that we approach our work rules and business rules. But we're not embarking on any type of an organized cost-cutting at this point in time."

25933,213716754,341319,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2012",2012-08-07,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bret, and good morning. During the second quarter of 2012, we continued to improve the overall Optimum experience for our customers. As we have stated before, we are changing the way we approach our business and we believe that our initiatives",1090,"Thank you, Bret, and good morning. During the second quarter of 2012, we continued to improve the overall Optimum experience for our customers. As we have stated before, we are changing the way we approach our business and we believe that our initiatives are positioning the company for long-term success. We added nearly 7000 total Optimum customer relationship in the second quarter. Net basic video subscribers were essentially flat company-wide. Both of these metrics reflect a significant improvement as compared with our performance during the second quarter 2011.
Optimum East experienced positive video growth as well as substantial increases in the number of Optimum Online and Optimum Voice subscribers. Optimum West felt the effects of a seasonally slow quarter which impacted all of its customer metrics.
We continue to focus on all aspects of our relationships with our customers including our products, pricing, customer service, network quality and performance. Our second quarter financial performance reflects the near-term impact of the operating and capital investments that we are in the process of making.
Second quarter 2012 total revenue increased by 0.5% as compared with the second quarter of 2011. AOCF declined 7.2% versus the prior year period, primarily reflecting lower margins in our core cable business. As expected, capital expenditures increased significantly in the second quarter. This increased level of investment negatively impacted free cash flow, which was $59 million for the quarter.
We continued to be committed to our return of capital initiatives. We repurchased 5.6 million shares of stock in the second quarter and last week the board declared a $0.15 per share quarterly dividend which is payable next month.
Turning to operations, product service and operational improvements and enhancements are all continuing as we strive to provide our customers with more value from their Optimum relationship. Our data network augmentation project, which was completed during the first quarter, significantly improved the Optimum Online experience. Our investment also enhanced our ability to monitor our network’s performance. As a result, we were not surprised when our product performance improvements were validated by the FCC’s latest Measurement Broadband America report, which was released on July 19.
According to the report, customers of our core Optimum Online and Optimum Online Boost Plus services received more than 100% of advertised speeds on average across a 24 hour day. In addition, the report highlighted that Optimum Online customers received 128% of advertised speeds during peak weekday hours and Optimum Online Boost Plus customers received 113% of advertised speeds during peak hours.
Another area in which we provide our customers with great value is through our continued investment in WiFi. Our WiFi network has more access points than any other WiFi network in the country and this product is becoming increasingly attractive to our customers who are seeking to contact to content outside of their homes.
During the second quarter, we expanded our network by adding nearly 5,000 additional hotspots in our Optimum East territories. In addition to adding coverage, we continued to invest to enhance the speed, capacity and connectivity of the network.
In June, we launched the free Optimum WiFi Finder app, which enables Optimum Online customers to locate Optimum WiFi hotspots. This app is expected to facilitate more WiFi connections at even higher levels of usage. Throughout the second quarter, we continued to see growth in the number of Optimum WiFi users, registered devices and data usage. By the end of the second quarter more than 1.4 million devices had been registered with Optimum WiFi, nearly 1 million of which were connecting to Optimum WiFi monthly, a clear example of how our investment is valued by our customers.
One final note on WiFi. Our Optimum WiFi users currently have access to certain Time Warner Cable and Comcast WiFi hotspots in the Northeast. In May, we announced plans to participate in a broader cross-MSO cable WiFi initiative, which will ultimately enable roaming across participating MSO WiFi networks throughout the United States.
Current participants in this initiative include, Cablevision, Comcast, Time Warner, Cox and Bright House. Optimum customers can already connect to WiFi hotspots in certain Bright House markets, including in parts of Florida. Cablevision WiFi network will be a major contributor to this initiative and our participation provides yet another incremental benefit to our Optimum Online customers.
In terms of new products, we introduced our Live TV Optimum app for the Kindle Fire in July and we plan to launch a version of the app for other Android devices shortly. The latest version of the Optimum app, which is also available for laptops and Apple mobile devices, has a look and feel that is consistent with our new Onyx user interface and guide. The Onyx guide is in the final stages of testing prior to its planned deployment to our digital set-top boxes during the fourth quarter.
In addition to our own efforts, we are always working with our programming partners to improve our customers’ viewing experiences and expand their choices. For instance, we worked with NBCUniversal to make it easier for our customers to watch London Olympics programming online by automatically authenticating them to view this content from home or over Optimum WiFi.
Services such as these are facilitated by our digital network. We expect to complete the conversion of the balance of our Optimum East analog customers to our digital service later this year. Once our remaining Optimum East customers are entirely digital, we can reclaim the bandwidth currently dedicated to our analog service and deploy DVR Plus to these homes.
The benefits of DVR Plus, a two whole home DVR that functions on all of our deployed digital boxes, are already being enjoyed by over 200,000 Optimum East customers. We have enhanced the product’s performance and user experience with each software release and we are confident that the flexibility of the product’s cloud-based design will prove to be the valuable strategic asset for Optimum in the future.
Finally, we plan to relaunch the Optimum brand later this month. I’m very excited about this initiative as it is an important part of our overall strategy of putting the customer first. Overall, I am pleased with our continuing progress and I have great confidence in our ability to develop and deploy new products and services in a rapidly changing technological environment.
Our ability to meet our customers’ needs and exceed their expectations is routed in the capacity, flexibility and resiliency of our network infrastructure.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Seibert.

25933,213716754,341319,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2012",2012-08-07,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we had a net increase of approximately 2,000 video subscribers in Optimum East and a similar level of net video losses in Optimum West. This compares favorably to the second quarter of 201",1017,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we had a net increase of approximately 2,000 video subscribers in Optimum East and a similar level of net video losses in Optimum West. This compares favorably to the second quarter of 2011 when we lost nearly 23,000 video customers company-wide.
As Jim noted, we added approximately 7,000 net new customer relationships in the quarter as compared with a customer loss of nearly 17,000 in the comparable 2011 period. We also added approximately 25,000 high-speed data customers and 23,000 voice customers company-wide, both of which also compare favorably to the second quarter of 2011.
Average revenue per video subscriber across all properties was $155.12 in the second quarter, an increase of $2.76 as compared with the prior year period. RPS also rose sequentially, increasing $2.59 or 1.7%, principally reflecting higher pay-per-view revenue, advertising and data services revenue. Average revenue per customer relationship was $139.14 in the second quarter.
As compared with the prior year total, total cable revenue for the quarter was essentially flat. Optimum East cable revenue was flat, principally reflecting the year-over-year reduction in video subscribers, the absence of a rate increase and the impact of certain promotional pricing. The impact of these factors was offset by additional data and voice subscribers and higher advertising revenue.
Total cable advertising revenue in the second quarter was up over 8% compared with last year’s second quarter. The growth reflects improvements in automotive, pay-TV services and other advertisers which were partially offset by a lower level of local issue-related political advertising.
AOCF for the cable business declined by 7.9% overall and by 9% in Optimum East. As Jim mentioned, the decline in Optimum East AOCF primarily reflects a lower AOFC margin. The principal elements of the margin reduction were higher programming costs and an increase in other operating expenses including non-executive employee compensation. Overall, Optimum East’s second quarter AOCF margin was 36.6%, down from 40.2% during the prior year quarter.
Optimum West’s performance partially reflects a seasonally slow quarter. As noted earlier, Optimum West lost approximately 2,000 video subscribers and gained approximately 2,000 voice and 2,000 data subscribers. Total Optimum West customer relationships declined by just over 1,000. Average revenue per video subscriber for Optimum West was $137.52 in the second quarter, up nearly $10 since the second quarter of last year. Revenue was up 7.1%, primarily due to the higher video and data revenues and AOCF increased 8.9%.
The AOCF margin for Optimum West was 29.9% in the second quarter. In July, Optimum West received a favorable judgment relating to its dispute with the Montana Department of Revenue. The court determined that all disputed property tax assessments were invalid and it directed the Department of Revenue to refund the amounts under protest. However, because the tax authority has the right to appeal this judgment, our second quarter financials do not reflect the very positive outcome of the proceeding.
Total capital spending in the second quarter was $296 million, reflecting a $90 million increase in Optimum East as compared to 2011. The increase in second quarter capital expenditures in Optimum East principally reflects increased investments in customer premise equipment and scalable infrastructure primarily related to the digitization of our cable network and our RS-DVR product. Capital spending for Optimum West was $20 million in the quarter, a $3 million decline compared with the second quarter of 2011.
At Optimum Lightpath, revenue increased 5.2% as compared with the second quarter of last year. Ethernet revenue grew 12.3%, while AOCF increased by 5.4% over the prior year period.
As discussed, our second quarter financial results reflect the impact of a number of initiatives that we were implementing throughout the year. Certain of these initiatives have resulted in higher operating expenses and higher capital expenditures as compared to the comparable 2011 period. As we continue to execute our strategy, we expect this level of investment to increase, in part due to the timing of certain initiatives such as the Optimum brand re-launch.
In addition, we expect second half 2012 capital expenditures to be significantly higher than during the comparable 2011 period. We believe that these initiatives are important elements of Cablevision’s long-term success.
Now, turning to the company’s financial position. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the second quarter was $59 million, a substantial decline from the prior year period. The company’s second quarter consolidated cash position was $338 million and net debt was $10.2 billion. We had $1.19 billion undrawn available under the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holding.
In calculating our total company leverage ratio, annual ACOF is determined using the “latest quarter annualized.” As a result at June 30, the company’s consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.8 times. The CSC Holding’s restricted group leverage ratio was 3.6 times.
At quarter end, Bresnan net debt was approximately $1 billion, with $75 million undrawn and available on its revolving credit facility. The leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.5 times, down from the first quarter ratio of 6.7 times. In the near term we expect that our latest quarter annualized AOCF will continue to be the principal factor in determining our quarterly leverage ratio.
Turning to Cablevision’s stock repurchase program, as Jim noted, in the second quarter we repurchased approximately 5.6 million shares of Cablevision’s stock for $68.4 million. This investment reflects a 2.6% reduction in outstanding Class A shares. From the inception of the program through the end of the second quarter, we have repurchased 41.3 million Class A shares. We currently expect to continue our repurchase activity in the coming quarter.
As we highlighted during our first quarter call, we are in the process of exploring potential strategic alternatives for our Clearview Cinemas business. This process is ongoing and we have no further update at this time. Similarly, a court date related to the Voom litigation has been set for September 18. We await our opportunity to pursue our claims, but we will have no further comment on this pending litigation at this time.
Operator, we’re now prepared to open the call for questions.

And then when your customers roll off of the promotional pricing, there’s a big huge jump that they have to make. And it tends to give them sticker shock, and that’s something that in the long run isn’t really very healthy for the subscriber base and for the company.
And so we’ve seen an easing in the marketplace in terms of promotional offers that are deeply discounted. And we’re certainly in agreement with that strategy, because you’re here for the long term, and that big jump at the end of the promotional pricing is tough for the customer to take.
And it creates, I think, a lot of unnecessary churn in the marketplace that doesn’t benefit any of the providers in the marketplace. So I think there’s some rationality coming in across the board, including with us in regards to that kind of pricing.

25933,213716754,341375,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2012",2012-08-07,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bret, and good morning. During the second quarter of 2012, we continued to improve the overall Optimum experience for our customers. As we have stated before, we are changing the way we approach our business and we believe that our initiatives",1091,"Thank you, Bret, and good morning. During the second quarter of 2012, we continued to improve the overall Optimum experience for our customers. As we have stated before, we are changing the way we approach our business and we believe that our initiatives are positioning the company for long-term success. We added nearly 7,000 total Optimum customer relationship in the second quarter. Net basic video subscribers were essentially flat company-wide. Both of these metrics reflect a significant improvement as compared with our performance during the second quarter of 2011.
Optimum East experienced positive video growth as well as substantial increases in the number of Optimum Online and Optimum Voice subscribers. Optimum West felt the effects of a seasonally slow quarter which impacted all of its customer metrics.
We continue to focus on all aspects of our relationships with our customers including our products, pricing, customer service, network quality and performance. Our second quarter financial performance reflects the near-term impact of the operating and capital investments that we are in the process of making.
Second quarter 2012 total revenue increased by 0.5% as compared with the second quarter of 2011. AOCF declined 7.2% versus the prior year period, primarily reflecting lower margins in our core cable business. As expected, capital expenditures increased significantly in the second quarter. This increased level of investment negatively impacted free cash flow, which was $59 million for the quarter.
We continued to be committed to our return of capital initiatives. We repurchased 5.6 million shares of stock in the second quarter and last week the board declared a $0.15 per share quarterly dividend which is payable next month.
Turning to operations, product service and operational improvements and enhancements are all continuing as we strive to provide our customers with more value from their Optimum relationship. Our data network augmentation project, which was completed during the first quarter, significantly improved the Optimum Online experience. Our investment also enhanced our ability to monitor our network’s performance. As a result, we were not surprised when our product performance improvements were validated by the FCC’s latest Measurement Broadband America report, which was released on July 19.
According to the report, customers of our core Optimum Online and Optimum Online Boost Plus services received more than 100% of advertised speeds on average across a 24 hour day. In addition, the report highlighted that Optimum Online customers received 128% of advertised speeds during peak weekday hours and Optimum Online Boost Plus customers received 113% of advertised speeds during peak hours.
Another area in which we provide our customers with great value is through our continued investment in WiFi. Our WiFi network has more access points than any other WiFi network in the country and this product is becoming increasingly attractive to our customers who are seeking to connect to content outside of their homes.
During the second quarter, we expanded our network by adding nearly 5,000 additional hotspots in our Optimum East territories. In addition to adding coverage, we continued to invest to enhance the speed, capacity and connectivity of the network.
In June, we launched the free Optimum WiFi Finder app, which enables Optimum Online customers to locate Optimum WiFi hotspots. This app is expected to facilitate more WiFi connections at even higher levels of usage. Throughout the second quarter, we continued to see growth in the number of Optimum WiFi users, registered devices and data usage. By the end of the second quarter more than 1.4 million devices had been registered with Optimum WiFi, nearly 1 million of which were connecting to Optimum WiFi monthly, a clear example of how our investment is valued by our customers.
One final note on WiFi. Our Optimum WiFi users currently have access to certain Time Warner Cable and Comcast WiFi hotspots in the Northeast. In May, we announced plans to participate in a broader cross-MSO cable WiFi initiative, which will ultimately enable roaming across participating MSO WiFi networks throughout the United States.
Current participants in this initiative include, Cablevision, Comcast, Time Warner, Cox and Bright House. Optimum customers can already connect to WiFi hotspots in certain Bright House markets, including in parts of Florida. Cablevision WiFi network will be a major contributor to this initiative and our participation provides yet another incremental benefit to our Optimum Online customers.
In terms of new products, we introduced our Live TV Optimum app for the Kindle Fire in July and we plan to launch a version of the app for other Android devices shortly. The latest version of the Optimum app, which is also available for laptops and Apple mobile devices, has a look and feel that is consistent with our new Onyx user interface and guide. The Onyx guide is in the final stages of testing prior to its planned deployment to our digital set-top boxes during the fourth quarter.
In addition to our own efforts, we are always working with our programming partners to improve our customers’ viewing experiences and expand their choices. For instance, we worked with NBCUniversal to make it easier for our customers to watch London Olympics programming online by automatically authenticating them to view this content from home or over Optimum WiFi.
Services such as these are facilitated by our digital network. We expect to complete the conversion of the balance of our Optimum East analog customers to our digital service later this year. Once our remaining Optimum East customers are entirely digital, we can reclaim the bandwidth currently dedicated to our analog service and deploy DVR Plus to these homes.
The benefits of DVR Plus, a true whole home DVR that functions on all of our deployed digital boxes, are already being enjoyed by over 200,000 Optimum East customers. We have enhanced the product’s performance and user experience with each software release and we are confident that the flexibility of the product’s cloud-based design will prove to be the valuable strategic asset for Optimum in the future.
Finally, we plan to relaunch the Optimum brand later this month. I’m very excited about this initiative as it is an important part of our overall strategy of putting the customer first. Overall, I am pleased with our continuing progress and I have great confidence in our ability to develop and deploy new products and services in a rapidly changing technological environment.
Our ability to meet our customers’ needs and exceed their expectations is rooted in the capacity, flexibility and resiliency of our network infrastructure.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Seibert."
25933,213716754,341375,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2012",2012-08-07,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we had a net increase of approximately 2,000 video subscribers in Optimum East and a similar level of net video losses in Optimum West. This compares favorably to the second quarter of 201",1014,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we had a net increase of approximately 2,000 video subscribers in Optimum East and a similar level of net video losses in Optimum West. This compares favorably to the second quarter of 2011 when we lost nearly 23,000 video customers company-wide.
As Jim noted, we added approximately 7,000 net new customer relationships in the quarter as compared with a customer loss of nearly 17,000 in the comparable 2011 period. We also added approximately 25,000 high-speed data customers and 23,000 voice customers company-wide, both of which also compare favorably to the second quarter of 2011.
Average revenue per video subscriber across all properties was $155.12 in the second quarter, an increase of $2.76 as compared with the prior year period. RPS also rose sequentially, increasing $2.59 or 1.7%, principally reflecting higher pay-per-view revenue, advertising and data services revenue. Average revenue per customer relationship was $139.14 in the second quarter.
As compared with the prior year total, total cable revenue for the quarter was essentially flat. Optimum East cable revenue was flat, principally reflecting the year-over-year reduction in video subscribers, the absence of a rate increase and the impact of certain promotional pricing. The impact of these factors was offset by additional data and voice subscribers and higher advertising revenue.
Total cable advertising revenue in the second quarter was up over 8% compared with last year’s second quarter. The growth reflects improvements in automotive, pay-TV services and other advertisers which were partially offset by a lower level of local issue-related political advertising.
AOCF for the cable business declined by 7.9% overall and by 9% in Optimum East. As Jim mentioned, the decline in Optimum East AOCF primarily reflects a lower AOCF margin. The principal elements of the margin reduction were higher programming costs and an increase in other operating expenses including non-executive employee compensation. Overall, Optimum East’s second quarter AOCF margin was 36.6%, down from 40.2% during the prior year quarter.
Optimum West’s performance partially reflects a seasonally slow quarter. As noted earlier, Optimum West lost approximately 2,000 video subscribers and gained approximately 2,000 voice and 2,000 data subscribers. Total Optimum West customer relationships declined by just over 1,000. Average revenue per video subscriber for Optimum West was $137.52 in the second quarter, up nearly $10 since the second quarter of last year. Revenue was up 7.1%, primarily due to the higher video and data revenues and AOCF increased 8.9%.
The AOCF margin for Optimum West was 29.9% in the second quarter. In July, Optimum West received a favorable judgment relating to its dispute with the Montana Department of Revenue. The court determined that all disputed property tax assessments were invalid and it directed the Department of Revenue to refund the amounts under protest. However, because the tax authority has the right to appeal this judgment, our second quarter financials do not reflect the very positive outcome of the proceeding.
Total capital spending in the second quarter was $296 million, reflecting a $90 million increase in Optimum East as compared to 2011. The increase in second quarter capital expenditures in Optimum East principally reflects increased investments in customer premise equipment and scalable infrastructure primarily related to the digitization of our cable network and our RS-DVR product. Capital spending for Optimum West was $20 million in the quarter, a $3 million decline compared with the second quarter of 2011.
At Optimum Lightpath, revenue increased 5.2% as compared with the second quarter of last year. Ethernet revenue grew 12.3%, while AOCF increased by 5.4% over the prior year period.
As discussed, our second quarter financial results reflect the impact of a number of initiatives that we were implementing throughout the year. Certain of these initiatives have resulted in higher operating expenses and higher capital expenditures as compared to the comparable 2011 period. As we continue to execute our strategy, we expect this level of investment to increase, in part due to the timing of certain initiatives such as the Optimum brand re-launch.
In addition, we expect second half 2012 capital expenditures to be significantly higher than during the comparable 2011 period. We believe that these initiatives are important elements of Cablevision’s long-term success.
Now, turning to the company’s financial position. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the second quarter was $59 million, a substantial decline from the prior year period. The company’s second quarter consolidated cash position was $338 million and net debt was $10.2 billion. We had $1.19 billion undrawn and available under the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holding.
In calculating our total company leverage ratio, annual AOCF is determined using the “latest quarter annualized.” As a result at June 30, the company’s consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.8x. The CSC Holding’s restricted group leverage ratio was 3.6x.
At quarter end, Bresnan net debt was approximately $1 billion, with $75 million undrawn and available on its revolving credit facility. The leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.5x, down from the first quarter ratio of 6.7x. In the near term we expect that our latest quarter annualized AOCF will continue to be the principal factor in determining our quarterly leverage ratio.
Turning to Cablevision’s stock repurchase program, as Jim noted, in the second quarter we repurchased approximately 5.6 million shares of Cablevision’s stock for $68.4 million. This investment reflects a 2.6% reduction in outstanding Class A shares. From the inception of the program through the end of the second quarter, we have repurchased 41.3 million Class A shares. We currently expect to continue our repurchase activity in the coming quarter.
As we highlighted during our first quarter call, we are in the process of exploring potential strategic alternatives for our Clearview Cinemas business. This process is ongoing and we have no further update at this time. Similarly, a court date related to the VOOM litigation has been set for September 18. We await our opportunity to pursue our claims, but we will have no further comment on this pending litigation at this time.
Operator, we’re now prepared to open the call for questions."

And the promotional pricing that we’ve seen over the last couple years has been - it’s been fairly deep in terms of the discounts. And then when your customers roll off of the promotional pricing, there’s a big huge jump that they have to make. And it tends to give them sticker shock, and that’s something that in the long run isn’t really very healthy for the subscriber base and for the company. And so we’ve seen an easing in the marketplace in terms of promotional offers that are deeply discounted. And we’re certainly in agreement with that strategy, because you’re here for the long term, and that big jump at the end of the promotional pricing is tough for the customer to take.

25933,213716754,341431,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2012",2012-08-07,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bret, and good morning. During the second quarter of 2012, we continued to improve the overall Optimum experience for our customers. As we have stated before, we are changing the way we approach our business and we believe that our initiatives",1091,"Thank you, Bret, and good morning. During the second quarter of 2012, we continued to improve the overall Optimum experience for our customers. As we have stated before, we are changing the way we approach our business and we believe that our initiatives are positioning the company for long-term success. We added nearly 7,000 total Optimum customer relationship in the second quarter. Net basic video subscribers were essentially flat company-wide. Both of these metrics reflect a significant improvement as compared with our performance during the second quarter of 2011.
Optimum East experienced positive video growth as well as substantial increases in the number of Optimum Online and Optimum Voice subscribers. Optimum West felt the effects of a seasonally slow quarter which impacted all of its customer metrics.
We continue to focus on all aspects of our relationships with our customers including our products, pricing, customer service, network quality and performance. Our second quarter financial performance reflects the near-term impact of the operating and capital investments that we are in the process of making.
Second quarter 2012 total revenue increased by 0.5% as compared with the second quarter of 2011. AOCF declined 7.2% versus the prior year period, primarily reflecting lower margins in our core cable business. As expected, capital expenditures increased significantly in the second quarter. This increased level of investment negatively impacted free cash flow, which was $59 million for the quarter.
We continued to be committed to our return of capital initiatives. We repurchased 5.6 million shares of stock in the second quarter and last week the board declared a $0.15 per share quarterly dividend which is payable next month.
Turning to operations, product service and operational improvements and enhancements are all continuing as we strive to provide our customers with more value from their Optimum relationship. Our data network augmentation project, which was completed during the first quarter, significantly improved the Optimum Online experience. Our investment also enhanced our ability to monitor our network’s performance. As a result, we were not surprised when our product performance improvements were validated by the FCC’s latest Measurement Broadband America report, which was released on July 19.
According to the report, customers of our core Optimum Online and Optimum Online Boost Plus services received more than 100% of advertised speeds on average across a 24 hour day. In addition, the report highlighted that Optimum Online customers received 128% of advertised speeds during peak weekday hours and Optimum Online Boost Plus customers received 113% of advertised speeds during peak hours.
Another area in which we provide our customers with great value is through our continued investment in WiFi. Our WiFi network has more access points than any other WiFi network in the country and this product is becoming increasingly attractive to our customers who are seeking to connect to content outside of their homes.
During the second quarter, we expanded our network by adding nearly 5,000 additional hotspots in our Optimum East territories. In addition to adding coverage, we continued to invest to enhance the speed, capacity and connectivity of the network.
In June, we launched the free Optimum WiFi Finder app, which enables Optimum Online customers to locate Optimum WiFi hotspots. This app is expected to facilitate more WiFi connections at even higher levels of usage. Throughout the second quarter, we continued to see growth in the number of Optimum WiFi users, registered devices and data usage. By the end of the second quarter more than 1.4 million devices had been registered with Optimum WiFi, nearly 1 million of which were connecting to Optimum WiFi monthly, a clear example of how our investment is valued by our customers.
One final note on WiFi. Our Optimum WiFi users currently have access to certain Time Warner Cable and Comcast WiFi hotspots in the Northeast. In May, we announced plans to participate in a broader cross-MSO cable WiFi initiative, which will ultimately enable roaming across participating MSO WiFi networks throughout the United States.
Current participants in this initiative include, Cablevision, Comcast, Time Warner, Cox and Bright House. Optimum customers can already connect to WiFi hotspots in certain Bright House markets, including in parts of Florida. Cablevision WiFi network will be a major contributor to this initiative and our participation provides yet another incremental benefit to our Optimum Online customers.
In terms of new products, we introduced our Live TV Optimum app for the Kindle Fire in July and we plan to launch a version of the app for other Android devices shortly. The latest version of the Optimum app, which is also available for laptops and Apple mobile devices, has a look and feel that is consistent with our new Onyx user interface and guide. The Onyx guide is in the final stages of testing prior to its planned deployment to our digital set-top boxes during the fourth quarter.
In addition to our own efforts, we are always working with our programming partners to improve our customers’ viewing experiences and expand their choices. For instance, we worked with NBCUniversal to make it easier for our customers to watch London Olympics programming online by automatically authenticating them to view this content from home or over Optimum WiFi.
Services such as these are facilitated by our digital network. We expect to complete the conversion of the balance of our Optimum East analog customers to our digital service later this year. Once our remaining Optimum East customers are entirely digital, we can reclaim the bandwidth currently dedicated to our analog service and deploy DVR Plus to these homes.
The benefits of DVR Plus, a true whole home DVR that functions on all of our deployed digital boxes, are already being enjoyed by over 200,000 Optimum East customers. We have enhanced the product’s performance and user experience with each software release and we are confident that the flexibility of the product’s cloud-based design will prove to be the valuable strategic asset for Optimum in the future.
Finally, we plan to relaunch the Optimum brand later this month. I’m very excited about this initiative as it is an important part of our overall strategy of putting the customer first. Overall, I am pleased with our continuing progress and I have great confidence in our ability to develop and deploy new products and services in a rapidly changing technological environment.
Our ability to meet our customers’ needs and exceed their expectations is rooted in the capacity, flexibility and resiliency of our network infrastructure.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Seibert."
25933,213716754,341431,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2012",2012-08-07,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we had a net increase of approximately 2,000 video subscribers in Optimum East and a similar level of net video losses in Optimum West. This compares favorably to the second quarter of 201",1014,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we had a net increase of approximately 2,000 video subscribers in Optimum East and a similar level of net video losses in Optimum West. This compares favorably to the second quarter of 2011 when we lost nearly 23,000 video customers company-wide.
As Jim noted, we added approximately 7,000 net new customer relationships in the quarter as compared with a customer loss of nearly 17,000 in the comparable 2011 period. We also added approximately 25,000 high-speed data customers and 23,000 voice customers company-wide, both of which also compare favorably to the second quarter of 2011.
Average revenue per video subscriber across all properties was $155.12 in the second quarter, an increase of $2.76 as compared with the prior year period. RPS also rose sequentially, increasing $2.59 or 1.7%, principally reflecting higher pay-per-view revenue, advertising and data services revenue. Average revenue per customer relationship was $139.14 in the second quarter.
As compared with the prior year total, total cable revenue for the quarter was essentially flat. Optimum East cable revenue was flat, principally reflecting the year-over-year reduction in video subscribers, the absence of a rate increase and the impact of certain promotional pricing. The impact of these factors was offset by additional data and voice subscribers and higher advertising revenue.
Total cable advertising revenue in the second quarter was up over 8% compared with last year’s second quarter. The growth reflects improvements in automotive, pay-TV services and other advertisers which were partially offset by a lower level of local issue-related political advertising.
AOCF for the cable business declined by 7.9% overall and by 9% in Optimum East. As Jim mentioned, the decline in Optimum East AOCF primarily reflects a lower AOCF margin. The principal elements of the margin reduction were higher programming costs and an increase in other operating expenses including non-executive employee compensation. Overall, Optimum East’s second quarter AOCF margin was 36.6%, down from 40.2% during the prior year quarter.
Optimum West’s performance partially reflects a seasonally slow quarter. As noted earlier, Optimum West lost approximately 2,000 video subscribers and gained approximately 2,000 voice and 2,000 data subscribers. Total Optimum West customer relationships declined by just over 1,000. Average revenue per video subscriber for Optimum West was $137.52 in the second quarter, up nearly $10 since the second quarter of last year. Revenue was up 7.1%, primarily due to the higher video and data revenues and AOCF increased 8.9%.
The AOCF margin for Optimum West was 29.9% in the second quarter. In July, Optimum West received a favorable judgment relating to its dispute with the Montana Department of Revenue. The court determined that all disputed property tax assessments were invalid and it directed the Department of Revenue to refund the amounts under protest. However, because the tax authority has the right to appeal this judgment, our second quarter financials do not reflect the very positive outcome of the proceeding.
Total capital spending in the second quarter was $296 million, reflecting a $90 million increase in Optimum East as compared to 2011. The increase in second quarter capital expenditures in Optimum East principally reflects increased investments in customer premise equipment and scalable infrastructure primarily related to the digitization of our cable network and our RS-DVR product. Capital spending for Optimum West was $20 million in the quarter, a $3 million decline compared with the second quarter of 2011.
At Optimum Lightpath, revenue increased 5.2% as compared with the second quarter of last year. Ethernet revenue grew 12.3%, while AOCF increased by 5.4% over the prior year period.
As discussed, our second quarter financial results reflect the impact of a number of initiatives that we were implementing throughout the year. Certain of these initiatives have resulted in higher operating expenses and higher capital expenditures as compared to the comparable 2011 period. As we continue to execute our strategy, we expect this level of investment to increase, in part due to the timing of certain initiatives such as the Optimum brand re-launch.
In addition, we expect second half 2012 capital expenditures to be significantly higher than during the comparable 2011 period. We believe that these initiatives are important elements of Cablevision’s long-term success.
Now, turning to the company’s financial position. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the second quarter was $59 million, a substantial decline from the prior year period. The company’s second quarter consolidated cash position was $338 million and net debt was $10.2 billion. We had $1.19 billion undrawn and available under the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holding.
In calculating our total company leverage ratio, annual AOCF is determined using the “latest quarter annualized.” As a result at June 30, the company’s consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.8x. The CSC Holding’s restricted group leverage ratio was 3.6x.
At quarter end, Bresnan net debt was approximately $1 billion, with $75 million undrawn and available on its revolving credit facility. The leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.5x, down from the first quarter ratio of 6.7x. In the near term we expect that our latest quarter annualized AOCF will continue to be the principal factor in determining our quarterly leverage ratio.
Turning to Cablevision’s stock repurchase program, as Jim noted, in the second quarter we repurchased approximately 5.6 million shares of Cablevision’s stock for $68.4 million. This investment reflects a 2.6% reduction in outstanding Class A shares. From the inception of the program through the end of the second quarter, we have repurchased 41.3 million Class A shares. We currently expect to continue our repurchase activity in the coming quarter.
As we highlighted during our first quarter call, we are in the process of exploring potential strategic alternatives for our Clearview Cinemas business. This process is ongoing and we have no further update at this time. Similarly, a court date related to the VOOM litigation has been set for September 18. We await our opportunity to pursue our claims, but we will have no further comment on this pending litigation at this time.

Let me begin this morning by addressing last week's storm.The storm cut a pathway of destruction up the entire East Coast, and our thoughts and prayers are with everyone who was been affected. In our Optimum e-service",1330,"Thank you, Bret, and good morning. Let me begin this morning by addressing last week's storm.
The storm cut a pathway of destruction up the entire East Coast, and our thoughts and prayers are with everyone who was been affected. In our Optimum e-service area, we began our preparations before the storm hit, implementing a thorough response plan that included positioning resources where we believe they would be most needed. Many of the measures that we put in place were on response to lessons learned during Hurricane Irene.
We recently reviewed and revised all of our hurricane response plans and took numerous proactive steps prior to the storm, including deploying emergency staff, testing generators and stocking fuel and securing additional contract labor to assist in the recovery. As soon as it was safe for our people to get into the field, they began responding to service outages and they haven't stopped. However, the loss of electrical power was the primary cause of widespread disruptions of Optimum service, particularly in heavily impacted areas of Long Island, New Jersey, Connecticut and Westchester county. Our crews continue to restore Optimum service as quickly as possible as power returns to our customers.
Our data as of 8:00 a.m. this morning, indicates that more than 2.7 million of our Optimum ease customers have electrical power and also have their Optimum service. But approximately 535,000 Cablevision households still have no power.
Our Optimum WiFi hotspots had helped many of our customers they connected, and we currently have approximately 47,000 hot spots operational across the tri-state region. Despite spread power outages, more than 32,000 of our hotspots were accessible to our customers throughout the storm and during the days immediately following. Restoring service our customers is our near singular focus right now. However, I realized that the primary purpose of this call is to review our third quarter results, so I'm going to now turn to briefly review the quarter and let Gregg provide some additional detail on our financials.
Despite the impact of seasonally slow -- seasonally slow quarter in Optimum East, we added nearly 5,000 total Optimum customer relationships companywide during the third quarter. In addition, we experienced net video subscriber losses that were nearly 50% lower than those experienced in the third quarter of 2011.
Total Optimum Online net additions rose by nearly 70% as compared with the third quarter of 2011. Third quarter net Optimum voice additions were at the similar level to those achieved during the prior year period, despite a lower contribution from Optimum West.
Our financial performance continues to reflect the near-term impact of the operating and capital investments that we are making. Third quarter 2012 total company revenue grew 1.2% as compared with the third quarter of 2011. AOCF declined 6.6% versus the prior year period, primarily reflecting higher expenses in our core Cable business in the East.
There are a couple of factors that affect the year-over-year comparisons of these results. In the current year's third quarter, we reached a favorable settlement with one of our voice termination partners. And in third quarter of 2011, our results reflect the impact of Hurricane Irene. Adjusting for these items, third quarter 2012 total company revenue increased 0.4% and consolidated AOCF declined 11.6% both as compared with the prior year period.
As expected, third quarter 2012 capital expenditures increased significantly as compared with third quarter of last year. This increased level of investment and higher operating cost impacted free cash flow which was $78 million for the quarter. We continue to be committed to our return of capital initiatives. We repurchased approximately 4 million shares of stock in the third quarter and on October 24, the board declared a $0.15 per share quarterly dividend, which is payable later this month.
Last month, we announced the resolution of the long-standing contractual dispute between  and dish network. Gregg will have a few more words within this matter. But suffice it to say we are pleased with the settlement.
Finally, I'd like to address the recent press reports about our Optimum West business. As we have stated previously, we are confident in the prospects for growth at Optimum West and we are pleased with our progress to date. In recent weeks, a number of parties expressed their unsolicited interest and possibly acquiring Optimum West. While it's not been our intention to divest this valuable asset, based on the approaches we received, we have decided to explore a potential transaction. Gregg will also have a little more to say regarding this matter.
Turning to operations. In October, we completed the conversion of the balance of our Optimum East analog customers to our digital service, and we reached a major milestone when we rolled out our new Optimum program guide to hundreds of thousands of our customers set-top boxes. We've completely reinvented the program guide to make everything about the Optimum experience better. The new guide has a redesigned look and feel and a faster and easier and more intelligent user interface. It allows viewers to search and easily access programming across live and on-demand channels, and it includes a variety of advanced tools that allows subscribers to customize the television experience.
It also incorporates high-quality graphics and video, delivers tuning between channels and provides significantly faster reboot times than our partner program guide.
The Optimum program guide is a very significant undertaking, and I am very pleased that our initial set-top box rollout has begun.
During the third quarter, we released a new version of our DVR Plus user interface, as well as a new and improved video search function. This new DVR plus release incorporates several new features, including improved content management tools such as the ability to organize recorded content into folders. Our new search function, Search 2.0, allows customers to search programs using an improved full-screen keyboard, saving retrieved recent searches, access recommended and featured programmings -- programs and the search programs with similar cash members and directors.
In addition to enhancing our Optimum Video platform, we've successfully negotiated several new programming agreements in the past few months. We've completed new agreements with the NFL, Univision, CBS, the Disney and ESPN networks, NBC and Tribune. Through these agreements, we're expanding the programming available to our Optimum customers and providing them with more opportunities to access live and on-demand content, both within the home and outside of the home on multiple devices.
In addition to our video products, progress relating to our various other initiatives continues as well. We have now deployed more than 50,000 indoor and outdoor Optimum WiFi access points. In addition to adding coverage, we continue to invest enhance the speed, capacity and connectivity of our WiFi network in order to meet the demand from the growing number of devices accessing our network. 
Over 2 billion megabytes of data pass through our WiFi network in the third quarter, more than twice the amount as compared to the 2011 period.
Finally, in September, we relaunched the Optimum brand and unveiled our new Optimum logo. The Optimum brand relaunch focuses on our customers and the meaningful connections we enable through our Optimum products and technology, as well as our vision of providing the highest level of service through all of our customer connections.
Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we are making with our various operating initiatives. But more importantly, I'm extremely proud of the tremendous response efforts made by our employees and leadership team in the wake of last week's storm.
In addition to our field teams, network operations staff and customer service representatives who are responding admirably to our customers needs, our local media properties have done an incredible job of keeping people informed and providing them with critical information across multiple platforms before, during and after the storm.
I thank them all for their dedication to our customers and to our company.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Seibert."

We also added approximately 28,000 high",1410,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim noted, we added approximately 5,000 net new customer relationships in the quarter as compared with the customer loss of nearly 15,000 in the comparable 2011 period. We also added approximately 28,000 high-speed data customers and 22,000 voice customers companywide. We lost just under 9,600 net video subscribers companywide in the third quarter. Again this was approximately half of the 19,000 net video customer losses that we experienced in the third quarter of 2011.
Average revenue per video subscriber across all properties was $154.83 in the third quarter, an increase of $3.12 as compared with the prior year period. RPS declined a bit sequentially, reflecting lower pay-per-view usage and advertising revenue, partially offset by the favorable settlement with one of our voice termination partners. RPS, excluding the impact of the settlement, was $153.53.
Average revenue per customer relationship was $138.44 in the third quarter.
As compared with the prior year, total Cable rental for the quarter increased 1.4%, principally reflecting additional data and voice subscribers, higher advertising revenue and the impact of the voice termination settlement. This growth was partially offset by the year-over-year reduction in video subscribers, the absence of a rate increase and the impact of certain promotional pricing. Excluding the impact of the voice termination settlement, Cable revenue growth would have been 1/2 of 1%.
Total Cable advertising revenue in the third quarter was up over 12% compared with last year's third quarter. This growth reflects increased political spending in the quarter at both the national level as well as continued improvements in automotive and pay TV services, partially offset by reduced financial sector advertising.
Total Cable AOCF declined 5.8% in the third quarter as compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the voice termination settlement and the impact of Hurricane Irene, this decline would have been 10.7%.
Optimum East AOCF declined by 7.9%, reflecting higher programming costs and an increase in other operating expenses, primarily nonexecutive employee compensation. Excluding the impact of the voice settlement and the current year's third quarter and the impact of Hurricane Irene during last year's third quarter, Optimum East AOCF would've declined 12.9% compared to the prior year third quarter.
Optimum East's third quarter AOCF margin was 34.2%, down from 37.4% during the prior year quarter. We expect that AOCF margin will continue to remain under pressure as we continue to absorb the impact of our operational initiatives and higher programming costs.
Turning to Optimum West. We gained approximately 1,500 video subscribers, 2,500 voice subscribers and 8,700 data subscribers in the third quarter of 2012. Total Optimum West customer relationships increased by approximately 6,200, driven primarily by an increase in data-only customers, including through a new returning student offer.
Average revenue per video subscriber for Optimum West was 1 40, 1 19 in the third quarter, up nearly $12 since the third quarter of last year. Revenue was up 9.3% primarily due to higher video and data revenues and AOCF increased 23.4%. The AOCF margin for Optimum West was 35.6% in the third quarter.
As discussed on last quarter's call, in July, Optimum West received a favorable judgment relating to its dispute with the Montana Department of Revenue. The court determined that all disputed property tax assessments were invalid and had directed the department of revenue to refund their up amounts under protest. The tax authority exercised its right to appeal this judgment in September. As you may recall, we made a protest payment of $5.5 million in the second quarter. Until the appeal is resolved, we expect to continue to make semiannual protest payments to the Montana Tax Authority. As such, we anticipate making another 2012 protest payment in the fourth quarter in the amount of approximately $4.6 million.
Total capital spending in the third quarter was $297 million, reflecting a $79 million increase at Optimum East as compared to 2011. This increase principally reflects investments in customer premise equipment and scalable infrastructure primarily related to the digitization of our Cable network, the buildout of our WiFi network and our RS-DVR product.
Capital spending for Optimum West was $19 million in the quarter, $9 million less than in the third quarter of 2011. The decline primarily reflects lower spending in 2012 on the fiber ring connecting our Optimum West systems. The ring currently connects nearly 90% of our Optimum West subscribers and allows us to provide these customers with faster Internet speeds and over 100 channels of HD programming.
As we continued to execute our 2012 plan, we expect fourth quarter 2012 capital expenditures to be significantly higher than during the comparable 2011 period.
At Optimum Lightpath, revenue increased 4.9% as compared with the third quarter of last year. AOCF increased by 7.8% over the prior year period.
Turning to the company's financial position. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the third quarter was $78 million, a 9% decline from the prior year period. The company's third quarter consolidated cash position was $439 million and net debt was $10.3 billion. We had $1.19 billion under available under the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings.
In the third quarter, we executed a number of successful financing transactions, further extending our debt maturity profile. In September, we issued $750 million of 10-year 5 7/8% senior notes at Cablevision Systems Corporation. These notes carry the lowest fixed-rate at Cablevision or CSC Holdings in the company's history. The net proceeds were invested in CSC Holdings to facilitate the tender for approximately $400 million of its 8.5% senior notes due 2014 and 2015, as well as the repayment of $150 million of its Term Loan B2 to that facility. The balance of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.
In October, we refinanced Newsdays $525 million 10.5% fixed-rate notes and it's $125 million floating rate notes priced at LIBOR plus 6.25 with a new $650 million term loan facility, priced at LIBOR plus 3.5%. This transaction is expected to result in significant interest expense savings over the 4-year term of the new credit facility.
In calculating our total company leverage, AOCF is determined using the latest quarter annualized AOCF. As a result, our leverage ratios continued to be somewhat volatile as they are more highly sensitive to changes in quarterly AOCF than they would be if our leverage were measured based on a trailing 12-month AOCF metric.
September 30, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 5.1x. The CSC Holdings Restricted Group leverage ratio was 3.6x. At quarter end, net debt was approximately $1 billion and $75 million was under on available under its revolving credit facility. The leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.1x, down from the second quarter ratio of 6.5x.
Turning to Cablevision's stock repurchase program, as Jim noted, in the third quarter we repurchased approximately 4 million shares of Cablevision stock for $61.1 million. This investment reflects a reduction of approximately 1.9% of outstanding Class A shares. From inception of the program through the end of the third quarter, we've repurchased 45.3 million Class A shares. As of the end of the third quarter, we had over $450 million of remaining stock repurchase authorization.
We are working with AMC Networks to finalize the allocation of the boom litigation settlement proceeds in accordance with the terms of our existing letter of agreement with AMC and our related-party transaction approval policy. At this time, we will not have any comments relating to the allocation of these proceeds between the 2 companies or the possibility of use of our portion of the settlement proceeds.
With regards to Clearview sentiments we continue to explore potential strategic alternatives for the business the process is ongoing and we have no further update at this time.
As Jim indicated, we are very confident in prospects for growth and we're very pleased with our progress to date. However, consistent with our approach of balancing our investable resources to the extent an attracted transaction is presented to us, we plan to pursue it. However, there can be no assurance that we will conclude a sale or go the opportunity to begin to continue execute our business plan. Beyond this, we'll have no further comment on this matter at this time.
Finally, we have not been estimated a full financial impact of last week's storm in our company. Suffice it to say that the impact could be significant. 
Operator, please open the call for questions."

A lot of that coming as a result of the Newsday refinancing. But I think more importantly what we've been doing is we've been continuing to issue our new paper up that Cablevision Systems Corp., up at the parent company. We've been using the proceeds from those financings to reduce the leverage and the amount of debt outstanding at our primary holding company -- I'm sorry, primary operating company, CSC Holdings. So we brought our leverage at the operating company down to 3.6x, which I think has been a nice improvement for our overall balance sheet and capital structure."

But the bigger issue with that in terms of our competition is that they continued to extend those introductory rates beyond the introductory period. And that's how they hang on to their subs. I don't think that that's a sustainable model for them and that they will eventually need to go to regular pricing. But meanwhile, we're very much holding our own. And I think that we will continue to do so."

And so that was going to basically run through our financials over, let's say, at least 8- to 10-year term. My tax guy is holding up 6 fingers across the table so. I would say over a 6-year term. But the more important event that could affect our NOL, which was $1.8 billion at the end of the quarter, will be the ultimate distribution of the proceeds from the boom litigation because certainly some of the cash that we would expect to receive there would be taxable and would reduce the NOL.

Let me begin this morning by addressing last week's storm.The storm cut a pathway of destruction up the entire East Coast, and our thoughts and prayers are with everyone who has been affected. In our Optimum East servi",1341,"Thank you, Bret, and good morning. Let me begin this morning by addressing last week's storm.
The storm cut a pathway of destruction up the entire East Coast, and our thoughts and prayers are with everyone who has been affected. In our Optimum East service area, we began our preparations before the storm hit, implementing a thorough response plan that included positioning resources where we believe they would be most needed. Many of the measures that we put in place were in response to lessons learned during Hurricane Irene.
We recently reviewed and revised all of our hurricane response plans and took numerous proactive steps prior to the storm, including deploying emergency staff, testing generators and stocking fuel and securing additional contract labor to assist in the recovery. As soon as it was safe for our people to get into the field, they began responding to service outages and they haven't stopped. However, the loss of electrical power was the primary cause of widespread disruptions of Optimum service, particularly in heavily impacted areas of Long Island, New Jersey, Connecticut and Westchester County. Our crews continue to restore Optimum service as quickly as possible as power returns to our customers.
Our data as of 8:00 a.m. this morning indicates that more than 2.7 million of our Optimum East customers have electrical power and also have their Optimum service but approximately 535,000 Cablevision households still have no power.
Our Optimum WiFi hotspots have helped many of our customers to stay connected and we currently have approximately 47,000 hot spots operational across the tri-state region. Despite widespread power outages, more than 22,000 of our hotspots were accessible to our customers throughout the storm and during the days immediately following. Restoring service to our customers is our near singular focus right now. However, I realized that the primary purpose of this call is to review our third quarter results, so I'm going to now turn to briefly review the quarter and let Gregg provide some additional detail on our financials.
Despite the impact of seasonally slow -- a seasonally slow quarter in Optimum East, we added nearly 5,000 total Optimum customer relationships company-wide during the third quarter. In addition, we experienced net video subscriber losses that were nearly 50% lower than those experienced in the third quarter of 2011.
Total Optimum Online net additions rose by nearly 70% as compared with the third quarter of 2011. Third quarter net Optimum Voice additions were at a similar level to those achieved during the prior year period, despite a lower contribution from Optimum West.
Our financial performance continues to reflect the near-term impact of the operating and capital investments that we are making. Third quarter 2012 total company revenue grew 1.2% as compared with the third quarter of 2011. AOCF declined 6.6% versus the prior year period, primarily reflecting higher expenses in our core Cable business in the East.
There are a couple of factors that affect the year-over-year comparisons of these results. In the current year's third quarter, we reached a favorable settlement with one of our voice termination partners and in third quarter of 2011, our results reflect the impact of Hurricane Irene. Adjusting for these items, third quarter 2012 total company revenue increased 0.4% and consolidated AOCF declined 11.6% both as compared with the prior year period.
As expected, third quarter 2012 capital expenditures increased significantly as compared with third quarter of last year. This increased level of investment and higher operating cost impacted free cash flow which was $78 million for the quarter. We continue to be committed to our return of capital initiatives. We repurchased approximately 4 million shares of stock in the third quarter and on October 24, the board declared a $0.15 per share quarterly dividend, which is payable later this month.
Last month, we announced the resolution of the long-standing contractual dispute between VOOM and dish network. Gregg will have a few more words to say on this matter but suffice it to say, we are pleased with the settlement.
Finally, I'd like to address the recent press reports about our Optimum West business. As we have stated previously, we are confident in the prospects for growth at Optimum West and we are pleased with our progress to date. In recent weeks, a number of parties expressed their unsolicited interest in possibly acquiring Optimum West. While it's not been our intention to divest this valuable asset, based on the approaches that we received, we have decided to explore a potential transaction. Gregg will also have a little bit more to say regarding this matter.
Turning to operations. In October, we completed the conversion of the balance of our Optimum East analog customers to our digital service and we reached a major milestone when we rolled out our new Optimum program guide to hundreds of thousands of our customers' set-top boxes. We've completely reinvented the program guide to make everything about the Optimum experience better. The new guide has a redesigned look and feel and a faster and easier and more intelligent user interface. It allows viewers to search and easily access programming across live and on-demand channels, and it includes a variety of advanced tools that allows subscribers to customize their television experience. It also incorporates high-quality graphics and video, delivers fast tuning between channels and provides significantly faster reboot times than our prior program guide.
The Optimum program guide is a very significant undertaking and I am very pleased that our initial set-top box rollout has begun.
During the third quarter, we released a new version of our DVR Plus user interface as well as a new and improved video search function. This new DVR Plus release incorporates several new features, including improved content management tools such as the ability to organize recorded content into folders. Our new search function, Search 2.0, allows customers to search programs using an improved full-screen keyboard, saving retrieved recent searches, access recommended and featured programmings -- programs and the search programs with similar cast members and directors.
In addition to enhancing our Optimum Video platform, we've successfully negotiated several new programming agreements in the past few months. We've completed new agreements with the NFL, Univision, CBS, the Disney and ESPN networks, NBC and Tribune. Through these agreements, we're expanding the programming available to our Optimum customers and providing them with more opportunities to access live and on-demand content, both within the home and outside of the home on multiple devices.
In addition to our video products, progress relating to our various other initiatives continues as well. We have now deployed more than 50,000 indoor and outdoor Optimum WiFi access points. In addition to adding coverage, we continue to invest to enhance the speed, capacity and connectivity of our WiFi network in order to meet the demand from the growing number of devices accessing our network. 
Over 2 billion megabytes of data passed through our WiFi network in the third quarter, more than twice the amount as compared to the 2011 period.
Finally, in September, we relaunched the Optimum brand and unveiled our new Optimum logo. The Optimum brand relaunch focuses on our customers and the meaningful connections we enable through our Optimum products and technology, as well as our vision of providing the highest level of service through all of our customer connections.
Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we are making on our various operating initiatives. But more importantly, I'm extremely proud of the tremendous response efforts made by our employees and leadership team in the wake of last week's storm.
In addition to our field teams, network operations staff and customer service representatives who are responding admirably to our customers' needs, our local media properties have done an incredible job of keeping people informed and providing them with critical information across multiple platforms before, during and after the storm. I thank them all for their dedication to our customers and to our company.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Seibert."
25933,222945735,379352,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2012",2012-11-06,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim noted, we added approximately 5,000 net new customer relationships in the quarter as compared with the customer loss of nearly 15,000 in the comparable 2011 period. We also added approximately 28,000 high",1409,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim noted, we added approximately 5,000 net new customer relationships in the quarter as compared with the customer loss of nearly 15,000 in the comparable 2011 period. We also added approximately 28,000 high-speed data customers and 22,000 voice customers company-wide. We lost just under 9,600 net video subscribers company-wide in the third quarter. Again, this was approximately half of the 19,000 net video customer losses that we experienced in the third quarter of 2011.
Average revenue per video subscriber across all properties was $154.83 in the third quarter, an increase of $3.12 as compared with the prior year period. RPS declined a bit sequentially, reflecting lower pay-per-view usage and advertising revenue, partially offset by the favorable settlement with one of our voice termination partners. RPS, excluding the impact of the settlement, was $153.53.
Average revenue per customer relationship was $138.44 in the third quarter.
As compared with the prior year, total Cable rental for the quarter increased 1.4%, principally reflecting additional data and voice subscribers, higher advertising revenue and the impact of the voice termination settlement. This growth was partially offset by the year-over-year reduction in video subscribers, the absence of a rate increase and the impact of certain promotional pricing. Excluding the impact of the voice termination settlement, Cable revenue growth would have been 1/2 of 1%.
Total Cable advertising revenue in the third quarter was up over 12% compared with last year's third quarter. This growth reflects increased political spending in the quarter at both the national level as well as continued improvements in automotive and Pay TV services, partially offset by reduced financial sector advertising.
Total Cable AOCF declined 5.8% in the third quarter as compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the voice termination settlement and the impact of Hurricane Irene, this decline would have been 10.7%.
Optimum East AOCF declined by 7.9%, reflecting higher programming costs and an increase in other operating expenses, primarily nonexecutive employee compensation. Excluding the impact of the voice settlement and the current year's third quarter and the impact of Hurricane Irene during last year's third quarter, Optimum East AOCF would've declined 12.9% compared to the prior year third quarter.
Optimum East's third quarter AOCF margin was 34.2%, down from 37.4% during the prior year quarter. We expect that the AOCF margin will continue to remain under pressure as we continue to absorb the impact of our operational initiatives and higher programming costs.
Turning to Optimum West. We gained approximately 1,500 video subscribers, 2,500 voice subscribers and 8,700 data subscribers in the third quarter of 2012. Total Optimum West customer relationships increased by approximately 6,200, driven primarily by an increase in data-only customers, including through a new returning student offer.
Average revenue per video subscriber for Optimum West was $141.19 in the third quarter, up nearly $12 since the third quarter of last year. Revenue was up 9.3% primarily due to higher video and data revenues and AOCF increased 23.4%. The AOCF margin for Optimum West was 35.6% in the third quarter.
As discussed on last quarter's call, in July, Optimum West received a favorable judgment relating to its dispute with the Montana Department of Revenue. The court determined that all disputed property tax assessments were invalid and it directed the Department of Revenue to refund the amounts under protest. The tax authority exercised its right to appeal this judgment in September. As you may recall, we made a protest payment of $5.5 million in the second quarter. Until the appeal is resolved, we expect to continue to make semiannual protest payments to the Montana Tax Authority. As such, we anticipate making another 2012 protest payment in the fourth quarter in the amount of approximately $4.6 million.
Total capital spending in the third quarter was $297 million, reflecting a $79 million increase at Optimum East as compared to 2011. This increase principally reflects investments in customer premise equipment and scalable infrastructure, primarily related to the digitization of our Cable network, the buildout of our WiFi network and our RS-DVR product.
Capital spending for Optimum West was $19 million in the quarter, $9 million less than in the third quarter of 2011. The decline primarily reflects lower spending in 2012 on the fiber ring connecting our Optimum West systems. The ring currently connects nearly 90% of our Optimum West subscribers and allows us to provide these customers with faster Internet speeds and over 100 channels of HD programming.
As we continue to execute our 2012 plan, we expect fourth quarter 2012 capital expenditures to be significantly higher than during the comparable 2011 period.
At Optimum Lightpath, revenue increased 4.9% as compared with the third quarter of last year. AOCF increased by 7.8% over the prior year period.
Turning to the company's financial position. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the third quarter was $78 million, a 9% decline from the prior year period. The company's third quarter consolidated cash position was $439 million and net debt was $10.3 billion. We had $1.19 billion undrawn and available under the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings.
In the third quarter, we executed a number of successful financing transactions, further extending our debt maturity profile. In September, we issued $750 million of 10-year 5.875% senior notes at Cablevision Systems Corporation. These notes carry the lowest fixed-rate at Cablevision or CSC Holdings in the company's history. The net proceeds were invested in CSC Holdings to facilitate the tender for approximately $400 million of its 8.5% senior notes due 2014 and 2015, as well as the repayment of $150 million of its Term Loan B-2 debt facility. The balance of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.
In October, we refinanced Newsday's $525 million, 10.5% fixed-rate notes and it's $125 million floating rate notes priced at LIBOR plus 6.25% with a new $650 million term loan facility, priced at LIBOR plus 3.5%. This transaction is expected to result in significant interest expense savings over the 4-year term of the new credit facility.
In calculating our total company leverage, AOCF is determined using the latest quarter annualized AOCF. As a result, our leverage ratios continue to be somewhat volatile as they are more highly sensitive to changes in quarterly AOCF than they would be if our leverage were measured based on a trailing 12-month AOCF metric.
At September 30, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 5.1x. The CSC Holdings' restricted group leverage ratio was 3.6x. At quarter end, present and net debt was approximately $1 billion and $75 million was undrawn and available under its revolving credit facility. The leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.1x, down from the second quarter ratio of 6.5x.
Turning to Cablevision's stock repurchase program. As Jim noted, in the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares of Cablevision stock for $61.1 million. This investment reflects a reduction of approximately 1.9% of outstanding Class A shares. From inception of the program through the end of the third quarter, we've repurchased 45.3 million Class A shares. As of the end of the third quarter, we had over $450 million of remaining stock repurchase authorization.
We are working with AMC Networks to finalize the allocation of the VOOM litigation settlement proceeds in accordance with the terms of our existing letter agreement with AMC and our related party transaction approval policy. At this time, we will not have any comments relating to the allocation of these proceeds between the 2 companies or the possible use of our portion of the settlement proceeds.
With regards to Clearview sentiments, we continue to explore potential strategic alternatives for the business. The process is ongoing and we have no further update at this time.
As Jim indicated, we are very confident in Bresnan's prospects for growth and we're very pleased with our progress to date. However, consistent with our approach of balancing our investable resources to the extent an attractive transaction is presented to us, we plan to pursue it. However, there can be no assurance that we will conclude a sale or go with the opportunity to continue to execute our business plan. Beyond this, we'll have no further comments on this matter at this time.
Finally, we have not yet estimated the full financial impact of last week's storm on our company. Suffice it to say that the impact could be significant. 
Operator, please open the call for questions."

But I think more importantly, what we've been doing is we've been continuing to issue our new paper up at Cablevision Systems Corp., up at the parent company. We've been using the proceeds from those financings to reduce the leverage and the amount of debt outstanding at our primary holding company -- I'm sorry, primary operating company, CSC Holdings and so we brought our leverage at the operating company down to 3.6x, which I think has been a nice improvement for our overall balance sheet and capital structure."

I don't think that that's a sustainable model for them and that they will eventually need to go to regular pricing.

And actually, I will say that during the storm, I know you don't want to talk about the storm, but during the storm, we were providing information to the power companies about where their power was on and where their power was off. And our whole -- and we focused very heavily in our data resources and about -- and our connectivity with our customer base and we're seeing -- we're starting to now see significant improvements and I believe that in the next year, you'll see a great deal of that actually impact the customers. They'll see significant improvement in their service, improvement in the products that they -- and so, we are getting through them.

So again, we've had these unsolicited indications, we're going to listen to them. But again, there's no assurance a transaction is going to take place here. That said, the tax benefits that we were receiving from Bresnan were not in the form of NOLs which just added to our NOL. It was basically an asset step-up and so, that was going to basically, run through our financials over, let's say, at least an 8 to 10-year term. My tax guy is holding up 6 fingers across the table so I would say, over a 6-year term for both of them. But the more important event that could affect our NOL, which was $1.8 billion at the end of the quarter, will be the ultimate distribution of the proceeds from the VOOM litigation because certainly, some of the cash that we would expect to receive there would be taxable and would reduce the NOL.

The storm cut a pathway of destruction up the entire East Coast, and our thoughts and prayers are with everyone who has been affected. In our Optimum East service area, we began our preparations before the storm hit, implementing a thorough response plan that included positioning resources where we believe they would be most needed. Many of the measures that we put in place were in response to lessons learned during Hurricane Irene.
We recently reviewed and revised all of our hurricane response plans and took numerous proactive steps prior to the storm, including deploying emergency staff, testing generators and stocking fuel and securing additional contract labor to assist in the recovery. As soon as it was safe for our people to get into the field, they began responding to service outages and they haven't stopped. However, the loss of electrical power was the primary cause of widespread disruptions of Optimum service, particularly in heavily impacted areas of Long Island, New Jersey, Connecticut and Westchester County. Our crews continue to restore Optimum service as quickly as possible as power returns to our customers.
Our data as of 8:00 a.m. this morning indicates that more than 2.7 million of our Optimum East customers have electrical power and also have their Optimum service, but approximately 535,000 Cablevision households still have no power.
Our Optimum WiFi hotspots have helped many of our customers to stay connected and we currently have approximately 47,000 hot spots operational across the tri-state region. Despite widespread power outages, more than 22,000 of our hotspots were accessible to our customers throughout the storm and during the days immediately following. Restoring service to our customers is our near singular focus right now. However, I realize that the primary purpose of this call is to review our third quarter results, so I'm going to now turn to briefly review the quarter and let Gregg provide some additional detail on our financials.
Despite the impact of seasonally slow -- a seasonally slow quarter in Optimum East, we added nearly 5,000 total Optimum customer relationships company-wide during the third quarter. In addition, we experienced net video subscriber losses that were nearly 50% lower than those experienced in the third quarter of 2011.
Total Optimum Online net additions rose by nearly 70% as compared with the third quarter of 2011. Third quarter net Optimum Voice additions were at a similar level to those achieved during the prior year period, despite a lower contribution from Optimum West.
Our financial performance continues to reflect the near-term impact of the operating and capital investments that we are making. Third quarter 2012 total company revenue grew 1.2% as compared with the third quarter of 2011. AOCF declined 6.6% versus the prior year period, primarily reflecting higher expenses in our core Cable business in the East.
There are a couple of factors that affect the year-over-year comparisons of these results. In the current year's third quarter, we reached a favorable settlement with one of our voice termination partners and in third quarter of 2011, our results reflect the impact of Hurricane Irene. Adjusting for these items, third quarter 2012 total company revenue increased 0.4% and consolidated AOCF declined 11.6% both as compared with the prior year period.
As expected, third quarter 2012 capital expenditures increased significantly as compared with third quarter of last year. This increased level of investment and higher operating cost impacted free cash flow which was $78 million for the quarter. We continue to be committed to our return of capital initiatives. We repurchased approximately 4 million shares of stock in the third quarter and on October 24, the board declared a $0.15 per share quarterly dividend, which is payable later this month.
Last month, we announced the resolution of the long-standing contractual dispute between VOOM and dish network. Gregg will have a few more words to say on this matter but suffice it to say, we are pleased with the settlement.
Finally, I'd like to address the recent press reports about our Optimum West business. As we have stated previously, we are confident in the prospects for growth at Optimum West and we are pleased with our progress to date. In recent weeks, a number of parties expressed their unsolicited interest in possibly acquiring Optimum West. While it's not been our intention to divest this valuable asset, based on the approaches that we received, we have decided to explore a potential transaction. Gregg will also have a little bit more to say regarding this matter.
Turning to operations. In October, we completed the conversion of the balance of our Optimum East analog customers to our digital service and we reached a major milestone when we rolled out our new Optimum program guide to hundreds of thousands of our customers' set-top boxes. We've completely reinvented the program guide to make everything about the Optimum experience better. The new guide has a redesigned look and feel and a faster and easier and more intelligent user interface. It allows viewers to search and easily access programming across live and on-demand channels, and it includes a variety of advanced tools that allows subscribers to customize their television experience. It also incorporates high-quality graphics and video, delivers fast tuning between channels, and provides significantly faster reboot times than our prior program guide.
The Optimum program guide is a very significant undertaking and I am very pleased that our initial set-top box rollout has begun.
During the third quarter, we released a new version of our DVR Plus user interface as well as a new and improved video search function. This new DVR Plus release incorporates several new features, including improved content management tools such as the ability to organize recorded content into folders. Our new search function, Search 2.0, allows customers to search programs using an improved full-screen keyboard, saving retrieved recent searches, access recommended and featured programmings -- programs and the search programs with similar cast members and directors.
In addition to enhancing our Optimum Video platform, we've successfully negotiated several new programming agreements in the past few months. We've completed new agreements with the NFL, Univision, CBS, the Disney and ESPN networks, NBC and Tribune. Through these agreements, we're expanding the programming available to our Optimum customers and providing them with more opportunities to access live and on-demand content, both within the home and outside of the home on multiple devices.
In addition to our video products, progress relating to our various other initiatives continues as well. We have now deployed more than 50,000 indoor and outdoor Optimum WiFi access points. In addition to adding coverage, we continue to invest to enhance the speed, capacity and connectivity of our WiFi network in order to meet the demand from the growing number of devices accessing our network. 
Over 2 billion megabytes of data passed through our WiFi network in the third quarter, more than twice the amount as compared to the 2011 period.
Finally, in September, we relaunched the Optimum brand and unveiled our new Optimum logo. The Optimum brand relaunch focuses on our customers and the meaningful connections we enable through our Optimum products and technology, as well as our vision of providing the highest level of service through all of our customer connections.
Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we are making on our various operating initiatives. But more importantly, I'm extremely proud of the tremendous response efforts made by our employees and leadership team in the wake of last week's storm.
In addition to our field teams, network operations staff and customer service representatives who are responding admirably to our customers' needs, our local media properties have done an incredible job of keeping people informed and providing them with critical information across multiple platforms before, during and after the storm. I thank them all for their dedication to our customers and to our company.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Seibert."
25933,222945735,379529,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2012",2012-11-06,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim noted, we added approximately 5,000 net new customer relationships in the quarter as compared with the customer loss of nearly 15,000 in the comparable 2011 period. We also added approximately 28,000 high",1409,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim noted, we added approximately 5,000 net new customer relationships in the quarter as compared with the customer loss of nearly 15,000 in the comparable 2011 period. We also added approximately 28,000 high-speed data customers and 22,000 voice customers company-wide. We lost just under 9,600 net video subscribers company-wide in the third quarter. Again, this was approximately half of the 19,000 net video customer losses that we experienced in the third quarter of 2011.
Average revenue per video subscriber across all properties was $154.83 in the third quarter, an increase of $3.12 as compared with the prior year period. RPS declined a bit sequentially, reflecting lower pay-per-view usage and advertising revenue, partially offset by the favorable settlement with one of our voice termination partners. RPS, excluding the impact of the settlement, was $153.53.
Average revenue per customer relationship was $138.44 in the third quarter.
As compared with the prior year, total Cable rental for the quarter increased 1.4%, principally reflecting additional data and voice subscribers, higher advertising revenue and the impact of the voice termination settlement. This growth was partially offset by the year-over-year reduction in video subscribers, the absence of a rate increase and the impact of certain promotional pricing. Excluding the impact of the voice termination settlement, Cable revenue growth would have been 1/2 of 1%.
Total Cable advertising revenue in the third quarter was up over 12% compared with last year's third quarter. This growth reflects increased political spending in the quarter at both the national level as well as continued improvements in automotive and Pay TV services, partially offset by reduced financial sector advertising.
Total Cable AOCF declined 5.8% in the third quarter as compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the voice termination settlement and the impact of Hurricane Irene, this decline would have been 10.7%.
Optimum East AOCF declined by 7.9%, reflecting higher programming costs and an increase in other operating expenses, primarily nonexecutive employee compensation. Excluding the impact of the voice settlement and the current year's third quarter and the impact of Hurricane Irene during last year's third quarter, Optimum East AOCF would've declined 12.9% compared to the prior year third quarter.
Optimum East's third quarter AOCF margin was 34.2%, down from 37.4% during the prior year quarter. We expect that the AOCF margin will continue to remain under pressure as we continue to absorb the impact of our operational initiatives and higher programming costs.
Turning to Optimum West. We gained approximately 1,500 video subscribers, 2,500 voice subscribers and 8,700 data subscribers in the third quarter of 2012. Total Optimum West customer relationships increased by approximately 6,200, driven primarily by an increase in data-only customers, including through a new returning student offer.
Average revenue per video subscriber for Optimum West was $141.19 in the third quarter, up nearly $12 since the third quarter of last year. Revenue was up 9.3% primarily due to higher video and data revenues and AOCF increased 23.4%. The AOCF margin for Optimum West was 35.6% in the third quarter.
As discussed on last quarter's call, in July, Optimum West received a favorable judgment relating to its dispute with the Montana Department of Revenue. The court determined that all disputed property tax assessments were invalid and it directed the Department of Revenue to refund the amounts under protest. The tax authority exercised its right to appeal this judgment in September. As you may recall, we made a protest payment of $5.5 million in the second quarter. Until the appeal is resolved, we expect to continue to make semiannual protest payments to the Montana Tax Authority. As such, we anticipate making another 2012 protest payment in the fourth quarter in the amount of approximately $4.6 million.
Total capital spending in the third quarter was $297 million, reflecting a $79 million increase at Optimum East as compared to 2011. This increase principally reflects investments in customer premise equipment and scalable infrastructure, primarily related to the digitization of our Cable network, the buildout of our WiFi network and our RS-DVR product.
Capital spending for Optimum West was $19 million in the quarter, $9 million less than in the third quarter of 2011. The decline primarily reflects lower spending in 2012 on the fiber ring connecting our Optimum West systems. The ring currently connects nearly 90% of our Optimum West subscribers and allows us to provide these customers with faster Internet speeds and over 100 channels of HD programming.
As we continue to execute our 2012 plan, we expect fourth quarter 2012 capital expenditures to be significantly higher than during the comparable 2011 period.
At Optimum Lightpath, revenue increased 4.9% as compared with the third quarter of last year. AOCF increased by 7.8% over the prior year period.
Turning to the company's financial position. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the third quarter was $78 million, a 9% decline from the prior year period. The company's third quarter consolidated cash position was $439 million and net debt was $10.3 billion. We had $1.19 billion undrawn and available under the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings.
In the third quarter, we executed a number of successful financing transactions, further extending our debt maturity profile. In September, we issued $750 million of 10-year 5.875% senior notes at Cablevision Systems Corporation. These notes carry the lowest fixed-rate at Cablevision or CSC Holdings in the company's history. The net proceeds were invested in CSC Holdings to facilitate the tender for approximately $400 million of its 8.5% senior notes due 2014 and 2015, as well as the repayment of $150 million of its Term Loan B-2 debt facility. The balance of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.
In October, we refinanced Newsday's $525 million, 10.5% fixed-rate notes and it's $125 million floating rate notes priced at LIBOR plus 6.25% with a new $650 million term loan facility, priced at LIBOR plus 3.5%. This transaction is expected to result in significant interest expense savings over the 4-year term of the new credit facility.
In calculating our total company leverage, AOCF is determined using the latest quarter annualized AOCF. As a result, our leverage ratios continue to be somewhat volatile as they are more highly sensitive to changes in quarterly AOCF than they would be if our leverage were measured based on a trailing 12-month AOCF metric.
At September 30, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 5.1x. The CSC Holdings' restricted group leverage ratio was 3.6x. At quarter end, present and net debt was approximately $1 billion and $75 million was undrawn and available under its revolving credit facility. The leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.1x, down from the second quarter ratio of 6.5x.
Turning to Cablevision's stock repurchase program. As Jim noted, in the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares of Cablevision stock for $61.1 million. This investment reflects a reduction of approximately 1.9% of outstanding Class A shares. From inception of the program through the end of the third quarter, we've repurchased 45.3 million Class A shares. As of the end of the third quarter, we had over $450 million of remaining stock repurchase authorization.
We are working with AMC Networks to finalize the allocation of the VOOM litigation settlement proceeds in accordance with the terms of our existing letter agreement with AMC and our related party transaction approval policy. At this time, we will not have any comments relating to the allocation of these proceeds between the 2 companies or the possible use of our portion of the settlement proceeds.
With regards to Clearview sentiments, we continue to explore potential strategic alternatives for the business. The process is ongoing and we have no further update at this time.
As Jim indicated, we are very confident in Bresnan's prospects for growth and we're very pleased with our progress to date. However, consistent with our approach of balancing our investable resources to the extent an attractive transaction is presented to us, we plan to pursue it. However, there can be no assurance that we will conclude a sale or go with the opportunity to continue to execute our business plan. Beyond this, we'll have no further comments on this matter at this time.
Finally, we have not yet estimated the full financial impact of last week's storm on our company. Suffice it to say that the impact could be significant.
