Before I get into the details on Slide 3, let me just tell you what we're going to try to accomplish this morning. I thought I'd start by saying a few words about the merger announcement from last week. We'll move quickly into what we've accomplished in 2011. I think the most important focus this morning will be to outline our plan for creating value for shareholders in the quarters to come. So let me just dispense with the merger first if I may.
It is our view -- it was our view and I think it continues to be our view that the proposed merger was a great opportunity to accelerate our strategy. It was a great opportunity to create long-term value for shareholders, and we also believe that will provide substantial benefits with regard to capital efficiencies for the capital markets community. However, given the narrow market definition the Commission chose to use when evaluating the transaction, it was my view that the industrial logic of the transaction would've been significantly compromised if we agreed to make the Commission's demand for revenues, and we were not going to violate the trust that the shareholders placed on us when they voted to support the deal this past summer. So the deal is done, it's behind us and I want to be very, very clear about that. I'd like to close that remark by thanking the shareholders, the customers and, most importantly, our employees for their patience and support during this process. I'm still glad we tried, but unfortunately the outcome was not what we hoped for. 
So now let's move onto 2011. I'm extremely pleased to share our full year 2011 results with you, which as you can see were characterized by a 6% increase in revenue, a 21% increase in operating income and a 19% increase in both net income and earnings per share. The results were driven by strong trading volumes, continued cost discipline and more meaningful contributions from new initiatives. We beat our cost guidance for the year. The cost declined 4% on a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis, and we were well below $200 million in CapEx. While we fell short of our target of 15% revenue growth in our NYSE Technologies business, we did achieve double-digit revenue growth under challenging market conditions and the uncertainty for clients that was created by the proposed merger. 
On the business front, we made significant progress in growing our NYSE Liffe U.S. business with the launch of interest rate derivatives and the migration of the MSCI Emerging Markets and stock index futures to our exchange. Open interest in these products has nearly doubled since the migration and open interest across the entire exchange surpassed the $1 million contracts marked in December.
Our approach to semimutualization has also paid off in our NYSE Amex options business, where we worked with our partners to continue to grow the business in 2011. Together with NYSE arc options, we grew our market share to a record 28%, which was #1 in U.S. equity options. We were also the global leader in IPOs in 2011, 3x the total proceeds rates by our nearest U.S. competitor who was ranked #8 globally. We continue to make progress in 2012 with big wins in the text sector as well as continued momentum on the transfer side. Since the beginning of 2010, we have had nearly 3x the number of companies transferred to the NYSE as opposed to away from the NYSE.
The strategy in the Technologies business continued to make strong inroad into Asia in particular with our acquisition of Metabit and the deepening of our relationship with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 
Overall, as you look at Slide 3, if you look at what we accomplished in 2011 and then remember that we also moved a transformational cross-border exchange merger further than any other, the ability to have done both is a testament to the team here and our relentless focus on execution that has become a hallmark of our company. Outside of the post trade arena, where we slowed the building of our own clearinghouse, we really did not miss a beat last year. Now with 2011 behind us, the key is what are the next steps in the evolution of our company? The next several slides that I'll walk through will address the measures we are going to take to grow the company, guided by our community strategy that has accelerated our growth the last couple of years. A more detailed presentation of these efforts will come on April 2 at our Investor Day.
Please turn to Slide 4. On Slide 4, we highlight in the firm our community strategy and give you the 3 pillars that will drive multiyear earnings growth for NYSE Euronext, assuming only modest improvements in the underlying operating environment. If you look back to 2009 and '10, those were the years when were finishing our global technology harmonization and building out our data centers as part of our capital markets community strategy. While the work that we accomplished during that time set the table for 2011 where we saw a step-up in earnings power and delivery. Despite the challenging near-term outlook for trading volumes, we remain optimistic about the future. We have within our control several levers that we can pull to drive earnings higher, again with just modest improvements in the operating environment.
These levers are the 3 pillars of our equity story we are laying out for you today and, again, greater detail will be provided at the Investor Day in a few weeks. To look at the right side of the slide, the first pillar is focused on targeted growth opportunities. First, we'll be rolling out a series of organically grown new products and services while continuing to focus on market structure innovation in our core markets. Our portfolio of post trade services will be a key priority in 2012. We have a solid clearing footprint in both Europe and the U.S. which we will now build on to improve our existing businesses and to create new service opportunities. Next, we are expecting NYSE Technologies to continue its double-digit growth trajectory, with enhanced managed service capabilities and expanded connectivity and data offerings. And lastly, in the targeted growth opportunity area, we are looking to NYSE Liffe U.S. to accelerate its growth with the possible addition of new partners and an expanded product portfolio.
Second pillar is cost efficiency. Looking back to our merger with Euronext, since that time we have pulled out over $600 million from the cost base. This has involved hard decisions about our organizational construct as well as changing the way we do business, this rigor will continue. Next, we will continue to examine our investment portfolio and exit those that are loss-making and or not expected to achieve the anticipated level of revenue generation, as we prioritize our set of growth initiatives. We are also examining our infrastructure to be sure that we are optimally structured for our current and future operational needs. 
The last pillar of our story is strategic capital deployment. Over the past several years, we have returned approximately $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are pledging to continue our shareholder focus with the recently announced $550 million repurchase program. We have several stakes in other companies that in our opinion have limited strategic benefit or have not lived up to our expectations. We will continue to examine opportunities to harvest these investments and reallocate the capital to other more attractive opportunities.
Lastly, over the past year, we have seen some interesting opportunities on the M&A front, but we emphasized our hope for merger. We will now begin to look at potential complementary strategic M&A opportunities going forward. 
In the next few slides, I will focus on the first pillar of our growth story, and Mike will provide some further granularity on the other 2 pillars when he gets into his remarks.
Please turn to Slide 5. Slide 5 shows our strengths and opportunities and illustrate the compelling targeted revenue initiatives we have underway. You should recognize this slide which refers to introduce at our shareholder meeting last April. While the  DB merger would've helped us fill this chart out, we believe that we have several compelling opportunities on our own in many of these areas. On the right side of the chart, we show a sample of high potential initiatives that both enhance our areas of strength and move us beyond our core business. In addition to new product opportunities and derivatives and continued market structure innovation in our core markets, shown as number 6 on this chart, we have some key initiatives in areas of strength that include number 3, we will continue to build on the success we have achieved by partnering with our clients NYSE Amex and NYSE Liffe U.S. Number 4, we are enhancing our connectivity for NYSE Technologies with the expansion of our network of liquidity hubs around the globe. Number 5, we are looking to make investments in issuer services similar to our acquisition of Corporate Board Member and our minority stake in the receivables exchange, which we believe further enhance our listings brand. And lastly, number 7, we are focused on enhancing our managed services capabilities for NYSE Technologies. 
There are also some initiatives that we believe will extend our capabilities beyond our core business. Number 1, which you all know will be a key focus for us in 2012, will be completing the development of a post trade solution for our European derivatives and cash equities businesses. Number two, coming back to the U.S., we will be launching new products in NYSE Liffe U.S. and NYPC the next one of which was just announced will be a future base on DTC's GCF repo index. We hope this will continue to round out NYSE Liffe U.S. and NYPC's capitally efficient value proposition.
My next several slides will go into more detail on some of these opportunities. Please turn to Slide 6. Slide 6 focus is on our post trade portfolio, which as I just said, will be a critical area for us in 2012. As I said earlier, we have a strong clearing footprint in both Europe and the U.S. which we will now further develop to improve our existing business and to create new service opportunities. Our immediate focus in 2012 is in Europe, where we will firstly enhance our current derivatives post trade services with attractive new solutions, completing the buildout of NYSE Liffe Clear which I'll focus on in a minute. Secondly, part of the effort will be to develop new OTC clearing capabilities in collaboration with our users. And thirdly, we will review our European cash clearing options to make sure we select arrangements for the future which offer stability, capital efficiency and innovation for our customers.
Second area of focus which I just mentioned will be NYSE's Liffe Clearing in our overall derivatives platform. We made significant investments in NYSE Liffe Clearing through 2011, rolling out a new clearing process engine, the universal clearing platform, which delivered significant performance improvements to our customers. This technology investment program will continue through 2012 as we roll out new technology interfaces to improve customer service and latency. While some of our stand-alone post trade plans were put on hold in 2011, we have already relaunched our project to convert NYSE Liffe Clearing into a full-service CCP. These plans involve expanding the service to clear all of our European derivatives products and to deliver many of the operational and capital efficiencies for customers which we have envisioned in the merger. We will also develop the OTC clearing capabilities which I referenced earlier, and we will complete the removing of the reliance on third-party providers by introducing new in-house solutions for treasury management services.
We look forward to engaging with users to develop a full-service U.K. based clearinghouse which will offer operating and capital efficiencies, provide innovative solutions across listed and OTC markets and provide unrivaled level of customer service. With legislation beginning to crystallize on the new mandates which will be imposed for central clearing of derivatives, now is the right time in our opinion to be working with users to develop competitive clearing solutions that will meet their needs. The current derivatives clearing arrangements with LCH.Clearnet expire in the middle of next year. 
On the European cash clearing side, we're accelerating the review of the strategic options available for clearing our European cash markets. These markets are cleared by LCH.Clearnet in Paris with the current arrangements due to expire at the end of next year. No decisions have been taken on cash clearing and all options will now be reviewed with a view to promptly identify the most efficient, stable, secure and commercially appropriate solution for the future for our clients and for us.
And lastly, on the slide, a minute on New York Portfolio Clearing. NYPC was created last year to deliver unique capital efficiencies to the market by evaluating and margining a clearing member's risk on a portfolio basis across related cash and derivative positions. There are a number of expansion opportunities under active consideration for NYPC as I noted earlier. More to come in this important area on April 2.
Please turn to Slide 7. Slide 7 is an update on the NYSE Technologies business, which grew revenues by more than 10% year-over-year and will be a significant contributor to our future growth. We remain committed to the $1 billion revenue target in 2015 and committed as well for the margin of 25% to 30% in that business. Our strategic vision for this business is to become the facilitator and enabler of the capital markets community and the roadmap to achieve this vision is focused on 4 key tenets that will guide us as we innovate. We executed against each tenet in 2011 by introducing new products and services in each arena. On the right-hand side of the table, we show a handful on the significant deals that we signed last year. These wins in our mind validate the strategy we are pursuing. 
Let me briefly walk you through the 4 key tenet. First, building out the network. We recently opened new liquidity centers in Chicago, Toronto and Tokyo to give customers the ability to access new markets with unparalleled speed and reliability. In 2011, we also expanded our SFTI network into Mexico and the U.K., increasing direct connectivity to new markets and new participants. The acquired Metabit, which provides industry-leading access to financial markets across Asia, is accelerating our efforts in that region. Secondly, we are expanding our data services footprint. We rolled out the super feed product in Europe, connecting 30 markets to the access centers in London and Frankfurt. Super feed provides immediate access to our exchanges data but also to data from a range of key global markets across the SFTI network. Third, it's about building out the service platform. Two major initiatives were successfully launched in 2011 to reinforce our leading position as a service platform provider. We launched the Capital Markets Community Platform, the most secure, reliable and scalable financial services cloud computing environment in the industry. And we created a vendor neutral platform driven by the financial services technology community by open sourcing our Mahwah programming interface.
Lastly, we continue to be focus on attracting other market venues. In 2011, we successfully deployed the first fully hosted MTF and ATS solutions, confirming this is an important product for future growth and consistent with where we think our model can go. Add this to our successful partnerships in Tokyo and Warsaw and you can see why we believe that NYSE Technologies is poised for future double-digit revenue growth.
Please turn to Slide 8. On Slide 8 we show how partnering with our clients has helped grow our derivatives business. First, NYC Liffe U.S. 2011 was a key year for NYSE Liffe U.S. with our launch of its interest rate futures complex and the much-anticipated launch of NYPC, which was recently named the Most Innovative Clearinghouse in North America during 2011. The platform gained momentum from the launch of interest rate futures, as well as the successful migration of the MS E&I index futures. Since this migration in June of 2011, as I mentioned earlier, open interest in ADV and the MS E&I products has nearly doubled led by the emerging markets Index products. The platform's success in 2011 culminated with our crossing the $1 million contracts of open interest milestone in December. This was led by Eurodollar futures where our open interest now represents 10% market share. 2012 will be a critical year for this venture, and we are working on several new initiatives, including launching new your products such as options on futures, connecting new clearing members and adding new partners. These efforts should accelerate our progress.
The platform plans continue with innovation theme during 2012. As noted by our January 4 press release announcing that NYSE Liffe U.S . has obtained the exclusive license for futures based on the DTCC's GCF repo index futures. Market feedback since that announcement has been overwhelmingly positive. 
Finally, Rich Magazine recently named NYSE Liffe U.S. Exchange of the Year, so we're excited about the prospects for this venture in 2012 and beyond.
Next let me turn to NYSE Amex options. We have been very pleased with the growth of the NYSE Amex U.S> Equity Options business and the support of our partners. We have seen Amex market share growth from under 6% in the fourth quarter of 2008 to north of 15% in the fourth quarter of 2011. This growth has been possible in part due to our partners who now hold 47.5% of the venture. Several key achievements have been instrumental to success in this venture.
While we oppose the qualified contingent cross order type when IAC first proposed, given the SEC approval and our acknowledgment that we need to be competitive in the market, we launched the similar product and the early returns have been very positive.  
Another key addition this year was the complex order option functionality which allows customers to see rapid price improvement electronically. Lastly, Amex complex order book volume was up over 350% year-on-year. While we're pleased with our growth in this new space, further expansion remains a significant opportunity for us in 2012. 
Lastly for me, before I turn it over to Mike, please turn to Slide 9.
On Slide 9, we attempt to address a number of the elements in the macro environment that have created uncertainty. Here we depict the various clouds on the horizon, many of which we believe may also come with a silver lining. With a focus on those elements of our business model that we can control, combined with solid execution of our strategy, we are optimistic that these clouds will not materially impact our business in the near term and may actually afford us with some new unexpected opportunities. 
First, in terms of derivatives reform, we have always supported regulatory efforts that bring transparency and better risk management to the markets. To support these efforts, because it makes sense for our markets and will significantly reduce systemic risk, both EMEA and Europe and Dodd-Frank in the U.S. encourage derivatives to move towards a clear environment and we have been actively involved in the dialogue in both regions. But the overhang of these performance is causing uncertainty, changes in our clients business models and underinvestment. However, as banks look to reduce costs, we believe we are well-positioned to serve as a major provider of outsourced trading infrastructure to the sell side as they reinvent their own business models. And with capital becoming an increasingly scarce and valuable resource, capitally efficient clearing houses like NYPC are poised to offer a lot of value to the end users.
Next we all know we are operating in a lower volatility, lower growth environment driven by the lingering effects of the financial crisis, which is keeping rates at or near 0. This type of environment dampens volumes and results in even greater internalization in the U.S. cash markets as we witnessed in early 2012. On the flip side though, more stable markets mean companies are better able to raise capital in the public markets, which is good for our listings business as the pipeline loosens up. It also highlights the benefit of our diversified revenue model. If these lower volatility conditions persist, 2012 promises to be a very good year for capital issuance.
Uncertainty continues to persist around the euro as well and that is naturally taking a toll an investment and growth in Europe. However, the silver lining here is that spikes in volatility drive volume and the evolving landscape may also present new product opportunities for us in cash and particularly in derivatives. Tougher capital formation but good for transaction volumes. 
Lastly the financial transaction taxes received its fair share of headlines in recent months. We viewed the likelihood of a transaction tax as initially envisioned at the euro zone or EU level as increasingly unlikely. Currently, there are individual tax proposals being floated in France and Germany, and we may even see unilateral action in other countries, notably Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium. In France there is a reasonably strong likelihood that some form of stamp duty tax will pass, however, we believe the impact will be muted by the fact that it would be limited in scope and would exempt liquidity providers and market makers. In short, this is a politically charged issue and we expect it to stay in the headlines in the near term, but in the final analysis, we place a low probability on the implementation of an FTT in Europe that would severely impact this business. With that, let me turn the call over to Mike for a review of the financial results. Thanks."
189274,145599320,219258,"NYSE Euronext, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2012",2012-02-10,"Earnings Calls","NYSE Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full year 2011. This quarter there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.43 a share and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 a share. Previousl",1933,"Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full year 2011. This quarter there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.43 a share and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 a share. Previously communicated fourth quarter 2011 results include a $25 million pretax charge related to our settlement with French tax authorities on the blue VAT manner. In terms of P&L geography, the gross $42 million was recorded on the SG&A line with an offsetting $17 million recorded on the noncontrolling interest line reflecting the payment made by our 40% joint venture partner CDC. In the quarter, we also reported a $46 million charge for merger expenses and exit costs, which included $38 million related to the merger. 2011, a total of $85 million was spent on the merger. During the process of finalizing residual costs related to the merger and will communicate this on our first quarter call.
Lastly, we benefited this quarter from being able to take a tax deduction for merger-related costs now that the merger has been prohibited. 
Now review our financial results in this call forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs, blue neck tax settlement and the discrete tax item.
Slide 11 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the quarter and full-year. Versus Q4 prior year, revenues were up and expenses lower, driving a 13% increase in operating income and a 9% increase in EPS. EPS of $0.50 a share is below the unseasonably strong $0.71 recorded in the third quarter of 2011. The full year 2011 EPS, was $2.48, up 19% versus 2010. 
Operating environment began to change in Q4 as volatility lessened and trading volumes declined an average of 17% across all our trading venues from Q3. This trend continued into January of this year. Fortunately, our diversified portfolio enables us to weather these periods better than what's the case a few years ago. For 2011, 48% of our revenues was attributed to trading volumes. In the quarter, we grew nontrading related revenues both versus Q3 and prior year, as well as from continued cost discipline. Q4 operating margins increased to 34% and full-year margins climbed 5 percentage points to 38%. This is driven by incremental margins that were greater than 100% in the quarter and for the full year.
NYSE Amex options continued to perform well in the quarter with market share of 15% for Q4, our highest level of quarterly market share. For the quarter, the pretax profit attributable to the noncontrolling interest on Amex options was $9 million based on the 47.5% stake in the business held by our partners. For the full year, higher technology services revenue, stronger trading volumes in European cash and U.S. equity options combined with strong increases in U.S. average net revenue capture and a 1% decline in reported expenses drove double-digit increases in operating income and earnings. We generated $1.3 billion in adjusted EBITDA from full year 2011, the highest level of EBITDA generation since 2008.
Diluted share count was down slightly due to $100 million in share repurchases in the fourth quarter. 
Slide 12 and 13 detail the financial performance for our Derivatives segment. Derivatives accounted for 32% of our consolidated net revenues and 42% of our operating income in 2011. While revenues decreased by 1% in the quarter, it rose 4% for the full year. Volumes increased 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by a 15% increase in U.S. equity options, which offset a 3% decline in European derivatives. Revenue capture for the quarter was slightly favorable for NYSE Liffe versus both Q3 and prior year quarter, due principally to product mix and volumes, whereas capture for U.S. options was lower. 
As a reminder, beginning December 1, we modified pricing for the trading of individual equity options and index futures and options on NYSE Liffe Amsterdam and Belgium. These represent approximately 10% of total NYSE Liffe volumes in 2011. We expect this pricing change to decrease NYSE Liffe overall capture by an annualized 3% to 4%.
Duncan indicated Global Derivatives continue to be a major area of focus for future investment and growth. Our Liffe U.S. and NYPC businesses were still very much in investment pace for 2011, both reporting sizable offers. In 2012, we are planning incremental investments in building our European clearing capabilities and a new product and service offering.
Similarly, Slides 14 and 15 show the financial performance for our cash trading and listing segment. Cash trading and listing accounts for 50% of our consolidated net revenues and 47% of our operating income in 2011. Cash trading and listing's net revenues was $315 million in the fourth quarter 2011, up 2% versus prior year, but down 11% compared to the third quarter of 2011. European cash ADV of $1.6 million transactions increased 13% in the fourth quarter 2010 levels but decreased 17% from Q3 levels. The U.S. cash equities increased 5% to 2.1 billion shares last year and decreased 18% from strong third quarter levels.
Market share was down slightly in Q4 for U.S. cash and was 65% in our 4 European markets compared to 72% in the prior year. That said, European share was stable quarter on quarter. Listings revenue increased $5 million year-over-year and was up $24 million for the full year 2011. Slowed in the quarter, however, the pipeline is strong. Revenue capture for U.S. cash increased at $0.039 per 100 shares handled for Q4, well above the $0.033 recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010. In the second quarter of 2010, we have linked overall U.S. consolidated volumes. We moved the inversion at the highest tier on Arca and benefited from sponsored access rule changes.
Revenue capture for European cash decreased to $0.58 from $0.71 in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $0.64 in the third quarter of 2011. The decline in capture was driven primarily by reduction of fees and option and lower trade size, which began in August and continue through December. Basis points is up slightly versus Q3.
Slide 16 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. This segment accounted for 20% of our net revenues and 13% of our operating income in the fourth quarter. Information Services and Technology Solutions revenue was $127 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $30 million or 11% from Q4 prior year. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in SFTI and co-location revenue and growth from managed service sales, to TSE, Warsaw and Sigma X. Revenues for this segment have grown sequentially every quarter this year. For the year, our technology segment grew revenues 10% and expanded margins from 20% to 26%.
Slide 17 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expenses. The intense focus on the merger, we made excellent progress this year on reducing our operating expenses. Q4 expenses were favorable to our prior guidance attributed to high cost management, stronger U.S. dollar and a onetime savings realized from a real estate transaction in Europe. This quarter operating expenses were down $9 million versus last year on a reported basis. 38% of our expenses in Q4 denominated in either euros, 18% or pounds, 20%. After adjusting for FX and the impact of transactions such as NYSE Blue JV and the acquisition of Corporate Board Member and Metabit, these operating costs were down $16 million or 4% from the fourth quarter of 2010. 
2011 was reported fixed cost $12 million below 2010. However, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and changes to our portfolio, our expenditures were $70 million or 4% below prior year levels. This puts us well below the commitment we made to you in early 2010 that our expenses will be less than 1650 million on a constant dollar constant portfolio basis in 2011.
Slide 18 reconciles our cost evolution since 2007 merger with Euronext. Over this period we saved over $650 million on a constant portfolio basis. About 2/3 of the savings was reinvested through business acquisitions our new business start-ups. 2012 and 2013, cost efficiency will remain a priority. We see further opportunities to leverage resources efficiently for the benefit of the group, with the goal of achieving a community premium for the company. As Duncan mentioned, there are a number of target areas where we'll be seeking greater efficiency. We'll provide greater transparency on this at our Investor Day.
Slide 19 details our cash and deposition as of December 31, 2011. The company ended the year with a strong balance sheet position. Combination of EBITDA growing 15% and debt declining $300 million reduced our leverage ratio to 1.6x, down from 2.2x at the end of 2010. This is the lowest level of leverage since NYSE and Euronext merged. Capital expenditures were $54 million in the quarter compared to $61 million in the prior year quarter. For the year, capital expenditures were $170 million, well below our full-year guidance of less than $200 million in capital spending. 
We executed $100 million in stock repurchases during the fourth quarter as part of our $1 billion share outstanding. Repurchasing 3.7 million shares at an average price of $29.96. Total of $550 million remains on the existing share buyback authorization. These repurchases will be funded out of cash on hand in cash from operating activities through 2012.
These purchases at current stock price levels are highly accretive. We see our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation as a major enabler for future earnings growth. The merger now prohibited, we are in the process of building a multiyear plan to grow earnings and strategically position the company. We will dive deeper into this plan on our Investor Day on April 2. 
On Slide 20, we are providing some preliminary guidance for 2012. First, let me discuss revenue. Duncan discussed our growth priorities earlier in the presentation. We are targeting another year of double-digit growth for NYSE Technologies, and we expect margins to improve from the 26% level achieved in 2011. For the past 2 years we have invested heavily in our U.S. futures business, Liffe U.S. We expect the financials in this venture to improve in 2012 and by 2013 to turn profitable. 
Now let me turn to cloud. On a constant dollar basis, exclusive of new business initiatives and incremental M&A, we are guiding that fixed expenses for 2012 will be below the 2011 costs of $166 million. This includes absorbing incremental variable costs associated with higher technology revenues. As Duncan mentioned earlier, one of our key 2012 priorities will be the buildout of our post rate capabilities in Europe. We will provide more guidance on the cost and benefits of this initiative once we finalize our plan. Incremental expenses and capital spending is expected to have a favorable rate of return once we can report the clearing revenues and rationalize cost for LCH to handle risk management and trade functions for Liffe during.
Turning to capital. We expect CapEx in 2012 to be above last year's $170 million but still below our maintenance level of $200 million, due in part to incremental capital spending to build our clearing capability. The $550 million buyback will become effective after today's earnings. We expect to complete the buyback in 2012. We're confirming our long-term financial policy of targeting debt levels between 2x and 2.25x EBITDA. Lastly on taxes, we anticipate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 26% for 2012.
Now I'll turn the call back to Duncan for some concluding remarks before we open the line for questions."

So just to summarize. The results for the quarter and full year 2011 were solid, driven by strong volumes, continued cost discipline and increasing contributions from our nontrading businesses as a result of our diversification efforts over the past few years. We are pleased with the progress we are making on our strategy to create a global capital markets community that will empower our clients to innovate and collaborate. And as we move to through 2012, we're you're not sitting still waiting for the operating environment to improve. We are focusing on those levers within our control to execute against our community strategy and to expand our ability to generate underlying earnings per share growth. As we've said, this will be accomplished through a mix of targeted revenue-generating initiatives, accelerated cost efficiency efforts and strategic capital deployment. As we talked about, we've already executed recently $100 million of stock repurchases at a price just below $27 and our announced $550 million additional share repurchase program will begin immediately. So with that, we're happy to open the lines for questions. We'll have time to take a few questions and then as always, we'll make ourselves available to the analyst community throughout the day.

I think we did manage that post the data center build, we thought maintenance level CapEx would come down to a number south of $200 million. And I think it did. I think you're right, Roger. I think it would've been a little higher last year if we had continued to invest in the completion of the buildout of Liffe Clear. I still think it would have have been under $200 million, but it would have been a little bit higher. So I think we're trying to reflect that as we sort of look at what the CapEx for '12 looks like. I do honestly believe having stayed very close to some of the big banking customers in terms of their needs to reinvent their business, but in fairness to them, as they were thinking about the big outsourcing decision in 2011 and looking it out saying okay I understand the value proposition, can you tell me with certainty where your data centers and where your hubs are going to be in 2012 and beyond, I think it would've been disingenuous of us to represent that that was a certainty given  what was going on with the merger, the various technology platform discussions that were being held. So I think it was an easy decision for them to put off for the time being. And I think we now need to revisit with them, and I think that's one of the reasons among several, that we think the Technology business double-digit revenue growth is pretty easily achieved in 2012 as far as we can tell given that we know some of those decisions were put on hold. And lastly, as I've said to some of you before, yes, this was certainly a drain on a few of us. A few of us were back and forth to Europe quite a bit. At the same time, our strategy was to involve as few people as possible in executing the merger. And what I mean by that is my philosophy was to take a meaningful percentage of a handful of people's time instead of a very small percentage of a lot of peoples time. So I think people like Mike and Larry have been able to stay very focused on the task at hand, which is why we feel better about going in to '12. I do think you're right, there are lot of near-term opportunities whether it's around clearing or the technology business or just a return rigor on capital deployment, which we obviously largely put on hold last year even though we were generating a ton of free cash flow then I think get us pretty excited about 2012. Lastly, I share your excitement in keeping the team together, that is one of the side benefits. And we had a team led by Larry that has been focusing on what would happen if the merger were approved, and that's why I think we've been able to be a week after prohibition able to give you as much information as we've given on the call this morning.

And I think full responsibility for having put that project on hold in 2011, some of our best people are already reengaged, they have been for a few weeks now and off they go. So I think we'll be able to give as Larry said a lot more clarity on some of the milestones for that, the timing of all that, et cetera. On the cash side, as we've said before, I don't think it's nearly as strategic, but that doesn't mean it's not imported commercially to us. Those of you who have been with us for a while will remember that going back a few years ago, the cost of those services provided to us were quite high, which meant it was quite high for our customers because it was just a pass through. So while we reduced those costs significantly in the last couple of years, I do believe that they are still priced -- our providers still prices them above the market and I think we have some work to do there to either strike commercially viable agreement with them or think about other options there. As far as LCH goes, I think it's fair to say we'd obviously be very interested in what happens with that asset. We own nearly 10% of the company. We have a Board seat and we're the enterprise's largest customer. We think that the company has a great deal of potential under leadership. I think he's been doing a great job since he got in there. But whether it's LCH or the alliance, as you referred to with DB1, I think given the shifting landscape and the clients need for capital efficiency, I think it would be foolish for us not to consider any and all go-forward alliances that will make sense between various exchanges and clearing organizations. Ultimately, it has to be all about the customer. And if there are things we could all do together to provide some of those cash capital efficiencies that people may not be able to do individually, we should certainly consider that. I think the alliance we have with DTC and NYPC is a great example of that. That was pretty much unprecedented. And I think that puts us in position to provide capital efficiency that neither we nor DTC could do alone. So hopefully, that gets most of your question, Alex."

When this was first floated as much as a year ago, I think it was a lot more draconian than it sort of evolved to. I think common sense has prevailed and people realized that the policymakers in Europe I think have come to realize that while it sounds good on paper, when you get down to the details and talk about how to implement it, you realize that if it's not implemented broadly and pretty consistently, it gets challenging at best. And I think policymakers also realize that it's not that hard for a lot of the volume to migrate across border now. So I think what we were trying to say in our remarks and I want to reiterate, this is a populous enough issue that we should expect it to stay in the press for the foreseeable future. But I think if you listen to the news coming out of Europe of late, these proposals are sort of evolving to stamp duty proposals, so sort of a fraction of an amount that we've lived with another jurisdiction around the world before. We do think the latest proposals are at least a little more sensible because they are limited in scope, they're not as dramatic in terms of costs as the originally proposed ones were. And if you exempt the things we'd be most worried about, we just don't want to affect price discovery and liquidity, then obviously if you exempt liquidity providers and market makers which we imagine would be a pretty broad definition, hopefully, it's easy for everyone to see why we would be more optimistic that's a fairly muted impact on the business. So that's a long-winded answer to a long question. And we also think if they apply it, it will apply to MPF and exchanges, so I don't think there's as much opportunity for regulatory arbitrage as there was talk about a few months ago. The second part of your question  I think bears watching. I think we're going to have to stay very close to that. I think if we have any learnings from the recent experience we had in Europe is that the policymakers there are bound and determined to push some of these regulations through. And I think we will keep a very close eye on where that goes. Certainly, in the cash business, I think we think that the silo is more or less than broken and where it goes from here and the derivatives market remains to be seen. As we've mentioned on this call and to some of you before, I think everyone should tread carefully because I don't get a sense that there is similar momentum for such change in North America, South America or Asia, nor do I think there will be in the near term."

Good morning, everybody, and thanks, as always, for joining us. Before I get into the details on Slide 3, let me just tell you what we're going to try to accomplish this morning. I thought I'd start by saying a few words about",3687,"All right. Thanks, Stephen. Good morning, everybody, and thanks, as always, for joining us. Before I get into the details on Slide 3, let me just tell you what we're going to try to accomplish this morning. I thought I'd start by saying a few words about the merger prohibition announcement from last week. We'll move quickly into what we've accomplished in 2011, and I think the most important focus this morning will be to outline our plan for creating value for shareholders in the quarters to come. So let me just dispense with the merger first, if I may.
It is our view -- it was our view, and I think it continues to be our view, that the proposed merger was a great opportunity to accelerate our strategy. It was a great opportunity to create long-term value for shareholders, and we also believe it would provide substantial benefits with regard to capital efficiencies for the capital markets community. 
However, given the narrow market definition that the Commission chose to use when evaluating the transaction, it was my view that the industrial logic of the transaction would've been significantly compromised if we agreed to meet the Commission's demand for remedies, and we were not going to violate the trust that the shareholders placed on us when they voted to support the deal this past summer. So the deal is done. It's behind us, and I want to be very, very clear about that. I'd like to close that remark by thanking the shareholders, the customers, and most importantly, our employees for their patience and support during this process. I'm still glad we tried. But unfortunately, the outcome was not what we'd hoped for. 
So now let's move on to 2011. I'm extremely pleased to share our full year 2011 results with you, which, as you can see, were characterized by a 6% increase in revenue, a 21% increase in operating income and a 19% increase in both net income and earnings per share. The results were driven by strong trading volumes, continued cost discipline and more meaningful contributions from new initiatives. We beat our cost guidance for the year as cost declined 4% on a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis, and we were well below $200 million in CapEx. While we fell short of our target of 15% revenue growth in our NYSE Technologies business, we did achieve double-digit revenue growth under challenging market conditions and the uncertainty for clients that was created by the proposed merger. 
On the business front, we made significant progress in growing our NYSE Liffe U.S. business with the launch of interest rate derivatives and the migration of the MSCI Emerging Markets and EAFE stock index futures to our exchange. Open interest in these products has nearly doubled since the migration and open interest across the entire exchange surpassed the $1 million contracts mark in December.
Our approach to semi-mutualization has also paid off in our NYSE Amex Options business, where we worked with our partners to continue to grow the business in 2011. Together with NYSE Arca Options, we grew our market share to a record 28%, which was #1 in U.S. equity options. 
We were also the global leader in IPOs in 2011 with 3x the total proceeds rates by our nearest U.S. competitor, who was ranked #8 globally. We continue to make progress in 2012 with big wins in the text sector, as well as continued momentum on the transfer side. Since the beginning of 2010, we have had nearly 3x the number of companies transferred to the NYSE as opposed to away from the NYSE.
The strategy in the Technologies business continued to make strong inroad into Asia in particular with our acquisition of Metabit and the deepening of our relationship with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 
Overall, as you look at Slide 3, if you look at what we accomplished in 2011 and then remember that we also moved a transformational cross-border exchange merger further than any other, the ability to have done both is a testament to the team here and our relentless focus on execution that has become a hallmark of our company. Outside of the post-trade arena, where we slowed the building of our own clearinghouse, we really did not miss a beat last year. Now with 2011 behind us, the key is what are the next steps in the evolution of our company? The next several slides that I'll walk through will address the measures we are going to take to grow the company, guided by our community strategy that has accelerated our growth the last couple of years. A more detailed presentation of these efforts will come on April 2 at our Investor Day.
Please turn to Slide 4. On Slide 4, we highlight in the firm our community strategy and give you the 3 pillars that will drive multiyear earnings growth for NYSE Euronext, assuming only modest improvements in the underlying operating environment. If you look back to 2009 and '10, those were the years when were finishing our global technology harmonization and building out our data centers as part of our capital markets community strategy. While the work that we accomplished during that time set the table for 2011, where we saw a step-up in earnings power and delivery. Despite the challenging near-term outlook for trading volumes, we remain optimistic about the future. We have within our control several levers that we can pull to drive earnings higher, again with just modest improvements in the operating environment.
These levers are the 3 pillars of our equity story we are laying out for you today, and again, greater detail will be provided at the Investor Day in a few weeks. If you look at the right side of the slide, the first pillar is focused on targeted growth opportunities. First, we will be rolling out a series of organically grown new products and services while continuing to focus on market structure innovation in our core markets. Our portfolio of post-trade services will be a key priority in 2012. We have a solid clearing footprint in both Europe and the U.S., which we will now build on to improve our existing businesses and to create new service opportunities. Next, we are expecting NYSE Technologies to continue its double-digit growth trajectory with enhanced managed service capabilities and expanded connectivity and data offerings. And lastly, in the targeted growth opportunity area, we are looking to NYSE Liffe U.S. to accelerate its growth with the possible addition of new partners and an expanded product portfolio.
The second pillar is cost efficiency. Looking back to our merger with Euronext, since that time, we have pulled out over $600 million from the cost base. This has involved hard decisions about our organizational construct, as well as changing the way we do business. This rigor will continue. Next, we will continue to examine our investment portfolio and exit those that are loss-making and/or not expected to achieve the anticipated level of revenue generation as we prioritize our set of growth initiatives. We are also examining our infrastructure to be sure that we are optimally structured for our current and future operational needs. 
The last pillar of our story is strategic capital deployment. Over the past several years, we have returned approximately $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are pledging to continue our shareholder focus with the recently announced $550 million repurchase program. We have several stakes in other companies that, in our opinion, have limited strategic benefit or have not lived up to our expectations. We will continue to examine opportunities to harvest these investments and reallocate the capital to other more attractive opportunities. Lastly, over the past year, we have seen some interesting opportunities on the M&A front, but we emphasized our hope for merger. We will now begin to look at potential complementary strategic M&A opportunities going forward. 
In the next few slides, I will focus on the first pillar of our growth story, and Mike will provide some further granularity on the other 2 pillars when he gets into his remarks.
Please turn to Slide 5. Slide 5 shows our strengths and opportunities and illustrate the compelling targeted revenue initiatives we have underway. You should recognize this slide when which we first introduced at our shareholder meeting last April. While the DB merger would have helped us fill this chart out, we believe that we have several compelling opportunities on our own in many of these areas. 
On the right side of the chart, we show a sample of high-potential initiatives that both enhance our areas of strength and move us beyond our core business. In addition to new product opportunities and derivatives and continued market structure innovation in our core markets, shown as number 6 on this chart, we have some key initiatives in areas of strength that include number 3. We will continue to build on the success we have achieved by partnering with our clients on NYSE Amex and NYSE Liffe U.S. Number 4, we are enhancing our connectivity for NYSE Technologies through the expansion of our network of liquidity hubs around the globe. Number 5, we are looking to make investments in issuer services similar to our acquisition of Corporate Board Member and our minority stake in the receivables exchange, which we believe further enhance our listings brand. And lastly, number 7, we are focused on enhancing our managed services capabilities for NYSE Technologies. 
There are also some initiatives that we believe will extend our capabilities beyond our core business. Number one, which you all know will be a key focus for us in 2012, will be completing the development of a post-trade solution for our European derivatives and cash equities businesses. And number two, coming back to the U.S., we will be launching new products in NYSE Liffe U.S. and NYPC, the next one of which, which was just announced, will be a future base on DTC's GCF Repo Index. We hope this will continue to round out NYSE Liffe U.S. and NYPC's capitally efficient value proposition.
My next several slides will go into more detail on some of these opportunities. Please turn to Slide 6. Slide 6 focuses on our post-trade portfolio, which, as I just said, will be a critical area for us in 2012. As I said earlier, we have a strong clearing footprint in both Europe and the U.S., which we will now further develop to improve our existing business and to create new service opportunities. Our immediate focus in 2012 is in Europe, where we will, firstly, enhance our current derivatives post-trade services with attractive new solutions, completing the buildout of NYSE Liffe Clear, which I'll focus on in a minute. Secondly, part of the effort will be to develop new OTC clearing capabilities in collaboration with our users. And thirdly, we will review our European cash clearing options to make sure we select arrangements for the future, which offer stability, capital efficiency and innovation for our customers.
Second area of focus, which I just mentioned, will be NYSE Liffe Clearing and our overall derivatives platform. We made significant investments in NYSE Liffe Clearing through 2011, rolling out a new clearing processing engine, the Universal Clearing Platform, which delivered significant performance improvements to our customers. This technology investment program will continue through 2012 as we roll out new technology interfaces to improve customer service and latency. 
While some of our standalone post-trade plans were put on hold in 2011, we have already relaunched our project to convert NYSE Liffe Clearing into a full-service CCP. These plans involve expanding the service to clear all of our European derivatives products and to deliver many of the operational and capital efficiencies for customers, which we envisioned in the merger. We will also develop the OTC clearing capabilities, which I referenced earlier, and we will complete the removing of the reliance on third-party providers by introducing new in-house solutions for treasury management services.
We look forward to engaging with users to develop a full-service U.K.-based clearinghouse, which will offer operating and capital efficiencies, provide innovative solutions across listed and OTC markets and provide an unrivaled level of customer service. With legislation beginning to crystallize on the new mandates which will be imposed for central clearing of derivatives, now is the right time in our opinion to be working with users to develop competitive clearing solutions that will meet their needs. The current derivatives clearing arrangements with LCH.Clearnet expire in the middle of next year. 
On the European cash clearing side, we're accelerating the review of the strategic options available for clearing our European cash markets. These markets are cleared by LCH.Clearnet in Paris with the current arrangements due to expire at the end of next year. No decisions have been taken on cash clearing, and all options will now be reviewed with a view to promptly identify the most efficient, stable, secure and commercially appropriate solution for the future for our clients and for us.
And lastly on this slide, a minute on New York Portfolio Clearing. NYPC was created last year to deliver unique capital efficiencies to the market by evaluating and margining a clearing member's risk on a portfolio basis across related cash and derivative positions. There are a number of expansion opportunities under active consideration for NYPC, as I noted earlier. More to come in this important area on April 2.
Please turn to Slide 7. Slide 7 is an update on the NYSE Technologies business, which grew revenues by more than 10% year-over-year and will be a significant contributor to our future growth. We remain committed to the $1 billion revenue target in 2015 and committed as well for the margin of 25% to 30% in that business. Our strategic vision for this business is to become the facilitator and enabler of the capital markets community, and the roadmap to achieve this vision is focused on 4 key tenets that will guide us as we innovate. We executed against each tenet in 2011 by introducing new products and services in each arena. On the right-hand side of the table, we show a handful on the significant deals that we signed last year. And these wins, in our mind, validate the strategy we are pursuing. 
Let me briefly walk you through the 4 key tenets. First, building out the network. We recently opened new liquidity centers in Chicago, Toronto and Tokyo to give customers the ability to access new markets with unparalleled speed and reliability. In 2011, we also expanded our SFTI network into Mexico and the U.K., increasing direct connectivity to new markets and new participants. We acquired Metabit, which provides industry-leading access to financial markets across Asia, accelerating our efforts in that region. 
Secondly, we are expanding our data services footprint. We rolled out the SuperFeed product in Europe, connecting 30 markets to the access centers in London and Frankfurt. SuperFeed provides immediate access to our exchanges data but also to data from a range of key global markets across the SFTI network. 
Third, it's about building out the service platform. Two major initiatives were successfully launched in 2011 to reinforce our leading position as a service platform provider. We launched the Capital Markets Community Platform, the most secure, reliable and scalable financial services cloud computing environment in the industry. And we created a vendor neutral platform driven by the financial services technology community by open sourcing our MAMA programming interface.
Lastly, we continue to be focused on attracting other market venues. In 2011, we successfully deployed the first fully hosted MTF and ATS solutions, confirming this is an important product for future growth and consistent with where we think our model can go. Add this to our successful partnerships in Tokyo and Warsaw, and you can see why we believe that NYSE Technologies is poised for future double-digit revenue growth.
Please turn to Slide 8. On Slide 8 we show how partnering with our clients has helped grow our Derivatives business. First, NYC Liffe U.S. 2011 was a key year for NYSE Liffe U.S. with our launch of its interest rate futures complex and the much-anticipated launch of NYPC, which was recently named the most innovative clearinghouse in North America during 2011. The platform gained momentum from the launch of interest rate futures, as well as the successful migration of the MSCI Liffe [ph] index futures. Since this migration in June of 2011, as I mentioned earlier, open interest in ADV in the MSCI products has nearly doubled, led by the emerging markets Index products. 
The platform's success in 2011 culminated with our crossing the $1 million contracts of open interest milestone in December. This was led by Eurodollar futures where our open interest now represents 10% market share. 2012 will be a critical year for this venture, and we are working on several new initiatives, including launching new products such as options on futures, connecting new clearing members and adding new partners. These efforts should accelerate our progress.
The platform plans continue with innovation theme during 2012. As noted by our January 4 press release announcing that NYSE Liffe U.S. has obtained the exclusive license to list futures based on DTCC's GCF Repo Index futures. Market feedback since that announcement has been overwhelmingly positive. 
Finally, Risk Magazine recently named NYSE Liffe U.S. Exchange of the Year, so we're excited about the prospects for this venture in 2012 and beyond.
Next, let me turn to NYSE Amex Options. We have been very pleased with the growth of the NYSE Amex U.S. Equity Options business and the support of our partners. We have seen Amex market share growth from under 6% in the fourth quarter of 2008 to north of 15% in the fourth quarter of 2011. This growth has been possible in part due to our partners who now hold 47.5% of the venture. Several key achievements have been instrumental to success in this venture.
While we oppose the Qualified Contingent Cross order type when ISE first proposed it, given the SEC approval and our acknowledgment that we need to be competitive in the market, we launched a similar product, and the early returns have been very positive.  
Another key addition this year was the complex order auction functionality, which allows customers to see graphic price improvement electronically. Lastly, Amex complex order book volume was up over 350% year-on-year. While we're pleased with our growth in this new space, further expansion remains a significant opportunity for us in 2012. 
Lastly for me, before I turn it over to Mike, please turn to Slide 9. On Slide 9, we attempt to address a number of the elements in the macroenvironment that have created uncertainty. Here, we depict the various clouds on the horizon, many of which we believe may also come with a silver lining. With a focus on those elements of our business model that we can control, combined with solid execution of our strategy, we are optimistic that these clouds will not materially impact our business in the near term and may actually afford us with some new unexpected opportunities. 
First, in terms of derivatives reform, we have always supported regulatory efforts that bring transparency and better risk management to the markets. We support these efforts because it makes sense for our markets and will significantly reduce systemic risk. Both EMEA and Europe and Dodd-Frank in the U.S. encourage derivatives to move toward a cleared environment, and we have been actively involved in the dialogue in both regions. But the overhang of these reforms is causing uncertainty, changes in our clients' business models and underinvestment. However, as banks look to reduce costs, we believe we are well positioned to serve as a major provider of outsourced trading infrastructure to the sell side as they reinvent their own business models. And with capital becoming an increasingly scarce and valuable resource, capitally efficient clearing houses like NYPC are poised to offer a lot of value to the end users.
Next, we all know we are operating in a lower-volatility, lower-growth environment driven by the lingering effects of the financial crisis, which is keeping rates at or near 0. This type of environment dampens volumes and results in even greater internalization in the U.S. cash markets, as we witnessed in early 2012. On the flip side though, more stable markets means companies are better able to raise capital in the public markets, which is good for our listings business as the pipeline loosens up. It also highlights the benefit of our diversified revenue model. If these lower volatility conditions persist, 2012 promises to be a very good year for capital issuance.
Uncertainty continues to persist around the euro as well, and that is naturally taking a toll an investment and growth in Europe. However, the silver lining here is that spikes in volatility drive volume, and the evolving landscape may also present new product opportunities for us in cash and particularly in derivatives, tough for capital formation but good for transaction volumes. 
Lastly, the financial transaction tax has received its fair share of headlines in recent months. We view the likelihood of a transaction tax as initially envisioned at the Eurozone or EU level as increasingly unlikely. Currently, there are individual tax proposals being floated in France and Germany, and we may even see unilateral action in other countries, notably Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium. In France, there is a reasonably strong likelihood that some form of stamp duty tax will pass. However, we believe the impact will be muted by the fact that it would be limited in scope and would exempt liquidity providers and market makers. In short, this is a politically charged issue, and we expect it to stay in the headlines in the near term. But in the final analysis, we place a low probability on the implementation of an FTT in Europe that would severely impact this business. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike for a review of the financial results. Thanks."
189274,145599320,219504,"NYSE Euronext, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2012",2012-02-10,"Earnings Calls","NYSE Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full year 2011. This quarter, there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.43 a share and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 a share. As previ",1966,"Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full year 2011. This quarter, there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.43 a share and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 a share. As previously communicated, fourth quarter 2011 results include a $25 million pretax charge related to our settlement with French tax authorities on the BlueNext VAT matter. In terms of P&L geography, the gross $42 million was recorded on the SG&A line with an offsetting $17 million recorded on the noncontrolling interest line, reflecting the payment made by our 40% joint venture partner CDC. 
In the quarter, we also reported a $46 million charge for merger expenses and exit costs, which included $38 million related to the merger. For 2011, a total of $85 million was spent on the merger. We are in the process of finalizing residual costs related to the merger, and we'll communicate this on our first quarter call.
Lastly, we benefited this quarter from being able to take a tax deduction for merger-related costs now that the merger has been prohibited. 
Our review our financial results in this call forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs, BlueNext tax settlement and the discrete tax item.
Slide 11 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the quarter and full year. Versus Q4 prior year, revenues were up and expenses lower, driving a 13% increase in operating income and a 9% increase in EPS. EPS of $0.50 a share is below the unseasonably strong $0.71 recorded in the third quarter of 2011. For the full year 2011, EPS was $2.48, up 19% versus 2010. 
The operating environment began to change in Q4 as volatility lessened and trading volumes declined in average of 17% across all our trading venues from Q3. This trend continued into January of this year. Fortunately, our diversified portfolio enables us to weather these periods better than what's the case a few years ago. For 2011, 48% of our revenues was attributed to trading volumes. In the quarter, we grew nontrading-related revenues both versus Q3 and prior year, as well as from continued cost discipline. Q4 operating margins increased to 34%, and full year margins climbed 5 percentage points to 38%. This is driven by incremental margins that were greater than 100% in the quarter and for the full year.
NYSE Amex Options continued to perform well in the quarter with market share of 15% for Q4, our highest level of quarterly market share. For the quarter, the pretax profit attributable to the noncontrolling interest on Amex Options was $9 million based on the 47.5% stake in the business held by our partners. For the full year, higher technology services revenue, stronger trading volumes in European cash and U.S. equity options, combined with strong increases in U.S. average net revenue capture and a 1% decline in reported expenses drove double-digit increases in operating income and earnings. We generated $1.3 billion in adjusted EBITDA from the full year 2011, the highest level of EBITDA generation since 2008.
Diluted share count was down slightly due to $100 million in share repurchases in the fourth quarter. 
Slide 12 and 13 detail the financial performance for our Derivatives segment. Derivatives accounted for 32% of our consolidated net revenues and 42% of our operating income in 2011. Net revenues decreased by 1% in the quarter. It rose 4% for the full year. Global Derivative Volumes increased 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by a 15% increase in U.S. equity options, which offset a 3% decline in European derivatives. Revenue capture for the quarter was slightly favorable for NYSE Liffe versus both Q3 and prior year quarter due principally to product mix and volumes, whereas capture for U.S. options was lower. 
As a reminder, beginning December 1, we modified pricing for the trading of individual equity options and index futures and options on NYSE Liffe Amsterdam and Belgium. These ADVs represent approximately 10% of total NYSE Liffe volumes in 2011. We expect this pricing change to decrease NYSE Liffe overall capture by an annualized 3% to 4%.
As Duncan indicated, Global Derivatives continued to be a major area of focus for future investment and growth. Our Liffe U.S. and NYPC businesses were still very much in investment phase for 2011, both reporting sizable offers. In 2012, we are planning incremental investments in building out our European clearing capabilities and the new product and service offerings.
Similarly, Slides 14 and 15 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading and Listings account for 50% of our consolidated net revenues and 47% of our operating income in 2011. Cash Trading and Listings net revenues was $315 million in the fourth quarter 2011, up 2% versus prior year but down 11% compared to the third quarter of 2011. European cash ADV of $1.6 million transactions increased 13% from the fourth quarter 2010 levels but decreased 17% from Q3 levels. And U.S. cash equities volumes increased 5% to 2.1 billion shares last year and decreased 18% from strong third quarter levels.
Market share was down slightly in Q4 for U.S. cash and was 65% in our 4 European markets compared to 72% in the prior year. That said, European share was stable quarter-on-quarter. Listings revenue increased $5 million year-over-year and was up $24 million for the full year 2011. IPO slowed in the quarter. However, the pipeline is strong. Revenue capture for U.S. cash increased to $0.039 per 100 shares handled for Q4, well above the $0.033 recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010. Since the second quarter of 2010, we have linked tiers to overall U.S. consolidated volumes. We moved the inversion at the highest tier on Arca and benefited from sponsored access rule changes.
Revenue capture for European cash decreased to $0.58 from $0.71 in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $0.64 in the third quarter of 2011. The decline in capture was driven primarily by a reduction in fees at auction and lower trade size, which began in August and continued through December. Clearing [ph] in basis points is up slightly versus Q3.
Slide 16 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. This segment accounted for 20% of our net revenues and 13% of our operating income in the fourth quarter. Information Services and Technology Solutions revenue was $127 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $13 million or 11% from Q4 prior year. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in SFTI and co-location revenue and growth from managed service sales to TSE, Warsaw and Sigma X. Revenues for this segment have grown sequentially every quarter this year. For the year, our Technology segment grew revenues 10% and expanded margins from 20% to 26%.
Slide 17 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expenses. Like the intense focus on the merger, we made excellent progress this year on reducing our operating expenses. Q4 expenses were favorable to our prior guidance attributed to high cost management, a stronger U.S. dollar and a onetime savings realized from a real estate transaction in Europe. Fourth quarter operating expenses were down $9 million versus last year on a reported basis. 38% of our expenses in Q4 were denominated in either euros, 18%, or pounds, 20%. After adjusting for FX and the impact of transactions such as NYSE Blue JV and the acquisition of Corporate Board Member and Metabit, fixed operating costs were down $16 million or 4% from the fourth quarter of 2010. 
The end of 2011 was reported fixed cost $12 million below 2010. However, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and changes to our portfolio, our expenses were $70 million or 4% below prior year levels. This puts us well below the commitment we made to you in early 2010 that our expenses will be less than $1,650 million on a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis in 2011.
Slide 18 reconciles our cost evolution since 2007 merger with Euronext. Over this period, we saved over $650 million on a constant portfolio basis. About 2/3 of the savings was reinvested through business acquisitions or new business start-ups. In 2012 and 2013, cost efficiency will remain a priority. We see further opportunities to leverage resources efficiently for the benefit of the group with the goal of achieving a community premium for the company. As Duncan mentioned, there are a number of target areas where we'll be seeking greater efficiencies. We'll provide greater transparency on this at our Investor Day.
Slide 19 details our cash and debt position as of December 31, 2011. The company ended the year in a strong balance sheet position. A combination of EBITDA growing 15% and debt declining $300 million reduced our leverage ratio to 1.6x, down from 2.2x at the end of 2010. This is the lowest level of leverage since NYSE and Euronext merged. Capital expenditures were $54 million in the quarter compared to $61 million in the prior year quarter. For the year, capital expenditures were $170 million, well below our full year guidance of less than $200 million in capital spending. 
We executed $100 million in stock repurchases during the fourth quarter as part of our $1 billion share outstanding. We're repurchasing 3.7 million shares at an average price of $29.96. A total of $550 million remains on the existing share buyback authorization, and these repurchases will be funded out of cash on hand and cash from operating activities through 2012.
Repurchases at current stock price levels are highly accretive. We see our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation as a major enabler for future earnings growth. With the merger now prohibited, we are in the process of building a multiyear plan to grow earnings and strategically reposition the company. We will dive deeper into this plan at our Investor Day on April 2. 
On Slide 20, we are providing some preliminary guidance for 2012. First, let me discuss revenue. Duncan discussed our growth priorities earlier in the presentation. We are targeting another year of double-digit growth for NYSE Technologies, and we expect margins to improve from the 26% level achieved in 2011. Over the past 2 years, we have invested heavily in our U.S. futures business, Liffe U.S. We expect the financials in this venture to improve in 2012, and by 2013, to turn profitable. 
Now let me turn to costs. On a constant dollar basis, exclusive of new business initiative and incremental M&A, we are guiding that fixed expenses for 2012 will be below the 2011 cost of $166 million. This includes absorbing incremental variable costs associated with higher technology revenues. As Duncan mentioned earlier, one of our key 2012 priorities will be the buildout of our post-trade capabilities in Europe. We will provide more guidance on the costs and benefits of this initiative once we finalize our plans. The incremental expenses and capital spending is expected to have a favorable rate of return once we can report the clearing revenues and rationalize cost for LCH to handle risk management and treasury functions for Liffe clearing.
Turning to capital. We expect CapEx in 2012 to be above last year's $170 million but still below our maintenance level of $200 million due in part to incremental capital spending to build on our clearing capabilities. Our $550 million buyback will become effective after today's earnings. We expect to complete the buyback in 2012. We are confirming our long-term financial policy of targeting debt levels between 2x and 2.25x EBITDA. 
Lastly on taxes, we anticipate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 26% for 2012.
I'll now turn the call back to Duncan for some concluding remarks before we open the line for questions."

Thanks, Mike. So just to summarize, the results for the quarter and full year 2011 were solid driven by strong volumes, continued cost discipline and increasing contributions from our nontrading businesses as a result of our diversification efforts over the past few years. We're pleased with the progress we are making on our strategy to create a global capital markets community that will empower our clients to innovate and collaborate. 
And as we move to through 2012, we're you're not sitting still waiting for the operating environment to improve. We are focusing on those levers within our control to execute against our community strategy and to expand our ability to generate underlying earnings per share growth. As we've said, this will be accomplished through a mix of targeted revenue-generating initiatives, accelerated cost efficiency efforts and strategic capital deployment. As we talked about, we've already executed recently $100 million of stock repurchases at a price just below $27, and our announced $550 million additional share repurchase program will begin immediately. 
So with that, we're happy to open the line for questions. We'll have time to take a few questions. And then as always, we'll make ourselves available to the analyst community throughout the day. So thank you."

And then there's also a number of other investments, I don't think effective margin, but minority investments that were sort of en vogue in the industry a few years ago that in some instances you have difficulty confirming the initial hypothesis.

Post the data center build, we thought maintenance level CapEx would come down to a number south of $200 million. And I think it did. I think you're right, Roger. I think it would have been a little higher last year if we had continued to invest in the completion of the buildout of Liffe Clear. I still think it would have been under $200 million, but it would have been a little bit higher. So I think we're trying to reflect that as we sort of look at what the CapEx for '12 looks like. I do honestly believe having stayed very close to some of the big banking customers in terms of their needs to reinvent their business, but in fairness to them, as they were thinking about a big outsourcing decision in 2011 and looking it out and saying, ""Okay, I understand the value proposition. Can you tell me with certainty where your data centers and where your hubs are going to be in 2012 and beyond?"" I think it would've been disingenuous of us to represent that, that was a certainty given what was going on with the merger, the various technology platform discussions that were being held. So I think it was an easy decision for them to put off for the time being. And I think we now need to revisit with them, and I think that's one of the reasons, among several, that we think the Technology business' double-digit revenue growth is pretty easily achieved in 2012, as far as we can tell, given that we know some of those decisions were put on hold. And lastly, as I've said to some of you before, yes, this was certainly a drain on a few of us. A few of us were back and forth to Europe quite a bit. At the same time, our strategy was to involve as few people as possible in executing the merger. And what I mean by that is my philosophy was to take a meaningful percentage of a handful of people's time instead of a very small percentage of a lot of people's time. So I think people like Mike and Larry have been able to stay very focused on the task at hand, which is why we feel better about going into '12. So I do think you're right. There are lot of near-term opportunities, whether it's around clearing or the technology business or just a return rigor on capital deployment, which we obviously largely put on hold last year even though we were generating a ton of free cash flow that I think get us pretty excited about 2012. Lastly, I share your excitement in keeping the team together. That is one of the side benefits. And we had a team led by Larry that has been focusing on what would happen if the merger were approved, and that's why I think we've been able to be, a week after prohibition, able to give you guys as much information as we've given on the call this morning.

So firstly, on the Derivatives side, I think -- remember, as far as we got with Liffe Clear was really everything but some of the treasury and risk management functions. So a big part of it build out was already done for our Derivatives business. So I don't think it's a big lift from here. And I take full responsibility for having put that project on hold in 2011. Some of our best people are already re-engaged. They have been for a few weeks now, and off they go. So I think we'll be able to give, as Larry said, a lot more clarity on some of the milestones for that, the timing of all that, et cetera. On the cash side, as we've said before, I don't think it's nearly as strategic, but that doesn't mean it's not imported commercially to us. Those of you who have been with us for a while will remember that going back a few years ago, the cost of those services provided to us were quite high, which meant it was quite high for our customers because it was just a pass-through. So while we reduced those costs significantly in the last couple of years, I do believe that they are still priced -- our provider still prices them above the market. And I think we have some work to do there to either strike a commercially viable agreement with them or think about other options there. As far as LCH goes, I think it's fair to say we'd obviously be very interested in what happens with that asset. We own nearly 10% of the company. We have a board seat, and we're the enterprise's largest customer. We think that the company has a great deal of potential under Ian Axe's leadership. I think he's been doing a great job since he got in there. But whether it's LCH or the alliance, as you referred to, with DB1, I think given the shifting landscape and the clients' need for capital efficiency, I think it would be foolish for us not to consider any and all go-forward alliances that might make sense between various exchanges and clearing organizations. Ultimately, it has to be all about the customer. And if there are things we could all do together to provide some of those cash capital efficiencies that people may not be able to do individually, we should certainly consider that. I think the alliance we have with DTC and NYPC is a great example of that. That was pretty much unprecedented. And I think that puts us in position to provide capital efficiency that neither we nor DTC could do alone. So hopefully, that gets most of your question, Alex."

And maybe another 2-part one-question-type thing. So with the financial transaction tax that Sarkozy wants to apply in France, it might be more of a stamp duty type of tax than a financial transaction tax. What exactly did you mean by a muted impact? I guess there, I'm trying to get to what sort of impact do you think you'd see in market share, potential opportunity for regulatory charges, et cetera. And then the second part would be, with such a negative regulatory environment overall, to what extent are you worried that maybe a year or 2 down the line, either if you're muted to or you'll mirror some other construct, that Europe might try to blow up the vertical clearing model?"

When this was first floated as much as 1 year ago, I think it was a lot more draconian than it sort of evolved to. I think common sense has prevailed and people realized that the policymakers in Europe, I think, have come to realize that while it sounds good on paper, when you get down to the details and talk about how to implement it, you realize that if it's not implemented broadly and pretty consistently, it gets challenging at best. And I think policymakers also realized that it's not that hard for a lot of the volume to migrate across border now. So I think what we were trying to say in our remarks, and look, I want to reiterate, this is a populous enough issue that we should all expect it to stay in the press for the foreseeable future. But I think if you listen to the news coming out of Europe of late, these proposals are sort of evolving to stamp duty proposals, so sort of a fraction of an amount that we've lived with another jurisdiction around the world before. We do think the latest proposals are at least a little more sensible because they are limited in scope. They're not as dramatic in terms of costs as the originally proposed ones were. And if you exempt the things we'd be most worried about are, we just don't want to affect price discovery and liquidity, then obviously, if you exempt liquidity providers and market makers, which we imagine would be a pretty broad definition, hopefully, it's easy for everyone to see why we'd be more optimistic that it's a fairly muted impact on the business. So that's -- it's a long-winded answer to a long question. And we also think if they apply it, it'll apply to MTFs and exchanges, so I don't think there's as much opportunity for regulatory arbitrage as there was talked about a few months ago. The second part of your question, I think, bears watching. I think we're going to have to stay very close to that. I think if we have any learnings from the recent experience we had in Europe is that they, the policymakers there, are bound and determined to push some of these regulations through. And I think we will keep a very close eye on where that goes. Certainly, in the cash business, I think we think that the silo is already more or less than broken, and where it goes from here and the derivatives market remains to be seen. As we've mentioned on this call and to some of you before, I think everyone should tread carefully because I don't get a sense that there is similar momentum for such change in North America, South America or Asia, nor do I think there will be in the near term."

Good morning, everybody, and thanks, as always, for joining us. Before I get into the details on Slide 3, let me just tell you what we're going to try to accomplish this morning. I thought I'd start by saying a few words about",3690,"All right. Thanks, Stephen. Good morning, everybody, and thanks, as always, for joining us. Before I get into the details on Slide 3, let me just tell you what we're going to try to accomplish this morning. I thought I'd start by saying a few words about the merger prohibition announcement from last week. We'll move quickly into what we've accomplished in 2011, and I think the most important focus this morning will be to outline our plan for creating value for shareholders in the quarters to come. So let me just dispense with the merger first, if I may.
It is our view and it was our view, and I think it continues to be our view, that the proposed merger was a great opportunity to accelerate our strategy. It was a great opportunity to create long-term value for shareholders, and we also believed it would provide substantial benefits with regard to capital efficiencies for the capital markets community. 
However, given the narrow market definition that the Commission chose to use when evaluating the transaction, it was my view that the industrial logic of the transaction would've been significantly compromised if we agreed to meet the Commission's demand for remedies, and we were not going to violate the trust that the shareholders placed on us when they voted to support the deal this past summer. So the deal is done. It's behind us, and I want to be very, very clear about that. I'd like to close that remark by thanking the shareholders, the customers, and most importantly, our employees for their patience and support during this process. I'm still glad we tried. But unfortunately, the outcome was not what we'd hoped for. 
So now let's move on to 2011. I'm extremely pleased to share our full year 2011 results with you, which, as you can see, were characterized by a 6% increase in revenue, a 21% increase in operating income and a 19% increase in both net income and earnings per share. The results were driven by strong trading volumes, continued cost discipline and more meaningful contributions from new initiatives. We beat our cost guidance for the year as cost declined 4% on a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis, and we were well below $200 million in CapEx. While we fell short of our target of 15% revenue growth in our NYSE Technologies business, we did achieve double-digit revenue growth under challenging market conditions and the uncertainty for clients that was created by the proposed merger. 
On the business front, we made significant progress in growing our NYSE Liffe U.S. business with the launch of interest rate derivatives and the migration of the MSCI Emerging Markets and EAFE stock index futures to our exchange. Open interest in these products has nearly doubled since the migration and open interest across the entire exchange surpassed the $1 million contracts mark in December.
Our approach to semi-mutualization has also paid off in our NYSE Amex Options business, where we worked with our partners to continue to grow the business in 2011. Together with NYSE Arca Options, we grew our market share to a record 28%, which was #1 in U.S. equity options. 
We were also the global leader in IPOs in 2011 with 3x the total proceeds rates by our nearest U.S. competitor, who was ranked #8 globally. We continue to make progress in 2012 with big wins in the text sector, as well as continued momentum on the transfer side. Since the beginning of 2010, we have had nearly 3x the number of companies transferred to the NYSE as opposed to away from the NYSE.
The strategy in the Technologies business continued to make strong inroad into Asia in particular with our acquisition of Metabit and the deepening of our relationship with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 
Overall, as you look at Slide 3, if you look at what we accomplished in 2011 and then remember that we also moved a transformational cross-border exchange merger further than any other, the ability to have done both is a testament to the team here and our relentless focus on execution that has become a hallmark of our company. Outside of the post-trade arena, where we slowed the building of our own clearinghouse, we really did not miss a beat last year. Now with 2011 behind us, the key is what are the next steps in the evolution of our company? The next several slides that I'll walk through will address the measures we are going to take to grow the company, guided by our community strategy that has accelerated our growth the last couple of years. A more detailed presentation of these efforts will come on April 2 at our Investor Day.
Please turn to Slide 4. On Slide 4, we highlight in the firm our community strategy and give you the 3 pillars that will drive multiyear earnings growth for NYSE Euronext, assuming only modest improvements in the underlying operating environment. If you look back to 2009 and '10, those were the years when we were finishing our global technology harmonization and building out our data centers as part of our capital markets community strategy. All the work that we accomplished during that time set the table for 2011, where we saw a step-up in earnings power and delivery. Despite the challenging near-term outlook for trading volumes, we remain optimistic about the future. We have within our control several levers that we can pull to drive earnings higher, again with just modest improvements in the operating environment.
These levers are the 3 pillars of our equity story we are laying out for you today, and again, greater detail will be provided at the Investor Day in a few weeks. If you look at the right side of the slide, the first pillar is focused on targeted growth opportunities. First, we will be rolling out a series of organically grown new products and services while continuing to focus on market structure innovation in our core markets. Our portfolio of post-trade services will be a key priority in 2012. We have a solid clearing footprint in both Europe and the U.S., which we will now build on to improve our existing businesses and to create new service opportunities. Next, we are expecting NYSE Technologies to continue its double-digit growth trajectory with enhanced managed service capabilities and expanded connectivity and data offerings. And lastly, in the targeted growth opportunity area, we are looking to NYSE Liffe U.S. to accelerate its growth with the possible addition of new partners and an expanded product portfolio.
The second pillar is cost efficiency. Looking back to our merger with Euronext, since that time, we have pulled out over $600 million from the cost base. This has involved hard decisions about our organizational construct, as well as changing the way we do business. This rigor will continue. Next, we will continue to examine our investment portfolio and exit those that are loss-making and/or not expected to achieve the anticipated level of revenue generation as we prioritize our set of growth initiatives. We are also examining our infrastructure to be sure that we are optimally structured for our current and future operational needs. 
The last pillar of our story is strategic capital deployment. Over the past several years, we have returned approximately $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are pledging to continue our shareholder focus with the recently announced $550 million repurchase program. We have several stakes in other companies that, in our opinion, have limited strategic benefit or have not lived up to our expectations. We will continue to examine opportunities to harvest these investments and reallocate the capital to other more attractive opportunities. Lastly, over the past year, we have seen some interesting opportunities on the M&A front, but we emphasized our hope for merger. We will now begin to look at potential complementary strategic M&A opportunities going forward. 
In the next few slides, I will focus on the first pillar of our growth story, and Mike will provide some further granularity on the other 2 pillars when he gets into his remarks.
Please turn to Slide 5. Slide 5 shows our strengths and opportunities and illustrate the compelling targeted revenue initiatives we have underway. You should recognize this slide when -- which we first introduced at our shareholder meeting last April. While the DB merger would have helped us fill this chart out, we believe that we have several compelling opportunities on our own in many of these areas. 
On the right side of the chart, we show a sample of high-potential initiatives that both enhance our areas of strength and move us beyond our core business. In addition to new product opportunities and derivatives and continued market structure innovation in our core markets, shown as number 6 on this chart, we have some key initiatives in areas of strength that include number 3. We will continue to build on the success we have achieved by partnering with our clients on NYSE Amex and NYSE Liffe U.S. Number 4, we are enhancing our connectivity for NYSE Technologies through the expansion of our network of liquidity hubs around the globe. Number 5, we are looking to make investments in issuer services similar to our acquisition of Corporate Board Member and our minority stake in the receivables exchange, which we believe further enhance our listings brand. And lastly, number 7, we are focused on enhancing our managed services capabilities for NYSE Technologies. 
There are also some initiatives that we believe will extend our capabilities beyond our core business. Number one, which you all know will be a key focus for us in 2012, will be completing the development of a post-trade solution for our European derivatives and cash equities businesses. And number two, coming back to the U.S., we will be launching new products in NYSE Liffe U.S. and NYPC, the next one of which, which was just announced, will be a future base on DTC's GCF Repo Index. We hope this will continue to round out NYSE Liffe U.S. and NYPC's capitally efficient value proposition.
My next several slides will go into more detail on some of these opportunities. Please turn to Slide 6. Slide 6 focuses on our post-trade portfolio, which, as I just said, will be a critical area for us in 2012. As I said earlier, we have a strong clearing footprint in both Europe and the U.S., which we will now further develop to improve our existing business and to create new service opportunities. Our immediate focus in 2012 is in Europe, where we will, firstly, enhance our current derivatives post-trade services with attractive new solutions, completing the build-out of NYSE Liffe Clear, which I'll focus on in a minute. Secondly, part of the effort will be to develop new OTC clearing capabilities in collaboration with our users. And thirdly, we will review our European cash clearing options to make sure we select arrangements for the future, which offer stability, capital efficiency and innovation for our customers.
The second area of focus, which I just mentioned, will be NYSE Liffe Clearing and our overall derivatives platform. We made significant investments in NYSE Liffe Clearing through 2011, rolling out a new clearing processing engine, the Universal Clearing Platform, which delivered significant performance improvements to our customers. This technology investment program will continue through 2012 as we roll out new technology interfaces to improve customer service and latency. 
While some of our standalone post-trade plans were put on hold in 2011, we have already re-launched our project to convert NYSE Liffe Clearing into a full-service CCP. These plans involve expanding the service to clear all of our European derivatives products and to deliver many of the operational and capital efficiencies for customers, which we envisioned in the merger. We will also develop the OTC clearing capabilities, which I referenced earlier, and we will complete the removing of the reliance on third-party providers by introducing new in-house solutions for treasury management services.
We look forward to engaging with users to develop a full-service U.K.-based clearinghouse, which will offer operating and capital efficiencies, provide innovative solutions across listed and OTC markets and provide an unrivaled level of customer service. With legislation beginning to crystallize on the new mandates which will be imposed for central clearing of derivatives, now is the right time in our opinion to be working with users to develop competitive clearing solutions that will meet their needs. The current derivatives clearing arrangements with LCH.Clearnet expire in the middle of next year. 
On the European cash clearing side, we're accelerating the review of the strategic options available for clearing our European cash markets. These markets are cleared by LCH.Clearnet in Paris with the current arrangements due to expire at the end of next year. No decisions have been taken on cash clearing, and all options will now be reviewed with a view to promptly identify the most efficient, stable, secure and commercially appropriate solution for the future for our clients and for us.
And lastly on this slide, a minute on New York Portfolio Clearing. NYPC was created last year to deliver unique capital efficiencies to the market by evaluating and margining a clearing member's risk on a portfolio basis across related cash and derivative positions. There are a number of expansion opportunities under active consideration for NYPC, as I noted earlier. More to come in this important area on April 2.
Please turn to Slide 7. Slide 7 is an update on the NYSE Technologies business, which grew revenues by more than 10% year-over-year and will be a significant contributor to our future growth. We remain committed to the $1 billion revenue target in 2015 and committed as well to the margin of 25% to 30% in that business. Our strategic vision for this business is to become the facilitator and enabler of the capital markets community, and the roadmap to achieve this vision is focused on 4 key tenets that will guide us as we innovate. We executed against each tenet in 2011 by introducing new products and services in each arena. On the right-hand side of the table, we show a handful on the significant deals that we signed last year. And these wins, in our mind, validate the strategy we are pursuing. Let me briefly walk you through the 4 key tenets. 
First, building out the network. We recently opened new liquidity centers in Chicago, Toronto and Tokyo to give customers the ability to access new markets with unparalleled speed and reliability. In 2011, we also expanded our SFTI network into Mexico and the U.K., increasing direct connectivity to new markets and new participants. We acquired Metabit, which provides industry-leading access to financial markets across Asia, accelerating our efforts in that region. 
Secondly, we are extending our data services footprint. We rolled out the SuperFeed product in Europe, connecting 30 markets to the access centers in London and Frankfurt. SuperFeed provides immediate access to our exchanges data but also to data from a range of key global markets across the SFTI network. 
Third, it's about building out the service platform. Two major initiatives were successfully launched in 2011 to reinforce our leading position as a service platform provider. We launched the Capital Markets Community Platform, the most secure, reliable and scalable financial services cloud computing environment in the industry. And we created a vendor neutral platform driven by the financial services technology community by open sourcing our MAMA programming interface.
Lastly, we continue to be focused on attracting other market venues. In 2011, we successfully deployed the first fully hosted MTF and ATS solutions, confirming this is an important product for future growth and consistent with where we think our model can go. Add this to our successful partnerships in Tokyo and Warsaw, and you can see why we believe that NYSE Technologies is poised for future double-digit revenue growth.
Please turn to Slide 8. On Slide 8 we show how partnering with our clients has helped grow our Derivatives business. First, NYC Liffe U.S. 2011 was a key year for NYSE Liffe U.S. with our launch of its interest rate futures complex and the much-anticipated launch of NYPC, which was recently named the most innovative clearinghouse in North America during 2011. The platform gained momentum from the launch of interest rate futures, as well as the successful migration of the MSCI Liffe [ph] index futures. Since this migration in June of 2011, as I mentioned earlier, open interest in ADV in the MSCI products has nearly doubled, led by the emerging markets Index products. 
The platform's success in 2011 culminated with our crossing the $1 million contracts of open interest milestone in December. This was led by Eurodollar futures where our open interest now represents 10% market share. 2012 will be a critical year for this venture, and we are working on several new initiatives, including launching new products such as options on futures, connecting new clearing members and adding new partners. These efforts should accelerate our progress.
The platform plans continue it’s innovation theme during 2012. As noted by our January 4 press release announcing that NYSE Liffe U.S. has obtained the exclusive license to list futures based on DTCC's GCF Repo Index futures. Market feedback since that announcement has been overwhelmingly positive. 
Finally, Risk Magazine recently named NYSE Liffe U.S. Exchange of the Year, so we're excited about the prospects for this venture in 2012 and beyond.
Next, let me turn to NYSE Amex Options. We have been very pleased with the growth of the NYSE Amex U.S. Equity Options business and the support of our partners. We have seen Amex market share growth from under 6% in the fourth quarter of 2008 to north of 15% in the fourth quarter of 2011. This growth has been possible in part due to our partners who now hold 47.5% of the venture. Several key achievements have been instrumental to success in this venture.
While we oppose the Qualified Contingent Cross order type when ISE first proposed it, given the SEC approval and our acknowledgment that we need to be competitive in the market, we launched a similar product, and the early returns have been very positive.  
Another key addition this year was the complex order auction functionality, which allows customers to see graphic price improvement electronically. Lastly, Amex complex order book volume was up over 350% year-on-year. While we're pleased with our growth in this new space, further expansion remains a significant opportunity for us in 2012. 
Lastly for me, before I turn it over to Mike, please turn to Slide 9. On Slide 9, we attempt to address a number of the elements in the macroenvironment that have created uncertainty. Here, we depict the various clouds on the horizon, many of which we believe may also come with a silver lining. With a focus on those elements of our business model that we can control, combined with solid execution of our strategy, we are optimistic that these clouds will not materially impact our business in the near term and may actually afford us with some new unexpected opportunities. 
First, in terms of derivatives reform, we have always supported regulatory efforts that bring transparency and better risk management to the markets. We support these efforts because it makes sense for our markets and will significantly reduce systemic risk. Both EMEA and Europe and Dodd-Frank in the U.S. encourage derivatives to move toward a cleared environment, and we have been actively involved in the dialogue in both regions. But the overhang of these reforms is causing uncertainty, changes in our clients' business models and underinvestment. However, as banks look to reduce costs, we believe we are well positioned to serve as a major provider of outsourced trading infrastructure to the sell side as they reinvent their own business models. And with capital becoming an increasingly scarce and valuable resource, capitally efficient clearing houses like NYPC are poised to offer a lot of value to the end users.
Next, we all know we are operating in a lower-volatility, lower-growth environment driven by the lingering effects of the financial crisis, which is keeping rates at or near 0. This type of environment dampens volumes and results in even greater internalization in the U.S. cash markets, as we witnessed in early 2012. On the flip side though, more stable markets means companies are better able to raise capital in the public markets, which is good for our listings business as the pipeline loosens up. It also highlights the benefit of our diversified revenue model. If these lower volatility conditions persist, 2012 promises to be a very good year for capital issuance.
Uncertainty continues to persist around the euro as well, and that is naturally taking a toll an investment and growth in Europe. However, the silver lining here is that spikes in volatility drive volume, and the evolving landscape may also present new product opportunities for us in cash and particularly in derivatives, tough for capital formation but good for transaction volumes. 
Lastly, the financial transaction tax has received its fair share of headlines in recent months. We view the likelihood of a transaction tax as initially envisioned at the Eurozone or EU level as increasingly unlikely. Currently, there are individual tax proposals being floated in France and Germany, and we may even see unilateral action in other countries, notably Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium. In France, there is a reasonably strong likelihood that some form of stamp duty tax will pass. However, we believe the impact will be muted by the fact that it would be limited in scope and would exempt liquidity providers and market makers. In short, this is a politically charged issue, and we expect it to stay in the headlines in the near term. But in the final analysis, we place a low probability on the implementation of an FTT in Europe that would severely impact the business. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike for a review of the financial results. Thanks."

Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full year 2011. This quarter, there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.43 a share and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 a share. As previously communicated, fourth quarter 2011 results include a $25 million pretax charge related to our settlement with French tax authorities on the BlueNext VAT matter. In terms of P&L geography, the gross $42 million was recorded on the SG&A line with an offsetting $17 million recorded on the noncontrolling interest line, reflecting the payment made by our 40% joint venture partner CDC. 
In the quarter, we also reported a $46 million charge for merger expenses and exit costs, which included $38 million related to the merger. For 2011, a total of $85 million was spent on the merger. We are in the process of finalizing residual costs related to the merger, and we'll communicate this on our first quarter call.
Lastly, we benefited this quarter from being able to take a tax deduction for merger-related costs now that the merger has been prohibited. 
Our review our financial results in this call forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs, BlueNext tax settlement and the discrete tax item.
Slide 11 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the quarter and full year. Versus Q4 prior year, revenues were up and expenses lower, driving a 13% increase in operating income and a 9% increase in EPS. EPS of $0.50 a share is below the unseasonably strong $0.71 recorded in the third quarter of 2011. For the full year 2011, EPS was $2.48, up 19% versus 2010. 
The operating environment began to change in Q4 as volatility lessened and trading volumes declined an average of 17% across all our trading venues from Q3. This trend continued into January of this year. Fortunately, our diversified portfolio enables us to weather these periods better than was the case a few years ago. For 2011, 48% of our revenues was attributed to trading volumes. In the quarter, we grew nontrading-related revenues both versus Q3 and prior year, as well as from continued cost discipline. Q4 operating margins increased to 34%, and full year margins climbed 5 percentage points to 38%. This is driven by incremental margins that were greater than 100% in the quarter and for the full year.
NYSE Amex Options continued to perform well in the quarter with market share of 15% for Q4, our highest level of quarterly market share. For the quarter, the pretax profit attributable to the noncontrolling interest on Amex Options was $9 million based on the 47.5% stake in the business held by our partners. For the full year, higher technology services revenue, stronger trading volumes in European cash and U.S. equity options, combined with strong increases in U.S. average net revenue capture and a 1% decline in reported expenses drove double-digit increases in operating income and earnings. We generated $1.3 billion in adjusted EBITDA from the full year 2011, the highest level of EBITDA generation since 2008.
Diluted share count was down slightly due to $100 million in share repurchases in the fourth quarter. 
Slide 12 and 13 detail the financial performance for our Derivatives segment. Derivatives accounted for 32% of our consolidated net revenues and 42% of our operating income in 2011. Net revenues decreased by 1% in the quarter. It rose 4% for the full year. Global Derivative Volumes increased 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by a 15% increase in U.S. equity options, which offset a 3% decline in European derivatives. Revenue capture for the quarter was slightly favorable for NYSE Liffe versus both Q3 and prior year quarter due principally to product mix and volumes, whereas capture for U.S. options was lower. 
As a reminder, beginning December 1, we modified pricing for the trading of individual equity options and index futures and options on NYSE Liffe Amsterdam and Belgium. These ADVs represent approximately 10% of total NYSE Liffe volumes in 2011. We expect this pricing change to decrease NYSE Liffe overall capture by an annualized 3% to 4%.
As Duncan indicated, Global Derivatives continues to be a major area of focus for future investment and growth. Our Liffe U.S. and NYPC businesses were still very much in investment phase for 2011, both reporting sizable losses. In 2012, we are planning incremental investments in building out our European clearing capabilities and the new product and service offerings.
Similarly, Slides 14 and 15 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading and Listings account for 50% of our consolidated net revenues and 47% of our operating income in 2011. Cash Trading and Listings net revenues was $315 million in the fourth quarter 2011, up 2% versus prior year but down 11% compared to the third quarter of 2011. European cash ADV of $1.6 million transactions increased 13% from the fourth quarter 2010 levels but decreased 17% from Q3 levels. In U.S. cash equities volumes increased 5% to 2.1 billion shares last year and decreased 18% from strong third quarter levels.
Market share was down slightly in Q4 for U.S. cash and was 65% in our 4 European markets compared to 72% in the prior year. That said, European share was stable quarter-on-quarter. Listings revenue increased $5 million year-over-year and was up $24 million for the full year 2011. IPO slowed in the fourth quarter. However, the pipeline is strong. Revenue capture for U.S. cash increased to $0.039 per 100 shares handled for Q4, well above the $0.033 recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010. Since the second quarter of 2010, we have linked tiers to overall U.S. consolidated volumes, we moved the inversion at the highest tier on Arca and benefited from sponsored access rule changes.
Revenue capture for European cash decreased to $0.58 from $0.71 in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $0.64 in the third quarter of 2011. The decline in capture was driven primarily by a reduction in fees at auction and lower trade size, which began in August and continued through December. Pricing in basis points is up slightly versus Q3.
Slide 16 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. This segment accounted for 20% of our net revenues and 13% of our operating income in the fourth quarter. Information Services and Technology Solutions revenue was $127 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $13 million or 11% from Q4 prior year. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in SFTI and co-location revenue and growth from managed service sales to TSE, Warsaw and Sigma X. Revenues for this segment have grown sequentially every quarter this year. For the year, our Technology segment grew revenues 10% and expanded margins from 20% to 26%.
Slide 17 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expenses. Despite the intense focus on the merger, we made excellent progress this year on reducing our operating expenses. Q4 expenses were favorable to our prior guidance attributed to high cost management, a stronger U.S. dollar and a onetime savings realized from a real estate transaction in Europe. Fourth quarter operating expenses were down $9 million versus last year on a reported basis. 38% of our expenses in Q4 were denominated in either euros, 18%, or pounds, 20%. After adjusting for FX and the impact of transactions such as NYSE Blue JV and the acquisition of Corporate Board Member and Metabit, fixed operating costs were down $16 million or 4% from the fourth quarter of 2010. 
The end of 2011 was reported fixed cost $12 million below 2010. However, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and changes to our portfolio, our expenses were $70 million or 4% below prior year levels. This puts us well below the commitment we made to you in early 2010 that our expenses will be less than $1,650 million on a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis in 2011.
Slide 18 reconciles our cost evolution since 2007 merger with Euronext. Over this period, we saved over $650 million on a constant portfolio basis. About 2/3 of the savings was reinvested through business acquisitions or new business start-ups. In 2012 and 2013, cost efficiency will remain a priority. We see further opportunities to leverage resources efficiently for the benefit of the group with the goal of achieving a community premium for the company. As Duncan mentioned, there are a number of target areas where we'll be seeking greater efficiencies. We'll provide greater transparency on this at our Investor Day.
Slide 19 details our cash and debt position as of December 31, 2011. The company ended the year in a strong balance sheet position. A combination of EBITDA growing 15% and debt declining $300 million reduced our leverage ratio to 1.6x, down from 2.2x at the end of 2010. This is the lowest level of leverage since NYSE and Euronext merged. Capital expenditures were $54 million in the quarter compared to $61 million in the prior year quarter. For the year, capital expenditures were $170 million, well below our full year guidance of less than $200 million in capital spending. 
We executed $100 million in stock repurchases during the fourth quarter as part of our $1 billion share outstanding. We're repurchasing 3.7 million shares at an average price of $29.96. A total of $550 million remains on the existing share buyback authorization, and these repurchases will be funded out of cash on hand and cash from operating activities through 2012.
Repurchases at current stock price levels are highly accretive. We see our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation as a major enabler for future earnings growth. With the merger now prohibited, we are in the process of building a multiyear plan to grow earnings and strategically reposition the company. We will dive deeper into this plan at our Investor Day on April 2. 
On Slide 20, we are providing some preliminary guidance for 2012. First, let me discuss revenue. Duncan discussed our growth priorities earlier in the presentation. We are targeting another year of double-digit growth for NYSE Technologies, and we expect margins to improve from the 26% level achieved in 2011. Over the past 2 years, we have invested heavily in our U.S. futures business, Liffe U.S. We expect the financials in this venture to improve in 2012, and by 2013, to turn profitable. 
Now let me turn to costs. On a constant dollar basis, exclusive of new business initiative and incremental M&A, we are guiding that fixed expenses for 2012 will be below the 2011 cost of $166 million. This includes absorbing incremental variable costs associated with higher technology revenues. As Duncan mentioned earlier, one of our key 2012 priorities will be the build-out of our post-trade capabilities in Europe. We will provide more guidance on the costs and benefits of this initiative once we finalize our plans. The incremental expenses and capital spending is expected to have a favorable rate of return once we can report the clearing revenues and rationalize cost for LCH to handle risk management and treasury functions for Liffe clearing.
Turning to capital. We expect CapEx in 2012 to be above last year's $170 million but still below our maintenance level of $200 million due in part to incremental capital spending to build on our clearing capabilities. Our $550 million buyback will become effective after today's earnings. We expect to complete the buyback in 2012. We are confirming our long-term financial policy of targeting debt levels between 2x and 2.25x EBITDA. 
Lastly on taxes, we anticipate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 26% for 2012.
I'll now turn the call back to Duncan for some concluding remarks before we open the line for questions."

Thanks, Mike. So just to summarize, the results for the quarter and full year 2011 were solid driven by strong volumes, continued cost discipline and increasing contributions from our non-trading businesses as a result of our diversification efforts over the past few years. We're pleased with the progress we are making on our strategy to create a global capital markets community that will empower our clients to innovate and collaborate. 
And as we move to through 2012, we are not sitting still waiting for the operating environment to improve. We are focusing on those levers within our control to execute against our community strategy and to expand our ability to generate underlying earnings per share growth. As we've said, this will be accomplished through a mix of targeted revenue-generating initiatives, accelerated cost efficiency efforts and strategic capital deployment. As we talked about, we've already executed it recently, $100 million of stock repurchases at a price just below $27, and our announced $550 million additional share repurchase program will begin immediately. 
So with that, we're happy to open the line for questions. We'll have time to take a few questions. And then as always, we'll make ourselves available to the analyst community throughout the day. So thank you."

Post the data center build, we thought maintenance level CapEx would come down to a number south of $200 million. And I think it did. I think you're right, Roger. I think it would have been a little higher last year if we had continued to invest in the completion of the build-out of Liffe Clear. I still think it would have been under $200 million, but it would have been a little bit higher. So I think we're trying to reflect that as we sort of look at what the CapEx for '12 looks like. I do honestly believe having stayed very close to some of the big banking customers in terms of their needs to reinvent their business, but in fairness to them, as they were thinking about a big outsourcing decision in 2011 and looking at us and saying, ""Okay, I understand the value proposition. Can you tell me with certainty where your data centers and where your hubs are going to be in 2012 and beyond?"" I think it would've been disingenuous of us to represent that, that was a certainty given what was going on with the merger, the various technology platform discussions that were being held. So I think it was an easy decision for them to put off for the time being. And I think we now need to revisit with them, and I think that's one of the reasons, among several, that we think the Technology business' double-digit revenue growth is pretty easily achieved in 2012, as far as we can tell, given that we know some of those decisions were put on hold. And lastly, as I've said to some of you before, yes, this was certainly a drain on a few of us. A few of us were back and forth to Europe quite a bit. At the same time, our strategy was to involve as few people as possible in executing the merger. And what I mean by that is my philosophy was to take a meaningful percentage of a handful of people's time instead of a very small percentage of a lot of people's time. So I think people like Mike and Larry have been able to stay very focused on the task at hand, which is why we feel better about going into '12. So I do think you're right. There are a lot of near-term opportunities, whether it's around clearing or the technology business or just a return rigor on capital deployment, which we obviously largely put on hold last year even though we were generating a ton of free cash flow that I think get us pretty excited about 2012. Lastly, I share your excitement in keeping the team together. That is one of the side benefits. And we had a team led by Larry that has been focusing on what would happen if the merger weren’t approved, and that's why I think we've been able to be, a week after prohibition, able to give you guys as much information as we've given on the call this morning.

But you also said -- particularly on the cash side, and I think that was new, that you're evaluating other alternatives. And obviously, there are a lot of clearinghouses out there, independent ones. So maybe you can talk about that. And then on the Derivatives side, obviously, during this whole process with DB1, you even talked about LCH a little bit. So I know you can't be too specific, but is that something that could still make sense given also the regulatory form? And then just lastly, sorry to drag it out, but you obviously worked very closely with DB1. In the process, you were excited about capital efficiencies and so forth. Are there things that you can do with DB1 going forward? And I know that you have a good relationship or better relationship with them that could accelerate growth areas."

But we'll call that a 4-part -- one question that had 4 parts. So firstly, on the Derivatives side, I think -- remember, as far as we got with Liffe Clear was really everything but some of the treasury and risk management functions. So a big part of that build-out was already done for our Derivatives business. So I don't think it's a big lift from here. And I take full responsibility for having put that project on hold in 2011. Some of our best people are already re-engaged. They have been for a few weeks now, and off they go. So I think we'll be able to give, as Larry said, a lot more clarity on some of the milestones for that, the timing of all that, et cetera. On the cash side, as we've said before, I don't think it's nearly as strategic, but that doesn't mean it's not imported commercially to us. Those of you who have been with us for a while will remember that going back a few years ago, the cost of those services provided to us were quite high, which meant it was quite high for our customers because it was just a pass-through. So while we reduced those costs significantly in the last couple of years, I do believe that they are still priced -- our provider still prices them above the market. And I think we have some work to do there to either strike a commercially viable agreement with them or think about other options there. As far as LCH goes, I think it's fair to say we'd obviously be very interested in what happens with that asset. We own nearly 10% of the company. We have a board seat, and we're the enterprise's largest customer. We think that the company has a great deal of potential under Ian Axe's leadership. I think he's been doing a great job since he got in there. But whether it's LCH or the alliance, as you referred to, with DB1, I think given the shifting landscape and the clients' need for capital efficiency, I think it would be foolish for us not to consider any and all go-forward alliances that might make sense between various exchanges and clearing organizations. Ultimately, it has to be all about the customer. And if there are things we could all do together to provide some of those cash capital efficiencies that people may not be able to do individually, we should certainly consider that. I think the alliance we have with DTC and NYPC is a great example of that. That was pretty much unprecedented. And I think that puts us in position to provide capital efficiency that neither we nor DTC could do alone. So hopefully, that gets at most of your question, Alex."

When this was first floated as much as 1 year ago, I think it was a lot more draconian than it sort of evolved to. I think common sense has prevailed and people realized that the policymakers in Europe, I think, have come to realize that while it sounds good on paper, when you get down to the details and talk about how to implement it, you realize that if it's not implemented broadly and pretty consistently, it gets challenging at best. And I think policymakers also realized that it's not that hard for a lot of the volume to migrate across border now. So I think what we were trying to say in our remarks, and look, I want to reiterate, this is a populous enough issue that we should all expect it to stay in the press for the foreseeable future. But I think if you listen to the news coming out of Europe of late, these proposals are sort of evolving to stamp duty proposals, so sort of a fraction of an amount that we've lived with another jurisdiction around the world before. We do think the latest proposals are at least a little more sensible because they are limited in scope. They're not as dramatic in terms of costs as the originally proposed ones were. And if you exempt the things we'd be most worried about are, we just don't want to affect price discovery and liquidity, then obviously, if you exempt liquidity providers and market makers, which we imagine would be a pretty broad definition, hopefully, it's easy for everyone to see why we'd be more optimistic that it's a fairly muted impact on the business. So that's -- it's a long-winded answer to a long question. And we also think if they apply it, it'll apply to MTFs and exchanges, so I don't think there's as much opportunity for regulatory arbitrage as there was talked about a few months ago. The second part of your question, I think, bears watching. I think we're going to have to stay very close to that. I think if we have any learnings from the recent experience we had in Europe is that they, the policymakers there, are bound and determined to push some of these regulations through. And I think we will keep a very close eye on where that goes. Certainly, in the cash business, I think we think that the silo’s already more or less been broken, and where it goes from here and the derivatives market remains to be seen. As we've mentioned on this call and to some of you before, I think everyone should tread carefully because I don't get the sense that there is similar momentum for such change in North America, South America or Asia, nor do I think there will be in the near term."

Good morning, everybody, and thanks, as always, for joining us. Before I get into the details on Slide 3, let me just tell you what we're going to try to accomplish this morning. I thought I'd start by saying a few words about",3691,"All right. Thanks, Stephen. Good morning, everybody, and thanks, as always, for joining us. Before I get into the details on Slide 3, let me just tell you what we're going to try to accomplish this morning. I thought I'd start by saying a few words about the merger prohibition announcement from last week. We'll move quickly into what we've accomplished in 2011, and I think the most important focus this morning will be to outline our plan for creating value for shareholders in the quarters to come. So let me just dispense with the merger first, if I may.
It is our view and it was our view, and I think it continues to be our view, that the proposed merger was a great opportunity to accelerate our strategy. It was a great opportunity to create long-term value for shareholders, and we also believed it would provide substantial benefits with regard to capital efficiencies for the capital markets community. 
However, given the narrow market definition that the Commission chose to use when evaluating the transaction, it was my view that the industrial logic of the transaction would've been significantly compromised if we agreed to meet the Commission's demand for remedies, and we were not going to violate the trust that the shareholders placed on us when they voted to support the deal this past summer. So the deal is done. It's behind us, and I want to be very, very clear about that. I'd like to close that remark by thanking the shareholders, the customers, and most importantly, our employees for their patience and support during this process. I'm still glad we tried. But unfortunately, the outcome was not what we'd hoped for. 
So now let's move on to 2011. I'm extremely pleased to share our full year 2011 results with you, which, as you can see, were characterized by a 6% increase in revenue, a 21% increase in operating income and a 19% increase in both net income and earnings per share. The results were driven by strong trading volumes, continued cost discipline and more meaningful contributions from new initiatives. We beat our cost guidance for the year as cost declined 4% on a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis, and we were well below $200 million in CapEx. While we fell short of our target of 15% revenue growth in our NYSE Technologies business, we did achieve double-digit revenue growth under challenging market conditions and the uncertainty for clients that was created by the proposed merger. 
On the business front, we made significant progress in growing our NYSE Liffe U.S. business with the launch of interest rate derivatives and the migration of the MSCI Emerging Markets and EAFE stock index futures to our exchange. Open interest in these products has nearly doubled since the migration and open interest across the entire exchange surpassed the $1 million contracts mark in December.
Our approach to semi-mutualization has also paid off in our NYSE Amex Options business, where we worked with our partners to continue to grow the business in 2011. Together with NYSE Arca Options, we grew our market share to a record 28%, which was #1 in U.S. equity options. 
We were also the global leader in IPOs in 2011 with 3x the total proceeds rates by our nearest U.S. competitor, who was ranked #8 globally. We continue to make progress in 2012 with big wins in the text sector, as well as continued momentum on the transfer side. Since the beginning of 2010, we have had nearly 3x the number of companies transferred to the NYSE as opposed to away from the NYSE.
The strategy in the Technologies business continued to make strong inroad into Asia in particular with our acquisition of Metabit and the deepening of our relationship with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 
Overall, as you look at Slide 3, if you look at what we accomplished in 2011 and then remember that we also moved a transformational cross-border exchange merger further than any other, the ability to have done both is a testament to the team here and our relentless focus on execution that has become a hallmark of our company. Outside of the post-trade arena, where we slowed the building of our own clearinghouse, we really did not miss a beat last year. Now with 2011 behind us, the key is what are the next steps in the evolution of our company? The next several slides that I'll walk through will address the measures we are going to take to grow the company, guided by our community strategy that has accelerated our growth the last couple of years. A more detailed presentation of these efforts will come on April 2 at our Investor Day.
Please turn to Slide 4. On Slide 4, we highlight in the firm our community strategy and give you the 3 pillars that will drive multiyear earnings growth for NYSE Euronext, assuming only modest improvements in the underlying operating environment. If you look back to 2009 and '10, those were the years when we were finishing our global technology harmonization and building out our data centers as part of our capital markets community strategy. All the work that we accomplished during that time set the table for 2011, where we saw a step-up in earnings power and delivery. Despite the challenging near-term outlook for trading volumes, we remain optimistic about the future. We have within our control several levers that we can pull to drive earnings higher, again with just modest improvements in the operating environment.
These levers are the 3 pillars of our equity story we are laying out for you today, and again, greater detail will be provided at the Investor Day in a few weeks. If you look at the right side of the slide, the first pillar is focused on targeted growth opportunities. First, we will be rolling out a series of organically grown new products and services while continuing to focus on market structure innovation in our core markets. Our portfolio of post-trade services will be a key priority in 2012. We have a solid clearing footprint in both Europe and the U.S., which we will now build on to improve our existing businesses and to create new service opportunities. Next, we are expecting NYSE Technologies to continue its double-digit growth trajectory with enhanced managed service capabilities and expanded connectivity and data offerings. And lastly, in the targeted growth opportunity area, we are looking to NYSE Liffe U.S. to accelerate its growth with the possible addition of new partners and an expanded product portfolio.
The second pillar is cost efficiency. Looking back to our merger with Euronext, since that time, we have pulled out over $600 million from the cost base. This has involved hard decisions about our organizational construct, as well as changing the way we do business. This rigor will continue. Next, we will continue to examine our investment portfolio and exit those that are loss-making and/or not expected to achieve the anticipated level of revenue generation as we prioritize our set of growth initiatives. We are also examining our infrastructure to be sure that we are optimally structured for our current and future operational needs. 
The last pillar of our story is strategic capital deployment. Over the past several years, we have returned approximately $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are pledging to continue our shareholder focus with the recently announced $550 million repurchase program. We have several stakes in other companies that, in our opinion, have limited strategic benefit or have not lived up to our expectations. We will continue to examine opportunities to harvest these investments and reallocate the capital to other more attractive opportunities. Lastly, over the past year, we have seen some interesting opportunities on the M&A front, but we emphasized our hope for merger. We will now begin to look at potential complementary strategic M&A opportunities going forward. 
In the next few slides, I will focus on the first pillar of our growth story, and Mike will provide some further granularity on the other 2 pillars when he gets into his remarks.
Please turn to Slide 5. Slide 5 shows our strengths and opportunities and illustrate the compelling targeted revenue initiatives we have underway. You should recognize this slide when -- which we first introduced at our shareholder meeting last April. While the DB merger would have helped us fill this chart out, we believe that we have several compelling opportunities on our own in many of these areas. 
On the right side of the chart, we show a sample of high-potential initiatives that both enhance our areas of strength and move us beyond our core business. In addition to new product opportunities and derivatives and continued market structure innovation in our core markets, shown as number 6 on this chart, we have some key initiatives in areas of strength that include number 3. We will continue to build on the success we have achieved by partnering with our clients on NYSE Amex and NYSE Liffe U.S. Number 4, we are enhancing our connectivity for NYSE Technologies through the expansion of our network of liquidity hubs around the globe. Number 5, we are looking to make investments in issuer services similar to our acquisition of Corporate Board Member and our minority stake in the receivables exchange, which we believe further enhance our listings brand. And lastly, number 7, we are focused on enhancing our managed services capabilities for NYSE Technologies. 
There are also some initiatives that we believe will extend our capabilities beyond our core business. Number one, which you all know will be a key focus for us in 2012, will be completing the development of a post-trade solution for our European derivatives and cash equities businesses. And number two, coming back to the U.S., we will be launching new products in NYSE Liffe U.S. and NYPC, the next one of which, which was just announced, will be a future base on DTC's GCF Repo Index. We hope this will continue to round out NYSE Liffe U.S. and NYPC's capitally efficient value proposition.
My next several slides will go into more detail on some of these opportunities. Please turn to Slide 6. Slide 6 focuses on our post-trade portfolio, which, as I just said, will be a critical area for us in 2012. As I said earlier, we have a strong clearing footprint in both Europe and the U.S., which we will now further develop to improve our existing business and to create new service opportunities. Our immediate focus in 2012 is in Europe, where we will, firstly, enhance our current derivatives post-trade services with attractive new solutions, completing the build-out of NYSE Liffe Clear, which I'll focus on in a minute. Secondly, part of the effort will be to develop new OTC clearing capabilities in collaboration with our users. And thirdly, we will review our European cash clearing options to make sure we select arrangements for the future, which offer stability, capital efficiency and innovation for our customers.
The second area of focus, which I just mentioned, will be NYSE Liffe Clearing and our overall derivatives platform. We made significant investments in NYSE Liffe Clearing through 2011, rolling out a new clearing processing engine, the Universal Clearing Platform, which delivered significant performance improvements to our customers. This technology investment program will continue through 2012 as we roll out new technology interfaces to improve customer service and latency. 
While some of our standalone post-trade plans were put on hold in 2011, we have already re-launched our project to convert NYSE Liffe Clearing into a full-service CCP. These plans involve expanding the service to clear all of our European derivatives products and to deliver many of the operational and capital efficiencies for customers, which we envisioned in the merger. We will also develop the OTC clearing capabilities, which I referenced earlier, and we will complete the removing of the reliance on third-party providers by introducing new in-house solutions for treasury management services.
We look forward to engaging with users to develop a full-service U.K.-based clearinghouse, which will offer operating and capital efficiencies, provide innovative solutions across listed and OTC markets and provide an unrivaled level of customer service. With legislation beginning to crystallize on the new mandates which will be imposed for central clearing of derivatives, now is the right time in our opinion to be working with users to develop competitive clearing solutions that will meet their needs. The current derivatives clearing arrangements with LCH.Clearnet expire in the middle of next year. 
On the European cash clearing side, we're accelerating the review of the strategic options available for clearing our European cash markets. These markets are cleared by LCH.Clearnet in Paris with the current arrangements due to expire at the end of next year. No decisions have been taken on cash clearing, and all options will now be reviewed with a view to promptly identify the most efficient, stable, secure and commercially appropriate solution for the future for our clients and for us.
And lastly on this slide, a minute on New York Portfolio Clearing. NYPC was created last year to deliver unique capital efficiencies to the market by evaluating and margining a clearing member's risk on a portfolio basis across related cash and derivative positions. There are a number of expansion opportunities under active consideration for NYPC, as I noted earlier. More to come in this important area on April 2.
Please turn to Slide 7. Slide 7 is an update on the NYSE Technologies business, which grew revenues by more than 10% year-over-year and will be a significant contributor to our future growth. We remain committed to the $1 billion revenue target in 2015 and committed as well to the margin of 25% to 30% in that business. Our strategic vision for this business is to become the facilitator and enabler of the capital markets community, and the roadmap to achieve this vision is focused on 4 key tenets that will guide us as we innovate. We executed against each tenet in 2011 by introducing new products and services in each arena. On the right-hand side of the table, we show a handful on the significant deals that we signed last year. And these wins, in our mind, validate the strategy we are pursuing. Let me briefly walk you through the 4 key tenets. 
First, building out the network. We recently opened new liquidity centers in Chicago, Toronto and Tokyo to give customers the ability to access new markets with unparalleled speed and reliability. In 2011, we also expanded our SFTI network into Mexico and the U.K., increasing direct connectivity to new markets and new participants. We acquired Metabit, which provides industry-leading access to financial markets across Asia, accelerating our efforts in that region. 
Secondly, we are extending our data services footprint. We rolled out the SuperFeed product in Europe, connecting 30 markets to the access centers in London and Frankfurt. SuperFeed provides immediate access to our exchanges data but also to data from a range of key global markets across the SFTI network. 
Third, it's about building out the service platform. Two major initiatives were successfully launched in 2011 to reinforce our leading position as a service platform provider. We launched the Capital Markets Community Platform, the most secure, reliable and scalable financial services cloud computing environment in the industry. And we created a vendor neutral platform driven by the financial services technology community by open sourcing our MAMA programming interface.
Lastly, we continue to be focused on attracting other market venues. In 2011, we successfully deployed the first fully hosted MTF and ATS solutions, confirming this is an important product for future growth and consistent with where we think our model can go. Add this to our successful partnerships in Tokyo and Warsaw, and you can see why we believe that NYSE Technologies is poised for future double-digit revenue growth.
Please turn to Slide 8. On Slide 8 we show how partnering with our clients has helped grow our Derivatives business. First, NYC Liffe U.S. 2011 was a key year for NYSE Liffe U.S. with our launch of its interest rate futures complex and the much-anticipated launch of NYPC, which was recently named the most innovative clearinghouse in North America during 2011. The platform gained momentum from the launch of interest rate futures, as well as the successful migration of the MSCI Liffe [ph] index futures. Since this migration in June of 2011, as I mentioned earlier, open interest in ADV in the MSCI products has nearly doubled, led by the emerging markets Index products. 
The platform's success in 2011 culminated with our crossing the $1 million contracts of open interest milestone in December. This was led by Eurodollar futures where our open interest now represents 10% market share. 2012 will be a critical year for this venture, and we are working on several new initiatives, including launching new products such as options on futures, connecting new clearing members and adding new partners. These efforts should accelerate our progress.
The platform plans continue its innovation theme during 2012. As noted by our January 4 press release announcing that NYSE Liffe U.S. has obtained the exclusive license to list futures based on DTCC's GCF Repo Index futures. Market feedback since that announcement has been overwhelmingly positive. 
Finally, Risk Magazine recently named NYSE Liffe U.S. Exchange of the Year, so we're excited about the prospects for this venture in 2012 and beyond.
Next, let me turn to NYSE Amex Options. We have been very pleased with the growth of the NYSE Amex U.S. Equity Options business and the support of our partners. We have seen Amex market share growth from under 6% in the fourth quarter of 2008 to north of 15% in the fourth quarter of 2011. This growth has been possible in part due to our partners who now hold 47.5% of the venture. Several key achievements have been instrumental to success in this venture.
While we oppose the Qualified Contingent Cross order type when ISE first proposed it, given the SEC approval and our acknowledgment that we need to be competitive in the market, we launched a similar product, and the early returns have been very positive.  
Another key addition this year was the complex order auction functionality, which allows customers to see graphic price improvement electronically. Lastly, Amex complex order book volume was up over 350% year-on-year. While we're pleased with our growth in this new space, further expansion remains a significant opportunity for us in 2012. 
Lastly for me, before I turn it over to Mike, please turn to Slide 9. On Slide 9, we attempt to address a number of the elements in the macro environment that have created uncertainty. Here, we depict the various clouds on the horizon, many of which we believe may also come with a silver lining. With a focus on those elements of our business model that we can control, combined with solid execution of our strategy, we are optimistic that these clouds will not materially impact our business in the near term and may actually afford us with some new unexpected opportunities. 
First, in terms of derivatives reform, we have always supported regulatory efforts that bring transparency and better risk management to the markets. We support these efforts because it makes sense for our markets and will significantly reduce systemic risk. Both EMEA and Europe and Dodd-Frank in the U.S. encourage derivatives to move toward a cleared environment, and we have been actively involved in the dialogue in both regions. But the overhang of these reforms is causing uncertainty, changes in our clients' business models and underinvestment. However, as banks look to reduce costs, we believe we are well positioned to serve as a major provider of outsourced trading infrastructure to the sell side as they reinvent their own business models. And with capital becoming an increasingly scarce and valuable resource, capitally efficient clearing houses like NYPC are poised to offer a lot of value to the end users.
Next, we all know we are operating in a lower-volatility, lower-growth environment driven by the lingering effects of the financial crisis, which is keeping rates at or near 0. This type of environment dampens volumes and results in even greater internalization in the U.S. cash markets, as we witnessed in early 2012. On the flip side though, more stable markets means companies are better able to raise capital in the public markets, which is good for our listings business as the pipeline loosens up. It also highlights the benefit of our diversified revenue model. If these lower volatility conditions persist, 2012 promises to be a very good year for capital issuance.
Uncertainty continues to persist around the euro as well, and that is naturally taking a toll an investment and growth in Europe. However, the silver lining here is that spikes in volatility drive volume, and the evolving landscape may also present new product opportunities for us in cash and particularly in derivatives, tough for capital formation but good for transaction volumes. 
Lastly, the financial transaction tax has received its fair share of headlines in recent months. We view the likelihood of a transaction tax as initially envisioned at the Eurozone or EU level as increasingly unlikely. Currently, there are individual tax proposals being floated in France and Germany, and we may even see unilateral action in other countries, notably Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium. In France, there is a reasonably strong likelihood that some form of stamp duty tax will pass. However, we believe the impact will be muted by the fact that it would be limited in scope and would exempt liquidity providers and market makers. In short, this is a politically charged issue, and we expect it to stay in the headlines in the near term. But in the final analysis, we place a low probability on the implementation of an FTT in Europe that would severely impact the business. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike for a review of the financial results. Thanks."

Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full year 2011. This quarter, there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.43 a share and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 a share. As previ",1966,"Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full year 2011. This quarter, there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.43 a share and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 a share. As previously communicated, fourth quarter 2011 results include a $25 million pretax charge related to our settlement with French tax authorities on the BlueNext VAT matter. In terms of P&L geography, the gross $42 million was recorded on the SG&A line with an offsetting $17 million recorded on the noncontrolling interest line, reflecting the payment made by our 40% joint venture partner CDC. 
In the quarter, we also reported a $46 million charge for merger expenses and exit costs, which included $38 million related to the merger. For 2011, a total of $85 million was spent on the merger. We are in the process of finalizing residual costs related to the merger, and we'll communicate this on our first quarter call.
Lastly, we benefited this quarter from being able to take a tax deduction for merger-related costs now that the merger has been prohibited. 
Our review our financial results in this call forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs, BlueNext tax settlement and the discrete tax item.
Slide 11 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the quarter and full year. Versus Q4 prior year, revenues were up and expenses lower, driving a 13% increase in operating income and a 9% increase in EPS. EPS of $0.50 a share is below the unseasonably strong $0.71 recorded in the third quarter of 2011. For the full year 2011, EPS was $2.48, up 19% versus 2010. 
The operating environment began to change in Q4 as volatility lessened and trading volumes declined an average of 17% across all our trading venues from Q3. This trend continued into January of this year. Fortunately, our diversified portfolio enables us to weather these periods better than was the case a few years ago. For 2011, 48% of our revenues was attributed to trading volumes. In the quarter, we grew nontrading-related revenues both versus Q3 and prior year, as well as from continued cost discipline. Q4 operating margins increased to 34%, and full year margins climbed 5 percentage points to 38%. This is driven by incremental margins that were greater than 100% in the quarter and for the full year.
NYSE Amex Options continued to perform well in the quarter with market share of 15% for Q4, our highest level of quarterly market share. For the quarter, the pretax profit attributable to the noncontrolling interest on Amex Options was $9 million based on the 47.5% stake in the business held by our partners. For the full year, higher technology services revenue, stronger trading volumes in European cash and U.S. equity options, combined with strong increases in U.S. average net revenue capture and a 1% decline in reported expenses drove double-digit increases in operating income and earnings. We generated $1.3 billion in adjusted EBITDA from the full year 2011, the highest level of EBITDA generation since 2008.
Diluted share count was down slightly due to $100 million in share repurchases in the fourth quarter. 
Slide 12 and 13 detail the financial performance for our Derivatives segment. Derivatives accounted for 32% of our consolidated net revenues and 42% of our operating income in 2011. Net revenues decreased by 1% in the quarter. It rose 4% for the full year. Global Derivative Volumes increased 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by a 15% increase in U.S. equity options, which offset a 3% decline in European derivatives. Revenue capture for the quarter was slightly favorable for NYSE Liffe versus both Q3 and prior year quarter due principally to product mix and volumes, whereas capture for U.S. options was lower. 
As a reminder, beginning December 1, we modified pricing for the trading of individual equity options and index futures and options on NYSE Liffe Amsterdam and Belgium. These ADVs represent approximately 10% of total NYSE Liffe volumes in 2011. We expect this pricing change to decrease NYSE Liffe overall capture by an annualized 3% to 4%.
As Duncan indicated, Global Derivatives continues to be a major area of focus for future investment and growth. Our Liffe U.S. and NYPC businesses were still very much in investment phase for 2011, both reporting sizable losses. In 2012, we are planning incremental investments in building out our European clearing capabilities and the new product and service offerings.
Similarly, Slides 14 and 15 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading and Listings account for 50% of our consolidated net revenues and 47% of our operating income in 2011. Cash Trading and Listings net revenues was $315 million in the fourth quarter 2011, up 2% versus prior year but down 11% compared to the third quarter of 2011. European cash ADV of $1.6 million transactions increased 13% from the fourth quarter 2010 levels but decreased 17% from Q3 levels. In U.S. cash equities volumes increased 5% to 2.1 billion shares last year and decreased 18% from strong third quarter levels.
Market share was down slightly in Q4 for U.S. cash and was 65% in our 4 European markets compared to 72% in the prior year. That said, European share was stable quarter-on-quarter. Listings revenue increased $5 million year-over-year and was up $24 million for the full year 2011. IPO slowed in the fourth quarter. However, the pipeline is strong. Revenue capture for U.S. cash increased to $0.039 per 100 shares handled for Q4, well above the $0.033 recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010. Since the second quarter of 2010, we have linked tiers to overall U.S. consolidated volumes, we moved the inversion at the highest tier on Arca and benefited from sponsored access rule changes.
Revenue capture for European cash decreased to $0.58 from $0.71 in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $0.64 in the third quarter of 2011. The decline in capture was driven primarily by a reduction in fees at auction and lower trade size, which began in August and continued through December. Pricing in basis points is up slightly versus Q3.
Slide 16 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. This segment accounted for 20% of our net revenues and 13% of our operating income in the fourth quarter. Information Services and Technology Solutions revenue was $127 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $13 million or 11% from Q4 prior year. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in SFTI and co-location revenue and growth from managed service sales to TSE, Warsaw and Sigma X. Revenues for this segment have grown sequentially every quarter this year. For the year, our Technology segment grew revenues 10% and expanded margins from 20% to 26%.
Slide 17 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expenses. Despite the intense focus on the merger, we made excellent progress this year on reducing our operating expenses. Q4 expenses were favorable to our prior guidance attributed to high cost management, a stronger U.S. dollar and a onetime savings realized from a real estate transaction in Europe. Fourth quarter operating expenses were down $9 million versus last year on a reported basis. 38% of our expenses in Q4 were denominated in either euros, 18%, or pounds, 20%. After adjusting for FX and the impact of transactions such as NYSE Blue JV and the acquisition of Corporate Board Member and Metabit, fixed operating costs were down $16 million or 4% from the fourth quarter of 2010. 
The end of 2011 was reported fixed cost $12 million below 2010. However, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and changes to our portfolio, our expenses were $70 million or 4% below prior year levels. This puts us well below the commitment we made to you in early 2010 that our expenses will be less than $1,650 million on a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis in 2011.
Slide 18 reconciles our cost evolution since 2007 merger with Euronext. Over this period, we saved over $650 million on a constant portfolio basis. About 2/3 of the savings was reinvested through business acquisitions or new business start-ups. In 2012 and 2013, cost efficiency will remain a priority. We see further opportunities to leverage resources efficiently for the benefit of the group with the goal of achieving a community premium for the company. As Duncan mentioned, there are a number of target areas where we'll be seeking greater efficiencies. We'll provide greater transparency on this at our Investor Day.
Slide 19 details our cash and debt position as of December 31, 2011. The company ended the year in a strong balance sheet position. A combination of EBITDA growing 15% and debt declining $300 million reduced our leverage ratio to 1.6x, down from 2.2x at the end of 2010. This is the lowest level of leverage since NYSE and Euronext merged. Capital expenditures were $54 million in the quarter compared to $61 million in the prior year quarter. For the year, capital expenditures were $170 million, well below our full year guidance of less than $200 million in capital spending. 
We executed $100 million in stock repurchases during the fourth quarter as part of our $1 billion share outstanding. We're repurchasing 3.7 million shares at an average price of $29.96. A total of $550 million remains on the existing share buyback authorization, and these repurchases will be funded out of cash on hand and cash from operating activities through 2012.
Repurchases at current stock price levels are highly accretive. We see our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation as a major enabler for future earnings growth. With the merger now prohibited, we are in the process of building a multiyear plan to grow earnings and strategically reposition the company. We will dive deeper into this plan at our Investor Day on April 2. 
On Slide 20, we are providing some preliminary guidance for 2012. First, let me discuss revenue. Duncan discussed our growth priorities earlier in the presentation. We are targeting another year of double-digit growth for NYSE Technologies, and we expect margins to improve from the 26% level achieved in 2011. Over the past 2 years, we have invested heavily in our U.S. futures business, Liffe U.S. We expect the financials in this venture to improve in 2012, and by 2013, to turn profitable. 
Now let me turn to costs. On a constant dollar basis, exclusive of new business initiative and incremental M&A, we are guiding that fixed expenses for 2012 will be below the 2011 cost of $166 million. This includes absorbing incremental variable costs associated with higher technology revenues. As Duncan mentioned earlier, one of our key 2012 priorities will be the build-out of our post-trade capabilities in Europe. We will provide more guidance on the costs and benefits of this initiative once we finalize our plans. The incremental expenses and capital spending is expected to have a favorable rate of return once we can report the clearing revenues and rationalize cost for LCH to handle risk management and treasury functions for Liffe clearing.
Turning to capital. We expect CapEx in 2012 to be above last year's $170 million but still below our maintenance level of $200 million due in part to incremental capital spending to build on our clearing capabilities. Our $550 million buyback will become effective after today's earnings. We expect to complete the buyback in 2012. We are confirming our long-term financial policy of targeting debt levels between 2x and 2.25x EBITDA. 
Lastly on taxes, we anticipate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 26% for 2012.
I'll now turn the call back to Duncan for some concluding remarks before we open the line for questions."

Thanks, Mike. So just to summarize, the results for the quarter and full year 2011 were solid driven by strong volumes, continued cost discipline and increasing contributions from our non-trading businesses as a result of our diversification efforts over the past few years. We're pleased with the progress we are making on our strategy to create a global capital markets community that will empower our clients to innovate and collaborate. 
And as we move to through 2012, we are not sitting still waiting for the operating environment to improve. We are focusing on those levers within our control to execute against our community strategy and to expand our ability to generate underlying earnings per share growth. As we've said, this will be accomplished through a mix of targeted revenue-generating initiatives, accelerated cost efficiency efforts and strategic capital deployment. As we talked about, we've already executed it recently, $100 million of stock repurchases at a price just below $27, and our announced $550 million additional share repurchase program will begin immediately. 
So with that, we're happy to open the line for questions. We'll have time to take a few questions. And then as always, we'll make ourselves available to the analyst community throughout the day. So thank you."

So I'll start with that, and then maybe Larry can add to some of that as well. I think the -- we did manage that. Post the data center build, we thought maintenance level CapEx would come down to a number south of $200 million. And I think it did. I think you're right, Roger. I think it would have been a little higher last year if we had continued to invest in the completion of the build-out of Liffe Clear. I still think it would have been under $200 million, but it would have been a little bit higher. So I think we're trying to reflect that as we sort of look at what the CapEx for '12 looks like. I do honestly believe having stayed very close to some of the big banking customers in terms of their needs to reinvent their business, but in fairness to them, as they were thinking about a big outsourcing decision in 2011 and looking at us and saying, ""Okay, I understand the value proposition. Can you tell me with certainty where your data centers and where your hubs are going to be in 2012 and beyond?"" I think it would've been disingenuous of us to represent that, that was a certainty given what was going on with the merger, the various technology platform discussions that were being held. So I think it was an easy decision for them to put off for the time being. And I think we now need to revisit with them, and I think that's one of the reasons, among several, that we think the Technology business' double-digit revenue growth is pretty easily achieved in 2012, as far as we can tell, given that we know some of those decisions were put on hold. And lastly, as I've said to some of you before, yes, this was certainly a drain on a few of us. A few of us were back and forth to Europe quite a bit. At the same time, our strategy was to involve as few people as possible in executing the merger. And what I mean by that is my philosophy was to take a meaningful percentage of a handful of people's time instead of a very small percentage of a lot of people's time. So I think people like Mike and Larry have been able to stay very focused on the task at hand, which is why we feel better about going into '12. So I do think you're right. There are a lot of near-term opportunities, whether it's around clearing or the technology business or just a return rigor on capital deployment, which we obviously largely put on hold last year even though we were generating a ton of free cash flow that I think get us pretty excited about 2012. Lastly, I share your excitement in keeping the team together. That is one of the side benefits. And we had a team led by Larry that has been focusing on what would happen if the merger weren’t approved, and that's why I think we've been able to be, a week after prohibition, able to give you guys as much information as we've given on the call this morning. Leibo, do you want anything to add for that on that part of it?"

But we'll call that a 4-part -- one question that had 4 parts. So firstly, on the Derivatives side, I think -- remember, as far as we got with Liffe Clear was really everything but some of the treasury and risk management functions. So a big part of that build-out was already done for our Derivatives business. So I don't think it's a big lift from here. And I take full responsibility for having put that project on hold in 2011. Some of our best people are already re-engaged. They have been for a few weeks now, and off they go. So I think we'll be able to give, as Larry said, a lot more clarity on some of the milestones for that, the timing of all that, et cetera. On the cash side, as we've said before, I don't think it's nearly as strategic, but that doesn't mean it's not imported commercially to us. Those of you who have been with us for a while will remember that going back a few years ago, the cost of those services provided to us were quite high, which meant it was quite high for our customers because it was just a pass-through. So while we reduced those costs significantly in the last couple of years, I do believe that they are still priced -- our provider still prices them above the market. And I think we have some work to do there to either strike a commercially viable agreement with them or think about other options there. As far as LCH goes, I think it's fair to say we'd obviously be very interested in what happens with that asset. We own nearly 10% of the company. We have a board seat, and we're the enterprise's largest customer. We think that the company has a great deal of potential under Ian Axe's leadership. I think he's been doing a great job since he got in there. But whether it's LCH or the alliance, as you referred to, with DB1, I think given the shifting landscape and the clients' need for capital efficiency, I think it would be foolish for us not to consider any and all go-forward alliances that might make sense between various exchanges and clearing organizations. Ultimately, it has to be all about the customer. And if there are things we could all do together to provide some of those cash capital efficiencies that people may not be able to do individually, we should certainly consider that. I think the alliance we have with DTC and NYPC is a great example of that. That was pretty much unprecedented. And I think that puts us in position to provide capital efficiency that neither we nor DTC could do alone. So hopefully, that gets at most of your question, Alex."

So with the financial transaction tax that Sarkozy wants to apply in France, it might be more of a stamp duty type of tax than a financial transaction tax. What exactly did you mean by a muted impact? I guess there, I'm trying to get to what sort of impact do you think you'd see in market share, potential opportunity for regulatory arbitrage, et cetera. And then the second part would be, with such a negative regulatory environment overall, to what extent are you worried that maybe a year or 2 down the line, either through method 2 or a mirror of some other construct, that Europe might try to blow up the vertical clearing model?"

When this was first floated as much as 1 year ago, I think it was a lot more draconian than it sort of evolved to. I think common sense has prevailed and people realized that the policymakers in Europe, I think, have come to realize that while it sounds good on paper, when you get down to the details and talk about how to implement it, you realize that if it's not implemented broadly and pretty consistently, it gets challenging at best. And I think policymakers also realized that it's not that hard for a lot of the volume to migrate across border now. So I think what we were trying to say in our remarks, and look, I want to reiterate, this is a populous enough issue that we should all expect it to stay in the press for the foreseeable future. But I think if you listen to the news coming out of Europe of late, these proposals are sort of evolving to stamp duty proposals, so sort of a fraction of an amount that we've lived with another jurisdiction around the world before. We do think the latest proposals are at least a little more sensible because they are limited in scope. They're not as dramatic in terms of costs as the originally proposed ones were. And if you exempt the things we'd be most worried about are, we just don't want to affect price discovery and liquidity, then obviously, if you exempt liquidity providers and market makers, which we imagine would be a pretty broad definition, hopefully, it's easy for everyone to see why we'd be more optimistic that it's a fairly muted impact on the business. So that's -- it's a long-winded answer to a long question. And we also think if they apply it, it'll apply to MTFs and exchanges, so I don't think there's as much opportunity for regulatory arbitrage as there was talked about a few months ago. The second part of your question, I think, bears watching. I think we're going to have to stay very close to that. I think if we have any learnings from the recent experience we had in Europe is that they, the policymakers there, are bound and determined to push some of these regulations through. And I think we will keep a very close eye on where that goes. Certainly, in the cash business, I think we think that the silo’s already more or less been broken, and where it goes from here and the derivatives market remains to be seen. As we've mentioned on this call and to some of you before, I think everyone should tread carefully because I don't get the sense that there is similar momentum for such change in North America, South America or Asia, nor do I think there will be in the near term.
With that guys, I promise if we didn't get to you, Mike and Stephen and the team will be available today. We thank you for your patience, not only on the call but really the last year.

Thanks for joining the call today. Just to preview with a bit to start out. Given that we did our investor day at the beginning of April, and then we just had the annual shareholders meeting just a few days ago, I",1954,"Thanks, Stephen, good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining the call today. Just to preview with a bit to start out. Given that we did our investor day at the beginning of April, and then we just had the annual shareholders meeting just a few days ago, I think since we've communicated so much recently, I think we can tell by the attendance on the call today, it's a little lighter than usual as well. We're going to keep our prepared remarks shorter than we normally do figuring there's not a lot of new news in here.
We'll leave the usual time that we leave for questions and then our expectation would be we'd have everybody kind of back to work by about 8:45 or so. From our point of view, the story of the first quarter is what we've done already and what we're continuing to do to set the table for growth. So that when the challenging market conditions we now face revert to what we believe are more historical norms. We are positioned to not only captured the revenue that comes with that the recovery, but to enhance our overall performance with new streams of revenues in a lower cost and reduced share count environment, which will magnify the operating leverage of the model.
We're doing this by executing our plans to Project 14 as we discussed at the Investor Day in early April. The actions we have taken with this comprehensive initiative will drive a step-up in the underlying earnings power of the company, which we believe will become evident in a more normal environment in 2013 and 2014.
So with that as a backdrop, let's turn to Slide 3. For the quarter, we recorded earnings per share of $0.47 per share, a net revenue of $601 million, down from $0.68 per share and $679 million in the prior-year period. Cost discipline, a hallmark of our team, continued in the quarter with cost down 3% year-over-year on a constant dollar and constant portfolio basis. We were #1 in listings globally for the fifth consecutive quarter and our share of technology IPOs in the U.S. year-to-date is approximately 60%.
In summary, we knew and expected this would be a challenging quarter for us given the difficult environment. We are seeing modest improvement in economic indicators around the world, which will generally bode well for our business. But unfortunately, we are still waiting for signs that trading volumes will return to the levels we have witnessed in 2010 and 2011.
Please turn to Slide 4. This is the Slide that we've used in other meetings. I think at the Investor Day as well. And it tries to depict the various crosswinds in the economic environment and the macro environment, in which we're operating our business. But a focus on what we can control and a solid execution of our strategy, we are optimistic that we can navigate through these in a way that will actually provide us with some opportunities.
First in terms of derivatives reform. We have always supported regulatory efforts that brings transparency and better risk management to markets. We support these efforts because it makes sense for our markets and will significantly reduce systemic risk. Both in the MEF Europe and Dodd-Frank here in the U.S. encourage derivatives to move toward a more centrally-cleared environment and we have been actively involved in the dialogue in both regions.
The overhang of these reforms however, is causing some uncertainty for our clients with regard to their business models and as a result, they continue to underinvest. As customers look to reduce costs however, we are well positioned to serve as a major provider of outsourced trading infrastructure.
With capital becoming increasingly scarce, capital efficient clearing houses like NYPC are also poised to offer a lot of value. Next, we are operating in  a low volatility, low growth environment, driven by the lingering effects of the financial crisis, which is keeping rates at or near 0. This type of environment dampens volumes and results in even greater internalization in the U.S. cash markets. On the flip side though, more stable markets mean companies are better able to raise capital in the public markets, which is good for our listings business.
It also highlights the benefits of our diversified revenue model.
Uncertainty continues to also persist around the euro and that is naturally taking a toll on investment and growth in Europe. However, the silver lining here is that spikes in volatility drive volume and the evolving landscape may also present new product opportunities for us in cash and derivatives. If any, indication volumes have already picked up the first half of April and throughout the month.
Lastly, while the low interest rate environment is conducive to balance sheet repair, our European derivatives business, which is focused on the short end of the yield curve is at a cyclical low and market participants see more opportunities to trade other interest rate underliers. That said, our derivatives trading volumes in Europe are holding up reasonably well and when the prospects for rate changes emerge, we should return to a more normal growth trajectory.
Please turn to Slide 5. On Slide 5, we highlighted a number of the growth initiatives that we are in the process of executing. This is a chart we showed at Investor Day. During the quarter, we provided you with our approach to building out clearing, announced project Trinity and launched the new initiative in the rates for our European derivatives business. I'm not going to go through each of the them as the team went through these a few weeks ago in a lot of detail but we will be continuing to update you on these initiatives entering into future.
I would however, like to comment on our technology services business. While we continue to see our technology business as a growth driver, we have experienced some dampening of demand recently. The spending growth rate in the technology sector has slowed more than we anticipated, which has resulted in lower technology sales in the first quarter. This is partly to geoeconomic factors but also uncertainty over the future regulatory landscape.
Our clients are demanding that major initiatives which they undertake show payback in 12 to 18 months and cost no more than their current operating and capital expenses to implement. In other words, no running costs, financial engineering is becoming a major part of the deal structures now.
Decision-making for many of our clients and prospects has also become more complex. And as a result, takes more time and when you do get close to a deal, there's a lot more parties involved in signing off. New initiatives have slowed and our customers are focused on cutting costs from existing infrastructure, such as reducing the number of vendors and cutting costs from existing vendor spent and we are seeing these in the reduction in unused cabinet inventory in both our Basel III and Mahwah data centers.
The silver lining we hope to all of this is that this issues support the managed service model that we have created with our business over the last 12 to 18 months. We have hit a temporary air pockets, which will have to work through but we're confident we will return to double-digit growth in revenue once the environment stabilizes.
Why are we confident? We have several key deals in the hopper and we're seeing some nice developments as a result of our acquisition of a 25% stake in Fixnetix where we are building a joint product pipeline. Other recent deals include a hosted matching engine for our global investor in no, a recently announced partnership with the Americas Trading Group to provide access to South American markets. And our agreement with the Hong Kong Exchanges and clearing to improve our consumers market data experience by delivering market data for all securities and derivatives traded by Hong Kong in a common message format.
Please turn to Slide 6. On Slide 6, we highlight the progress that we have been making in technology IPOs over the last few years and the strong pipeline for deals already on file with NYSE language. One of the areas on which we have been focused and has been a growth driver for us on the new listings front is emerging growth companies in the technology arena. In the early 2000s, we had less than 10% market share of the technology space. In 2008, we had about 20% and we have since grown our market share to approximately 60% year-to-date in 2012, which includes success more recently with companies like Yelp, LinkedIn, Pandora and Millennial Media.
There's also currently a strong pipeline with 118 IPOs on file with NYSE language, adding up to roughly $20 billion in proceeds, which includes the likes of Avaya, Service Now, Silver Spring networks and Mobile TV.
While we have seen European market concerns creeped back into the market, we still believe that the IPO window is opened and we will see more companies come to market in both the U.S. and Europe.
Lastly, for me before I turn it over to Mike, please turn to Slide 7. Consider this the first of many updates to ocme on what we call Project 14. We're purposely calling this project, Project 14, because it is not about this quarter or even this year. It is the time between now and 2014. Our goal is to spent this year, next year and the year after executing against 3 pillars: targeted growth, cost efficiency and strategic deployment of capital. So that by the end of 2014, we are in an even better position to compete and win in our core businesss.
Larry and Mike will be spearheading the cost efficiency part of this project and we will be as transparent as we're able to allow you to track our progress so nobody will have to guess how far along we are in this program. We're going to be focused on a series of short, medium and long-term actions around our technology platforms, streamlining our organization and optimizing how we do business.
We will divest underperforming assets and we will build out clearing, both of which we believe will provide us with incremental revenue that Mike will discuss in more detail but will also allow us to reduce cost.
So in the 4-week since we first announced the program, how are we doing? On the growth side of the ledger, we have lots of initiatives that are in progress, which we believe will yield return in our investment regardless of how the market environment evolves. Our focus is not only on executing these initiatives shown in the growth bucket, but also seeking additional opportunity to create value.
On the efficiency front, our costs are down and following our closure of SecFinex, we finalized the unwind of NYSE Blue. This is not meant to be a verdict on the environmental space, just simply a recognition that this market will take much longer to develop than we or our shareholders are willing to wait.
On the capital front, I think we can check a couple of boxes and it is nice to see that several of our peers are taking a page from our playbook by adding to their buybacks or establishing or increasing their dividends. Lastly, we bought back $125 million of stock in the quarter, our CapEx was $43 million in line with our full year guidance of about $200 million and we announced plans to reevaluate several more of our minority investments.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Mike for a review of our financial results."

In the quarter, we reported $31 million charge for merger and exit expenses, which included $16 million related to final fees under DB merger. Severance and exit costs were higher in the quarter as we launched our Project 14 efficiency efforts. Our GAAP results also reflect the impact of several discrete tax items related to a favorable tax settlement with U.K. tax authorities, which was more than offset by noncash expense related to changes from legal entities in the U.S.
Our review our financial results in this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs and the discrete tax items.
Slide 9 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the quarter. As we saw this quarter, operating leverage cuts both ways, that is really the story for the quarter. Lower volatility in volumes and the lower venues in particularly European derivatives coupled with a weaker euro has negatively impacted revenues versus Q1 2011 and last quarter.
Revenues of $601 million for the quarter were down 11% year-over-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter. Finance were down an average of 17% year-over-year and we're down an average of 7% from the traditionally slower fourth quarter period. While we continue to make headway in diversifying our business model, trading-related net revenues still makes up approximately 50% of our revenue base. And this revenue stream was down $88 million or 25% year-over-year. Revenue from other streams were up $10 million or 3% versus Q1 prior year. Across our lower $10 million or 2% for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 25% for the quarter, down from 26% in the prior year. The decline in the effective tax rate year-over-year was due to the aforementioned tax changes in the U.K. and U.S..
And our diluted share count was reduced 3 million shares to 259 million shares this quarter. The period end outstanding share count was 255 million. Slide 10 provides consolidated and segment results on a currency neutral basis. The U.S. dollar strength in this quarter versus prior year for both the euro and the British pound. For the first quarter, 45% of our net revenue was denominated in either euros or pounds and 55% in U.S. dollars. Currency impact on net revenue for the quarter was negative $9 million versus prior year and unfavorable $5 million versus the previous quarter.
Foreign exchange contributed an unfavorable $4 million to operating income this quarter versus prior year. On a currency neutral basis, first quarter net revenues were down 10% and operating income decreased 24% versus the first quarter of 2011. Operationally, revenues for our derivatives and Cash Trading and Listings increased 24% and 6%, respectively. Our technologies segment revenues were up an adjusted 6%.
Slide 11 and 12 detail the financial performance for our derivatives segment. Derivatives accounted for 29% of our consolidated net revenues and 35% of our operating income in the first quarter due to the decrease of $60 million in net revenues year-over-year principally driven by lower European derivatives trading volumes.
Finance are weakest in the rate area, while equity futures and option volumes were also impacted on the underlying reduction in equity trading. Open interest has moved higher from year-end 2011 levels but 17% lower than Q1 2011. We're at cyclical lows for this business, which is geared to the short end of the yield curve but we are confident that when expectations for rate increases escalate, we will return to a growth trajectory for this business.
Revenue capture for the quarter was lower for NYSE Liffe versus both Q4 and prior-year first quarter. Decline year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was principally due to a shift in volume mix. Specifically, lower volumes and higher capture short-term interest rate products, as well as modified pricing for the trading of individual equity options and index futures and options on the NYSE Liffe Amsterdam and Belgium.
Capture for the competitive U.S. options business was lower year-over-year but stable on a linked quarter basis. Higher percentage of dividends strategy trades over ARCA, the gaps offset by stronger capture on NYSE Amex Options.
NYSE Amex Options is on track for a record monthly market share in April of 16%. A clearing build is in full swing with a target date for fully insourcing life clear by Q3 2013. This is expected to save an annualized $30 million. Officially, moving clearing to Life Clear is targeted for Q1 2014. This move will enable us to realize approximately $40 million in annual revenues of traditional derivative clearinghouse margins.
Similarly, Slide 13 and 14 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading and Listings account for 51% of our consolidated net revenues and 53% of our operating income in the first quarter. Cash Trading and Listings net revenue was $304 million in the first quarter of 2012, down 7% versus the prior-year period and down 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.
The decrease was principally due to lower volumes, driven by a lower consolidated tape and an increase in OpEx trading in the U.S. European cash ADV of 1.6 million transactions decreased 12% from the first quarter of 2011 levels but was in line with fourth quarter 2011. For April 2012, we have seen a dramatic improvement in European cash volumes, with ADV rising nearly 20% from Q1. U.S. cash equities, volumes decreased 23% to 1.8 billion shares compared to prior year and decreased 16% from the fourth quarter 2011 levels. April month to date U.S. cash trading volumes remain at depressed levels.
Non-exchange traded share or TRX shares increased several percentage points year-to-date March to approximately 34% of the U.S. cash trading due to lower volatility and has impacted our market share in the U.S. cash, which is down in Q1 both against fourth quarter 2011 and first quarter 2011 levels. Market share in Europe has stabilized for the last few quarters at 65% in our 4 European markets compared to 70% in the prior year. European share figures exclude off-exchange trading volume.
Revenue capture for the U.S. cash increased to $0.042 per 100 shares handled for Q1. Well above the $0.037 recorded in the first quarter of 2011 and above the $0.039 in Q4. Revenue capture for European cash decreased to $0.57 from $0.67 in the first quarter of 2011 and were down slightly from the $0.58 in the fourth quarter of 2011.
14% decline in capture year-over-year was driven primarily by the overall decline in value traded in a weaker euro, partially offset by higher average basis point. Slide 16 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information and technology solutions accounted for 20% of our net revenue and 12% of our operating income in the first quarter of 2012. Information Services and Technology Solutions revenue was $121 million in the first quarter, an increase of $5 million or 4% from Q1 prior year. A constant exchange rates revenues were up 6% from prior year.
Softer sales in particular are traditionally weak in Quarter 1 versus Quarter 4 but in 2012, the economic environment accentuated this trend. While the Q1 results are below our expectations for this business, there reflect a very challenging for financial technology spending in the industry. Clients are delaying technology decisions, reducing staff levels, which impact market data revenues and lower volatility in trading environment is impacting co-location and productivity revenues.
We expect this trend to continue at least through Quarter 2. Medium-term, we remain convinced that we can resume double-digit top line growth with a solid pipeline of service opportunities and new product offerings.
Slide 16 provides a reconciliation of our underlying cost base and details investment spending for the quarter. This format also provides comparison to our full year cost guidance. This will enable investors to track our realization of the $250 million in annualized savings we committed to at the Investor Day as part of Project 14.
Current period expenses of $405 million are rebased to currency rates for ou r2012 cost guidance resulting in rebased cost base in Q1 2012 of $409 million. Expense total of $8 million in the 3 growth initiatives during the quarter. This translates to a first quarter cor expenses of $401 million. Our cost guidance for core expenses a range between 1,580,000,000 and 1,600,000,000, which represents projected 25% of savings of $250 million Project 14 goal.
Using our traditional methodology in measuring expenses, year-over-year on a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis, costs were down $12 million or 3%. Looking to Q2, the April divestiture of NYSE Blue should save $5 million in costs and $1 million in operating losses per quarter. Additionally, we expect to ramp up spending for our clearing and contract for differences initiatives.
Slide 17 details our cash and debt position as of March 31, 2012. Our cash and debt positions were similar to Q4 2011, with gross debt at $2.1 billion. This despite the first quarter where we paid annual bonuses, repurchased $125 million of stock and dispersed accumulated Section 31 fees. Debt levels were constant, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio increased 2x reflecting a weak Q1 for EBITDA.
Capital expenditures were $43 million in the quarter, compared to $35 million in the prior-year quarter. First half of the year is our strongest current for free cash flow generation as result of billings for annual listings fees. The executed $125 million in stock repurchases in the first quarter, repurchasing 4.3 million shares at an average price of $29.73.
Lastly, the board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the second quarter of 2012, which is payable on June 29. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Duncan for closing remarks."

As we move through 2012, we are not sitting still, waiting for the operating environment to improve. As we said at our Investor Day, we believe there's further value that can be unlocked by having these businesses as under 1 umbrella. We're focusing on unlocking that potentially, which is what Project 14 is all about.
We're focusing on the leverage within our control to execute against our community strategy and drive the step-up in our underlying earnings per share growth between now and 2014. This will be accomplished as we said a few times today through a mix of targeted revenue-generating initiatives, accelerated cost efficiency efforts and strategic capital deployment.

They're being asked to do that in a macro environment that is impacting them as much as it's impacting us as you can see from some of the results that the integrated investment banks have been publishing. So I don't think we are certainly not leading internally at this point ot worry about whether this quarter or after 3 years of a pretty consistent growth is suddenly the beginning of a new trend. I think if this persisted throughout this year, we would have to rethink kind of where we are on that. But we continue to believe there's good bolt-on acquisition opportunities and there's good organic growth opportunities in that business. And I will say what I've said before. I think that, that will largely the success in that arena will largely define the longer-term success of this company as I think that's where we and others in the industry are going to have to head."

But if you look at what we've done with NYPC and things like that where our contribution when we started that remember we had to fund the guarantee fund there as well. And the issues there are that was $25 million to $50 million funding. Remember that in our Life Clear business, we are doing most of the clearing already. We insourced everything but the Treasury and risk management functions. So of course, we will continue to stay focused on that. We'll seed it if whatever is required. We're under undertaking the discussions with the FSA now to talk about what they want that to look like. But we don't think that's going to be a huge hit to capital if indications today are any barometer. We also continue to think that although our credit rating is obviously well above investment-grade, well into investment-grade territory. I continue to believe as I've mentioned to some of you before that looking at the credit rating of the parent company of any clearing house, I believe is a strange way of thinking about it. If you really get down to it, when the exchanges guarantee fund will be tapped is so far down the risk waterfall that I can continue to say and I can't say that anybody is listening, but them going to continue to say generally, that the right way to think about the credit exposure in any clearing house is really a weighted average of all the clearing houses participants. I think that's much more important. And I think we're much more focused with the regulators that we're talking to about the realtime risk-controlled seen the clearing house and how to manage all of that. I think that's much more important than A, the credit rating of the top Co. And B, whether we put in $25 million, $50 million or $100 million in the guarantee fund, those are interesting facts, but not terribly relevant as compared to the other stuff.

And Mike I may add have something to add as well. But I'll start by saying this. I think we're not going to pat ourselves on the back. I mean, everyone can see the market share trends right and as I said it in my remarks and as I've said in some of you in of low volatility, low volume environment, it lend themselves more to internalization. It's not obvious to us why the volatility and volume stay here, why the dark pool of percentage of the market isn't going to stabilize or even increase potentially higher. Now our view maybe relative to some of our competitors is it's fairly simple calculus. You either chase revenue capture or profitability or you chase our market share. Obviously in this macro environment, it's difficult to do both. I think some of our competitors have chosen that they believe the optics of market share are better. I think we continue to believe that the markets are pretty fragmented. I'm not sure getting a couple of market SharePoint is going to convince anybody that we have a better business model. I think the revenue capture is more important because our view is if you return to a more normal volume and volatility environment, we know that affordability is highly correlated with our market share. And I think we've been a little bit more focused on revenue capture in reasonable ways where as clients are fully aware of and I think we do that rather than chase market share.

And I think that we were hopeful that 1 future arena that the NYSE BPC partnership and NYPC could explore was having already couple euro-dollar futures and the cash bonds to kind of create a more capital efficient clearing house I think the next obvious leg to that stool will do to try to figure out a way to get into the interest rate swaps. It's no secret to anybody on this call that LCH is SwapClear subsidiary which is less more or less governed by the important battles for the liquidity providers in the swaps market has been looking for a partner on U.S. soil for that for quite some time. And it's also no secret that they are the dominant force in the interest rate swap business. So our view was and we've announced that the Project Trinity, which we referenced at the Investor Day. The idea is LCH picks up basically the license by buying IDCG from NASDAQ. I don't view that the support during our strategy. I'd viewed as buying that license to lastly, partner with others and DTC so now we can bring that third leg of this tool into NYPC over time. So that's what Project Trinity is all about. At the same time on the other side of the pond, LSE is going to acquire a majority share of LCH assuming that deal gets approved sometime this year or next year. The timing on them getting approval will more or less coincide with us finishing the vertical integration of our own clearinghouse so remember, we insourced as I said earlier, all the Treasury and risk management functions. That's what we are working on, that's consistent with the press release that we put out a few months ago about our timetable and all of that. So roughly this time next year maybe a little later, we will be completing that migration into the clearinghouse so we will have our own clearinghouse, LSE will own the majority of LCH and we at LCH and DTC will hopefully right by then be partnering on that three-legged stool I referenced earlier so that we'll be able to clear interest rate futures, the cash underliers, as well as interest rate swaps. And I think that will be an unprecedented cross-margining opportunity as well. So hopefully that the press is most of what you're asking about. Finally, just 1 quick thing to add it came up twice now. On the debt-to-EBITDA, all we're doing at 1.6  to 2x with the first quarter EBITDA multiply it by 4 sort of look at things. It's the one-time bump is clearly moving from 2011 where EBITDA is higher to are really weak first quarter."

I think when we talked on top of that is with the lower volumes, 1 of the other revenue boost we've been getting is people purchasing more cabinets, more safety connectivity, et cetera and clearly in the lower volume environment, within to there's a lot of conservation so you're saying is there are some excess capacity and clearly we're not get incremental sales when sort of volume environment. So it's really those 2 things. But I think again we have the robust fourth quarter for software sales.

It's hard to have as much insight as into it does you can give it won't given the fact that don't have all the information. I do think that the confluence of factors, including lower volatility, lower volumes, the high-frequency community diversifying into other asset classes and geographies not being as reliant on the U.S.. And frankly, as I articulated I think publicly a couple of times, the regulatory, the potential for more regulatory scrutiny and in the interim, a lot of politics if I can use that the word were around these subject, some of the high-frequency folks we talk to the are simply saying, look, if this is going to be much focused on it, the majority of what we do is liquidity provision, I think whether it's an unintended consequence or not, some of the rhetoric from the regulators and politicians may be leading the high-frequency community to think about a lot of other alternatives and maybe in fact accelerating their move to either a, other asset classes and geographies, or B, some of the more likely regulated liquidity pools. Right. I mean, if you and I were high-frequency folks and their for the rarity have mentioned the paper informed or uninformed that say we're going to be bring a lot more scrutiny to their come it is a rational decision to go look at other market opportunities or to trade in the less regulated markets. And actually think that part of the increase in dark pool liquidity is coming from a change in demographics there as well because I don't think the high-frequency guys have left the U.S. market and early but they do think that we have shifted some of their volume from direct related to the less repetitive markets, which you have to say see rational decision on their part. So that's as much of informations we've got at the moment. Some of that is obviously speculative. And again as I said Rich or someone earlier about your question, I can have Larry and Joe do a little more work in that then if they have some different views, I'll encourage them to share with you guys. We'll take 1 more guys and everyone get back to work okay?"

Thanks for joining the call today. Just to preview it a bit to start out. Given that we did our Investor Day at the beginning of April, and then we just had the Annual Shareholder Meeting just a few days ago, I think since we've communicated so much recently, I think we can tell by the attendance on the call today, it's a little lighter than usual as well. We're going to keep our prepared remarks shorter than we normally do figuring there's not a lot of new news in here. We'll leave the usual time that we leave for questions and then our expectation would be we'd have everybody kind of back to work by about 8:45 or so. 
From our point of view, the story of the first quarter is what we've done already and what we're continuing to do to set the table for growth. So that when the challenging market conditions we now face revert to what we believe are more historical norms, we are positioned to not only capture the revenue that comes with that recovery, but to enhance our overall performance with new streams of revenues in a lower cost and reduced share count environment, which will magnify the operating leverage of the model.
We're doing this by executing our plans through Project 14 as we discussed at the Investor Day in early April. The actions we are taking with this comprehensive initiative will drive a step-up in the underlying earnings power of the company, which we believe will become evident in a more normal environment in 2013 and 2014.
So with that as a backdrop, let's turn to Slide 3. For the quarter, we recorded earnings per share of $0.47 per share, a net revenue of $601 million, down from $0.68 per share and $679 million in the prior-year period. Cost discipline, a hallmark of our team, continued in the quarter with cost down 3% year-over-year on a constant dollar and constant portfolio basis. We were #1 in listings globally for the fifth consecutive quarter, and our share of technology IPOs in the U.S. year-to-date is approximately 60%.
In summary, we knew and expected this would be a challenging quarter for us given the difficult environment. We are seeing modest improvement in economic indicators around the world, which would generally bode well for our business. But unfortunately, we are still waiting for signs that trading volumes will return to the levels we have witnessed in 2010 and 2011.
Please turn to Slide 4. This is the slide that we've used in other meetings. I think at the Investor Day as well. And it tries to depict the various crosswinds in the economic environment and the macro environment in which we're operating our business. With a focus on what we can control and a solid execution of our strategy, we are optimistic that we can navigate through these in a way that will actually provide us with some opportunities.
First in terms of derivatives reform. We have always supported regulatory efforts that bring transparency and better risk management to markets. We support these efforts because it makes sense for our markets and will significantly reduce systemic risk. Both EMIR in Europe and Dodd-Frank here in the U.S. encourage derivatives to move toward a more centrally cleared environment, and we have been actively involved in the dialogue in both regions.
The overhang of these reforms, however, is causing some uncertainty for our clients with regard to their business models. And as a result, they continue to underinvest. As customers to look -- as customers look to reduce costs, however, we are well positioned to serve as a major provider of outsourced trading infrastructure. With capital becoming increasingly scarce, capitally efficient clearinghouses, like NYPC, are also poised to offer a lot of value. 
Next, we are operating in  a low volatility, low-growth environment, driven by the lingering effects of the financial crisis, which is keeping rates at or near 0. This type of environment dampens volumes and results in even greater internalization in the U.S. cash markets. On the flip side though, more stable markets mean companies are better able to raise capital in the public markets, which is good for our listings business. It also highlights the benefits of a diversified revenue model.
Uncertainty continues to also persist around the euro, and that is naturally taking a toll on investment and growth in Europe. However, the silver lining here is that spikes in volatility drive volume and the evolving landscape may also present new product opportunities for us in cash and derivatives. If April has any indication, volumes have already picked up the first -- into the first half of April and throughout the month.
Lastly, while the low interest rate environment is conducive to balance sheet repair, our European derivatives business, which is focused on the short end of the yield curve is at a cyclical low, and market participants see more opportunities to trade other interest rate underliers. That said, our derivatives trading volumes in Europe are holding up reasonably well and when the prospects for rate changes emerge, we should return to a more normal growth trajectory.
Please turn to Slide 5. On Slide 5, we highlighted a number of the growth initiatives that we are in the process of executing. This is a chart we showed at Investor Day. During the quarter, we provided you with our approach to building out clearing, announced Project Trinity and launched the new initiative in rates for our European derivatives business. I'm not going to go through each of the them as the team went through these a few weeks ago in a lot of detail, but we will be continuing to update you on these initiatives in earnings calls in the future.
I would, however, like to comment on our technology services business. While we continue to see our technology business as a growth driver, we have experienced some dampening of demand recently. The spending growth rate in the technology sector has slowed more than we anticipated, which has resulted in lower technology sales in the first quarter. This is partly due to geoeconomic factors, but also uncertainty over the future regulatory landscape.
Our clients are demanding that major initiatives, which they undertake, show payback in 12 to 18 months and cost no more than their current operating and capital expenses to implement. In other words, no running costs. Financial engineering is becoming a major part of deal structures now.
Decision making for many of our clients and prospects has also become more complex, and as a result, takes more time. And when you do get close to a deal, there's a lot more parties involved in signing off. New initiatives have slowed, and our customers are focused on cutting costs from existing infrastructure, such as reducing the number of vendors and cutting costs from existing vendor spend, and we are seeing this in the reduction in unused cabinet inventory in both our Basildon and Mahwah data centers.
The silver lining we hoped to all of this is that these issues support a managed service model that we have created with our business over the last 12 to 18 months. We have hit a temporary air pocket, which we will have to work through, but we are confident that we will return to double-digit growth in revenue once the environment stabilizes.
Why are we confident? We have several key deals in the hopper, and we are seeing some nice developments as a result of our acquisition of a 25% stake in Fixnetix, where we are building a joint product pipeline. Other recent deals include a hosted matching engine for our global investment bank, a recently announced partnership with the Americas Trading Group to provide access to South American markets and our agreement with the Hong Kong exchanges and clearing to improve our customers' market data experience by delivering market data for all securities and derivatives traded by Hong Kong in a common message format.
Please turn to Slide 6. On Slide 6, we highlight the progress that we have been making in technology IPOs over the last few years and the strong pipeline for deals already on file with NYSE language. One of the areas on which we have been focused and has been a growth driver for us on the new listings front is emerging growth companies in the technology arena. In the early 2000s, we had less than a 10% market share of the technology space. In 2008, we had about 20%, and we have since grown our market share to approximately 60% year-to-date in 2012, which includes success more recently with companies like Yelp, LinkedIn, Pandora and Millennial Media.
There is also currently a strong pipeline with 118 IPOs on file with NYSE language, adding up to roughly $20 billion in proceeds, which includes the likes of Avaya, Service Now, Silver Spring Networks and MobiTV.
While we have seen European market concerns creep back into the market, we still believe that the IPO window is opened, and we will see more companies come to market in both the U.S. and Europe.
Lastly for me before I turn it over to Mike, please turn to Slide 7. Consider this the first of many updates to come on what we call Project 14. We're purposely calling this project, Project 14, because it is not about this quarter or even this year. It is about the time between now and 2014. Our goal is to spent this year, next year and the year after executing against 3 pillars: targeted growth, cost efficiency and strategic deployment of capital. So that by the end of 2014, we are in an even better position to compete and win in our core businesses.
Larry and Mike will be spearheading the cost-efficiency part of this project, and we will be as transparent as we're able to allow you to track our progress, so nobody will have to guess how far along we are in this program. We are going to be focused on a series of short, medium and long-term actions around our technology platforms, streamlining our organization and optimizing how we do business. We will divest underperforming assets, and we will build out clearing, both of which we believe will provide us with incremental revenue that Mike will discuss in more detail, but will also allow us to reduce cost.
So in the 4 weeks since we first announced the program, how are we doing? On the growth side of the ledger, we have lots of initiatives that are in progress, which we will believe -- which we believe will yield return on our investment regardless of how the market environment evolves. Our focus is not only on executing these initiatives shown in the growth bucket, but also seeking additional opportunity to create value.
On the efficiency front, our costs are down and following our closure of SecFinex, we finalized the unwind of NYSE Blue. This is not meant to be a verdict on the environmental space, just simply a recognition that this market will take much longer to develop than we or our shareholders are willing to wait.
On the capital front, I think we can check a couple of boxes, and it is nice to see that several of our peers are taking a page from our playbook by adding to their buybacks or establishing or increasing their dividends. Lastly, we bought back $125 million of stock in the quarter. Our CapEx was $43 million in line with our full year guidance of about $200 million, and we announced plans to reevaluate several more of our minority investments.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Mike for a review of our financial results."
189274,181982389,292804,"NYSE Euronext, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2012",2012-04-30,"Earnings Calls","NYSE Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Duncan, and good morning.

This quarter, there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.34 per share and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.47 per share. In the quarter,",1690,"Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 8 provides comparative GAAP results in the first quarter of 2012. This quarter, there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.34 per share and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.47 per share. 
In the quarter, we reported a $31 million charge for merger and exit expenses, which included $16 million related to final fees on the DB merger. Severance and exit costs were higher in the quarter as we launched our Project 14 efficiency effort. Our GAAP results also reflect the impact of several discrete tax items related to a favorable tax settlement with U.K. tax authorities, which was more than offset by a noncash expense related to changes from the legal entities in the U.S. Our review of our financial results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs and the discrete tax items.
Slide 9 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the quarter. As we saw this quarter, operating leverage cuts both ways, that is really the story for the quarter. Lower volatility in volumes in all our venues, but particularly European derivatives, coupled with a weaker euro have negatively impacted revenues versus Q1 2011 and last quarter.
Revenues of $601 million for the quarter were down 11% year-over-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter. Volumes were down an average of 17% year-over-year, and we're down an average of 7% from the traditionally slower fourth quarter period. While we continue to make headway in diversifying our business model, trading-related net revenues still makes up approximately 50% of our revenue base. And this revenue stream was down $88 million or 25% year-over-year. 
Revenue from other streams were up $10 million or 3% versus Q1 prior year. Our costs were lower, $10 million or 2% for the quarter, the effective tax rate was 25% for the quarter, down from 26% in the prior year. The decline in the effective tax rate year-over-year was due to the aforementioned tax changes in the U.K. and U.S. And our diluted share count was reduced 3 million shares to 259 million shares this quarter. The period end outstanding share count was 255 million. 
Slide 10 provides a consolidated and segment results on a currency neutral basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened this quarter versus prior year for both the euro and the British pound. For the first quarter, 45% of our net revenue was denominated in either euros or pounds and 55% in U.S. dollars. Currency impact on net revenue for the quarter was negative $9 million versus prior year and an unfavorable $5 million versus the previous quarter.  Foreign exchange contributed an unfavorable $4 million to operating income this quarter versus prior year. 
On a currency neutral basis, first quarter net revenues were down 10% and operating income decreased 24% versus the first quarter of 2011. Operationally, revenues for our Derivatives and Cash Trading and Listings increased 24% and 6%, respectively. Our Technology segment revenues were up an adjusted 6%.
Slides 11 and 12 detail the financial performance for our Derivatives segment. Derivatives accounted for 29% of our consolidated net revenues and 35% of our operating income in the first quarter due to the decrease of $60 million in net revenues year-over-year principally driven by lower European derivatives trading volume. Volumes are weakest in the rates area, while equity, future and option volumes were also impacted on the underlying reduction in equity trading. 
Open interest has moved higher from year end 2011 levels, but is 17% lower than Q1 2011. We are at cyclical lows for this business, which is geared to the short end of the yield curve, but we are confident that when expectations for rate increases escalate, we will return to a growth trajectory for this business.
Revenue capture for the quarter was lower for NYSE Liffe versus both Q4 and prior-year first quarter. Decline year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was principally due to a shift in volume mix. Specifically, lower volumes and higher capture, short-term interest rate products, as well as modified pricing for the trading of individual equity options and index futures and options on the NYSE Liffe Amsterdam and Belgium.
Capture for the competitive U.S. options business was lower year-over-year, but stable on a linked-quarter basis. Higher percentage of dividend strategy trades over Arca, with feed caps was offset by a stronger capture on NYSE Amex Options.
NYSE Amex Options is on track for a record monthly market share in April of 16%. A clearing build is in full swing with a target date for fully in-sourcing Liffe Clear by Q3 2013. This is expected to save an annualized $30 million. Initially, moving continental clearing to Liffe Clear is targeted for Q1 2014. This move will enable us to realize approximately $40 million in annual revenues at traditional derivative clearinghouse margins.
Similarly, Slide 13 and 14 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading and Listings accounted for 51% of our consolidated net revenues and 53% of our operating income in the first quarter. Cash Trading and Listings net revenue was $304 million in the first quarter of 2012, down 7% versus the prior-year period and down 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. The decrease was principally due to lower volumes, driven by a lower consolidated tape and an increase in off-exchange trading in the U.S. 
European cash ADV of 1.6 million transactions decreased 12% from the first quarter of 2011 levels, but was in line with fourth quarter 2011. For April 2012, we have seen a dramatic improvement in European cash volumes, with ADV rising nearly 20% from Q1. In U.S. cash equities, volumes decreased 23% to 1.8 billion shares compared to prior year and decreased 16% from fourth quarter 2011 levels. April month to date U.S. cash trading volumes remain at depressed levels.
Non-exchange traded share or TRX share has increased several percentage points year-to-date March to approximately 34% of the U.S. cash trading due to lower volatility and has impacted our market share in the U.S. cash, which was down in Q1 both against fourth quarter 2011 and first quarter 2011 levels. Market share in Europe has stabilized for the last few quarters at 65% in our 4 European markets compared to 70% in the prior year. European share figures exclude off-exchange trading volume.
Revenue capture for the U.S. cash increased to $0.042 per 100 shares handled for Q1, well above the $0.037 recorded in the first quarter of 2011 and above the $0.039 in Q4. Revenue capture for European cash decreased to $0.57 from $0.67 in the first quarter of 2011 and were down slightly from the $0.58 in the fourth quarter of 2011. 14% decline in capture year-over-year was driven primarily by the overall decline in value traded in a weaker euro, partially offset by higher average basis points tape. 
Slide 15 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information and Technology Solutions accounted for 20% of our net revenue and 12% of our operating income in the first quarter of 2012. Information Services and Technology Solutions revenue was $121 million in the first quarter, an increase of $5 million or 4% from Q1 prior year. At constant exchange rates, revenues were up 6% on prior year.
Software sales, in particular, are traditionally weak in quarter 1 versus quarter 4, but in 2012, the economic environment accentuated this trend. While the Q1 results are below our expectations for this business, they reflect a very challenging environment for financial technology spending in the industry. Clients are delaying technology decisions, reducing staff levels, which impact market data revenues, and the lower volatility in trading environment is impacting co-location in connectivity revenues. We expect this trend to continue, at least through, quarter 2. Medium term, we remain convinced that we can resume double-digit top line growth. We have a solid pipeline of managed service opportunities and new product offerings.
Slide 16 provides a reconciliation of our underlying cost base and details investment spending for the quarter. This format also provides a comparison to our full year cost guidance. This will enable investors to track our realization of the $250 million in annualized savings we committed to at the Investor Day as part of Project 14.
Current period expenses of $405 million are rebased to currency rates for our 2012 cost guidance, resulting in a rebased cost base in 2001 -- Q1 2012 of $409 million. Expenses totaled $8 million in the 3 growth initiatives during the quarter. This translates to our first quarter core expenses of $401 million. 
Our cost guidance for core expenses, it's a range between $1,580 million and $1,600 million, which represents a projected 25% of savings on the $250 million Project 14 goal. Using our traditional methodology in measuring expenses, year-over-year on a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis, costs were down $12 million or 3%. 
Looking to Q2, the April divestiture of NYSE Blue should save us $5 million in costs and $1 million in operating losses per quarter. Additionally, we expect to ramp up spending for our clearing and contract for differences initiatives.
Slide 17 details our cash and debt position as of March 31, 2012. Our cash and debt positions were similar to Q4 2011, with gross debt at $2.1 billion. This despite a first quarter where we paid annual bonuses, repurchased $125 million of stock and dispersed accumulated Section 31 fees. Although debt levels were constant, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio increased to 2x reflecting a weak Q1 for EBITDA.
Capital expenditures were $43 million in the quarter, compared to $35 million in the prior year quarter. First half of the year is our strongest period for free cash flow generation as result of billings for annual listing fees. We executed $125 million in stock repurchases in the first quarter, repurchasing 4.3 million shares at an average price of $29.73. Last week, the board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the second quarter of 2012, which is payable on June 29. 
Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Duncan for closing remarks."

As we said at our Investor Day, we believe there's further value that can be unlocked by having these businesses under 1 umbrella. We are focusing on unlocking that potential, which is what Project 14 is all about.
We're focusing on the leverage within our control to execute against our community strategy and drive the step-up in our underlying earnings per share growth between now and 2014. This will be accomplished, as we said a few times today, through a mix of targeted revenue-generating initiatives, accelerated cost-efficiency efforts and strategic capital deployment.
With that, we'll open the line for your questions, and thanks for listening."

They're being asked to do that in a macro environment that is impacting them as much as it's impacting us as you can see from some of the results that the integrated investment banks have been publishing. So I don't think -- we are certainly not meeting internally at this point to worry about whether this quarter, after 3 years of a pretty consistent growth, is suddenly the beginning of a new trend. I think if this persisted throughout this year, we would have to rethink kind of where we are on that. But we continue to believe there's good bolt-on acquisition opportunities, and there's good organic growth opportunities in that business. And I will say what I've said before, I think that will largely -- the success in that arena will largely define the longer-term success of this company as I think that's where we and others in the industry are going to have to head."

But if you look at what we've done with NYPC and things like that where our contribution when we started that, remember, we had to fund the guarantee fund there as well. And the issues there are that was $25 million to $50 million funding. Remember that in our Liffe Clear business, we are doing most of the clearing already. We insourced everything but the Treasury and risk management functions. So of course, we will continue to stay focused on that. We'll seed it with whatever's required. We're undertaking the discussions with the FSA now to talk about what they want that to look like. But we don't think that's going to be a huge hit to capital, if indications to date are any barometer. We also continue to think that although our credit rating is obviously well above investment grade, well into investment-grade territory, I continue to believe, as I've mentioned to some of you before, that looking at the credit rating of the parent company of any clearinghouse, I believe is a strange way of thinking about it. If you really get down to it, when the exchanges guarantee fund would be tapped is so far down the risk waterfall that I continue to say, and I can't say that anybody's listening, but I'm going to continue to say it anyway, that the right way to think about the credit exposure in any clearinghouse is really a weighted average of all the clearinghouses' participants. I think that's much more important. And I think we're much more focused with the regulators that we're talking to about the real-time risk controls in the clearinghouse and how to manage all of that. I think that's much more important than a, the credit rating of the topco; and b, whether we put in $25 million, $50 million or $100 million in the guarantee fund, those are interesting facts, but not terribly relevant as compared to the other stuff. So I'll do some more homework into that with my derivatives specialist and if the answer they give me is quite different than what I just shared, we'll make sure we circulate something on that."

But I'll start by saying this: I think we're not going to pat ourselves on the back. I mean everyone can see the market share trends, right? And as I said it in my remarks and as I've said to some of you, in a low volatility, low-volume environment, it lends itself more to internalization. And it's not obvious to us why, if volatility and volume stay here, why the dark pool of percentage of the market isn't going to stabilize or even increase potentially higher. Now, our view may be relative to some of our competitors is it's fairly simple calculus. You either chase revenue capture and profitability or you chase market share. Obviously in this macro environment, it's difficult to do both. I think some of our competitors have chosen that they believe the optics of market share are better. I think we continue to believe that the market's pretty fragmented. I'm not sure getting a couple of market share points is going to convince anybody that we have a better business model. I think the revenue capture is more important, because our view is, if you return to a more normal volume in volatility environment, we know that volatility is highly correlated with our market share. And I think we've been a little more focused on revenue capture in reasonable ways, where as the clients are fully aware of and I think we do that rather than chase market share. Is that -- Mike, anything you want to add to that and then we can have Larry follow-up to?"

Here's what I think is going on. So let's just have it all pretty clear. So we already partnered with DTC and NYPC. And I think that we were hopeful that 1 future arena that the NYSE DTC partnership at NYPC could explore was having already coupled euro-dollar futures and the cash bonds to kind of create a more capitally efficient clearinghouse, I think the next obvious leg to that stool will be to try to figure out a way to get into interest rate swaps. It's no secret to anybody on this call that LCH is SwapClear subsidiary, which is more or less governed by the important banks, who are the liquidity providers in the swaps market, has been looking for a partner on U.S. soil for that for quite some time. And it's also no secret that they are the dominant force in the interest rate swap business. So our view was -- and we've announced that with Project Trinity, which we referenced at the Investor Day. The idea is LCH picks up basically the license by buying IDCG from NASDAQ. I don't view that as a partnering strategy, I'd view that as them buying the license to actually partner with us and DTC, so now we can bring that third leg of the stool into NYPC over time. So that's what Project Trinity is all about. At the same time on the other side of the pond, LSE is going to acquire a majority share of LCH assuming that deal gets approved some time this year or next year. The timing on them getting approval will more or less coincide with us finishing will more or less coincide with us finishing the vertical integration of our own clearinghouse. So remember, we insourced, as I said earlier, all with the treasury and risk management functions. That's what we are working on, that's consistent with the press release that we put out a few months ago about our timetable on all of that. So roughly this time next year, maybe a little later, we will be completing that migration into the clearinghouse. So we will have our own clearinghouse, LSE will own a majority of LCH, and we in LCH and DTC will hopefully by then, be partnering on that three-legged stool I referenced earlier, so that we'll be able to clear interest rate futures, the cash underliers, as well as interest rate swaps. And I think that will be an unprecedented cross-margining opportunity as well. So hopefully that addresses most of what you were asking about."

In a couple of previous years, we had some offsetting good guys in the first quarter that made the first quarter results, maybe looked more robust. The principle reason why moving sequentially from the fourth quarter, first quarter is lower software, which would happen in almost in a year. I think when we talked on top of that is with the lower volumes, one of the other revenue boost we've been getting is people purchasing more cabinets, more safety connectivity, et cetera. And clearly in the lower volume environment, we didn't say there were a lot of cancellations, what we are saying is there is some excess capacity. And clearly, we're not getting incremental sales when -- in this sort of volume environment. So it's really those 2 things. But I think again, we have a pretty robust fourth quarter for software sales. And the first quarter always is weaker, this particular quarter was even a little weaker than normal because of some of the things that I mentioned earlier."

And you try to have as much insight as into it as you can, given the fact that we don't have all the information. I do think that the confluence of factors, including lower volatility, lower volumes, the high-frequency community diversifying into other asset classes and geographies not being as reliant on the U.S. And frankly, as we've articulated, I think, publicly a couple of times, the regulatory -- the potential for more regulatory scrutiny and in the interim, a lot of politics if I can use that word around this subject, some of the high-frequency folks we talk to are simply saying, ""Look, if there's going to be that much focus on it, when the majority of what we do is liquidity provision, I think whether it's an unintended consequence or not, some of the rhetoric from the regulators and politicians may be leading the high-frequency community to think about a lot of other alternatives and maybe, in fact, accelerating their move to either a, other asset classes and geographies, or B, some of the more likely regulated liquidity pools, right? I mean, if you and I were high-frequency folks and every day, we're reading headlines in the paper, informed or uninformed, that say, we're going to be bringing a lot more scrutiny to bear. It is a rational decision to go look at other market opportunities or to trade in the less regulated markets. And I actually think that part of the increase in dark pool liquidity is coming from a change in demographics there as well because I don't think the high-frequency guys have left the U.S. market entirely. But I do think they have shifted some of their volume from the regulated to the less regulated markets, which you have to say is a rational decision on their part. So that's as much of information as we've got at the moment. Some of that is obviously speculative.

Thanks for joining the call today. Just to preview it a bit to start out. Given that we did our Investor Day at the beginning of April, and then we just had the Annual Shareholder Meeting just a few days ago, I think since we've communicated so much recently, I think we can tell by the attendance on the call today, it's a little lighter than usual as well. We're going to keep our prepared remarks shorter than we normally do, figuring there's not a lot of new news in here. We'll leave the usual time that we leave for questions and then our expectation would be we'd have everybody kind of back to work by about 8:45 or so. 
From our point of view, the story of the first quarter is what we've done already and what we're continuing to do to set the table for growth. So that when the challenging market conditions we now face revert to what we believe are more historical norms, we are positioned to not only capture the revenue that comes with that recovery, but to enhance our overall performance with new streams of revenues in a lower cost and reduced share count environment, which will magnify the operating leverage of the model.
We're doing this by executing our plans through Project 14 as we discussed at the Investor Day in early April. The actions that we are taking with this comprehensive initiative will drive a step-up in the underlying earnings power of the company, which we believe will become evident in a more normal environment in 2013 and 2014.
So with that as a backdrop, let's turn to Slide 3. For the quarter, we recorded earnings per share of $0.47 per share on net revenue of $601 million, down from $0.68 per share on $679 million in the prior-year period. Cost discipline, a hallmark of our team, continued in the quarter with cost down 3% year-over-year on a constant dollar and constant portfolio basis. We were #1 in listings globally for the fifth consecutive quarter, and our share of technology IPOs in the U.S. year-to-date is approximately 60%.
In summary, we knew and expected this would be a challenging quarter for us given the difficult environment. We are seeing modest improvement in economic indicators around the world, which would generally bode well for our business. But unfortunately, we are still waiting for signs that trading volumes will return to the levels we have witnessed in 2010 and 2011.
Please turn to Slide 4. This is a slide that we've used in other meetings; I think at the Investor Day as well. And it tries to depict the various crosswinds in the economic environment and the macro environment in which we're operating our business. With a focus on what we can control and a solid execution of our strategy, we are optimistic that we can navigate through these in a way that will actually provide us with some opportunities.
First in terms of derivatives reform. We have always supported regulatory efforts that bring transparency and better risk management to markets. We support these efforts because it makes sense for our markets and will significantly reduce systemic risk. Both EMIR in Europe and Dodd-Frank here in the U.S. encourage derivatives to move toward a more centrally cleared environment, and we have been actively involved in the dialogue in both regions.
The overhang of these reforms, however, is causing some uncertainty for our clients with regard to their business models. And as a result, they continue to underinvest. As customers to look -- as customers look to reduce costs, however, we are well positioned to serve as a major provider of outsourced trading infrastructure. With capital becoming increasingly scarce, capitally efficient clearinghouses, like NYPC, are also poised to offer a lot of value. 
Next, we are operating in a low volatility, low-growth environment, driven by the lingering effects of the financial crisis, which is keeping rates at or near 0. This type of environment dampens volumes and results in even greater internalization in the U.S. cash markets. On the flip side though, more stable markets mean companies are better able to raise capital in the public markets, which is good for our listings business. It also highlights the benefits of a diversified revenue model.
Uncertainty continues to also persist around the euro, and that is naturally taking a toll on investment and growth in Europe. However, the silver lining here is that spikes in volatility drive volume and the evolving landscape may also present new product opportunities for us in cash and derivatives. If April is any indication, volumes have already picked up the first -- in the first half of April and throughout the month.
Lastly, while the low interest rate environment is conducive to balance sheet repair, our European derivatives business, which is focused on the short end of the yield curve is at a cyclical low, and market participants see more opportunities to trade other interest rate underliers. That said, our derivatives trading volumes in Europe are holding up reasonably well and when the prospects for rate changes emerge, we should return to a more normal growth trajectory.
Please turn to Slide 5. On Slide 5, we highlight a number of the growth initiatives that we are in the process of executing. This is a chart we showed at Investor Day. During the quarter, we provided you with our approach to building out clearing, announced Project Trinity and launched the new initiative in rates for our European derivatives business. I'm not going to go through each of the them as the team went through these a few weeks ago in a lot of detail, but we will be continuing to update you on these initiatives in earnings calls in the future.
I would, however, like to comment on our technology services business. While we continue to see our technology business as a growth driver, we have experienced some dampening of demand recently. The spending growth rate in the technology sector has slowed more than we anticipated, which has resulted in lower technology sales in the first quarter. This is partly due to geoeconomic factors, but also uncertainty over the future regulatory landscape.
Our clients are demanding that major initiatives which they undertake show payback in 12 to 18 months and cost no more than their current operating and capital expenses to implement. In other words, no running costs. Financial engineering is becoming a major part of deal structures now.
Decision making for many of our clients and prospects has also become more complex, and as a result, takes more time. And when you do get close to a deal, there's a lot more parties involved in signing off. New initiatives have slowed, and our customers are focused on cutting costs from existing infrastructure, such as reducing the number of vendors and cutting costs from existing vendor spend, and we are seeing this in the reduction in unused cabinet inventory in both our Basildon and Mahwah data centers.
The silver lining, we hope, to all of this is that these issues support a managed service model that we have created with our business over the last 12 to 18 months. We have hit a temporary air pocket, which we will have to work through, but we are confident that we will return to double-digit growth in revenue once the environment stabilizes.
Why are we confident? We have several key deals in the hopper, and we are seeing some nice developments as a result of our acquisition of a 25% stake in Fixnetix, where we are building a joint product pipeline. Other recent deals include a hosted matching engine for a global investment bank, a recently announced partnership with the Americas Trading Group to provide access to South American markets and our agreement with the Hong Kong exchanges and clearing to improve our customers' market data experience by delivering market data for all securities and derivatives traded by Hong Kong in a common message format.
Please turn to Slide 6. On Slide 6, we highlight the progress that we have been making in technology IPOs over the last few years and the strong pipeline for deals already on file with NYSE language. One of the areas on which we have been focused and has been a growth driver for us on the new listings front is emerging growth companies in the technology arena. In the early 2000s, we had less than a 10% market share of the technology space. In 2008, we had about 20%, and we have since grown our market share to approximately 60% year-to-date in 2012, which includes success more recently with companies like Yelp, LinkedIn, Pandora and Millennial Media.
There is also currently a strong pipeline with 118 IPOs on file with NYSE language, adding up to roughly $20 billion in proceeds, which includes the likes of Avaya, Service Now, Silver Spring Networks and MobiTV. While we have seen European market concerns creep back into the market, we still believe that the IPO window is open, and we will see more companies come to market in both the U.S. and Europe.
Lastly for me before I turn it over to Mike, please turn to Slide 7. Consider this the first of many updates to come on what we call Project 14. We're purposely calling this project, Project 14, because it is not about this quarter or even this year. It is about the time between now and 2014. Our goal is to spent this year, next year and the year after executing against 3 pillars: targeted growth, cost efficiency and strategic deployment of capital, so that by the end of 2014, we are in an even better position to compete and win in our core businesses.
Larry and Mike will be spearheading the cost-efficiency part of this project, and we will be as transparent as we're able to, to allow you to track our progress, so nobody will have to guess how far along we are in this program. We are going to be focused on a series of short, medium and long-term actions around our technology platforms, streamlining our organization and optimizing how we do business. We will divest underperforming assets, and we will build out clearing, both of which we believe will provide us with incremental revenue that Mike will discuss in more detail, but will also allow us to reduce cost.
So in the 4 weeks since we first announced the program, how are we doing? On the growth side of the ledger, we have lots of initiatives that are in progress, which we will believe -- which we believe will yield return on our investment regardless of how the market environment evolves. Our focus is not only on executing these initiatives shown in the growth bucket, but also seeking additional opportunity to create value.
On the efficiency front, our costs are down and following our closure of SecFinex, we finalized the unwind of NYSE Blue. This is not meant to be a verdict on the environmental space, just simply a recognition that this market will take much longer to develop than we or our shareholders are willing to wait.
On the capital front, I think we can check a couple of boxes, and it is nice to see that several of our peers are taking a page from our playbook by adding to their buybacks or establishing or increasing their dividends. Lastly, we bought back $125 million of stock in the quarter. Our CapEx was $43 million, in line with our full year guidance of about $200 million, and we announced plans to reevaluate several more of our minority investments.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Mike for a review of our financial results."
189274,181982389,292872,"NYSE Euronext, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2012",2012-04-30,"Earnings Calls","NYSE Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 8 provides comparative GAAP results in the first quarter of 2012. This quarter, there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.34 per share and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.47 per share. In the quarter,",1687,"Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 8 provides comparative GAAP results in the first quarter of 2012. This quarter, there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.34 per share and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.47 per share. 
In the quarter, we reported a $31 million charge for merger and exit expenses, which included $16 million related to final fees on the DB merger. Severance and exit costs were higher in the quarter as we launched our Project 14 efficiency effort. Our GAAP results also reflect the impact of several discrete tax items related to a favorable tax settlement with U.K. tax authorities, which was more than offset by a noncash expense related to changes from the legal entities in the U.S. Our review of our financial results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs and the discrete tax items.
Slide 9 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the quarter. As we saw this quarter, operating leverage cuts both ways, and that is really the story for the quarter. Lower volatility in volumes in all our venues, but particularly European derivatives, coupled with a weaker euro have negatively impacted revenues versus Q1 2011 and last quarter.
Revenues of $601 million for the quarter were down 11% year-over-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter. Volumes were down an average of 17% year-over-year, and were down an average of 7% from the traditionally slower fourth quarter period. While we continue to make headway in diversifying our business model, trading-related net revenue still makes up approximately 50% of our revenue base. And this revenue stream was down $88 million or 25% year-over-year. 
Revenue from other streams were up $10 million or 3% versus Q1 prior year. Our costs were lower $10 million or 2% for the quarter, the effective tax rate was 25% for the quarter, down from 26% in the prior year. The decline in the effective tax rate year-over-year was due to the aforementioned tax changes in the U.K. and U.S. And our diluted share count was reduced 3 million shares to 259 million shares this quarter. The period-end outstanding share count was 255 million. 
Slide 10 provides the consolidated and segment results on a currency neutral basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened this quarter versus prior year for both the euro and the British pound. For the first quarter, 45% of our net revenue was denominated in either euros or pounds and 55% in U.S. dollars. Currency impact on net revenue for the quarter was negative $9 million versus prior year and an unfavorable $5 million versus the previous quarter.  Foreign exchange contributed an unfavorable $4 million to operating income this quarter versus prior year. 
On a currency neutral basis, first quarter net revenues were down 10% and operating income decreased 24% versus the first quarter of 2011. Operationally, revenues for our Derivatives and Cash Trading and Listings increased 24% and 6%, respectively. Our Technology segment revenues were up an adjusted 6%.
Slides 11 and 12 detail the financial performance for our Derivatives segment. Derivatives accounted for 29% of our consolidated net revenues and 35% of our operating income in the first quarter due to the decrease of $60 million in net revenues year-over-year principally driven by lower European derivatives trading volume. Volumes are weakest in the rates area, while equity, future and option volumes were also impacted by the underlying reduction in equity trading. 
Open interest has moved higher from year end 2011 levels, but is 17% lower than Q1 2011. We are at cyclical lows for this business, which is geared to the short end of the yield curve, but we are confident that when expectations for rate increases escalate, we will return to a growth trajectory for this business.
Revenue capture for the quarter was lower for NYSE Liffe versus both Q4 and prior-year first quarter. Decline year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was principally due to a shift in volume mix. Specifically, lower volumes and higher capture, short-term interest rate products, as well as modified pricing for the trading of individual equity options and index futures and options on the NYSE Liffe Amsterdam and Belgium.
Capture for the competitive U.S. options business was lower year-over-year, but stable on a linked-quarter basis. Higher percentage of dividend strategy trades over Arca, with fee caps was offset by a stronger capture on NYSE Amex Options.
NYSE Amex Options is on track for a record monthly market share in April of 16%. A clearing build is in full swing with a target date for fully in-sourcing Liffe Clear by Q3 2013. This is expected to save an annualized $30 million. Additionally, moving continental clearing to Liffe Clear is targeted for Q1 2014. This move will enable us to realize approximately $40 million in annual revenues at traditional derivative clearinghouse margins.
Similarly, Slide 13 and 14 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading and Listings accounted for 51% of our consolidated net revenues and 53% of our operating income in the first quarter. Cash Trading and Listings net revenue was $304 million in the first quarter of 2012, down 7% versus the prior-year period and down 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. The decrease was principally due to lower volumes, driven by a lower consolidated tape and an increase in off-exchange trading in the U.S. 
European cash ADV of 1.6 million transactions decreased 12% from the first quarter 2011 levels, but was in line with fourth quarter 2011. For April 2012, we have seen a dramatic improvement in European cash volumes, with ADV rising nearly 20% from Q1. In U.S. cash equities, volumes decreased 23% to 1.8 billion shares compared to prior year and decreased 16% from fourth quarter 2011 levels. April month-to-date U.S. cash trading volumes remain at depressed levels.
Non-exchange traded share or TRX share has increased several percentage points year-to-date March to approximately 34% of the U.S. cash trading due to lower volatility and has impacted our market share in the U.S. cash, which was down in Q1 both against fourth quarter 2011 and first quarter 2011 levels. Market share in Europe has stabilized for the last few quarters at 65% in our 4 European markets compared to 70% in the prior year. European share figures exclude off-exchange trading volume.
Revenue capture for the U.S. cash increased to $0.042 per 100 shares handled for Q1, well above the $0.037 recorded in the first quarter of 2011 and above the $0.039 in Q4. Revenue capture for European cash decreased to $0.57 from $0.67 in the first quarter of 2011 and was down slightly from the $0.58 in the fourth quarter of 2011. 14% decline in capture year-over-year was driven primarily by the overall decline in value traded and a weaker euro, partially offset by higher average basis point stake. 
Slide 15 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information and Technology Solutions accounted for 20% of our net revenue and 12% of our operating income in the first quarter of 2012. Information Service and Technology Solutions revenue was $121 million in the first quarter, an increase of $5 million or 4% from Q1 prior year. At constant exchange rates, revenues were up 6% on prior year.
Software sales, in particular, are traditionally weak in quarter 1 versus quarter 4, but in 2012, the economic environment accentuated this trend. While the Q1 results are below our expectations for this business, they reflect a very challenging environment for financial technology spending in the industry. Clients are delaying technology decisions, reducing staff levels, which impacts market data revenues, and the lower volatility and trading environment is impacting co-location and connectivity revenues. We expect this trend to continue, at least through quarter 2. Medium term, we remain convinced that we can resume double-digit top line growth. We have a solid pipeline of managed service opportunities and new product offerings.
Slide 16 provides a reconciliation of our underlying cost base and details investment spending for the quarter. This format also provides a comparison to our full year cost guidance. This will enable investors to track our realization of the $250 million in annualized savings we committed to at the Investor Day as part of Project 14.
Current period expenses of $405 million are rebased to currency fee rates for our 2012 cost guidance, resulting in a rebased cost base in 2001 -- Q1 2012 of $409 million. Expenses totaled $8 million in the 3 growth initiatives during the quarter. This translates to our first quarter core expenses of $401 million. 
Our cost guidance for core expenses is a range between $1,580 million and $1,600 million; this represents a projected 25% savings on the $250 million Project 14 goal. Using our traditional methodology of measuring expenses, year-over-year on a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis, costs were down $12 million or 3%. 
Looking to Q2, the April divestiture of NYSE Blue should save us $5 million in costs and $1 million in operating losses per quarter. Additionally, we expect to ramp up spending for our clearing and contract for differences initiatives.
Slide 17 details our cash and debt position as of March 31, 2012. Our cash and debt positions were similar to Q4 2011, with gross debt at $2.1 billion. This despite a first quarter where we paid annual bonuses, repurchased $125 million of stock and dispersed accumulated Section 31 fees. Although debt levels were constant, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio increased to 2x reflecting a weak Q1 for EBITDA.
Capital expenditures were $43 million in the quarter, compared to $35 million in the prior year quarter. First half of the year is our strongest period for free cash flow generation as result of billings for annual listing fees. We executed $125 million in stock repurchases in the first quarter, repurchasing 4.3 million shares at an average price of $29.73. Last week, the board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the second quarter of 2012, which is payable on June 29. 
Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Duncan for closing remarks."

I think if this persisted throughout this year, we would have to rethink kind of where we are on that.

We insource everything but the Treasury and risk management functions. So of course, we will continue to stay focused on that. We'll seed it with whatever's required. We're undertaking the discussions with the FSA now to talk about what they want that to look like. But we don't think that's going to be a huge hit to capital, if indications to date are any barometer. We also continue to think that although our credit rating is obviously well above investment grade, well into investment-grade territory, I continue to believe, as I've mentioned to some of you before, that looking at the credit rating of the parent company of any clearinghouse, I believe is a strange way of thinking about it. If you really get down to it, when the exchanges guarantee fund would be tapped is so far down the risk waterfall that I continue to say, and I can't say that anybody's listening, but I'm going to continue to say it anyway, that the right way to think about the credit exposure in any clearinghouse is really a weighted average of all the clearinghouse's participants. I think that's much more important. And I think we're much more focused with the regulators that we're talking to about the real-time risk controls in the clearinghouse and how to manage all of that. I think that's much more important than a, the credit rating of the topco; and b, whether we put in $25 million, $50 million or $100 million in a guarantee fund, those are interesting facts, but not terribly relevant as compared to the other stuff.

But could you explain a little bit more what was going on with your revenue capture going up versus the peer going down, and actually, your revenue declined less than your peer as well?"

And then if Larry's got more details or Joe does, we'll ask them to follow-up with you and others on this. And Mike may have something to add as well. But I'll start by saying this: I think we're not going to pat ourselves on the back. I mean everyone can see the market share trends, right? And as I said it in my remarks and as have said to some of you, in a low volatility, low-volume environment, it lends itself more to internalization. And it's not obvious to us why, if volatility and volume stay here, why the dark pool percentage of the market isn't going to stabilize or even increase potentially higher. Now, our view may be relative to some of our competitors is it's fairly simple calculus. You either chase revenue capture and profitability or you chase market share. Obviously in this macro environment, it's difficult to do both. I think some of our competitors have chosen that they believe the optics of market share are better. I think we continue to believe that the market's pretty fragmented. I'm not sure getting a couple of market share points is going to convince anybody that we have a better business model. I think the revenue capture is more important, because our view is, if you return to a more normal volume in volatility environment, we know that volatility is highly correlated with our market share. And I think we've been a little more focused on revenue capture in reasonable ways, where -- which the clients are fully aware of and I think we do that rather than chase market share. Is that -- Mike, anything you want to add to that and then we can have Larry follow up too?"

Here's what I think is going on. So let's just have it all pretty clear. So we already partnered with DTC and NYPC. And I think we were hopeful that the 1 future arena that the NYSE DTC partnership at NYPC could explore was having already coupled euro-dollar futures and the cash bonds to kind of create a more capitally efficient clearinghouse, I think the next obvious leg to that stool will be to try to figure out a way to get into interest rate swaps. It's no secret to anybody on this call that LCH's SwapClear subsidiary, which is more or less governed by the important banks, who are the liquidity providers in the swaps market, has been looking for a partner on U.S. soil for that for quite some time. And it's also no secret that they are the dominant force in the interest rate swap business. So our view was -- and we've announced that with Project Trinity, which we referenced at the Investor Day. The idea is LCH picks up basically the license by buying IDCG from NASDAQ. I don't view that as a partnering strategy, I view that as them buying the license to actually partner with us and DTC, so now we can bring that third leg of the stool into NYPC over time. So that's what Project Trinity is all about. At the same time on the other side of the pond, LSE is going to acquire a majority share of LCH assuming that deal gets approved sometime this year or next year. The timing on them getting approval will more or less coincide with us finishing the vertical integration of our own clearinghouse. So remember, we insourced, as I said earlier, all but the treasury and risk management functions. That's what we are working on, that's consistent with the press release that we put out a few months ago about our timetable on all that. So roughly this time next year, maybe a little later, we will be completing that migration into the clearinghouse. So we will have our own clearinghouse, LSE will own a majority of LCH, and we and LCH and DTC will hopefully by then, be partnering on that 3-legged stool I referenced earlier, so that we'll be able to clear interest rate futures, the cash underliers, as well as interest rate swaps. And I think that will be an unprecedented cross-margining opportunity as well. So hopefully that addresses most of what you were asking about."

Now in a couple previous years, we had some offsetting good guys in the first quarter that made the first quarter results, maybe look more robust. The principle reason why moving sequentially from the fourth quarter, first quarter is lower software, which would happen in almost in a year. I think what we talked on top of that is with the lower volumes, one of the other revenue boosts we've been getting is people purchasing more cabinets, more safety connectivity, et cetera. And clearly in the lower volume environment, we didn't say there were a lot of cancellations, what we were saying is there is some excess capacity. And clearly, we're not getting incremental sales when -- in this sort of volume environment. So it's really those 2 things. But I think again, we had a pretty robust fourth quarter for software sales.

I do think that the confluence of factors, including lower volatility, lower volumes, the high-frequency community diversifying into other asset classes and geographies not being as reliant on the U.S. And frankly, as we've articulated, I think publicly, a couple of times, the regulatory -- the potential for more regulatory scrutiny and in the interim, a lot of politics, if I can use that word, around this subject, some of the high-frequency folks we talk to are simply saying, ""Look, if there's going to be that much focus on it, when the majority of what we do is liquidity provision, I think whether it's an unintended consequence or not, some of the rhetoric from the regulators and politicians may be leading the high-frequency community to think about a lot of other alternatives and maybe, in fact, accelerating their move to either a, other asset classes and geographies, or b, some of the more lightly regulated liquidity pools, right? I mean, if you and I were high-frequency folks and every day, we're reading headlines in the paper, informed or uninformed, that say, we're going to be bringing a lot more scrutiny to bear. It is a rational decision to go look at other market opportunities or to trade in the less regulated markets. And I actually think that part of the increase in dark pool liquidity is coming from a change in demographics there as well because I don't think the high-frequency guys have left the U.S. market entirely. But I do think they've shifted some of their volume from the regulated to the less regulated markets, which you have to say is a rational decision on their part. So that's as much information as we've got at the moment. Some of that is obviously speculative.

Thanks for joining the call today. Just to preview it a bit to start out. Given that we did our Investor Day at the beginning of April, and then we just had the Annual Shareholder Meeting just a few days ago, I think since we've communicated so much recently, I think we can tell by the attendance on the call today, it's a little lighter than usual as well. We're going to keep our prepared remarks shorter than we normally do, figuring there's not a lot of new news in here. We'll leave the usual time that we leave for questions and then our expectation would be we'd have everybody kind of back to work by about 8:45 or so. 
From our point of view, the story of the first quarter is what we've done already and what we're continuing to do to set the table for growth. So that when the challenging market conditions we now face revert to what we believe are more historical norms, we are positioned to not only capture the revenue that comes with that recovery, but to enhance our overall performance with new streams of revenues in a lower cost and reduced share count environment, which will magnify the operating leverage of the model.
We're doing this by executing our plans through Project 14 as we discussed at the Investor Day in early April. The actions that we are taking with this comprehensive initiative will drive a step-up in the underlying earnings power of the company, which we believe will become evident in a more normal environment in 2013 and 2014.
So with that as a backdrop, let's turn to Slide 3. For the quarter, we recorded earnings per share of $0.47 per share on net revenue of $601 million, down from $0.68 per share on $679 million in the prior-year period. Cost discipline, a hallmark of our team, continued in the quarter with cost down 3% year-over-year on a constant dollar and constant portfolio basis. We were #1 in listings globally for the fifth consecutive quarter, and our share of technology IPOs in the U.S. year-to-date is approximately 60%.
In summary, we knew and expected this would be a challenging quarter for us given the difficult environment. We are seeing modest improvement in economic indicators around the world, which would generally bode well for our business. But unfortunately, we are still waiting for signs that trading volumes will return to the levels we have witnessed in 2010 and 2011.
Please turn to Slide 4. This is a slide that we've used in other meetings; I think at the Investor Day as well. And it tries to depict the various crosswinds in the economic environment and the macro environment in which we're operating our business. With a focus on what we can control and a solid execution of our strategy, we are optimistic that we can navigate through these in a way that will actually provide us with some opportunities.
First in terms of derivatives reform. We have always supported regulatory efforts that bring transparency and better risk management to markets. We support these efforts because it makes sense for our markets and will significantly reduce systemic risk. Both EMIR in Europe and Dodd-Frank here in the U.S. encourage derivatives to move toward a more centrally cleared environment, and we have been actively involved in the dialogue in both regions.
The overhang of these reforms, however, is causing some uncertainty for our clients with regard to their business models. And as a result, they continue to underinvest. As customers to look -- as customers look to reduce costs, however, we are well positioned to serve as a major provider of outsourced trading infrastructure. With capital becoming increasingly scarce, capitally efficient clearinghouses, like NYPC, are also poised to offer a lot of value. 
Next, we are operating in a low volatility, low-growth environment, driven by the lingering effects of the financial crisis, which is keeping rates at or near 0. This type of environment dampens volumes and results in even greater internalization in the U.S. cash markets. On the flip side though, more stable markets mean companies are better able to raise capital in the public markets, which is good for our listings business. It also highlights the benefits of a diversified revenue model.
Uncertainty continues to also persist around the euro, and that is naturally taking a toll on investment and growth in Europe. However, the silver lining here is that spikes in volatility drive volume and the evolving landscape may also present new product opportunities for us in cash and derivatives. If April is any indication, volumes have already picked up the first -- in the first half of April and throughout the month.
Lastly, while the low interest rate environment is conducive to balance sheet repair, our European derivatives business, which is focused on the short end of the yield curve is at a cyclical low, and market participants see more opportunities to trade other interest rate underliers. That said, our derivatives trading volumes in Europe are holding up reasonably well and when the prospects for rate changes emerge, we should return to a more normal growth trajectory.
Please turn to Slide 5. On Slide 5, we highlight a number of the growth initiatives that we are in the process of executing. This is a chart we showed at Investor Day. During the quarter, we provided you with our approach to building out clearing, announced Project Trinity and launched the new initiative in rates for our European derivatives business. I'm not going to go through each of the them as the team went through these a few weeks ago in a lot of detail, but we will be continuing to update you on these initiatives in earnings calls in the future.
I would, however, like to comment on our technology services business. While we continue to see our technology business as a growth driver, we have experienced some dampening of demand recently. The spending growth rate in the technology sector has slowed more than we anticipated, which has resulted in lower technology sales in the first quarter. This is partly due to geoeconomic factors, but also uncertainty over the future regulatory landscape.
Our clients are demanding that major initiatives which they undertake show payback in 12 to 18 months and cost no more than their current operating and capital expenses to implement. In other words, no running costs. Financial engineering is becoming a major part of deal structures now.
Decision making for many of our clients and prospects has also become more complex, and as a result, takes more time. And when you do get close to a deal, there's a lot more parties involved in signing off. New initiatives have slowed, and our customers are focused on cutting costs from existing infrastructure, such as reducing the number of vendors and cutting costs from existing vendor spend, and we are seeing this in the reduction in unused cabinet inventory in both our Basildon and Mahwah data centers.
The silver lining, we hope, to all of this is that these issues support a managed service model that we have created with our business over the last 12 to 18 months. We have hit a temporary air pocket, which we will have to work through, but we are confident that we will return to double-digit growth in revenue once the environment stabilizes.
Why are we confident? We have several key deals in the hopper, and we are seeing some nice developments as a result of our acquisition of a 25% stake in Fixnetix, where we are building a joint product pipeline. Other recent deals include a hosted matching engine for a global investment bank, a recently announced partnership with the Americas Trading Group to provide access to South American markets and our agreement with the Hong Kong exchanges and clearing to improve our customers' market data experience by delivering market data for all securities and derivatives traded by Hong Kong in a common message format.
Please turn to Slide 6. On Slide 6, we highlight the progress that we have been making in technology IPOs over the last few years and the strong pipeline for deals already on file with NYSE language. One of the areas on which we have been focused and has been a growth driver for us on the new listings front is emerging growth companies in the technology arena. In the early 2000s, we had less than a 10% market share of the technology space. In 2008, we had about 20%, and we have since grown our market share to approximately 60% year-to-date in 2012, which includes success more recently with companies like Yelp, LinkedIn, Pandora and Millennial Media.
There is also currently a strong pipeline with 118 IPOs on file with NYSE language, adding up to roughly $20 billion in proceeds, which includes the likes of Avaya, Service Now, Silver Spring Networks and MobiTV. While we have seen European market concerns creep back into the market, we still believe that the IPO window is open, and we will see more companies come to market in both the U.S. and Europe.
Lastly for me before I turn it over to Mike, please turn to Slide 7. Consider this the first of many updates to come on what we call Project 14. We're purposely calling this project, Project 14, because it is not about this quarter or even this year. It is about the time between now and 2014. Our goal is to spent this year, next year and the year after executing against 3 pillars: targeted growth, cost efficiency and strategic deployment of capital, so that by the end of 2014, we are in an even better position to compete and win in our core businesses.
Larry and Mike will be spearheading the cost-efficiency part of this project, and we will be as transparent as we're able to, to allow you to track our progress, so nobody will have to guess how far along we are in this program. We are going to be focused on a series of short, medium and long-term actions around our technology platforms, streamlining our organization and optimizing how we do business. We will divest underperforming assets, and we will build out clearing, both of which we believe will provide us with incremental revenue that Mike will discuss in more detail, but will also allow us to reduce cost.
So in the 4 weeks since we first announced the program, how are we doing? On the growth side of the ledger, we have lots of initiatives that are in progress, which we will believe -- which we believe will yield return on our investment regardless of how the market environment evolves. Our focus is not only on executing these initiatives shown in the growth bucket, but also seeking additional opportunity to create value.
On the efficiency front, our costs are down and following our closure of SecFinex, we finalized the unwind of NYSE Blue. This is not meant to be a verdict on the environmental space, just simply a recognition that this market will take much longer to develop than we or our shareholders are willing to wait.
On the capital front, I think we can check a couple of boxes, and it is nice to see that several of our peers are taking a page from our playbook by adding to their buybacks or establishing or increasing their dividends. Lastly, we bought back $125 million of stock in the quarter. Our CapEx was $43 million, in line with our full year guidance of about $200 million, and we announced plans to reevaluate several more of our minority investments.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Mike for a review of our financial results."
189274,181982389,293256,"NYSE Euronext, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2012",2012-04-30,"Earnings Calls","NYSE Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 8 provides comparative GAAP results in the first quarter of 2012. This quarter, there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.34 per share and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.47 per share. In the quarter,",1687,"Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 8 provides comparative GAAP results in the first quarter of 2012. This quarter, there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.34 per share and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.47 per share. 
In the quarter, we reported a $31 million charge for merger and exit expenses, which included $16 million related to final fees on the DB merger. Severance and exit costs were higher in the quarter as we launched our Project 14 efficiency effort. Our GAAP results also reflect the impact of several discrete tax items related to a favorable tax settlement with U.K. tax authorities, which was more than offset by a noncash expense related to changes from the legal entities in the U.S. Our review of our financial results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs and the discrete tax items.
Slide 9 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the quarter. As we saw this quarter, operating leverage cuts both ways, and that is really the story for the quarter. Lower volatility in volumes in all our venues, but particularly European derivatives, coupled with a weaker euro have negatively impacted revenues versus Q1 2011 and last quarter.
Revenues of $601 million for the quarter were down 11% year-over-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter. Volumes were down an average of 17% year-over-year, and were down an average of 7% from the traditionally slower fourth quarter period. While we continue to make headway in diversifying our business model, trading-related net revenue still makes up approximately 50% of our revenue base. And this revenue stream was down $88 million or 25% year-over-year. 
Revenue from other streams were up $10 million or 3% versus Q1 prior year. Our costs were lower $10 million or 2% for the quarter, the effective tax rate was 25% for the quarter, down from 26% in the prior year. The decline in the effective tax rate year-over-year was due to the aforementioned tax changes in the U.K. and U.S. And our diluted share count was reduced 3 million shares to 259 million shares this quarter. The period-end outstanding share count was 255 million. 
Slide 10 provides the consolidated and segment results on a currency neutral basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened this quarter versus prior year for both the euro and the British pound. For the first quarter, 45% of our net revenue was denominated in either euros or pounds and 55% in U.S. dollars. Currency impact on net revenue for the quarter was negative $9 million versus prior year and an unfavorable $5 million versus the previous quarter. Foreign exchange contributed an unfavorable $4 million to operating income this quarter versus prior year. 
On a currency neutral basis, first quarter net revenues were down 10% and operating income decreased 24% versus the first quarter of 2011. Operationally, revenues for our Derivatives and Cash Trading and Listings increased 24% and 6%, respectively. Our Technology segment revenues were up an adjusted 6%.
Slides 11 and 12 detail the financial performance for our Derivatives segment. Derivatives accounted for 29% of our consolidated net revenues and 35% of our operating income in the first quarter due to the decrease of $60 million in net revenues year-over-year principally driven by lower European derivatives trading volume. Volumes are weakest in the rates area, while equity, future and option volumes were also impacted by the underlying reduction in equity trading. 
Open interest has moved higher from year end 2011 levels, but is 17% lower than Q1 2011. We are at cyclical lows for this business, which is geared to the short end of the yield curve, but we are confident that when expectations for rate increases escalate, we will return to a growth trajectory for this business.
Revenue capture for the quarter was lower for NYSE Liffe versus both Q4 and prior-year first quarter. Decline year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was principally due to a shift in volume mix. Specifically, lower volumes and higher capture, short-term interest rate products, as well as modified pricing for the trading of individual equity options and index futures and options on the NYSE Liffe Amsterdam and Belgium.
Capture for the competitive U.S. options business was lower year-over-year, but stable on a linked-quarter basis. Higher percentage of dividend strategy trades over Arca, with fee caps was offset by a stronger capture on NYSE Amex Options.
NYSE Amex Options is on track for a record monthly market share in April of 16%. A clearing build is in full swing with a target date for fully in-sourcing Liffe Clear by Q3 2013. This is expected to save an annualized $30 million. Additionally, moving continental clearing to Liffe Clear is targeted for Q1 2014. This move will enable us to realize approximately $40 million in annual revenues at traditional derivative clearinghouse margins.
Similarly, Slide 13 and 14 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading and Listings accounted for 51% of our consolidated net revenues and 53% of our operating income in the first quarter. Cash Trading and Listings net revenue was $304 million in the first quarter of 2012, down 7% versus the prior-year period and down 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. The decrease was principally due to lower volumes, driven by a lower consolidated tape and an increase in off-exchange trading in the U.S. 
European cash ADV of 1.6 million transactions decreased 12% from the first quarter 2011 levels, but was in line with fourth quarter 2011. For April 2012, we have seen a dramatic improvement in European cash volumes, with ADV rising nearly 20% from Q1. In U.S. cash equities, volumes decreased 23% to 1.8 billion shares compared to prior year and decreased 16% from fourth quarter 2011 levels. April month-to-date U.S. cash trading volumes remain at depressed levels.
Non-exchange traded share or TRX share has increased several percentage points year-to-date March to approximately 34% of the U.S. cash trading due to lower volatility and has impacted our market share in the U.S. cash, which was down in Q1 both against fourth quarter 2011 and first quarter 2011 levels. Market share in Europe has stabilized for the last few quarters at 65% in our 4 European markets compared to 70% in the prior year. European share figures exclude off-exchange trading volume.
Revenue capture for the U.S. cash increased to $0.042 per 100 shares handled for Q1, well above the $0.037 recorded in the first quarter of 2011 and above the $0.039 in Q4. Revenue capture for European cash decreased to $0.57 from $0.67 in the first quarter of 2011 and was down slightly from the $0.58 in the fourth quarter of 2011. 14% decline in capture year-over-year was driven primarily by the overall decline in value traded and a weaker euro, partially offset by higher average basis point stake. 
Slide 15 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information and Technology Solutions accounted for 20% of our net revenue and 12% of our operating income in the first quarter of 2012. Information Service and Technology Solutions revenue was $121 million in the first quarter, an increase of $5 million or 4% from Q1 prior year. At constant exchange rates, revenues were up 6% on prior year.
Software sales, in particular, are traditionally weak in quarter 1 versus quarter 4, but in 2012, the economic environment accentuated this trend. While the Q1 results are below our expectations for this business, they reflect a very challenging environment for financial technology spending in the industry. Clients are delaying technology decisions, reducing staff levels, which impacts market data revenues, and the lower volatility and trading environment is impacting co-location and connectivity revenues. We expect this trend to continue, at least through quarter 2. Medium term, we remain convinced that we can resume double-digit top line growth. We have a solid pipeline of managed service opportunities and new product offerings.
Slide 16 provides a reconciliation of our underlying cost base and details investment spending for the quarter. This format also provides a comparison to our full year cost guidance. This will enable investors to track our realization of the $250 million in annualized savings we committed to at the Investor Day as part of Project 14.
Current period expenses of $405 million are rebased to currency fee rates for our 2012 cost guidance, resulting in a rebased cost base in 2001 -- Q1 2012 of $409 million. Expenses totaled $8 million in the 3 growth initiatives during the quarter. This translates to our first quarter core expenses of $401 million. 
Our cost guidance for core expenses is a range between $1,580 million and $1,600 million; this represents a projected 25% savings on the $250 million Project 14 goal. Using our traditional methodology of measuring expenses, year-over-year on a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis, costs were down $12 million or 3%. 
Looking to Q2, the April divestiture of NYSE Blue should save us $5 million in costs and $1 million in operating losses per quarter. Additionally, we expect to ramp up spending for our clearing and contract for differences initiatives.
Slide 17 details our cash and debt position as of March 31, 2012. Our cash and debt positions were similar to Q4 2011, with gross debt at $2.1 billion. This despite a first quarter where we paid annual bonuses, repurchased $125 million of stock and dispersed accumulated Section 31 fees. Although debt levels were constant, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio increased to 2x reflecting a weak Q1 for EBITDA.
Capital expenditures were $43 million in the quarter, compared to $35 million in the prior year quarter. First half of the year is our strongest period for free cash flow generation as result of billings for annual listing fees. We executed $125 million in stock repurchases in the first quarter, repurchasing 4.3 million shares at an average price of $29.73. Last week, the board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the second quarter of 2012, which is payable on June 29. 
Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Duncan for closing remarks."

As we move through 2012, we are not sitting still waiting for the operating environment to improve. As we said at our Investor Day, we believe there is further value that can be unlocked by having these businesses under 1 umbrella. We are focusing on unlocking that potential, which is what Project 14 is all about.
We're focusing on the leverage within our control to execute against our community strategy and drive the step-up in our underlying earnings per share growth between now and 2014. This will be accomplished, as we've said a few times today, through a mix of targeted revenue-generating initiatives, accelerated cost-efficiency efforts and strategic capital deployment.
With that, we'll open the line for your questions, and thanks for listening."

They're being asked to do that in a macro environment that is impacting them as much as it's impacting us as you can see from some of the results that the integrated investment banks have been publishing. So I don't think -- we are certainly not meeting internally at this point to worry about whether this quarter, after 3 years of pretty consistent growth, is suddenly the beginning of a new trend. I think if this persisted throughout this year, we would have to rethink kind of where we are on that. But we continue to believe there's good bolt-on acquisition opportunities, and there's good organic growth opportunities in that business. And I will say what I've said before, I think that will largely -- the success in that arena will largely define the longer-term success of this company because I think that's where we and others in the industry are going to have to head."

But if you look at what we've done with NYPC and things like that where our contribution when we started that, remember, we had to fund the guarantee fund there as well. And the issues there are that was a $25 million to $50 million funding. Remember that in our Liffe Clear business, we are doing most of the clearing already. We insource everything but the Treasury and risk management functions. So of course, we will continue to stay focused on that. We'll seed it with whatever's required. We're undertaking the discussions with the FSA now to talk about what they want that to look like. But we don't think that's going to be a huge hit to capital, if indications to date are any barometer. We also continue to think that although our credit rating is obviously well above investment grade, well into investment-grade territory, I continue to believe, as I've mentioned to some of you before, that looking at the credit rating of the parent company of any clearinghouse, I believe is a strange way of thinking about it. If you really get down to it, when the exchanges guarantee fund would be tapped is so far down the risk waterfall that I continue to say, and I can't say that anybody's listening, but I'm going to continue to say it anyway, that the right way to think about the credit exposure in any clearinghouse is really a weighted average of all the clearinghouse's participants. I think that's much more important. And I think we're much more focused with the regulators that we're talking to about the real-time risk controls in the clearinghouse and how to manage all of that. I think that's much more important than a, the credit rating of the topco; and b, whether we put in $25 million, $50 million or $100 million in a guarantee fund, those are interesting facts, but not terribly relevant as compared to the other stuff. So I'll do some more homework into that with my derivatives specialists and if the answer they give me is quite different than what I just shared, we'll make sure we circulate something on that."

But I'll start by saying this: I think we're not going to pat ourselves on the back. I mean everyone can see the market share trends, right? And as I said it in my remarks and as have said to some of you, in a low volatility, low-volume environment, it lends itself more to internalization. And it's not obvious to us why, if volatility and volume stay here, why the dark pool percentage of the market isn't going to stabilize or even increase potentially higher. Now, our view may be relative to some of our competitors is it's fairly simple calculus. You either chase revenue capture and profitability or you chase market share. Obviously in this macro environment, it's difficult to do both. I think some of our competitors have chosen that they believe the optics of market share are better. I think we continue to believe that the market's pretty fragmented. I'm not sure getting a couple of market share points is going to convince anybody that we have a better business model. I think the revenue capture is more important, because our view is, if you return to a more normal volume in volatility environment, we know that volatility is highly correlated with our market share. And I think we've been a little more focused on revenue capture in reasonable ways, where -- which the clients are fully aware of and I think we do that rather than chase market share.

Here's what I think is going on. So let's just have it all pretty clear. So we already partnered with DTC and NYPC. And I think we were hopeful that the 1 future arena that the NYSE DTC partnership at NYPC could explore was having already coupled euro-dollar futures and the cash bonds to kind of create a more capitally efficient clearinghouse, I think the next obvious leg to that stool will be to try to figure out a way to get into interest rate swaps. It's no secret to anybody on this call that LCH's SwapClear subsidiary, which is more or less governed by the important banks, who are the liquidity providers in the swaps market, has been looking for a partner on U.S. soil for that for quite some time. And it's also no secret that they are the dominant force in the interest rate swap business. So our view was -- and we've announced that with Project Trinity, which we referenced at the Investor Day. The idea is LCH picks up basically the license by buying IDCG from NASDAQ. I don't view that as a partnering strategy, I view that as them buying the license to actually partner with us and DTC, so now we can bring that third leg of the stool into NYPC over time. So that's what Project Trinity is all about. At the same time on the other side of the pond, LSE is going to acquire a majority share of LCH assuming that deal gets approved sometime this year or next year. The timing on them getting approval will more or less coincide with us finishing the vertical integration of our own clearinghouse. So remember, we insourced, as I said earlier, all but the treasury and risk management functions. That's what we are working on, that's consistent with the press release that we put out a few months ago about our timetable on all that. So roughly this time next year, maybe a little later, we will be completing that migration into the clearinghouse. So we will have our own clearinghouse, LSE will own a majority of LCH, and we and LCH and DTC will hopefully by then, be partnering on that 3-legged stool I referenced earlier, so that we'll be able to clear interest rate futures, the cash underliers, as well as interest rate swaps. And I think that will be an unprecedented cross-margining opportunity as well. So hopefully that addresses most of what you were asking about."

Now in a couple previous years, we had some offsetting good guys in the first quarter that made the first quarter results, maybe look more robust. The principle reason why moving sequentially from the fourth quarter, first quarter is lower software, which would happen in almost in a year. I think what we talked on top of that is with the lower volumes, one of the other revenue boosts we've been getting is people purchasing more cabinets, more safety connectivity, et cetera. And clearly in the lower volume environment, we didn't say there were a lot of cancellations, what we were saying is there is some excess capacity. And clearly, we're not getting incremental sales when -- in this sort of volume environment. So it's really those 2 things. But I think again, we had a pretty robust fourth quarter for software sales. And the first quarter always is weaker, this particular quarter was even a little weaker than normal because of some of the things Duncan and I mentioned earlier."

And you try to have as much insight as into it as you can, given the fact that we don't have all the information. I do think that the confluence of factors, including lower volatility, lower volumes, the high-frequency community diversifying into other asset classes and geographies not being as reliant on the U.S. And frankly, as we've articulated, I think publicly, a couple of times, the regulatory -- the potential for more regulatory scrutiny and in the interim, a lot of politics, if I can use that word, around this subject, some of the high-frequency folks we talk to are simply saying, ""Look, if there's going to be that much focus on it, when the majority of what we do is liquidity provision, I think whether it's an unintended consequence or not, some of the rhetoric from the regulators and politicians may be leading the high-frequency community to think about a lot of other alternatives and maybe, in fact, accelerating their move to either a, other asset classes and geographies, or b, some of the more lightly regulated liquidity pools, right? I mean, if you and I were high-frequency folks and every day, we're reading headlines in the paper, informed or uninformed, that say, we're going to be bringing a lot more scrutiny to bear. It is a rational decision to go look at other market opportunities or to trade in the less regulated markets. And I actually think that part of the increase in dark pool liquidity is coming from a change in demographics there as well because I don't think the high-frequency guys have left the U.S. market entirely. But I do think they've shifted some of their volume from the regulated to the less regulated markets, which you have to say is a rational decision on their part. So that's as much information as we've got at the moment. Some of that is obviously speculative. And again, as I said to Rich or someone earlier about their question, I can have Larry and Joe do a little more work in that, and if they have some different views, I'll encourage them to share it with you guys. We'll take 1 more, guys, and then let everyone get back to work, okay?"

Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining the call today. Before I start, I just thought it would make sense to point out that we're having this call at an important time in the markets.

Before I start, I just thought it would make sense to point out that we're having this call at an important time in the markets. I think there's a lot going on obviously that has broad ratification. So what you'll hear this morning is that some of our comments will be less focused on our company individually and instead focus on what I see as broader industry issues and the longer-term outlook. 
So the start with, I thought I'd provide some introductory remarks on the operating environment. We'll obviously spend some time reviewing our results for the quarter. And then Mike and I will update you in each of our businesses on kind of where we see things going and what the trajectory looks like. Now as many of you know, in my role, I have the opportunity to do a lot of traveling, and I have the privilege of getting to meet with corporate leaders and government leaders around the world on a pretty regular basis. And as you would expect, what I'm asking them about these days is what do they think about the outlook for the operating environment, the global economy, et cetera, and it won't surprise any of you that to a person everyone's talking about the tremendous and continuing uncertainty in the underlying foundation. And that's whether you talk about the political landscape, the economic landscape et cetera. Now I did ask people, what do they think about the likely length of this uncertainty and the softness in the global economy. And I think the general consensus is that most people would envision the state we're in persisting for at least the balance of this year and most people think it's going to extend through the end of next year at a minimum. 
So what does that mean? That means that as we're seeing now, a lot of money is sitting on the sidelines, volumes are obviously muted. Technology spending is on hold, if not down, and many of our competitors and more importantly our customers are grappling with their business models. So I think what we have to do as a business company is take a step back and say  does this current climate present an opportunity to focus the company for growth when the macroenvironment turns to whatever the new -- returns to whatever the new normal will be. So I think what we'll talk about this morning are just update you on the progress we believe we made during the quarter in our 3 pillars of growth and delivering against the commitment we laid out earlier in the year both tied to a recall project 14. We remain focused on the long-term financing the table for growth. We're not going to focus given that we don't control the macro environment or volumes or currency rates. We are not going to focus on quarter by quarter results, which we all understand are largely a function of the global macro environment and the underlying uncertainty that we're seeing from a lot of investors. 
So what have we been doing? We've been bringing to market new initiatives. We're focusing on organizational efficiency and we are being as agile as we can as we deploy our capital more efficiently for the benefit of all of our shareholders. 
So let me start by mentioning a few specific things that we did get done since we last spoke to all of you. In June, we announced a new internal organizational construct that will create teams centered around products and clients. The goal of this organizational change is not just change for the sake of change, but it is to get closer to our customers, focus our company more on product innovation and do that more nimbly than make better use of our global shared service functions. The product groups we've set up would consist of specialists organized focused on their respective areas of expertise, underpinned by a generalist sales force that will be responsible for cross-selling the full array of transaction and technology products and services we offer to all of our clients. To alleviate a potential concern, we do not envision, nor do we have any plans to change how we report our businesses externally. But we think this new internal structure will foster more collaboration and eliminate some silos that I think it inadvertently developed. 
We also took a major step this quarter in creating a full service CCP, NYSE Clearing, by giving official notice of termination to LCH. I'll talk about that more in my comments later. We had several new product launches for NYSE Liffe U.S. which we anticipate will drive further growth. We're excited about the positon of Corpedia, which supports our corporate services business and is an entry into the fast-growing areas of governance, risk and compliance. In our listings franchise we continue to experience very positive momentum whether you measure that in terms of discussions with clients, prospects across all industries in particular Silicon Valley after the events of this past spring Our market model and the IPO process speak for themselves. Our customers are you are eager to become references for us and with over 100 companies in the pipeline, we are pleased with how this listings business is positioned going forward. 
Lastly as you'll hear this morning, we made excellent progress on Project 14 cost savings exercise. And we are continuing to buy back stock at what we think will prove to be attractive levels. The load trading environment and the weaker euro this year is shrouding what we believe is excellent progress that we're making. But as we enter 2013, the tangible benefits of all the work we've been doing should begin to accrue with a return to earnings growth next year. 
With that as an introduction for the quarter, we recorded EPS of $0.51 a share and revenue of just over $600 million, down from $0.61 per share or $661 million of revenue in this quarter last year. Cost discipline continued in the quarter with cost down 5% year-on-year on a reported and constant dollar constant portfolio basis. The excellent work that the team has done will now allow us to exceed our previously stated cost guidance. As we move into Q3, we continue to battle the macro headwinds that are dampening volatility and reducing volumes. We will do this by focusing on our new growth initiatives, accelerating cost savings and continuing to deploy capital in the disciplined way to reduce our share count. 
Please turn to Slide 4. Slide 4 illustrates the strong progress that we are making in executing against our strategy. On the growth side of the ledger, we have several initiatives that are in progress and a number that have been completed, which we believe will yield return on our investment regardless of where the market environment evolves. The driver of future growth, we are on track to launch a full-service CCP in June of next year. We are launching new products across our derivatives franchise. We have implemented a new and innovative market structure with RLP program and we acquired Corpedia to bolster our corporate services business. 
We have also realigned our client facing and product and as I alluded to earlier. And on the efficiency front, we continued to show cost discipline as illustrated by our results. We have eliminated in several senior management positions. We have notified LCH of our intention to fully in source clearing. We are looking at options to reduce our global real estate footprint and further streamline our technology costs. In addition, we continue to look for opportunities to rationalize the portfolio. We recently unwound NYSE Blue and we have made the decision to terminate our CFD initiative. Given our priorities clearing, our organizational realignment, the ongoing macro headwinds and dampening client demand for CFDs, we've decided not to move ahead with this investment that we envisioned in retail CFD. We are in the early stages of a multiyear investment and I believe this position evidences our ability to be flexible, focused and disciplined when it comes to capital allocation. 
Lastly, on the capital front we have an agreement in principle to maintain our investment in Cotter at 12% rather than the initially envisioned 20%. We sold an additional 7% of NYSE Liffe U.S. to our partners and lastly, we are continuing to buyback shares at attractive levels and we have paid out more than 50% of our earnings year-to-date in dividends. 
Please turn to Slide 5. Slide 5 is a refresher on our strategy compass. Before we dive into the review by segment, I wanted to make sure we remind you of the context for the different initiatives we have in progress. We talked about this at Investor Day and we will continue to show you how our activities plot against the areas we have chosen to prioritize in the coming 18 to 24 months. The 6 areas we highlight on Slide 5 will be addressed in the coming slides and then I'll turn it over to Mike. 
So please turn over to Slide 6. On Slide 6, we're going to focus on growth initiatives specific to our derivatives business. On the upper left-hand quadrant, on July 16, we launched futures trading on DTCC GCF Repo Index on our NYSE Liffe U.S. platform. In just about 2 weeks of writing, open interest across treasury, agency and MBSS classes has grown to over 15,000 contracts. The fact that the underlying index is based on actual secure interbank financing transactions is a clear differentiator and is aligned with the global regulatory trend of greater transparency for these markets.  The launch of this product complements our strategy of continuing to build our preferred franchise at NYSE Liffe U.S. through innovative approaches to markets. In the upper right quadrant, we highlight the continued strength we have witnessed in our equity options business in the U.S. NYSE Amex registered higher market share of 15.7% in the second quarter, up 1% from last year and up or about the same from Q1. On the bottom half of the slide, we highlight current trends in our fixed income and equity derivatives businesses and new product initiatives. First, in fixed income, the ongoing uncertainty in the Eurozone has driven some higher activity in our U.K. based products on the short sterling side with those products up 77% since the fourth quarter of last year, which was in a low and the long gilt end up 9% versus last year. These products are key examples of our diversification and strong position outside the Eurozone. On the new product front, given the decrease in hedging and speculation on the short end of the curve, we are actively looking to move along the yield curve to allow us to generate interest rate business in a persistently low interest rate environment. A clear example of this is the recent launch of our mid-curve options products. On July 17 we launched additional mid-curve options on British pound and products and through July 30, we have created nearly 3 quarters of 1 million contracts with open interest of about a quarter of a million contracts. 
Lastly on our Swapnote product, which has all the characteristics of an OTC swap but is better correlated to the swap curve and is traded in a clear exchange environment, this product was relaunched with a new market making program. The Swapnote product addresses both regulatory needs, as well as the new market paradigm of single government bond curve that doesn't necessarily meet the needs of the current swap market. We believe the growth retention of this product will be strong over time.  Turning to equities, we've seen a rebound in index futures and we expect to announce the launch of some new index futures contracts and new country single stock products later this fall. 
Please turn to Slide 7. On Slide 7, I'm going to walk quickly through the key milestones for establishing our full-service CCP NYSE clearing. There are basically 3 main delivery phases to our clearing strategy. First, with the aforementioned termination notice given to LCH Clearnet in June, we are on track to establish full-service CCP by the end of the second quarter of 2013. This will be the trigger for eliminating the payments that we now make to LCH for risk management services. This will also position us to gain new sources of income and better position us for new product and service launches. Next, in the third quarter of 2013, we will establish new OTC clearing services to align with the latest regulatory mandates. We'll leverage our existing franchise by offering clearing for closely correlated products to provide our clients with cross margining opportunities against their already established open interest. Third and last, in the first quarter of 2014, we will consolidate all of our European derivatives into a single CCP. This should bring us incremental clearing fees of about $40 million annually, strengthen our resisting equity derivatives platform and the single pan-European platform should deliver significant operational benefits to members, not the least of which will be major margin offsets of approximately EUR 1.2 billion given today's open interest. 
Please turn to Slide 8. On Slide 8, I'm going to focus on key developments in our Cash Trading and Listings business. Again, starting in the upper left in our European cash business we have seen a nice pickup in market share moving up more than 300 basis points in June. The share gains in the month of June came off the renewal and expansion of our liquidity provider program. This is all part of our focus on market equality, which is attracting new volume and new participants. On the upper right, we launched a new and innovative micro structure in our U.S. cash equities business, which is designed to address the growth of off exchange volume. This is our effort to level the playing field by replicating practices that are currently permitted on non exchange markets. The newly approved retail liquidity program for NYSE and NYSE market allows for price improvement for retail orders within an exchange environment resulting in real transparent savings for retail investors. Retail order represents approximately 10% of the market and as we all know, most retail orders do not currently make their way to exchanges. We are hopeful that this program will create a more attractive exchange environment for this customer segment and the liquidity providers that would like to interact with it. 
Turning to the lower left quadrant, as we've mentioned, we closed on the acquisition of Corpedia in June, which is designed to diversify our corporate services it and the key agencies such as governance, risk and compliance. Corpedia has a deep and diversified client base of more than 500 customers across all verticals, of which about 25% are part of the Fortune 500. The business model has strong cash flow characteristics, limited capital requirements and is supported by favorable regulatory trends, which include intensified regulatory oversight, scrutiny and enforcement. Mike will provide you in his remarks with the sense of the revenue and expenses tied to this new acquisition. 
Lastly in the lower right-hand quadrant, our listings franchise is gaining momentum on all fronts. We're winning more than half the technology IPOs today and the tech pipeline is even stronger. Of the 8 companies that have moved to the NYSE in 2012, 2 of them were in the Top 100 market cap companies listed on our competitor's exchange. Since 2010, the total of 38 companies have transferred to the NYSE while 14 transferred away, about a 3 to 1 win ratio. And as I mentioned earlier, the most encouraging sign is that there are more than 100 companies in the pipeline already filed with NYSE language. As is always the case, market conditions will dictate how many of these customers actually make it to the market, but on the whole, we feel very good about our listings business where we continue to have many positive conversations with companies across a wide range of industries. 
I'm also pleased to report that the jobs that we've worked so hard on with the venture capital association and others in the industry has been received very positively by a lot of private companies and in fact in my last trip to California, every prospect I talked to said it changed their thinking on their ability to go public, whether it was the opportunity to file in the early stages confidentially with the SEC and become more transparent when they were ready to do their IPO or whether it was the on ramp capabilities of having the opportunity scale into Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. It's clear that people know we play a significant role in that legislation. They're appreciative of it, and I think it's generally making a difference. So we believe that the combination of that, our advocacy efforts, our market model and our service offering will continue to differentiate us globally. 
Lastly on Slide 9, before I turn it over to Mike, just a quick update on our Commercial Technology business. Financial technology is and will continue to be a critical element in the evolution of the Capital Markets. So the leadership position that we have achieved and continue to aspire to in this business is important for our future growth regardless of the near term challenging environment. 
There are several trends, which are impacting the business in the near term as well as that of our peers. First, technology spending in the medium term is either flat or down. As a result, the industry has shifted from a build it and they would come approach to how can we do a cheaper approach by costing out their projects. And the technology arms race has cooled with the decrease in trading volumes, technology is increasingly viewed by some as a commodity or an off-the-shelf product firms no longer have to build and house. 
The second trend we see is as trading volumes in the full electronic markets have declined, we are seeing a greater emphasis on the higher growth OTC products that are in the midst of a migration to a more electronic-based system. Thirdly, the globalization of the technology services phase is continuing. And while we see ourselves as a global leader there has been a greater focus in Asia where we are in an earlier stage of our growth. Fourth, an increasing share of the spend from our customers is defensive, focused on things like regulatory compliance around reporting, compliance and risk management. In the last trend, which eventually should be supportive of our business is the acceleration of more manage and outsourcing as clients try to manage their overall cost better. 
So while we're clearly in an air pocket, we are doing a lot to actively respond to this challenging environment. First, while we are focused on long-term growth, we cannot lose sight of the short-term so we are reviewing immediate actions we can take to support and run our business more efficiently. Next, we are improving our execution capabilities, namely focusing on our costs, making sure we provide great service to our clients and the highest quality product. Lastly with the acceleration of the market trend toward managed services and outsourcing, we are placing an increased focus on solutions and managed services. I'm happy to report that the managed services pipeline is strong and building. We are in active dialogue with several investment banks, and we are in the process of rolling out several new MTFs for example. We will accomplish this by getting closer to our customers and by having our technology relationship team working together with our markets-focused salespeople. This is exactly what the new organizational construct that I referenced earlier should promote. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike for a review of our financial results, and then I'll wrap up the call before we turn it over to your questions. Go ahead, Mike."
189274,206995777,339079,"NYSE Euronext, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2012",2012-08-03,"Earnings Calls","NYSE Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Duncan. Good morning. Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the second quarter 2012. This quarter there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.49 per share and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.51 per share. In the quarter, we repo",1925,"Thanks, Duncan. Good morning. Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the second quarter 2012. This quarter there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.49 per share and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.51 per share. In the quarter, we reported a $12 million charge for merger expenses and exit costs. The majority of the chart was related to severance for our Project 14 efficiency effort. Our GAAP results also include a net $2 million loss related to the winding down of our NYSE Blue environmental venture in April. Lastly, our GAAP tax rate of 21% was below our effective rate of 25% attributed to some onetime benefits realized in the quarter. 
Our review of financial results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs, disposal activities and discrete tax items. Slide 11 provides a more detailed look at financial results for the quarter. Lower volumes across most of our venues or particularly European derivatives, coupled with the weaker euro have negatively impacted our financial results versus Q2 2011. That said, Q2 trading volumes increased sequentially for European derivatives in Europe and U.S. cash. 
Net revenues of $602 million for the quarter were down 9% year-over-year and increased slightly from Q1 levels. Costs were lower by $23 million or 5% for the quarter and are running $35 million lower year to date. For the second quarter, 39% of our operating expenses were denominated in either euros or pounds, 60% in U.S. dollars and another 1% in various Asian currencies. 
We closed the acquisition of Corpedia at the end of the second quarter. We expect this business to generate approximately $7 million in revenue per quarter for the second half of 2012. The effective tax rate was 25% for the quarter, down from 26% in the prior year. The diluted share count was reduced by 6 million shares to $253 million this quarter. The period and fully diluted share count was 249 million shares. 
Slide 12 provides our consolidated segment results on a currency neutral basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened this quarter versus prior year for both the euro and British pound by 11% and 3% respectively. For the second quarter, 45% of our net revenues was denominated in either euros or pounds. The currency impact on a net revenue for the quarter was a negative $22 million versus prior year and unfavorable by $3 million versus the previous quarter. Foreign exchange contributed an unfavorable $11 million to operating income this quarter versus prior year. 
On a currency neutral basis, second quarter net revenues were down 6% and operating income decreased 10% versus the second quarter of 2011. Operationally, revenue for our derivatives and Cash Trading and Listings businesses decreased 12% and 5% respectively. Commercial technology revenues were up 2%. 
Slides 13 and 14 detail the financial performance for our Derivatives segment. Derivatives accounted for 30% of our consolidated net revenues and 36% of our operating income. Derivatives net revenues of $182 million in the second quarter was down 15% versus prior year and up 3% sequentially. Despite a sequential quarter increase of 9% in European derivative trading volumes and an 8% increase in open interest across the exchange, the environment remains challenging due to our focus on the short end of the yield curve. 
Revenue capture for the quarter was higher for NYSE Liffe versus Q1 and lower compared to the prior year second quarter. The decline year-over-year was primarily due to a modified pricing in Q4 2011 for the trading of individual equity options and index futures and options on NYSE Liffe Amsterdam and Belgium. The increase compared to Q1 was principally due to a positive mix shift, principally higher sterling futures activity given continued uncertainty in the Eurozone. 
Capture for the U.S. Options business was lower year-over-year but stable on a linked quarter basis. The decline in capture year-over-year was principally due to the changes in NYSE New York. NYSE Amex Options notched a quarterly market share record high in the second quarter of nearly 16%. We gave LCH Clearnet notice that we'll be terminating our outsourcing arrangement in June 2013, putting us on track to establish a full-service CCP for NYSE Clearing. This move is expected to save an annualized $30 million.  Moving Continent to Clearing to NYSE clearing is targeted for Q1 2014. This will enable us to realize approximately $40 million in annual revenues and traditional derivative clearinghouse margins. Similarly, slides 15 and 16 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listing segment. Cash Trading and Listings accounted for 50% of our consolidated net revenues and 53% of our operating income in the second quarter. Cash Trading and Listings net revenue was $300 million in the second quarter, down 8% versus the prior year period and down 1% compared to the first quarter of 2012. 
Global listings revenues increased $2 million or 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. European cash ADD at 1.7 million transactions increased 11% from second quarter 2011 levels, and increased 8% from the first quarter of 2012. Market share across our 4 primary markets, which excludes off exchange trading volume was 66% in the second quarter, down from 71% in the prior year but up from 65% in the first quarter of 2012.  Market share in June was 69%, reflecting strong activity from a revamp supplemental liquidity provider program. 
In U.S. cash equities, volumes decreased 12% to 1.8 billion shares compared to the prior year but increased 2% in the first quarter 2012 levels. Our market share across all takes increased slightly sequentially but is down 200 basis points year-over-year. Non exchange traded share or TRF share remains elevated at 32% of the U.S. equities market, down from 34% in Q1, but up from 31% in the prior year. In response to the growth in off change rating we have relaunched the retail equity provider program in Q3 as Duncan discussed earlier. 
Revenue capture for U.S. cash increased to $0.043 per hundred shares handled in Q2, well above the $0.039 recorded in the second quarter of 2011 and in line with Q1. The 10% increase in capture helped offset the 12% decrease in trading volumes resulting in a 4% decline in net trading revenues. Revenue capture for European cash on a per transaction basis decreased to $0.52 from $0.74 in the second quarter of 2011 and was down from $0.57 in the first quarter of 2012. As our daily value traded and the average trade size has decreased, it has resulted in an increase in a number of transactions per day artificially depressing our revenue capture on a per transaction basis. To allow the fee per transaction has decreased 30% year-on-year in terms of local currency fees and basis points were down only 5% year on year. The weaker euro and higher mix of volumes from liquidity providers has reduced Q2 capture versus Q1. 
Slide 17 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information and technology solutions accounted for 20% of our net revenue and 11% of our operating income in the second quarter of 2012. Segment revenue was $119 million in the second quarter, a decrease of $3 million from Q2 prior year. At constant exchange rates, revenues were up $2 million or 2% over prior year. For the first half of 2012, commercial technology revenues at constant exchange rates were up 4%. 
Our top line growth is below our long-term expectations for this business and reflects a very challenging environment for financial technology spending in the industry. For delayed technology decisions, reducing staff levels which impacts market data revenues and the lower volatility and trading environment is impacting colocation and connectivity revenues. Pipeline for solution and managed services fields are growing. We expect growth to be sluggish for at least one more quarter as we work through this cycle and execute the turnaround plans. 
Margins for the quarter remained at 23% for the second consecutive quarter below our 26% rate for all of last year. Given lower projected revenue growth this year, we have taken short-term actions to reduce costs for this business and expect segment expenses to be below last year's level for the second half of 2012. 
Slide 18 provides a reconciliation of our underlying cost base and updates our 2012 cost guidance. Costs are below $400 million for the first time in years Current period expenses of $396 million are rebates to currency rates for our 2012 cost guidance resulting in a rebates cost base for Q2 2012 of $400 million, eight hundred and nine million year-to-date. We expect a total of $12 million on growth initiatives during the quarter. This translates to second quarter core expenses of $388 million and $789 million year-to-date. This compares favorably to our prior full year guidance for core expenses. 
We are updating our full year expense guidance for strategic initiatives as follows: The acquisition of Corpedia, along with the $14 million of incremental revenue we expect to incur, about $10 million in cost in the second half of 2012. As Duncan mentioned earlier, we have decided not to move forward with the buildout of our contractor differences initiative, so we're no longer including it as a discrete investment. We expect to save $10 million, which we had anticipated spending on this project in 2012. 
NYSE incremental cost in the quarter were $7 million, and $11 million year-to-date. As I mentioned, we're not expecting incremental NYSE cost for the full year to be between $5 million and $10 million, reflecting the short-term actions we are taking to reduce costs in the business in the second half and protect margins. This will save about $15 million from prior estimates. Our solid expense control in the first half, combined with the anticipated $15 million in discreet initiative savings will put us on track to be well below our initial cost guidance for reported and core expenses that we're reviving downward our full year 2012 guidance to be between one six one two million and one six one seven million on a constant dollar basis using the rates of $1.35 to the euro, $1.60 to the pound. We also expect our core expense base to be less than one five 8 0 which is below the full low end of our original guidance. 
Slide 19 details our cash and debt position as of June 30, 2012. Gross debt at June 30 was $2.3 billion and it was a little over $400 million of cash on the balance sheet, bringing net debt to $1.9 billion. Debt levels increased slightly as we financed the share buyback and acquisition of Corpedia. Our debt to EBITDA leverage ratio increased to 2.1x, reflecting a weak first half EBITDA. 
We have agreed in principle that the Qatar Exchange to maintaining our stake at 12%. This will allow us to forgo the 2 remaining $40 million payments. Capital expenditures were $41 million in the quarter and $84 million year-to-date, in line with our full year 2012 guidance. The second quarter $2 million of CapEx was related to the buildout of our clearing capability in Europe. We executed $177 million of stock repurchase in the second quarter, retiring 6.9 million shares at an average price of $25.60. And year-to-date we've retired 11.2 million shares. Lastly week, the board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the second quarter of 2012, which is payable on September 28. 
Now I would like to turn the call back to Duncan for closing remarks."

But if we need to go a few extra minutes we'll be prepared to do that and obviously, we'll follow-up with many of you throughout the day. So just a few closing remarks before we open up the phone to questions, in summary, we're pleased with the progress we're making on our strategy to create a global Capital Markets community that empowers our clients to innovate and collaborate. We believe we made a lot of progress in executing against the strategy and combined with the cost reduction plans we have in place and better management of our capital, we believe that the company is well-positioned to return to strong earnings growth in 2013 and beyond. 
And finally, before we get into questions, I think it would be appropriate to comment on the unfortunate situation that occurred this week with Knight Capital. As Knight reported, they incurred a technology issue the cost of routing error involving roughly 140 issues listed on our exchange. As we said Wednesday, the systems here at the NYSE operated and performed normally, and we believe that the human interaction on the floor, as well as some of our liquidity refreshment points that are built in as speed bumps into our model actually assisted in mitigating this issue to some degree. As many of you know, under our rules, we broke trades in a handful of the issues, which were found to be clearly erroneous, and after carefully reviewing the trading issue with the SEC and other market participants, we validated the trades and the remainder of the issues as is mandated under our exchange rules, rules that I would point out are uniform across all exchanges. 
There has been some speculation in the media that this was somehow related to the launch of our RLP program. So let me be clear in saying that it had nothing to do with RLP. As I said a moment ago, RLP enjoyed a successful launch with multiple market participants trading on the new platform with no problems whatsoever. To be clear, the technology specs for this new order type were out in October of last year. We opened for user acceptance testing in January of this year. And even though the rule is just approved, this testing has gone on for months. And we sent notice of the official launch and a reminder of testing in the middle of July and many market participants have tested with us during those -- during this period of user acceptance testing including Knight in fact. We continue to work with the SEC, FINRA and others to the extent we can provide any additional information they may need as we work our way through this issue. 
I'm happy to take more questions on that if it's relevant in Q&A. And with that, we'll open the line for your questions. So Stephen, back to you."

So let me just give you some additional thoughts and hopefully, this will address it as much as we're able to today. So firstly, as I said in my remarks, while I do not want to go into too much detail, I think it's fair to say that the market model we have here helped us flag this issue sooner than I think others would have been able to. So we went to work pretty quickly to dissect what we thought the root cause would be, and within minutes, we were in contact with Knight to begin working through the issue with that. I think subsequent to that, they have clearly articulated what the problem was. And I think Tom Joyce has handled this rather unfortunate situation as well as he could have from my point of view in terms of how he's communicated, how upfront he's been and how accountable he's been, and I think he is to be commended for that. In terms of what -- if you listen to what Knight has said, they publicly stated that the problem was cost by a software problem on their side. And I think well, it's fair to say that this issue happened to be coincident with the timing of the launch of our RLP program, there is no indication based on our review and reviews that others have done that our software had anything to do with the problem. And in fact as I said in my remarks, several firms have been actively using RLP successfully and we don't see a problem with the software. In following the procedures that we follow in the aftermath of an issue like this, I think I want to be very clear. We adhered strictly to the provisions that are clearly erroneous rules. Frankly the way those rules are written I think correctly, they don't give exchanges a lot of latitude. And I think market participants agree that, that is more sensible. We coordinated with all the market participants, all the other exchanges and the regulators. And I firmly believe we made the right decision on that. Now at this time, we haven't received any claims relating to this metal and we don't expect any, but we should be mindful of the fact that the situation is still unfolding. On the bigger issue, I'd say this is yet another instance that highlights the need for reforms in market structure in the United States. We've talked about this publicly, but the growing fragmentation and uneven regulations across what is now hundreds of competing platforms continue to fuel the crisis of confidence among investors. It's just too hard for them to understand how the markets work. As I testified publicly before Congress in June, I believe the time has come for policymakers to address the public concerns. And we fear that quite frankly, there's been too much focus recently on what I would call market microstructure incrementalism. And there hasn't been the right amount of public discourse and one we should really be focused in which is the reliability and resilience of the markets during crises, during periods of volatility or aberrant behavior. And we should remember that we're here to serve the investors in the broader market, not individual participants or their business models. So I'm sincerely hopeful and believe that incidents like this will encourage the regulators to more seriously we've address these issues. And we've already indicated to the regulators as we did to Congress in our testimony that we stand ready to be an active participant in any and all dialogue going forward. So hopefully, that address the details and kind of where we think we go from here."

But I know the intention of the program was to bring retail internalized liquidity back to the exchange, back to the lit markets. But it also accomplished to a lot of surprise sort of custom segmentation where pricing -- other exchanges are looking at actually segment and customers and pricing for different customer types. So I guess the point is how do you balance that looking at broader market structure issues with now this press of segmented pricing by a client type? And then I also just love to get a feel for in this week of retail execution turmoil, how the volumes in there went throughout the week."

So I'll let Lebo talk a minute about what we think the potential for the impact of the FTT in France and potentially other markets will be. We'll get to that in a minute. In terms of the market structure, if you go back and reference the commentary that I shared publicly in both our written statement and then my own remarks in front of Congress and regards committee in the House, I don't think our feelings of change with the recent event. We just simply think the recent events are another example that the structure that has evolved over the last decade in the U.S. has led to an external fragmentation, really an emphasis on speed, a feeling that somehow, if something can happen faster, it is by definition better. And I think the more of this we see, we're all understanding, meaning we, market participants and most importantly, the regulators are understanding that speed is not always better. I think the market structure has gotten incredibly complex. It's virtually impossible to explain to a policymaker and an investor anymore. And I think all we're saying is not that we're trying to go back to the old days, but what we said to our sell side customers and our policymakers is it would seem that it's time for all of us to sit around and acknowledge that whatever's happened, sure, some good things about them. There's no question that spreads are tighter. But let's be honest. Spreads are tighter more because of stabilization and because of anything that happened on the revelatory landscape in terms of market structure. When you want a decimal that obviously made the spreads tighter. So let's acknowledge the victories that we have and the things that made it better for investors. But at the same time, let's have a heavy dose of intellectual honesty and say that no 1 would look at this rationally and say, ""It's not broke and we shouldn't fix it."" There's really something that need to be examined. Now without getting into details in terms of the 2 or 3 things we'd like to see because I think they were all in the testimony and I don't think to be redundant, this week is a really interesting example, right, because we sit here and we see things that are now able to happen. And you take a step back from that and say, ""There must be things we could fix. For example, we've had a lot of talk on the wake of the flash crash and I think we're certainly prepared to at that time and can convening various participants around the table to think about what we should do. And individual end market wise, circuit breakers are put in place. We were -- we think that's important. It's always been a function of our model. And in fact, our speed bumps are tighter than the circuit breakers that the industry approved the. Now I actually think that our individual circuit breakers, which I would reiterate, we have not removed from our model nor do I think we should, I think that mitigated problem, the problem on Wednesday to some degree and it would mitigate other problems that could arise like that. So there's an example where I think if we all just sit around and say, ""How do we make it better? How do we reinstill confidence?"" What are asking to do away from dark pool what are we asking for everything to come back to the exchange what we're asking for people to a basic knowledge this is an indescribably complex and I think it's in all of the sit down and see what we can do positively. These things always take longer than we think but I feel like this latest incident will be a call to action and we've committed to the regulators that we're prepared to convene the industry and do whatever it takes to come to some consensus around the kind of things that could be done. Lebo, why don't you talk a little bit about the FTT and its early days but just what we think about that?"

And intention at the very least, it looks like it's supposed to have similar exemptions. I think one of the things that we have seen is a confusion in the market as to those exemptions. And that has caused some liquidity providers to pull out at least temporarily while they get counsel and get advice on how that's going to happen. And in fact, some of the directives recently came out. We also saw some confusion for example were some custodian banks were in the U.S. we are say that they would not support transfer of ownership in French because they couldn't figure out double taxation and things like that and we fear that we might have do not allow the stock the trade. Now subsequently the French government gave relief on that at least temporarily. So there's a lot of issues still up in the air. So it's hard to really draw any conclusions from a couple days of trading. We continue to believe that financial transaction taxes are not the best way to either raise revenues or punish people for things that could be done other ways and that interfering with the price recovery process is dangerous in the intended consequences. Unless, we do feel that the impact of this, if we can get the exemptions clarified so in the equities market, we will be relatively muted."

Obviously, it's early days. So we shouldn't get ahead of our skis here. But I think that if things like -- if the Fed were to do that or the treasury were to issue some notes and use that as an underlying benchmark, we certainly think that would be a good acid test for this. Frankly, we just thought it was a good innovation and remember, we launched -- we had this on the drawing board before all these questions about the efficacy and accuracy of the derivation of LIBOR as a bench mark. But I mean let's be a little realistic here too, right? So we know that LIBOR is deeply embedded and currently very, very important to basically have money markets function around the world. To our best information, there is more than 600 trillion of business tied in some way to a LIBOR benchmark. And some of that goes out for decades. So it's not just as simple for example as saying, ""Okay, don't list any more products tied to some of these underlying benchmarks."" That's easy to say. It is not easy to implement. It is so embedded in how the markets work. So I think what we said for the regulators here and abroad is we're happy to work with them. We're happy to work with the market participants. If people think there should be ways to address the concerns that have been expressed than to be part of implementing some change whether it's different mechanics, new kinds of innovative products like we just launched, they should consider us to be more than eager to do that. But I think a lot of the participants we spoken to feel that whether or not LIBOR stays as a standard, which, given all the business that's smart too, and it's going to be hard to see it disappearing overnight, I think they're still inclined to use this because the repo product at least for U.S. underliers I think actually is a better hedge against some of the bespoke FLOPS people would put on than euro dollars might enable you to do. So news to come. We're going to be very transparent about the volumes. But given that we're only 2 weeks in, I think we're pretty pleased so far with how we've done."

Obviously, we're all familiar that the 2 benchmarks are calculated under idiosyncrasies sinker season in which the way they are calculated. The investigation to date has been pretty much focused on LIBOR. That's not to say a we'll be focused on kind of all these different benchmarks. We have already been in conversations with the regulators and participants in the U.K. and in the EU. So to the degree we need to develop products that might provide an alternative as we've been able to do here, we would be prepared to engage in the dialogue on that. But much as I said about LIBOR, this is not something you can change overnight even if you thought that both of the underlying benchmarks had some idiosyncrasies that were manipulative. So I think we're going to pay very close attention. It is a different process, the way the 2 are calculated. But I don't think we can pay 100% comfort from that. That doesn't mean we're not going to engage in the dialogue with the policymakers over there. In fact, we have. So more to come on all that. But I don't think this is going to happen quickly on either side of the pond. But keep in mind, there are some differences to how the benchmarks are calculated to. All right.

Before I start, I just thought it would make sense to point out that we're having this call at an important time in the markets. I think there's a lot going on, obviously, that has broader ramifications. 
So what you'll hear this morning is that what -- that some of our comments will be less focused on our company individually and instead focus on what I see as broader industry issues and the longer-term outlook. So to start with, I thought I'd provide some introductory remarks on the operating environment. We'll obviously spend some time reviewing our results for the quarter, and then Mike and I will update you, in each of our businesses, on kind of where we see things going and what the trajectory looks like. 
Now as many of you know, in my role, I have the opportunity to do a lot of traveling, and I have the privilege of getting to meet with corporate leaders and government leaders around the world on a pretty regular basis. And as you would expect, what I'm asking them about these days is what do they think about the outlook for the operating environment, the global economy, et cetera. And it won't surprise any of you that to a person, everyone's talking about the tremendous and continuing uncertainty and the underlying foundation, and whether -- that's whether you talk about the political landscape, the economic landscape, et cetera. 
Now I then ask people, what do they think about the likely length of this uncertainty and the softness in the global economy? And I think that general consensus is that most people would envision the state we're in persisting for, at least, the balance of this year and most people think it's going to extend through the end of next year at a minimum. 
So what does that mean? That means that, as we're seeing now, a lot of money is sitting on the sidelines. Volumes are obviously muted. Technology spending is on hold, if not down, and many of our competitors and, more importantly, our customers are grappling with their business models. So I think what we have to do as a company is then take a step back and say, ""Does this current climate present an opportunity to focus the company for growth when the macro environment turns to whatever the new -- returns to whatever the new normal will be?"" 
So I think what we'll talk about this morning is to just update you on the progress we believe we made during the quarter in our 3 pillars of growth and delivering against the commitments that we laid out earlier in the year, all tied to what we call Project 14. We remain focused on this long-term plan and setting the table for growth, but we're not going to focus -- given that we don't control the macro environment or volumes or currency rates, we are not going to focus on quarter-by-quarter results, which we all understand are largely a function of that global macro environment and the underlying uncertainty that we're seeing from a lot of investors. 
So what have we been doing? We've been bringing to market new initiatives. We're focusing on organizational efficiency, and we are being as agile as we can as we deploy our capital more efficiently for the benefit of all of our shareholders. 
So let me start by mentioning a few specific things that we did get done since we last spoke to all of you. In June, we announced the new internal organizational construct that will create teams centered around products and clients. The goal of this organizational change is not just change for the sake of change, but it is to get closer to our customers, focus our company more on product innovation and do that more nimbly and make better use of our global shared service functions. 
The product groups we've set up will consist of specialists organized to focus on their respective areas of expertise, underpinned by a generalist sales force that we will be responsible for cross-selling the full array of transaction and technology products and services we offer to all of our clients. To alleviate a potential concern, we do not envision, nor do we have any plans to change how we report our businesses externally, but we think this new internal structure will foster more collaboration and eliminate some silos that I think had inadvertently developed. 
We also took a major step this quarter in creating a full service CCP, NYSE Clearing by giving official notice of termination to LCH. I'll talk about that more in my comments later. We had several new product launches for NYSE Liffe U.S., which we anticipate will drive further growth. We're excited about the acquisition of Corpedia, which supports our corporate services business and is an entry into the fast-growing areas of governance, risk and compliance. 
In our Listings franchise, we continue to experience very positive momentum, whether you measure that in terms of discussions with clients, prospects across all industries, in particular, Silicon Valley, after the events of this past spring. Our market model and IPO process speak for themselves. Our customers are eager to become references for us. And with over 100 companies in the pipeline, we are pleased with how this Listings business is positioned going forward. 
Lastly, as you'll hear this morning, we've made excellent progress on Project 14 cost-savings exercise, and we are continuing to buy back stock at what we think will prove to be attractive levels. 
The low trading environment and the weaker euro this year is shrouding what we believe is excellent progress that we're making. But as we enter 2013, the tangible benefits of all the work we've been doing should begin to accrue with a return to earnings growth next year. 
With that as an introduction for the quarter, we recorded EPS of $0.51 a share and revenue of just over $600 million, down from $0.61 per share on $661 million in revenue in this quarter last year. Cost discipline continued in the quarter with costs down 5% year-on-year on a reported and constant dollar/constant portfolio basis. The excellent work that the team has done will now allow us to exceed our previously stated cost guidance. 
As we move into Q3, we continue to battle the macro headwinds that are dampening volatility and reducing volumes. We will do this by focusing on our new growth initiatives, accelerating cost savings and continuing to deploy capital in a disciplined way to reduce our share count. 
Please turn to Slide 4. Slide 4 illustrates the strong progress that we are making in executing against our strategy. On the growth side of the ledger, we have several initiatives that are in progress and a number that have been completed, which we believe will yield return on our investment regardless of how the market environment evolves. 
A driver of future growth, we are on track to launch a full-service CCP in June of next year. We are launching new products across our Derivatives franchise. We have implemented a new and innovative market structure with our RLP program, and we acquired Corpedia to bolster our corporate services business. We have also realigned our client-facing and product teams, as I alluded to earlier. 
And on the efficiency front, we continue to show cost discipline as illustrated by our results. We have eliminated several senior management positions. We have notified LCH of our intention to fully insource clearing. We are looking at options to reduce our global real estate footprint and further streamline our technology costs. 
In addition, we continue to look for opportunities to rationalize the portfolio. We recently unwound NYSE Blue, and we have made the decision to terminate our CFD initiative. Given our priorities with clearing, our organizational realignment, the ongoing macro headwinds and dampening client demand for CFDs, we've decided not to move ahead with this investment that we envisioned in retail CFDs. We were in the early stages of a multiyear investment, and I believe this decision evidences our ability to be flexible, focused and disciplined when it comes to capital allocation. 
Lastly, on the capital front, we have an agreement in principle to maintain our investment in Qatar at 12%, rather than the initial we envisioned 20%. We sold an additional 7% of NYSE Liffe U.S. to our partners. And lastly, we are continuing to buy back shares at attractive levels, and we have paid out more than 50% of our earnings year-to-date in dividends. 
Please turn to Slide 5. Slide 5 is a refresher on our strategy compass. Before we dive into the review by segment, I wanted to make sure we remind you of the contacts for the -- context for the different initiatives we have in progress. We talked about this at Investor Day, and we will continue to show you how our activities plot against the areas we have chosen to prioritize in the coming 18 to 24 months. The 6 areas we highlight on Slide 5 will be addressed in the coming slides, and then I'll turn it over to Mike. 
So please turn to Slide 6. On Slide 6, we're going to focus on growth initiatives specific to our Derivatives business. On the upper left-hand quadrant, on July 16, we launched futures trading on DTCC GCF Repo Index on our NYSE Liffe U.S. platform. And just about 2 weeks of trading, open interest across treasury, agency and MBS asset classes has grown to over 15,000 contracts. The fact that the underlying index is based on actual secured interbank financing transactions is a clear differentiator and is aligned with the global regulatory trend of greater transparency for these markets. The launch of this product complements our strategy of continuing to build our interest rate franchise at NYSE Liffe U.S. through innovative approaches to markets. 
In the upper-right quadrant, we highlight the continued strength we have witnessed in our equity options business in the U.S. NYSE Amex registered record-high market share of 15.7% in the second quarter, up 1% from last year and up -- or about the same from Q1. 
On the bottom half of the slide, we highlight current trends in our fixed income and equity Derivatives businesses and new product initiatives. First, in fixed income, the ongoing uncertainty in the Eurozone has driven some higher activity in our U.K.-based products on the Short Sterling side, with those products up 77% since the fourth quarter of last year, which was at a low, and the Long Gilt end, up 9% versus last year. These products are key examples of our diversification and strong position outside the Eurozone. 
On the new product front, given the decrease in hedging and speculation on the short end of the curve, we are actively looking to move along the yield curve to allow us to generate interest rate business in a persistently low interest rate environment. A clear example of this is the recent launch of our mid-curve options products. On July 17, we launched additional mid-curve options on British pound and Euribor products, and through July 30, we have traded nearly 0.75 million contracts with open interest of about 0.25 million contracts. 
Lastly, on our Swapnote product, which has all the characteristics of an OTC swap but is better correlated to the swap curve and is traded in cleared and exchange environment, this product was relaunched with a new market-making program. The Swapnote product addresses both regulatory needs, as well as the new market paradigm of single-government bond curve that doesn't necessarily meet the needs in the current swap market. We believe the growth potential of this product will be strong over time.  
Turning to equities, we've seen a rebound in index futures, and we expect to announce the launch of some new index futures contracts and new country single-stock products later this fall. 
Please turn to Slide 7. On Slide 7, I'm going to walk quickly through the key milestones for establishing our full-service CCP NYSE clearing. There are basically 3 main delivery phases to our clearing strategy. First, with the aforementioned termination notice given to LCH.Clearnet in June, we are on track to establish a full-service CCP by the end of the second quarter of 2013. This will be the trigger for eliminating the payments that we now make to LCH for risk management services. This will also position us to gain new sources of income and better position us for new product and service launches. 
Next, in the third quarter of 2013, we will establish new OTC clearing services to align with the latest regulatory mandates. We'll leverage our existing franchise by offering clearing for closely correlated products to provide our clients with cross-margining opportunities against their already established open interest. 
Third and last, in the first quarter of 2014, we will consolidate all of our European Derivatives into a single CCP. This should bring us incremental clearing fees of about $40 million annually, strengthen our resisting equity Derivatives platform and a single pan-European platform should deliver significant operational benefits to members, not the least of which will be major margin offsets of approximately EUR 1.2 billion, given today's open interest. 
Please turn to Slide 8. On Slide 8, I'm going to focus on key developments in our Cash Trading and Listings business. Again, starting in the upper left, in our European Cash business, we have seen a nice pickup in market share, moving up more than 300 basis points in June. The share gains in the month of June came off the renewal and expansion of our liquidity provider program. This is all part of our focus on market quality, which is attracting new volume and new participants. 
On the upper right, we launched a new and innovative micro structure in our U.S. Cash equities business, which is designed to address the growth of off-exchange volume. This is our effort to help level the playing field through replicating practices that are currently permitted on non-exchange markets. The newly approved Retail Liquidity Program for NYSE and NYSE market allows for price improvement for retail orders within an exchange environment, resulting in real transparent savings for retail investors. Retail order flow represents approximately 10% of the market, and as we all know, most retail orders do not currently make their way to exchanges. We are hopeful that this program will create a more attractive exchange environment for this customer segment and to liquidity providers that would like to interact with it. 
Turning to the lower-left quadrant, as we've mentioned, we closed on the acquisition of Corpedia in June, which is designed to diversify our corporate services offering in the key adjacencies, such as governance, risk and compliance. Corpedia has a deep and diversified client base of more than 500 customers across all verticals, of which about 25% are part of the Fortune 500. The business model has strong cash flow characteristics, limited capital requirements and is supported by favorable regulatory trends, which include intensified regulatory oversight, scrutiny and enforcement. Mike will provide you in his remarks with a sense of the revenue and expenses tied to this new acquisition. 
Lastly, in the lower right quadrant, our Listings franchise is gaining momentum on all fronts. We're winning more than half the technology IPOs year-to-date, and the tech pipeline is even stronger. Of the 8 companies that have moved to the NYSE in 2012, 2 of them were in the top 100 market cap companies listed on our competitor's exchange. Since 2010, a total of 38 companies have transferred to the NYSE, while 14 have transferred away, about a 3:1 win ratio. And as I mentioned earlier, the most encouraging sign is that there are more than 100 companies in the pipeline already filed with NYSE language. As is always the case, market conditions will dictate how many of these companies actually make it to the market, but on the whole, we feel very good about our Listings business where we continue to have many positive conversations with companies across a wide range of industries. 
I'm also pleased to report that the Jobs Act, which we worked so hard on with the Venture Capital Association and others in the industry, has been received very positively by a lot of private companies. And in fact, in my last trip to California, every prospect I talked to said it had changed their thinking on their ability to go public, whether it was the opportunity to file in the early stages confidentially with the SEC and become more transparent when they were ready to do their IPO or whether it was the on-ramp capabilities of having to -- having the opportunity to scale into Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. It's clear that people know we played a significant role in that legislation. They're appreciative of it, and I think it's genuinely making a difference. So we believe that the combination of that, our efficacy efforts, our market model and our service offering will continue to differentiate us globally. 
Lastly on Slide 9, before I turn it over to Mike, just a quick update on our commercial technology business. Financial technology is and will continue to be a critical element in the evolution of the capital markets. So the leadership position that we have achieved and continue to aspire to in this business is important for our future growth regardless of the near-term challenging environment. 
There are several trends which are impacting the business in the near term, as well as that of our peers. First, technology spending in the medium term is either flat or down. As a result, the industry has shifted from a ""build it and they will come"" approach to ""how can we do it cheaper"" approach by costing out their projects. As the technology arms race has cooled with the decrease in trading volumes, technology is increasingly viewed by some as a commodity or an off-the-shelf product firms no longer have to build and house. 
The second trend we see is as trading volumes in the fully electronic markets have declined, we are seeing a greater emphasis on the higher-growth OTC products that are in the midst of a migration to a more electronic-based system. 
Thirdly, the globalization of the technology services phase is continuing. And while we see ourselves as a global leader, there has been a greater focus in Asia where we are in an earlier stage of our growth. 
Fourth, an increasing share of the spend from our customers is defensive, focused on things like regulatory compliance around reporting, compliance and risk management. 
And the last trend, which eventually should be supportive of our business, is the acceleration of more managed services and outsourcing as clients try to manage their overall cost better. 
So while we're clearly in an air pocket, we are doing a lot to actively respond to this challenging environment. First, while we are focused on long-term growth, we cannot lose sight of the short term. So we are reviewing immediate actions we can take to support and run our business more efficiently. 
Next, we are improving our execution capabilities, namely, focusing on our costs, making sure we provide great service to our clients and the highest quality product. 
Lastly, with the acceleration of the market trend toward managed services and outsourcing, we are placing an increased focus on solutions and managed services. I'm happy to report that the managed services pipeline is strong and building. We are in active dialogue with several investment banks, and we are in the process of rolling out several new MTFs, for example. 
We will accomplish this by getting closer to our customers and by having our technology relationship team working together with our markets-focused salespeople. This is exactly what the new organizational construct that I referenced earlier should promote. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike for a review of our financial results, and then I'll wrap up the call before we turn it over to your questions. Go ahead, Mike."
189274,206995777,339473,"NYSE Euronext, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2012",2012-08-03,"Earnings Calls","NYSE Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the second quarter 2012. This quarter there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.49 per share and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.51 per share. In the quarter, we",1900,"Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the second quarter 2012. This quarter there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.49 per share and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.51 per share. In the quarter, we reported a $12 million charge for merger expenses and exit costs. The majority of the charge was related to severance for our Project 14 efficiency effort. Our GAAP results also include a net $2 million loss related to the winding down of our NYSE Blue environmental venture in April. Lastly, our GAAP tax rate of 21% was below our effective rate of 25%, attributed to some onetime benefits realized in the quarter. 
Our review of our financial results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs, disposal activities and discrete tax items. Slide 11 provides a more detailed look at financial results for the quarter. Lower volumes across most of our venues, or particularly, European Derivatives, coupled with a weaker euro, have negatively impacted our financial results versus Q2 2011. That said, Q2 trading volumes increased sequentially for European Derivatives and Europe and U.S. Cash. 
Net revenues of $602 million for the quarter were down 9% year-over-year and increased slightly from Q1 levels. Costs were lower by $23 million or 5% for the quarter and are running $35 million lower year-to-date. For the second quarter, 39% of our operating expenses were denominated in either euros or pounds, 60% in U.S. dollars and another 1% in various Asian currencies. 
We closed the acquisition of Corpedia at the end of the second quarter. We expect this business to generate approximately $7 million in revenue per quarter for the second half of 2012. The effective tax rate was 25% for the quarter, down from 26% in the prior year. The diluted share count was reduced by 6 million shares to 253 million this quarter. The period-end fully diluted share count was 249 million shares. 
Slide 12 provides our consolidated and segment results on a currency-neutral basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened this quarter versus prior year for both the euro and British pounds by 11% and 3%, respectively. For the second quarter, 45% of our net revenues was denominated in either euros or pounds. The currency impact on a net revenue for the quarter was a negative $22 million versus prior year and unfavorable by $3 million versus the previous quarter. Foreign exchange contributed an unfavorable $11 million to operating income this quarter versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, second quarter net revenues were down 6%, and operating income decreased 10% versus the second quarter of 2011. Operationally, revenues for our Derivatives and Cash Trading and Listings businesses decreased 12% and 5%, respectively. Commercial technology revenues were up 2%. 
Slides 13 and 14 detail the financial performance for our Derivatives segment. Derivatives accounted for 30% of our consolidated net revenues and 36% of our operating income. Derivatives net revenues of $182 million in the second quarter was down 15% versus prior year and up 3% sequentially. Despite a sequential quarter increase of 9% in European Derivatives trading volumes and an 8% increase in open interest across the exchange, the environment remains challenging due to our focus on the short end of the yield curve. 
Revenue capture for the quarter was higher for NYSE Liffe versus Q1 and lower compared to the prior-year second quarter. The decline year-over-year was primarily due to a modified pricing in Q4 2011 for the trading of individual equity options and index futures and options on NYSE Liffe Amsterdam and Belgium. The increase compared to Q1 was principally due to a positive mix shift, principally higher sterling futures activity, given continued uncertainty in the Eurozone. 
Capture for the U.S. options business was lower year-over-year but stable on a linked quarter basis. The decline in capture year-over-year was principally due to a few changes in NYSE Arca. NYSE Amex Options notched a quarterly market share record high in the second quarter of nearly 16%. 
We gave LCH.Clearnet notice that we'll be terminating our outsourcing arrangement in June 2013, putting us on track to establish a full-service CCP with NYSE clearing.  This move is expected to save an annualized $30 million. Moving continental clearing to NYSE clearing is targeted for Q1 2014. This will enable us to realize approximately $40 million in annual revenues and traditional derivative clearinghouse margins. 
Similarly, slides 15 and 16 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading and Listings accounted for 50% of our consolidated net revenues and 53% of our operating income in the second quarter. Cash Trading and Listings net revenue was $300 million in the second quarter, down 8% versus the prior-year period and down 1% compared to the first quarter of 2012. Global Listings revenues increased $2 million or 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. 
European Cash ADV of 1.7 million transactions increased 11% from second quarter 2011 levels and increased 8% from the first quarter of 2012. Market share across our 4 primary markets, which excludes off-exchange trading volume, was 66% in the second quarter, down from 71% in the prior year but up from 65% in the first quarter of 2012.  Market share in June was 69%, reflecting strong activity from a revamp supplemental liquidity provider program. 
In U.S. Cash equities, volumes decreased 12% to 1.8 billion shares compared to prior year, but increased 2% in the first quarter 2012 levels. Our market share across all takes increased slightly sequentially but is down 200 basis points year-over-year. Non-exchange traded share, or TRF share, remains elevated at 32% of the U.S. equities market, down from 34% in Q1, but up from 31% in the prior year. In response to the growth in off-exchange trading, we have launched the Retail Liquidity Provider program in Q3, as Duncan discussed earlier. 
Revenue capture for U.S. Cash increased to $0.043 per 100 shares handled for Q2, well above the $0.039 recorded in the second quarter of 2011 and in line with Q1. The 10% increase in capture helped offset the 12% decrease in trading volumes, resulting in a 4% decline in net trading revenues. Revenue capture for European Cash on a per-transaction basis decreased to $0.52 from $0.74 in the second quarter of 2011 and was down from $0.57 in the first quarter of 2012. 
As average daily value traded and the average trade size has decreased, it has resulted in an increase in the number of transactions per day, artificially depressing our revenue capture on a per-transaction basis. While the fee per transaction has decreased 30% year-on-year. In terms of local currency fees and basis points, we're down only 5% year-on-year. The weaker euro and higher mix of volumes from liquidity providers has reduced Q2 capture versus Q1. 
Slide 17 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information and Technology Solutions accounted for 20% of our net revenue and 11% of our operating income in the second quarter of 2012. Segment revenue was $119 million in the second quarter, a decrease of $3 million from Q2 prior year. At constant exchange rates, revenues were up $2 million or 2% on prior year. For the first half of 2012, commercial technology revenues at constant exchange rates were up 4%. 
Our top line growth is below our long-term expectations for this business and reflects a very challenging environment for financial technology spending in the industry. Clients are delaying technology decisions, reducing staff levels, which impacts market data revenues, and the lower volatility and trading environment is impacting co-location connectivity revenues. 
Pipeline for solution and managed service fields are growing. We expect growth to be sluggish for at least one more quarter as we work through this cycle and execute the turnaround plans. 
Margins for the quarter remained at 23% for the second consecutive quarter, below our 26% rate for all of last year. Given lower projected revenue growth this year, we have taken short-term actions to reduce costs for this business and expect segment expenses to be below last year's level for the second half of 2012. 
Slide 18 provides a reconciliation of our underlying cost base and updates our 2012 cost guidance. Costs are below $400 million for the first time in years. Current period expenses of $396 million are rebased to currency rates for our 2012 cost guidance, resulting in a rebased cost base in -- for Q2 2012 of $400 million, $809 million year-to-date. We spent a total of $12 million on growth initiatives during the quarter. This translates to second quarter core expenses of $388 million and $789 million year-to-date. This compares favorably to our prior full year guidance for core expenses. 
We are updating our full year expense guidance for strategic initiative as follows. The acquisition of Corpedia, along with the $14 million of incremental revenue, we expect to incur about $10 million in costs in the second half of 2012. As Duncan mentioned earlier, we have decided not to move forward with the buildout of our contractor differences initiative, so we're no longer including it as a discrete investment. We expect to save $10 million, which we had anticipated spending on this project in 2012. 
NYSE incremental costs in the quarter were $7 million and $11 million year-to-date. As I mentioned, we're now expecting incremental NYSE costs for the full year to be between $5 million and $10 million, reflecting the short-term actions we are taking to reduce costs in the business in the second half and protect margins. This will save about $15 million from prior estimates. 
Our solid expense control in the first half, combined with the anticipated $15 million in discrete initiative savings, will put us on track to be well below our initial cost guidance for reported and core expenses. So we're reviving downward our full year 2012 guidance to be between $1,612 million and $1,617 million on a constant dollar basis, using the rates of $1.35 to the euro, $1.60 to the pounds. We also expect our core expense base to be less than $1,580 million, which is below the low end of our original full year guidance. 
Slide 19 details our cash and debt position as of June 30, 2012. Gross debt at June 30 was $2.3 billion, and there was a little over $400 million cash on the balance sheet, bringing net debt to $1.9 billion. Debt levels increased slightly as we financed the share buyback and acquisition of Corpedia. Our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio increased to 2.1x, reflecting a weak first half for EBITDA. We have agreed in principle with the Qatar Exchange to maintaining our stake at 12%. This will allow us to forgo the 2 remaining $40 million payments. 
Capital expenditures were $41 million in the quarter and $84 million year-to-date, in line with our full year 2012 guidance. The second quarter $2 million of CapEx was related to the buildout of our clearing capability in Europe. 
We executed $177 million of stock repurchase in the second quarter, retiring 6.9 million shares at an average price of $25.60, and year-to-date, we've retired 11.2 million shares. Last week, the board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the second quarter of 2012, which is payable on September 28. 
Now I would like to turn the call back to Duncan for closing remarks."

Before we open it up to questions -- and I realize we've gone on a little longer than we sometimes do, so we'll -- so we hope to wrap this up at 9.

Before we open it up to questions -- and I realize we've gone on a little longer than we sometimes do, so we'll -- so we hope to wrap this up at 9. But if we need to go a few extra minutes, we'll be prepared to do that, and obviously, we'll follow-up with many of you throughout the day. 
So just a few closing remarks before we open up the phone to questions. In summary, we're pleased with the progress we're making on our strategy to create a global capital markets community that empowers our clients to innovate and collaborate. We believe we made a lot of progress in executing against this strategy, and combined with the cost reduction plans we have in place and better management of our capital, we believe that the company is well positioned to return to strong earnings growth in 2013 and beyond. 
And finally, before we get into questions, I think it would be appropriate to comment on the unfortunate situation that occurred this week with Knight Capital. As Knight reported, they incurred a technology issue that caused a routing error involving roughly 140 issues listed on our exchange. As we said Wednesday, the systems here at the NYSE operated and performed normally, and we believe that the human interaction on the floor, as well as some of our liquidity refreshment points that are built in as speed bumps into our model, actually assisted in mitigating this issue to some degree. 
As many of you know, under our rules, we broke trades in a handful of the issues, which were found to be clearly erroneous. And after carefully reviewing the trading issue with the SEC and other market participants, we validated the trades in the remainder of the issues as is mandated under our exchange rules, rules that I would point out are uniform across all exchanges. 
There has been some speculation in the media that this was somehow related to the launch of our RLP program. So let me be clear in saying that it had nothing to do with RLP. As I said a moment ago, RLP enjoyed a successful launch with multiple market participants trading on the new platform with no problems whatsoever. To be clear, the technology specs for this new order type were out in October of last year. We opened for user acceptance testing in January of this year. And even though the rule was just approved, this testing has gone on for months. And we sent notice of the official launch and a reminder of testing in the middle of July, and many market participants have tested with us during those -- during this period of user acceptance testing, including Knight, in fact. 
We will continue to work with the SEC, FINRA and others to the extent we can provide any additional information they may need as we work our way through this issue. I'm happy to take more questions on that if it's relevant in Q&A. 
And with that, we'll open the line for your questions. So, Stephen, back to you."

So let me just give you some additional thoughts, and hopefully, this will address it as much as we're able to today. So firstly, as I said in my remarks, while I don't want to go into too much more detail, I think it's fair to say that the market model we have here helped us flag this issue sooner than I think others would have been able to. So we went to work pretty quickly to dissect what we thought the root cause would be, and within minutes, we were in contact with Knight to begin working through the issue with them. I think subsequent to that, they've clearly articulated what the problem was, and I think that Tom Joyce has handled this rather unfortunate situation as well as he could have, from my point of view, in terms of how he's communicated, how upfront he's been and how accountable he's been. And I think he is to be commended for that. In terms of what -- if you listen to what Knight has said, they publicly stated that the problem was caused cost by a software problem on their side. And I think while it's fair to say that this issue happened to be coincident with the timing of the launch of our RLP program, there is no indication, based on our review and reviews that others have done, that our software had anything to do with the problem. And in fact, as I said in my remarks, several firms have been actively using RLP successfully, and we don't see a problem with the software. In following the procedures that we follow in the aftermath of an issue like this, I think I want to be very clear, we adhered strictly to the provisions of the clearly erroneous rules. Frankly, the way those rules are written, I think, correctly, they don't give exchanges a lot of latitude, and I think market participants agree that, that is more sensible. We coordinated with all the market participants, all the other exchanges and the regulators, and I firmly believe we made the right decision on that. Now at this time, we haven't received any claims relating to this matter, and we don't expect any. But we should be mindful of the fact that the situation is still unfolding. On the bigger issue, I'd say this is yet another instance that highlights the need for reforms in market structure in the United States. We've talked about this publicly, but the growing fragmentation and uneven regulations across what is now hundreds of competing platforms continue to fuel a crisis of confidence among investors. It's just too hard for them to understand how the markets work. As I testified publicly before Congress in June, I believe the time has come for policymakers to address the public concerns. And we fear that quite frankly, there's been too much focus recently on what I would call market microstructure incrementalism, and there hasn't been the right amount of public discourse on what we should really be focused in, which is the reliability and resilience of the markets during crises, during periods of volatility or aberrant behavior, and we should remember that we're here to serve the investors in the broader market, not individual participants or their business models. So I'm sincerely hopeful and of the belief that incidents like this will encourage the regulators to more seriously address these issues, and we've already indicated to the regulators, as we did to Congress in our testimony, that we stand ready to be an active participant in any and all dialogue going forward. So hopefully, that address the details and kind of where we think we might go from here."

As you said -- as you say, Duncan, through no fault of its own, it got more fanfare in its launch, but -- and your other comments about looking at broader market issues. But I know the intention of the program was to bring retail internalized liquidity back to the exchange and back to the lit markets. But it also accomplished, to a lot of surprise, sort of custom segmentation where pricing -- other exchanges are looking at actually segmenting customers and pricing for different customer types. So I guess the point is, do you -- how do you balance that looking at broader market structured issues with now this precedent of segmented pricing by a client type? And then I'd also just love to get a feel for, in this week of retail execution turmoil, how the volumes in there went throughout the week?"

In terms of how -- look, the idea is how are exchanges going to compete with all the other executional offerings that are out of the market, and this is simply one way to do that. In terms of the success of the program, I mean, I think our goals were relatively small this week, notwithstanding the issue the other day, which was -- have a very small controlled rollout. And we focused everyone on 5 stocks. We got a lot of different participants in. We've gotten some good trading through. We've gotten higher than we expected in terms of price improvement. But it's a small sample size, so we're not out -- we're not going to go out there. And I don't think it would be appropriate for us to be tooting our horn one way or the other on this right now, given the larger picture that's going on around us.

We're just trying to have the flexibility to do some of the things that the people with whom we compete do in less transparent venues, and I think this was a step in that direction. As Larry said, it was a pretty soft rollout. This was more to test the -- to kind of validate the concept this week, and we think it's validated. Several participants used it pretty actively, and I think our goal is to have this more broadly rolled out by September. And then we would hope, I think, that no later than the end of the year, we can assess, okay, did this make a difference, what kind of difference did it make and is this the beginning of a bit of a shift in policy, where we're given a little more flexibility than we've been given historically, which all the people with whom we compete outside of the exchange world are able to have today. So I think that's kind of where we hope to go, and we'll obviously report pretty openly on this going forward."

So I'll let Leibo talk in a minute about the -- what we think the potential for the impact of the FTT in France and potentially other markets will be. We'll get to that in a minute. In terms of the market structure, if you go back and reference the commentary that I shared publicly in both our written statement and then my oral remarks in front of Congressman Garrett's committee in the House, I don't think our feelings have changed with the recent event. We just simply think the recent events are another example that the structure that has evolved over the last decade in the U.S. has led to inexorable fragmentation. Really, an emphasis on speed, a feeling that somehow if something can happen faster, it is by definition better. And I think the more of this we see, we're all understanding -- meaning we, market participants and, most importantly, the regulators are understanding that speed is not always better. I think the market structure has gotten incredibly complex. It's virtually impossible to explain to a policymaker or an investor anymore. And I think all we're saying is not that we're trying to go back to the old days, but what we said to our sell-side customers and to the policymakers is it would seem that it's the time for all of us to sit around and acknowledge that whatever has happened -- sure, some good things have happened them. There's no question that spreads are tighter. But let's be honest, spreads are tighter more because of decimalization than because of anything that happened on the regulatory landscape in terms of market structure. When you went to decimals, that obviously made the spreads tighter. So let's acknowledge the victories that we had and the things that made it better for investors, but at the same time, let's have a heavy dose of intellectual honesty and say that no one would look at this rationally and say, ""It's not broke and we shouldn't fix it."" There's clearly some things that need to be examined. Now without getting into details in terms of the 2 or 3 things we'd like to say, because I think they were all on the testimony so I don't need to be redundant, this week's a really interesting example, right. Because we sit here and we see things that are now able to happen, and you take a step back from that and say, ""There must be things we could fix."" For example, we've had a lot of talk in the wake of the flash crash, and I think we're certainly prepared to lead, as we did at that time in convening the various participants around the table to think about what we should do and individual and market-wide circuit breakers were put in place. We were -- we think that's important. It's always been a function of our model. And in fact, our speed bumps are tighter than the circuit breakers that the industry approved. Now I actually think those -- that our individual circuit breakers, which I would reiterate, we have not removed from our model nor do I think we should, I think that mitigated problem -- the problem on Wednesday to some degree, and it would mitigate other problems that could arise like that. So there's an example of where -- I think if we all just sit around and say, ""How do we make it better? How do we reinstill confidence?"" We're not asking to do away with dark pools. We're not asking for everything to come back to the exchange. What we are asking is for people to at least acknowledge this is indescribably complex, and I think it's incumbent on all of us to sit down and see what we can do positively. These things always take longer than we think. But I feel like this latest incident will be a call to action, and we've committed to the regulators that we're prepared to convene the industry and do whatever it takes to come to some consensus around the kind of things that could be done. Leibo, why don't you talk a little bit about the FTT? And I mean, it's early days, but just what we all think about that?"

Well, first, as a context, the new FTT that France has implemented is actually smaller still than the U.K. stamp tax, just to put it in context. And in intention, at the very least, it looks like it's supposed to have similar exemptions. I think one of the things that we have seen is a confusion in the market as to those exemptions, and that has caused some liquidity providers to pull out, at least, temporarily, while they get counsel and get advice on how that's going to happen. And in fact, some of the directives just recently came out. We also saw some confusion, for example, where some custodian banks, who were in the U.S., were saying that they would not support transfer of ownership in French ADRs because they couldn't figure out double taxation and things like that, and we had a fear that we might have to not allow those stocks to trade. Now subsequently, the French government gave relief on that, at least, temporarily. So there's a lot of issues still up in the air. So it's hard to really draw any conclusions from a couple of days of trading. We continue to believe that financial transaction taxes are not the best way to either raise revenues or punish people for things that should -- could be done other ways, and that interfering with a price discovery process is dangerous due to unintended consequences. Nonetheless, we do feel that the impact of this, if we can get the exemptions clarified, certainly in the equities market, we'll be relatively muted."

Obviously, it's early days. So we shouldn't get ahead of our skis here. But I think that if things like -- if the Fed were to do that or Treasury were to issue some notes and use that as an underlying benchmark, we certainly think that would be a good acid test for this. Frankly, we just thought it was a good innovation. And remember, we launched -- we had this on the drawing board before all these questions about the efficacy and accuracy of the derivation of LIBOR as a benchmark. But I mean, let's be a little realistic here, too, right. So we know that LIBOR is deeply embedded in -- and currently very, very important to basically how money markets function around the world. To our best information, there is more than 600 trillion of business tied in some way to a LIBOR benchmark, and some of that goes out for decades. So it's not just as simple, for example, as saying, ""Okay. Don't list any more products tied to some of these underlying benchmarks."" That's easy to say. It is not easy to implement. It is so embedded in how the markets work. So I think what we said to the regulators here and abroad is we're happy to work with them. We're happy to work with the market participants. If people think there should be ways to address the concerns that have been expressed and to be part of implementing some change, whether it's different mechanics, new kinds of innovative products like we just launched, they should consider us to be more than eager to do that. But I think a lot of the participants we've spoken to feel that whether or not LIBOR stays as a standard, which, given all the business that's marked to it, it's going to be hard to see it disappearing overnight. I think they're still inclined to use this because the repo product, at least, for U.S. underliers, I think actually is a better hedge against some of the bespoke swaps people would put on than the -- than euro dollars might enable you to do. So news to come, we're going to be very transparent about the volumes. But given that we're only 2 weeks in, I think we're pretty pleased so far with how we've done."

With respect to Mahwah, when we first opened it, it was a highly closed and limited facility. And I think what we've done is open the facility up for more vendor access, more cross-connect collaboration between vendors and things like that based on customer feedback. I wouldn't expect that, that would have an immediate impact, but that will, over time. What we want to be is the data center of choice for people locating applications, locating significant services, buying market data. And the more we restrict what they can do in that data center, the more you sort of cut them off before they can even get to the place they need to get to. So I think by opening these policies, which we've done both in Basildon and Mahwah, that will significantly help things. It just takes time because it's not like you suddenly make that change and everybody goes, ""Oh, okay, great.""

In terms of our guidance, we have adjusted downward our guidance to sort of low single-digit revenue growth. I mentioned in constant rates, first half, we're at 4%.

Obviously, we're all familiar that the 2 benchmarks are calculated under idiosyncrasies in the -- which the way they're calculated. The investigation to date has been pretty much focused on LIBOR. That's not to say it won't be focused on kind of all these different benchmarks. We're -- we have already been in conversations with the regulators and participants in the U.K. and in the EU. So to the degree we need to develop products that might provide an alternative, as we've been able to do here, we would be prepared to engage in the dialogue on that. But much as I said about LIBOR, this is not something you can change overnight, even if you thought that both of the underlying benchmarks had some idiosyncrasies that were manipulative. So I think we're going to pay very close attention. It is a different process, the way the 2 are calculated. But I don't think we can take 100% comfort from that. That doesn't mean we're not going to engage in the dialogue with the policymakers over there. In fact, we have.

189274,206995777,339667,"NYSE Euronext, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2012",2012-08-03,"Earnings Calls","NYSE Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Stephen. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining the call today. Before I start, I just thought it would make sense to point out that we're having this call at an important time in the markets. I think there's a lot going on, obviously, th",3349,"Thanks, Stephen. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining the call today. Before I start, I just thought it would make sense to point out that we're having this call at an important time in the markets. I think there's a lot going on, obviously, that has broader ramifications. 
So what you'll hear this morning is that what -- that some of our comments will be less focused on our company individually and instead focused on what I'd see as broader industry issues and the longer-term outlook. So to start with, I thought I'd provide some introductory remarks on the operating environment. We'll obviously spend some time reviewing our results for the quarter, and then Mike and I will update you, in each of our businesses, on kind of where we see things going and what the trajectory looks like. 
Now as many of you know, in my role, I have the opportunity to do a lot of traveling, and I have the privilege of getting to meet with corporate leaders and government leaders around the world on a pretty regular basis. And as you would expect, what I'm asking them about these days is what do they think about the outlook for the operating environment, the global economy, et cetera. And it won't surprise any of you that to a person, everyone's talking about the tremendous and continuing uncertainty in the underlying foundation, and whether -- that's whether you talk about the political landscape, the economic landscape, et cetera. 
Now I then ask people, what do they think about the likely length of this uncertainty and the softness in the global economy? And I think that general consensus is that most people would envision the state we're in persisting for at least the balance of this year and most people think it's going to extend through the end of next year at a minimum. 
So what does that mean? That means that, as we're seeing now, a lot of money is sitting on the sidelines. Volumes are obviously muted. Technology spending is on hold, if not down, and many of our competitors and, more importantly, our customers are grappling with their business models. So I think what we have to do as a company is then take a step back and say, ""Does this current climate present an opportunity to focus the company for growth when the macro environment turns to whatever the new -- returns to whatever the new normal will be?"" 
So I think what we'll talk about this morning is to just update you on the progress we believe we made during the quarter in our 3 pillars of growth and delivering against the commitments that we laid out earlier in the year, all tied to what we call Project 14. We remain focused on this long-term plan and setting the table for growth, but we're not going to focus, given that we don't control the macro environment or volumes or currency rates, we are not going to focus on quarter-by-quarter results, which we all understand are largely a function of that global macro environment and the underlying uncertainty that we're seeing from a lot of investors. 
So what have we been doing? We've been bringing to market new initiatives. We're focusing on organizational efficiency, and we are being as agile as we can as we deploy our capital more efficiently for the benefit of all of our shareholders. 
So let me start by mentioning a few specific things that we did get done since we last spoke to all of you. In June, we announced the new internal organizational construct that will create teams centered around products and clients. The goal of this organizational change is not just change for the sake of change, but it is to get closer to our customers, focus our company more on product innovation and do that more nimbly and make better use of our global shared service functions. 
The product groups we've set up will consist of specialists organized to focus on their respective areas of expertise, underpinned by a generalist sales force that will be responsible for cross-selling the full array of transaction and technology products and services we offer to all of our clients. To alleviate a potential concern, we do not envision, nor do we have any plans to change how we report our businesses externally, but we think this new internal structure will foster more collaboration and eliminate some silos that I think had inadvertently developed. 
We also took a major step this quarter in creating a full service CCP, NYSE Clearing, by giving official notice of termination to LCH. I'll talk about that more in my comments later. We had several new product launches for NYSE Liffe U.S., which we anticipate will drive further growth. We're excited about the acquisition of Corpedia, which supports our corporate services business and is an entry into the fast-growing areas of governance, risk and compliance. 
In our Listings franchise, we continue to experience very positive momentum, whether you measure that in terms of discussions with clients, prospects across all industries, in particular, Silicon Valley, after the events of this past spring. Our market model and IPO process speak for themselves. Our customers are eager to become references for us. And with over 100 companies in the pipeline, we are pleased with how this Listings business is positioned going forward. 
Lastly, as you'll hear this morning, we've made excellent progress on Project 14 cost-savings exercise, and we are continuing to buy back stock at what we think will prove to be attractive levels. 
The low trading environment and the weaker euro this year is shrouding what we believe is excellent progress that we're making. But as we enter 2013, the tangible benefits of all the work we've been doing should begin to accrue with a return to earnings growth next year. 
With that as an introduction for the quarter, we recorded EPS of $0.51 a share on revenue of just over $600 million, down from $0.61 per share on $661 million in revenue in this quarter last year. Cost discipline continued in the quarter with costs down 5% year-on-year on a reported and constant dollar/constant portfolio basis. The excellent work that the team has done will now allow us to exceed our previously stated cost guidance. 
As we move into Q3, we continue to battle the macro headwinds that are dampening volatility and reducing volumes. We will do this by focusing on our new growth initiatives, accelerating cost savings and continuing to deploy capital in a disciplined way to reduce our share count. 
Please turn to Slide 4. Slide 4 illustrates the strong progress that we are making in executing against our strategy. On the growth side of the ledger, we have several initiatives that are in progress and a number that have been completed, which we believe will yield return on our investment regardless of how the market environment evolves. 
To drive our future growth, we are on track to launch a full-service CCP in June of next year. We are launching new products across our Derivatives franchise. We have implemented a new and innovative market structure with our RLP program, and we acquired Corpedia to bolster our corporate services business. We have also realigned our client-facing and product teams, as I alluded to earlier. 
And on the efficiency front, we continue to show cost discipline as illustrated by our results. We have eliminated several senior management positions. We have notified LCH of our intention to fully insource clearing. We are looking at options to reduce our global real estate footprint and further streamline our technology costs. 
In addition, we continue to look for opportunities to rationalize the portfolio. We recently unwound NYSE Blue, and we have made the decision to terminate our CFD initiative. Given our priorities with clearing, our organizational realignment, the ongoing macro headwinds and dampening client demand for CFDs, we've decided not to move ahead with this investment that we envisioned in retail CFDs. We were in the early stages of a multiyear investment, and I believe this decision evidences our ability to be flexible, focused and disciplined when it comes to capital allocation. 
Lastly, on the capital front, we have an agreement in principle to maintain our investment in Qatar at 12%, rather than the initially envisioned 20%. We sold an additional 7% of NYSE Liffe U.S. to our partners. And lastly, we are continuing to buy back shares at attractive levels, and we have paid out more than 50% of our earnings year-to-date in dividends. 
Please turn to Slide 5. Slide 5 is a refresher on our strategy compass. Before we dive into the review by segment, I wanted to make sure we remind you of the context for the different initiatives we have in progress. We talked about this at Investor Day, and we will continue to show you how our activities plot against the areas we have chosen to prioritize in the coming 18 to 24 months. The 6 areas we highlight on Slide 5 will be addressed in the coming slides, and then I'll turn it over to Mike. 
So please turn to Slide 6. On Slide 6, we're going to focus on growth initiatives specific to our Derivatives business. In the upper left-hand quadrant, on July 16, we launched futures trading on DTCC GCF Repo Index on our NYSE Liffe U.S. platform. And just about 2 weeks of trading, open interest across treasury, agency and MBS asset classes has grown to over 15,000 contracts. The fact that the underlying index is based on actual secured interbank financing transactions is a clear differentiator and is aligned with the global regulatory trend of greater transparency for these markets. The launch of this product complements our strategy of continuing to build our interest rate franchise at NYSE Liffe U.S. through innovative approaches to markets. 
In the upper-right quadrant, we highlight the continued strength we have witnessed in our equity options business in the U.S. NYSE Amex registered record-high market share of 15.7% in the second quarter, up 1% from last year and up about the same from Q1. 
On the bottom half of the slide, we highlight current trends in our fixed income and equity Derivatives businesses and new product initiatives. First, in fixed income, the ongoing uncertainty in the Eurozone has driven some higher activity in our U.K.-based products on the Short Sterling side, with those products up 77% since the fourth quarter of last year, which was at a low, and the Long Gilt end, up 9% versus last year. These products are key examples of our diversification and strong position outside the Eurozone. 
On the new product front, given the decrease in hedging and speculation on the short end of the curve, we are actively looking to move along the yield curve to allow us to generate interest rate business in a persistently low interest rate environment. A clear example of this is the recent launch of our mid-curve options products. On July 17, we launched additional mid-curve options on British pound and Euribor products, and through July 30, they have traded nearly 0.75 million contracts with open interest of about 0.25 million contracts. 
Lastly, on our Swapnote product, which has all the characteristics of an OTC swap but is better correlated to the swap curve and is traded and cleared in an exchange environment, this product was relaunched with a new market-making program. The Swapnote product addresses both regulatory needs, as well as the new market paradigm of single-government bond curve that doesn't necessarily meet the needs of the current swap market. We believe the growth potential of this product will be strong over time.  
Turning to equities, we've seen a rebound in index futures, and we expect to announce the launch of some new index futures contracts and new country single-stock products later this fall. 
Please turn to Slide 7. On Slide 7, I'm going to walk quickly through the key milestones for establishing our full-service CCP NYSE clearing. There are basically 3 main delivery phases to our clearing strategy. First, with the aforementioned termination notice given to LCH.Clearnet in June, we are on track to establish a full-service CCP by the end of the second quarter of 2013. This will be the trigger for eliminating the payments that we now make to LCH for risk management services. This will also position us to gain new sources of income and better position us for new product and service launches. 
Next, in the third quarter of 2013, we will establish new OTC clearing services to align with the latest regulatory mandates. We'll leverage our existing franchise by offering clearing for closely correlated products to provide our clients with cross-margining opportunities against their already established open interest. 
Third and last, in the first quarter of 2014, we will consolidate all of our European Derivatives into a single CCP. This should bring us incremental clearing fees of about $40 million annually, strengthen our existing equity Derivatives platform and a single pan-European platform should deliver significant operational benefits to members, not the least of which will be major margin offsets of approximately EUR 1.2 billion, given today's open interest. 
Please turn to Slide 8. On Slide 8, I'm going to focus on key developments in our Cash Trading and Listings business. Again, starting in the upper left, in our European Cash business, we have seen a nice pickup in market share, moving up more than 300 basis points in June. The share gains in the month of June came off the renewal and expansion of our liquidity provider program. This is all part of our focus on market quality, which is attracting new volume and new participants. 
On the upper right, we launched a new and innovative micro structure in our U.S. Cash equities business, which is designed to address the growth of off-exchange volume. This was our effort to help level the playing field through replicating practices that are currently permitted on non-exchange markets. The newly approved Retail Liquidity Program for NYSE and NYSE market allows for price improvement for retail orders within an exchange environment, resulting in real transparent savings for retail investors. Retail order flow represents approximately 10% of the market, and as we all know, most retail orders do not currently make their way to exchanges. We are hopeful that this program will create a more attractive exchange environment for this customer segment and the liquidity providers that would like to interact with it. 
Turning to the lower-left quadrant, as we've mentioned, we closed on the acquisition of Corpedia in June, which is designed to diversify our corporate services offering into key adjacencies, such as governance, risk and compliance. Corpedia has a deep and diversified client base of more than 500 customers across all verticals, of which about 25% are part of the Fortune 500. The business model has strong cash flow characteristics, limited capital requirements and is supported by favorable regulatory trends, which include intensified regulatory oversight, scrutiny and enforcement. Mike will provide you in his remarks with a sense of the revenue and expenses tied to this new acquisition. 
Lastly, in the lower-right quadrant, our Listings franchise is gaining momentum on all fronts. We're winning more than half the technology IPOs year-to-date, and the tech pipeline is even stronger. Of the 8 companies that have moved to the NYSE in 2012, 2 of them were in the top 100 market cap companies listed on our competitor's exchange. Since 2010, a total of 38 companies have transferred to the NYSE, while 14 have transferred away, about a 3:1 win ratio. And as I mentioned earlier, the most encouraging sign is that there are more than 100 companies in the pipeline already filed with NYSE language. As is always the case, market conditions will dictate how many of these companies actually make it to the market, but on the whole, we feel very good about our Listings business where we continue to have many positive conversations with companies across a wide range of industries. 
I'm also pleased to report that the Jobs Act, which we worked so hard on with the Venture Capital Association and others in the industry, has been received very positively by a lot of private companies. And in fact, in my last trip to California, every prospect I talked to said it had changed their thinking on their ability to go public, whether it was the opportunity to file in the early stages confidentially with the SEC and become more transparent when they were ready to do their IPO or whether it was the on-ramp capabilities of having to -- having the opportunity to scale into Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. It's clear that people know we played a significant role in that legislation. They're appreciative of it, and I think it's genuinely making a difference. So we believe that the combination of that, our efficacy efforts, our market model and our service offering will continue to differentiate us globally. 
Lastly on Slide 9, before I turn it over to Mike, just a quick update on our commercial technology business. Financial technology is and will continue to be a critical element in the evolution of the capital markets. So the leadership position that we have achieved and continue to aspire to in this business is important for our future growth regardless of the near-term challenging environment. 
There are several trends which are impacting the business in the near term, as well as that of our peers. First, technology spending in the medium term is either flat or down. As a result, the industry has shifted from a ""build it and they will come"" approach to ""how can we do it cheaper"" approach by costing out their projects. As the technology arms race has cooled with the decrease in trading volumes, technology is increasingly viewed by some as a commodity or an off-the-shelf product firms no longer have to build and house. 
The second trend we see is as trading volumes in the fully electronic markets have declined, we are seeing a greater emphasis on the higher-growth OTC products that are in the midst of a migration to a more electronic-based system. 
Thirdly, the globalization of the technology services space is continuing. And while we see ourselves as a global leader, there has been a greater focus in Asia where we are in an earlier stage of our growth. 
Fourth, an increasing share of the spend from our customers is defensive, focused on things like regulatory compliance around reporting, compliance and risk management. 
And the last trend, which eventually should be supportive of our business, is the acceleration of more managed services and outsourcing as clients try to manage their overall costs better. 
So while we're clearly in an air pocket, we are doing a lot to actively respond to this challenging environment. First, while we are focused on long-term growth, we cannot lose sight of the short term. So we are reviewing immediate actions we can take to support and run our business more efficiently. 
Next, we are improving our execution capabilities, namely, focusing on our costs, making sure we provide great service to our clients and the highest quality product. 
Lastly, with the acceleration of the market trend toward managed services and outsourcing, we are placing an increased focus on solutions and managed services. I'm happy to report that the managed services pipeline is strong and building. We are in active dialogue with several investment banks, and we are in the process of rolling out several new MTFs, for example. 
We will accomplish this by getting closer to our customers and by having our technology relationship team working together with our markets-focused salespeople. This is exactly what the new organizational construct that I referenced earlier should promote. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike for a review of our financial results, and then I'll wrap up the call before we turn it over to your questions. Go ahead, Mike."
189274,206995777,339667,"NYSE Euronext, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2012",2012-08-03,"Earnings Calls","NYSE Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the second quarter 2012. This quarter there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.49 per share and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.51 per share. In the quarter, we",1901,"Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the second quarter 2012. This quarter there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.49 per share and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.51 per share. In the quarter, we reported a $12 million charge for merger expenses and exit costs. The majority of the charge was related to severance for our Project 14 efficiency effort. Our GAAP results also include a net $2 million loss related to the winding down of our NYSE Blue environmental venture in April. Lastly, our GAAP tax rate of 21% was below our effective rate of 25%, attributed to some onetime benefits realized in the quarter. 
Our review of our financial results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs, disposal activities and discrete tax items. Slide 11 provides a more detailed look at financial results for the quarter. Lower volumes across most of our venues, or particularly, European Derivatives, coupled with a weaker euro, have negatively impacted our financial results versus Q2 2011. That said, Q2 trading volumes increased sequentially for European Derivatives and Europe and U.S. Cash. 
Net revenues of $602 million for the quarter were down 9% year-over-year and increased slightly from Q1 levels. Costs were lower by $23 million or 5% for the quarter and are running $35 million lower year-to-date. For the second quarter, 39% of our operating expenses were denominated in either euros or pounds, 60% in U.S. dollars and another 1% in various Asian currencies. 
We closed the acquisition of Corpedia at the end of the second quarter. We expect this business to generate approximately $7 million in revenue per quarter for the second half of 2012. The effective tax rate was 25% for the quarter, down from 26% in the prior year. The diluted share count was reduced by 6 million shares to 253 million this quarter. The period-end fully diluted share count was 249 million shares. 
Slide 12 provides our consolidated and segment results on a currency-neutral basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened this quarter versus prior year for both the euro and British pounds by 11% and 3%, respectively. For the second quarter, 45% of our net revenues was denominated in either euros or pounds. The currency impact on net revenue for the quarter was a negative $22 million versus prior year and unfavorable by $3 million versus the previous quarter. Foreign exchange contributed an unfavorable $11 million to operating income this quarter versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, second quarter net revenues were down 6%, and operating income decreased 10% versus the second quarter of 2011. Operationally, revenues for our Derivatives and Cash Trading and Listings businesses decreased 12% and 5%, respectively. Commercial technology revenues were up 2%. 
Slides 13 and 14 detail the financial performance for our Derivatives segment. Derivatives accounted for 30% of our consolidated net revenues and 36% of our operating income. Derivatives net revenues of $182 million in the second quarter was down 15% versus prior year, but up 3% sequentially. Despite a sequential quarter increase of 9% in European Derivatives trading volumes and an 8% increase in open interest across the exchange, the environment remains challenging due to our focus on the short end of the yield curve. 
Revenue capture for the quarter was higher for NYSE Liffe versus Q1, but  lower compared to the prior-year second quarter. The decline year-over-year was primarily due to a modified pricing in Q4 2011 for the trading of individual equity options and index futures and options on NYSE Liffe Amsterdam and Belgium. The increase compared to Q1 was principally due to a positive mix shift, principally higher sterling futures activity, given continued uncertainty in the Eurozone. 
Capture for the U.S. options business was lower year-over-year but stable on a linked quarter basis. The decline in capture year-over-year was principally due to a few changes at NYSE Arca. NYSE Amex Options notched a quarterly market share record high in the second quarter of nearly 16%. 
We gave LCH.Clearnet notice that we'll be terminating our outsourcing arrangement in June 2013, putting us on track to establish a full-service CCP  called NYSE Clearing.  This move is expected to save an annualized $30 million. Moving continental clearing to NYSE clearing is targeted for Q1 2014. This will enable us to realize approximately $40 million in annual revenues and traditional derivative clearinghouse margins. 
Similarly, Slides 15 and 16 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading and Listings accounted for 50% of our consolidated net revenues and 53% of our operating income in the second quarter. Cash Trading and Listings net revenue was $300 million in the second quarter, down 8% versus the prior-year period and down 1% compared to the first quarter of 2012. Global Listings revenues increased $2 million or 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. 
European Cash ADV of 1.7 million transactions increased 11% from second quarter 2011 levels and increased 8% from the first quarter of 2012. Market share across our 4 primary markets, which excludes off-exchange trading volume, was 66% in the second quarter, down from 71% in the prior year but up from 65% in the first quarter of 2012.  Market share in June was 69%, reflecting strong activity from a revamped supplemental liquidity provider program. 
In U.S. Cash equities, volumes decreased 12% to 1.8 billion shares compared to prior year, but increased 2% from the first quarter 2012 levels. Our market share across all takes increased slightly sequentially but is down 200 basis points year-over-year. Non-exchange traded share, or TRF share, remains elevated at 32% of the U.S. equities market, down from 34% in Q1, but up from 31% in the prior year. In response to the growth in off-exchange trading, we have launched the Retail Liquidity Provider program in Q3, as Duncan discussed earlier. 
Revenue capture for U.S. Cash increased to $0.043 per 100 shares handled for Q2, well above the $0.039 recorded in the second quarter of 2011 and in line with Q1. The 10% increase in capture helped offset the 12% decrease in trading volumes, resulting in a 4% decline in net trading revenues. Revenue capture for European Cash on a per-transaction basis decreased to $0.52 from $0.74 in the second quarter of 2011 and was down from $0.57 in the first quarter of 2012. 
As average daily value traded and the average trade size has decreased, it has resulted in an increase in the number of transactions per day, artificially depressing our revenue capture on a per-transaction basis. While the fee per transaction has decreased 30% year-on-year, in terms of local currency fees and basis points, we're down only 5% year-on-year. The weaker euro and higher mix of volumes from liquidity providers has reduced Q2 capture versus Q1. 
Slide 17 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information and Technology Solutions accounted for 20% of our net revenue and 11% of our operating income in the second quarter of 2012. Segment revenue was $119 million in the second quarter, a decrease of $3 million from Q2 prior year. At constant exchange rates, revenues were up $2 million or 2% on prior year. For the first half of 2012, commercial technology revenues at constant exchange rates were up 4%. 
Our top line growth is below our long-term expectations for this business and reflects a very challenging environment for financial technology spending in the industry. Clients are delaying technology decisions, reducing staff levels, which impacts market data revenues, and the lower volatility and trading environment is impacting co-location connectivity revenues. 
Pipeline for solution and managed service fields are growing. We expect growth to be sluggish for at least one more quarter as we work through this cycle and execute the turnaround plans. 
Margins for the quarter remained at 23% for the second consecutive quarter, below our 26% rate for all of last year. Given lower projected revenue growth this year, we have taken short-term actions to reduce costs for this business and expect segment expenses to be below last year's level for the second half of 2012. 
Slide 18 provides a reconciliation of our underlying cost base and updates our 2012 cost guidance. Costs are below $400 million for the first time in years. Current period expenses of $396 million are rebased to currency rates for our 2012 cost guidance, resulting in a rebased cost base in -- for Q2 2012 of $400 million, $809 million year-to-date. We spent a total of $12 million on growth initiatives during the quarter. This translates to second quarter core expenses of $388 million and $789 million year-to-date. This compares favorably to our prior full year guidance for core expenses. 
We are updating our full year expense guidance for strategic initiative as follows. With the acquisition of Corpedia, along with the $14 million of incremental revenue, we expect to incur about $10 million in costs in the second half of 2012. As Duncan mentioned earlier, we have decided not to move forward with the buildout of our contractor differences initiative, so we're no longer including it as a discrete investment. We expect to save $10 million, which we had anticipated spending on this project in 2012. 
NYSE incremental costs in the quarter were $7 million and $11 million year-to-date. As I mentioned, we're now expecting incremental NYSE costs for the full year to be between $5 million and $10 million, reflecting the short-term actions we are taking to reduce costs in the business in the second half and protect margins. This will save about $15 million from prior estimates. 
Our solid expense control in the first half, combined with the anticipated $15 million in discrete initiative savings, will put us on track to be well below our initial cost guidance for reported and core expenses. So we're revising downward our full year 2012 guidance to be between $1,612 million and $1,617 million on a constant dollar basis, using the rates of $1.35 to the euro, $1.60 to the pounds. We also expect our core expense base to be less than $1,580 million, which is below the low end of our original full year guidance. 
Slide 19 details our cash and debt position as of June 30, 2012. Gross debt at June 30 was $2.3 billion, and there was a little over $400 million in cash on the balance sheet, bringing net debt to $1.9 billion. Debt levels increased slightly as we financed the share buyback and acquisition of Corpedia. Our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio increased to 2.1x, reflecting a weak first half for EBITDA. We have agreed in principle with the Qatar Exchange to maintaining our stake at 12%. This will allow us to forgo the 2 remaining $40 million payments. 
Capital expenditures were $41 million in the quarter and $84 million year-to-date, in line with our full year 2012 guidance. The second quarter $2 million of CapEx was related to the buildout of our clearing capability in Europe. 
We executed $177 million of stock repurchase in the second quarter, retiring 6.9 million shares at an average price of $25.60, and year-to-date, we've retired 11.2 million shares. Last week, the board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the second quarter of 2012, which is payable on September 28. 
Now I would like to turn the call back to Duncan for closing remarks."
189274,206995777,339667,"NYSE Euronext, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2012",2012-08-03,"Earnings Calls","NYSE Holdings LLC","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Mike. Before we open it up to questions, and I realize we've gone on a little longer than we sometimes do, so we'll -- so we hope to wrap this up at 9:00. But if we need to go a few extra minutes, we'll be prepared to do that, and obviously,",516,"Okay. Thanks, Mike. Before we open it up to questions, and I realize we've gone on a little longer than we sometimes do, so we'll -- so we hope to wrap this up at 9:00. But if we need to go a few extra minutes, we'll be prepared to do that, and obviously, we'll follow-up with many of you throughout the day. 
So just a few closing remarks before we open up the phone to questions. In summary, we're pleased with the progress we're making on our strategy to create a global capital markets community that empowers our clients to innovate and collaborate. We believe we've made a lot of progress in executing against this strategy, and combined with the cost reduction plans we have in place and better management of our capital, we believe that the company is well positioned to return to strong earnings growth in 2013 and beyond. 
And finally, before we get into questions, I think it would be appropriate to comment on the unfortunate situation that occurred this week with Knight Capital. As Knight reported, they incurred a technology issue that caused a routing error involving roughly 140 issues listed on our exchange. As we said Wednesday, the systems here at the NYSE operated and performed normally, and we believe that the human interaction on the floor, as well as some of our liquidity refreshment points that are built in as speed bumps into our model, actually assisted in mitigating this issue to some degree. 
As many of you know, under our rules, we broke trades in a handful of the issues, which were found to be clearly erroneous. And after carefully reviewing the trading issue with the SEC and other market participants, we validated the trades in the remainder of the issues as is mandated under our exchange rules, rules that I would point out are uniform across all exchanges. 
There has been some speculation in the media that this was somehow related to the launch of our RLP program. So let me be clear in saying that it had nothing to do with RLP. As I said a moment ago, RLP enjoyed a successful launch with multiple market participants trading on the new platform with no problems whatsoever. To be clear, the technology specs for this new order type were out in October of last year. We opened for user acceptance testing in January of this year. And even though the rule was just approved, this testing's gone on for months. And we sent notice of the official launch and a reminder of testing in the middle of July, and many market participants have tested with us during those -- during this period of user acceptance testing, including Knight, in fact. 
We will continue to work with the SEC, FINRA and others to the extent we can provide any additional information they may need as we work our way through this issue. Happy to take more questions on that if it's relevant in Q&A. 
And with that, we'll open the line for your questions. So Stephen, back to you."

So let me just give you some additional thoughts, and hopefully, this will address it as much as we're able to today. So firstly, as I said in my remarks, while I don't want to go into too much more detail, I think it's fair to say that the market model we have here helped us flag this issue sooner than I think others would have been able to. So we went to work pretty quickly to dissect what we thought the root cause would be, and within minutes, we were in contact with Knight to begin working through the issue with them. I think subsequent to that, they've clearly articulated what the problem was, and I think Tom Joyce has handled this rather unfortunate situation as well as he could have, from my point of view, in terms of how he's communicated, how upfront he's been and how accountable he's been. And I think he's to be commended for that. In terms of what -- if you listen to what Knight has said, they publicly stated that the problem was caused cost by a software problem on their side. And I think while it's fair to say that this issue happened to be coincident with the timing of the launch of our RLP program, there is no indication, based on our review and reviews that others have done, that our software had anything to do with the problem. And in fact, as I said in my remarks, several firms have been actively using RLP successfully, and we don't see a problem with the software. In following the procedures that we follow in the aftermath of an issue like this, I think I want to be very clear, we adhered strictly to the provisions of the clearly erroneous rules. Frankly, the way those rules are written, I think correctly, they don't give exchanges a lot of latitude, and I think market participants agree that, that is more sensible. We coordinated with all the market participants, all the other exchanges and the regulators, and I firmly believe we made the right decision on that. Now at this time, we haven't received any claims relating to this matter, and we don't expect any. But we should be mindful of the fact that the situation is still unfolding. On the bigger issue, I'd say this is yet another instance that highlights the need for reforms in market structure in the United States. We've talked about this publicly, that the growing fragmentation and uneven regulations across what is now hundreds of competing platforms continue to fuel a crisis of confidence among investors. It's just too hard for them to understand how the markets work. As I testified publicly before Congress in June, I believe the time has come for policymakers to address the public concerns. And we fear that quite frankly, there's been too much focus recently on what I would call market microstructure incrementalism, and there hasn't been the right amount of public discourse on what we should really be focused in, which is the reliability and resilience of the markets during crises, during periods of volatility or aberrant behavior, and we should remember that we're here to serve the investors in the broader market, not individual participants or their business models. So I'm sincerely hopeful and of the belief that incidents like this will encourage the regulators to more seriously address these issues, and we've already indicated to the regulators, as we did to Congress in our testimony, that we stand ready to be an active participant in any and all dialogue going forward. So hopefully, that address the details and kind of where we think we might go from here."

But I know the intention of the program was to bring retail internalized liquidity back to the exchange and back to the lit markets. But it also accomplished, to a lot of surprise, sort of custom segmentation where pricing -- other exchanges are looking at actually segmenting customers and pricing for different customer types. So I guess the point is, do you -- how do you balance that looking at broader market structured issues with now this precedent of segmented pricing by a client type?

In terms of how -- look, the idea is how are exchanges going to compete with all the other execution offerings that are out of the market, and this is simply one way to do that. In terms of the success of the program, I mean, I think our goals were relatively small this week, notwithstanding the issue the other day, which was have a very small controlled rollout. And we focused everyone on 5 stocks. We got a lot of different participants in. We've gotten some good trading through. We've gotten higher than we expected in terms of price improvement. But it's a small sample size, so we're not out --  not going to go out there, and I don't think it would be appropriate for us to be tooting our horn one way or the other on this right now, given the larger picture that's going on around us.

As Larry said, it was a pretty soft rollout. This was more to test the -- to kind of validate the concept this week, and we think it's validated. Several participants used it pretty actively, and I think our goal is to have this more broadly rolled out by September. And then we would hope, I think, that no later than the end of the year, we can assess, okay, did this make a difference, what kind of differences did it make and is this the beginning of a bit of a shift in policy, where we're given a little more flexibility than we've been given historically, which all the people with whom we compete outside of the exchange world are able to have today.

So I'll let Leibo talk in a minute about what we think the potential for the impact of the FTT in France and potentially other markets will be. We'll get to that in a minute. In terms of the market structure, if you go back and reference the commentary that I shared publicly in both our written statement and then my oral remarks in front of Congressman Garrett's committee in the House, I don't think our feelings have changed with the recent events. We just simply think the recent events are another example that the structure that has evolved over the last decade in the U.S. has led to inexorable fragmentation. Really, an emphasis on speed, a feeling that somehow if something can happen faster, it is by definition better. And I think the more of this we see, we're all understanding -- meaning we, market participants and, most importantly, the regulators are understanding that speed is not always better. I think the market structure has gotten incredibly complex. It's virtually impossible to explain to a policymaker or an investor anymore. And I think all we're saying is not that we're trying to go back to the old days, but what we said to our sell-side customers and to the policymakers is it would seem that it's a time for all of us to sit around and acknowledge that whatever's happened -- sure, some good things have happened them. There's no question that spreads are tighter. But let's be honest, spreads are tighter more because of decimalization than because of anything that happened on the regulatory landscape in terms of market structure. When you went to decimals, that obviously made the spreads tighter. So let's acknowledge the victories that we've had and the things that made it better for investors, but at the same time, let's have a heavy dose of intellectual honesty and say that no one would look at this rationally and say, ""It's not broke and we shouldn't fix it."" There's clearly some things that need to be examined. Now without getting into details in terms of the 2 or 3 things we'd like to see, because I think they were all in the testimony so I don't need to be redundant, this week's a really interesting example, right. Because we sit here and we see things that are now able to happen, and you take a step back from that and say, ""There must be things we could fix."" For example, we've had a lot of talk in the wake of the flash crash, and I think we're certainly prepared to lead, as we did at that time in convening the various participants around the table to think about what we should do and individual and market-wide circuit breakers were put in place. Okay? We were -- we think that's important. It's always been a function of our model. And in fact, our speed bumps are tighter than the circuit breakers that the industry approves. Now I actually think those -- that our individual circuit breakers, which I would reiterate, we have not removed from our model nor do I think we should, I think that mitigated problems -- the problem on Wednesday to some degree, and it would mitigate other problems that could arise like that. So there's an example of where I think if we all just sit around and say, ""How do we make it better? How do we re-instill confidence?"" We're not asking to do away with dark pools. We're not asking for everything to come back to the exchange. What we are asking is for people to at least acknowledge this is indescribably complex, and I think it's incumbent on all of us to sit down and see what we can do positively. These things always take longer than we think. But I feel like this latest incident will be a call to action, and we've committed to the regulators that we're prepared to convene the industry and do whatever it takes to come to some consensus around the kind of things that could be done. Leibo, why don't you talk a little bit about the FTT? And I mean, it's early days, but just what we think about that?"

Well, first, as a context, the new FTT that France has implemented is actually smaller still than the U.K. stamp tax, just to put it in context. And in intention, at the very least, it looks like it's supposed to have similar exemptions. I think one of the things that we have seen is a confusion in the market as to those exemptions, and that has caused some liquidity providers to pull out, at least temporarily, while they get counsel and get advice on how that's going to happen. And in fact, some of the directives just recently came out. We also saw some confusion, for example, where some custodian banks were in the U.S., were saying that they would not support transfer of ownership in French ADRs because they couldn't figure out double taxation and things like that, and we had a fear that we might have to not allow those stocks to trade. Now subsequently, the French government gave relief on that, at least, temporarily. So there's a lot of issues still up in the air. So it's hard to really draw any conclusions from a couple days of trading. We continue to believe that financial transaction taxes are not the best way to either raise revenues or punish people for things that should -- could be done other ways, and that interfering with the price discovery process is dangerous due to unintended consequences. Nonetheless, we do feel that the impact of this, if we can get the exemptions clarified, certainly in the equities market, would be relatively muted."

But I think that if things like -- if the Fed were to do that or Treasury were to issue some notes and use that as an underlying benchmark, we certainly think that would be a good acid test for this. Frankly, we just thought it was a good innovation. And remember, we launched -- we had this on the drawing board before all these questions about the efficacy and accuracy of the derivation of LIBOR as a benchmark. But I mean, let's be a little realistic here, too, right. So we know that LIBOR is deeply embedded in -- and currently very, very important to basically how money markets function around the world. To our best information, there is more than $600 trillion of business tied in some way to a LIBOR benchmark, and some of that goes out for decades. So it's not just as simple, for example, as saying, ""Okay. Don't list any more products tied to some of these underlying benchmarks."" That's easy to say. It is not easy to implement. It is so embedded in how the markets work. So I think what we've said to the regulators here and abroad is we're happy to work with them. We're happy to work with their market participants. If people think there should be ways to address the concerns that have been expressed and to be part of implementing some change, whether it's different mechanics, new kinds of innovative products like we just launched, they should consider us to be more than eager to do that. But I think a lot of the participants we've spoken to feel that whether or not LIBOR stays as a standard, which given all the business that's marked to it, it's going to be hard to see it disappearing overnight. I think they're still inclined to use this because the repo product, at least for U.S. underliers, I think actually is a better hedge against some of the bespoke swaps people would put on than the -- than euro dollars might enable you to do. So news to come, we're going to be very transparent about the volumes. But given that we're only 2 weeks in, I think we're pretty pleased so far with how we've done."

So as we've mentioned, the managed services and solutions part of the business is the fastest-growing part of our business, but it's also the smallest. So there is a growing pipeline. We are in active dialogue, as Duncan mentioned in his opening remarks. But the core portion of this segment's revenues still comes from connectivity and co-location and market data and software sales. So it's a little bit of a mix issue, where you're going to need -- while that core is under some marketplace pressure, you're not going to get enough growth near term from the solutions and managed services to grow the business double digits. In terms of our guidance, we have adjusted downward our guidance to sort of low single-digit revenue growth. I mentioned constant rates, first half, we're at 4%. This quarter, we were at 2% growth. What we are focusing on is that the business year-to-date has a 23% margin. Last year, it had a 26%. We'd still like to try to hold that margin of last year. So you're going to see some better cost discipline in the second half that should improve the profitability, get closer to sort of last year's margins."

I think it's a good question, Jillian, and it's one we're asking ourselves a lot around here, too. Obviously, look, we're all familiar that the 2 benchmarks are calculated, there are idiosyncrasies in which the way they're calculated. The investigation to date has been pretty much focused on LIBOR. That's not to say it won't be focused on kind of all these different benchmarks. We're -- we have already been in conversations with the regulators and participants in the U.K. and in the EU. So to the degree we need to develop products that might provide an alternative, as we've been able to do here, we would be prepared to engage in the dialogue on that. But much as I said about LIBOR, this is not something you can change overnight, even if you thought that both of the underlying benchmarks had some idiosyncrasies that were manipulative. So I think we're going to pay very close attention. It is a different process, the way the 2 are calculated. But I don't think we can take 100% comfort from that. That doesn't mean we're not going to engage in the dialogue with the policymakers over there. In fact, we have. So more to come on all that, but I don't think this is going to happen quickly on either side of the pond. But keep in mind, there are some differences to how the benchmarks are calculated too.

Our count doesn't have any powers so I guess we're going to be doing it old-school today, but we are going to make sure we do that tonight. 
Before I get into the results, I do want to take a few minutes to talk about Hurricane Sandy. It was a pretty challenging week for our community here at at NYSE Euronext and many of the communities in and around the East Coast. However, I couldn't be more proud of our teams that worked here nonstop over really the last week or 10 days. As usual, we let the industry from the front in helping to build the consensus the coastal markets last Monday and Tuesday, which I firmly believe was the right thing to do. And with Wednesday historically opening, I can attribute that to the result of truly heroic efforts on the part of many of our key people. Not only did we reopen the market smoothly when the entire surrounding area was still in darkness, but we had 3 IPOs come to market last Friday, which is a testament to the resiliency of the U.S. markets. 
Now let me focus on the third quarter. During the quarter, we made significant progress with new product development and our key initiatives that will drive future growth. And we'll highlight those throughout the presentation that Mike and I will do. Focusing on those levers of our business model, they're in our control and we can influence to deliver value for our shareholders over the long-term, well beyond the current lackluster trading environment. As you know, we've made a lot of headway over last few years in diversifying our business model, a large portion of -- although we made a lot of headway, a large portion of our revenues remain to trading, and our derivatives franchise in Europe has been especially impacted by macro conditions of deleveraging, driving lower levels of hedging and speculation. But contrary to what many are saying today, this is not structural shape in the market in my opinion. And we see the current climate as an opportunity to focus the company for growth when macro conditions return to normal. At the same time, we need to remain focused on further diversification on our technology, data and Post trade businesses. 
In some respect, I feel that NYSE Euronext's way to U.S. economy. We're positioned to grow under the right conditions. For the moment, we're still facing strong macroeconomic headwinds and our results for the third quarter reflect this. With $0.44 for the quarter at $559 million in revenue compared to $0.71 from $704 million in revenue in the prior year third quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 4. On Slide 4, I thought we'd share some year-on-year comparisons of the past 2 third quarters  Third quarter of 2011 was characterized by event driven volatility in the U.S. and Europe, which drove strong trading volumes across all of our menus, setting new records for orders and executions. Fast-forward to the third quarter of 2012 and we will have multiyear lows in terms of volatility. 
In conjunction with this decline in volatility, our exchange trading has increased more than 4% of the orders and internalize more client flow in these low volatility markets. We continue to be frustrated with this trend and are troubled that the U.S. equity markets have gotten more opaque while the value of the public market continues to be diminished. 
Moving to the upper right quadrant, we illustrate the decrease need on the short end of the curve, which rates at or near 0 and no indication from Central banks that risks will be going up before 2014. Open interest is down in the front for quarterly tax compared to 18 months ago. But as you move out on the curve, we see more favorable trends in open interest. 
Lastly on the lower right quadrant, while our principal trading venues faced challenging operating conditions, our market share across U.S. equity options, European cash and U.S. cash has actually remained fairly stable and in the case of European cash had even increased. U.S. equities market share is also relatively strong given the aforementioned increase in all exchange trading. 
So in summary, market share on our primary venues has remained stable or improved, but this has been overshadowed by deleveraging and a more typically seasonally summer quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 5 for me. At the same time, in our control, and Slide 5 illustrates the progress that we are making and executing against our strategy. First of all, we need to find areas for growth and diversification. We have several new product development and growth initiatives underway that should improve the company's position in the near future. We're working to launch a full-service CCP by June of 2013. More on that in another slide or 2. Our listings franchise continues to build momentum especially in terms of technology market share. We're in the process of revamping our global data agreements, which we expect will result in additional revenue beginning in 2013. The Bank of China agreement that we recently signed is not just another an IOU but a wide range partnership that well, among other things, make Bank of China a general clearing member of NYSE Liffe. We are continuing to launch new products and expand participation on NYSE Liffe U.S. with the onboarding of 2 new clearing members. And lastly, we're continuing to roll out new futures products like the Russell Europe SMID 300 index, the new Mini MSCI contracts and 3-year mid-curve options on sterling and the euro, which we launched in July. 
Secondly we need to enhance our operating leverage. We continue to share discipline as illustrated by our results, which Mike will outline more detail later. Additionally, having previously, we have now we with our partner and trends to unwind our 60 40 joint venture earnings. We are also moving ahead with our initiative, which will lead to opportunities to rationalize our global real estate footprint. 
Thirdly, we remain committed to deploying capital in a shareholder friendly way. In addition to the 2012 dividend and buyback that Mike will touch on, we are continuing to look at opportunities to ship things in businesses that do not support our strategic objectives. We will be looking to divest all or at least a portion of our stakes in LCH.Clearnet and NZX at the appropriate time. 
Please turn to Slide 6 for me. On Slide 6, we go a little deeper into our derivatives business. On the top half of the slide, we show the development of the MSCI index futures on clear. Year-to-date average daily volume is around 7,000 contracts a day, which is 82% above last year. And open interest is over 200,000 contracts, up 91% versus the prior year. 
On the bottom half of the slide, we highlighted selected trends on our fixed-income businesses where we are beginning to see some semblance of improvement while the market remains challenging. At STI our futures open interest is showing good growth of 35% since the lows of December of 2011. The long-term growth trend in long futures volume continues with ADV up 6% year-over-year and trading and short is also picking up with ADD in the third quarter of 29% sequentially. 
Turning to our product, new market program fueling strong volumes in Q3. ADV is up 30% quarter-over-quarter and is up 26% year-over-year with open interest up 9% versus the third quarter of 2011. We also launched three-year mid-curve options under LIBOR and sterling in July as I mentioned a minute ago. The LIBOR 3-year mid curve option is one of the fastest-growing new products for NYSE Liffe on record. In the first few months of trading, open entry is approaching 385,000 contracts and ADV at 23,000 contracts. 
Lastly, I thought I'd give you an update on NYSE Liffe here in the U.S. where we are launching new products and expanding the number of clearing members on NYPC. from MCI futures continue to be a strong growth story, since NYSE Liffe U.S. was granted the exclusive and license. Bottom end open interest in the products have more than doubled since last year, and new end-users are participating in our emerging and product as a result of the increased liquidity. New customer demand, we launched new futures on the MSCI World Index and MSCI emerging markets and Latin America Index and the MSCI Canada Index all in Q3. 
In July we launched futures on the DTCC GCF Repo Index, which continues to gain momentum with the diverse range of new market participants. ADV since launch is just over 3,000 contracts a day, and more recently has grown over 5,000 contracts a date and open interest is rapidly approaching 50,000 contracts. 
Finally, as I alluded to earlier, JPMorgan and into you went live as NYPC clearing members during the third quarter of 2012. As members of NYPC, they will be able to realize savings to the innovative single pipe cross emerging model that is unique to NYPC and its numbers. 
Please turn to Slide 7. On Slide 7, we provide you with an update on our NYSE Clearing initiative. We filed the application for our new London Clearing House with the FSA and are well into the build Phase for a fully in-source clearinghouse with a targeted completion date of June of next year. This will generate cost savings from June and revenue synergies from early 2014. With the new regulatory guidance in place, all CCP's within the EU are put in a challenging position in terms of financial resources and operational requirements. In addition to anticipating a consolidation of existing CCP's, a key differentiator for NYSE Clearing is our full-service CCP will be, ""New to market."" We are building our clearinghouse from the bottom up. So from the start, it will reflect the new EMIR guidance. With all CCP's working to change their current systems to the revised principles, we certainly believe that building our CCP with all the initial requirements from the very beginning gives us certain advantages and flexibility over the competition. In the future, our but platform should allow us to innovate faster on new product as well. 
In the second quarter, we selected and established third-party risk and collateral system provider. This third party has consistently been recognized as a leader in derivative software development, work management and processing for both CCP's as well as investment banks and end-users. We are now working on system integration with them. 
We also completed the delivery schedule of key IT releases. This has a timeline which our clearing and technology teams are looking diligently to meet. 
Lastly before year-end, we will be engaging with all the clearing members of NYSE Liffe Clearing. We've already circulated a detailed service subscription of our CCP and the proposed business model. Once we've completed the in-sourcing, we could then extend their clearing offering, which will include migrating our continental derivatives market in early 2014 and launching OTC clearing services in late 2013. Expanding the clearing offering will generate incremental clearing fees for us but will also provide significant offsets and capital savings for our customers as well. The single pan-European clearing platform will be to deliver considerable operational benefits for all of our clients. 
Please turn to Slide 8. I'm going to shift here to the IPO market and on this slide IPO market continues to be strong with NYSE Euronext leading the way in capital raising. Franchise has continued to strengthen with a great showing in the number of IPOs and the pipeline that continuously both momentum. We're proud of our brand has been able to extend its footprint, both of the U.S. and into the global community. 
I'd like to share with you some of the noteworthy accomplishments that we've had recently. We're in #1 global IPOs and follow-on proceeds, with over 30% more IPO proceeds and nearly 4x more following proceeds than our nearest competitor. In the third quarter, we priced 19 IPOs, raising almost $10 billion collectively, while our euros competitor priced 17 IPOs with a little less than $2 billion collectively. Year-to-date through October, we had cash of 55% of the U.S. technology IPO market share, we welcomed 2 new technology IPOs in the third quarter of 2012 and 4 new tech IPOs in the month of October. The IPO market has slowed after the debut but it's picked up again quite nicely. October was the most active month for IPOs in the U.S. so far this year. And we want more than 2/3 of the deals. These included some of the biggest and most successful IPOs of the year, Workday and. 
We are also the leading exchange for international offerings year to date with $6.3 billion in proceeds. Some of the largest international players are choosing our market in addition to their own local market, including Santander Mexico and Banco P&P G-Pack 12. 
Please turn to Slide 9. On this slide, we have an update on our technology services business. over the last few years, we have assembled a superior portfolio of assets and the long-term strategic plan has been to evolve the commercial technology business from a product and service provider to a client-focused solutions provider. Unfortunately during this transition, we hit a period of compression and financial technology spending as clients cost containment initiatives were prioritized over technology innovation and footprint expansion. Our commercial technology business has been making slow incremental progress but underperforming relative to our expectations. However, we do have enough visibility into the business that we expect to return to top and bottom line growth in 2013. These plans, notwithstanding however, the challenges this year have taken us offtrack for the $1 billion revenue target, which we previously announced as being a 2015 goal. Given the softness in revenue generation, we have been focused on managing our costs effectively. The silver lining of declines are transitional state, which will eventually result in moving their model to an outsourced solution. We expected to create a much greater opportunity that we are well-positioned to capture. The new leadership of John Robson, I'm confident that we have the right person in the sit and one who shares our vision for the future of the business. In the meantime, John and the team are working at a detailed plan to return us to growth, and John will be joining us on the earnings call in February to provide you with his insights as to the future of the business. 
In the third quarter, we signed a landmark deal with Russell Investments to fully manage Russell's platform content and distribution. More recently, we have begun revising global data agreements, and we anticipate will result in more data products and higher market data revenue. And lastly, we announced yesterday that we have formed a new company with the Americas Trading Group in Brazil to develop a new liquidity center targeting the Brazilian market. NYSE Technologies will provide the technology for the company on commercial terms, and we will have an equity share in the venture. But contrary to reports overnight, we will not be contributing capital. 
Lastly on Slide 10, before I turn it over to Mike. I wanted to update you on a few regulatory and macro issues that are affecting our industries and many of our issuers. As always, we are leading our industry from the front on these issues. I want to address everything on the slide, but let me touch on a few important highlights. 
First, in Europe, with regard to MiFid and MiFIR. While there are many more milestones ahead of the process, we are pleased with where things currently stand in the European Parliament. Of particular note, Articles 28 and 29 have been restricted to the cash markets only, which makes sense given where the cash markets are in terms of maturation. In terms of a financial transaction tax, the proposed EUI tax was rejected in June. However, 11 members stat4e have since expressed an agreement to work together on the potential FTT. 
Scope Territory, range of technical characteristics of that proposal are not yet known, but we are continuing to make our voice heard on the issue. 
In 
France, and FTT was implemented on August 1, and while we have seen some reduction in volumes, it has been manageable, but we continue to monitor it. 
Turning to the right side of the slide, in the U.S., as you know, U.S. market structure has become a widely debated topic in recent months. In my view, this is an appropriate conversation to have as investor confidence remains at record low levels. This is in part due to macro uncertainty, which has caused a lot of investors to move to the sidelines but it's also at least partially driven by a lack of confidence in the underlying market structure. Markets appear too complex and fragmented for individual investors and there has been a dramatic rise in the exchange trading, which we believe Discovery process. We believe the right thing to do is to engage in a holistic review of market structure with all participants to more closely examine some of the unintended consequences of the framework under which we operate. 
At the same time, we remain committed to demonstrating leadership in the industry. One example of this was the industry's response to capital this past summer, which we helped spearhead. Bringing a letter to the SEC dated September 28, we outlined the collaboratively design concept of a kill switch, that would allow an exchange to suspend or drop order flow from the member firm or a trading partner whose trades exceeded a preset risk. The second, more recent and obvious example of our industry leadership that we demonstrated was in response to Hurricane Sandy. Finally, we are continuing to use our platform to advocate important issues like the fiscal health of the United States and job creation, the latter of which we think is really about access to capital for small and medium-sized companies. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike for a review of the quarter's financial results. Mike?"
189274,216657872,378896,"NYSE Euronext, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2012",2012-11-06,"Earnings Calls","NYSE Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 11 provides comparative GAAP results for the third quarter of 2012. Our GAAP EPS of $0.44 per share was the same as our non-GAAP for the quarter. In the quarter, we reported an $18 million charge from merger expense",1986,"Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 11 provides comparative GAAP results for the third quarter of 2012. Our GAAP EPS of $0.44 per share was the same as our non-GAAP for the quarter. In the quarter, we reported an $18 million charge from merger expenses and exit costs. Also related to P 14 initiatives. This was mitigated by some discrete tax benefits related to the reduction in the UK tax rates from 25% to 23%. 
Our review of our financial results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs and discrete tax items. 
Slide 12 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the quarter. Our financial results were impacted by the dramatic decline in trading volumes compared to the third quarter of 2011, which benefited from a spike in volatility as Duncan discussed earlier. Net revenues on a reported basis were down 21% year-over-year and were 14% lower year-to-date. Transaction of volume-based revenues declined 35% year-over-year, which was somewhat offset by the late Q2 acquisition of Corpedia and slightly higher listing revenues. Costs were lower by $28 million or 7% for the quarter and are 5% lower year-to-date on a constant dollar constant portfolio basis. For the third quarter, 38% of our other operating expenses were denominated in either euros or pounds, 61% in U.S. dollars and another 1% in other currencies. Based on the current projections for profits and changes to U.K. tax rates, we now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 24% for the full year 2012. There were 21% effective tax rate in the quarter was the result of a tax rate true up to adjust the year-to-date tax rate to 24% from 25%, adding $0.02 in EPS to our Q3 results. 
Diluted share count was reduced by 16 million shares to 247 million this quarter. 
Slide 13 provides our consolidated segment results on a currency neutral basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened this quarter versus prior year for both the euro and the British pound by 12% and 2%, respectively. For the third quarter, 43% of our net revenues were denominated in either euros or pounds. Currency impact on net revenue for the quarter was a negative $20 million versus prior year, and unfavorable by $4 million versus the previous quarter. Foreign exchange contributed an unfavorable $10 million to operating income this quarter versus prior year. On a currency neutral basis, third quarter net revenues were down 18% and operating income decreased 37% versus the third quarter of 2011. Operationally, revenues for our derivatives and Cash Trading and Listings businesses decreased 26% and 17%, respectively, while our commercial technology revenues were down 6%. 
Slide 14 to 15 detail the financial performance for our derivatives segment. Derivatives revenue in the third quarter of $164 million was lower by 27% year-over-year and down 10% sequentially, mostly attributable to lower trading volumes. On a reported basis were essentially flat but were actually lower when you adjust for the investment we're making in our U.K. clearing initiative. Derivatives accounted for 29% of our consolidated net revenues and 35% of our operating income. Revenue capture for NYSE Liffe was lower, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The decline year-over-year was primarily due to modified pricing in the fourth quarter of 2011 for the trading of individual equity options and index futures in Amsterdam and Belgium. The decrease compared to Q2 was principally due to the declines in single stock futures revenue, which is seasonally stronger in the second quarter due to the dividend arbitrage trades. These revenues are included in the revenue capture calculation, but the are not. 
Capture for the U.S. options businesses is also lower. The decline in capture was principally due to the Penny Pilot pricing changes on this quarter. The decline quarter-over-quarter was principally due to the Penny Pilot pricing changes and a mix shift weighted by higher market maker participation on AMEX, which has cap. We had eliminated caps on dividend trades beginning November 1. 
Similarly, Slides 16 and 17 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading and Listings accounted for 50% of our consolidated net revenues and 53% of our operating income in the third quarter. Trading and listings net revenues were $282 million, down 20% versus the prior year period and down 6% compared to the second quarter of 2012. European cash market share across our 4 primary markets, which excludes off exchange trading volume, increased to 68% in the third quarter, up from 66% in the prior year and the second quarter of 2012. 
In U.S. cash equities, our market share across all tapes increased slightly sequentially but is down 200 basis points year-over-year. Non-Exchange traded shares or TRF share remains elevated at 32% of the U.S. equities market, up from 28% in the prior year. In response to the growth and exchange trading, we have launched a Retail Liquidity Provider program in Q3, which currently trades about 6 million shares a day and has shown promise. Revenue capture for U.S. cash decreased to $0.04 per 100 shares traded for Q3, favorable to the 3.8 cents recorded in the third quarter of 2011 but below the 4.3 cents in Q3 2011. The increase year-over-year was driven by a favorable mix and selected pricing changes. The decrease quarter-over-quarter was due to client mix, with certain large clients hitting volunteers with favorable pricing. 
Strong second quarter also benefited from the Russell rebalancing in June. We are implementing several initiatives, which should increase the capture for Q4. 
Revenue capture for European cash on a per transaction basis decreased to $0.54 from $0.64 in the third quarter of 2011 but increased from $0.52 in the third quarter of 2012. Decline year-over-year was primarily driven by foreign exchange and declines in average daily value traded and average trade sizes, which has resulted in an increase in the number of transactions per day. Artificially, the pricing revenue transaction on a per transaction basis. The increase compared to the second quarter of 2012 was driven by a favorable mix over the platform. 
Slide 18 details the financial performance for Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. This segment accounted for 20% of our net revenues and 12% of our operating income in the third quarter of 2012. Segment revenue was $113 million in the quarter, a decrease of $12 million from Q3 prior year. A constant exchange rates, revenues were down $7 million or 6% on the prior year. Prior year third quarter did benefit from $5 million in onetime platforms sales to Warsaw and Tokyo Stock Exchanges. 
As expected, technology expenses were below second quarter and prior year levels as a result of proactive efforts to manage costs given the macro headwinds. The top line growth in this segment, as Duncan discussed earlier, has been below our expectations due to conscripted technology spending environment. While we do not expect real growth this year, we do expect Q4 revenue and operating margins will be nicely above Q3 levels and look optimistically towards 2013. 
Slide 19 illustrates the progress we've made toward the Project 14 efficiency stream. Costs are below $400 million for the first time in years. Current period expenses of $388 million are down 7% year-over-year and down $8 million quarter-over-quarter. Year-to-date, we've saved $82 million of our Project 14 efficiency goal representing 33% of the $250 million in annualized savings. We continue to be disciplined and diligent with costs by reviewing our portfolio, streamlining our business model and simplifying our technology architecture. 
Looking forward, we have received regulatory approval to consolidate redefine our market operations functions and teams. A new approach is aimed to utilize our expertise in multimarket operations in trading product oversight as a competitive advantage in our business model. We have planned to integrate Corporate Board Member and Corpedia into unified corporate services offerings. We are unwinding BlueNext and evaluating other nonperforming products in the portfolio. 
In the IT area, we continue to explore shoring opportunities, system architecture harmonization and ways to more efficiently utilize our data center capacity. And lastly we are also exploring a series of initiatives to rationalize our global real estate footprint. 
Slide 20 provides a reconciliation of our underlying cost base and updates our 2012 cost guidance. Due to the reported expenses of $388 million, which at the P14 currency rates resulted in a rebate cost of $383 million in Q3 and $1.2 billion year-to-date. We spent a total of $11 million on growth initiatives during the quarter and $31 million year-to-date. This translates into third quarter core expenses of $382 million and $1.169 million year-to-date. 
Expenses in the quarter included $5 million related to our settlement with the SEC on issues related to exchange market data. We also had several one-time expense benefits, which mitigated the impact. 
We're updating our full-year expense guidance for strategic initiatives as follows. A recurring house build to take shape and accelerate, it's become clear that we will be incurring higher than anticipated costs for the buildout of our London Clearing House. This is due in part to the complexity to build, more regulations on client separation and the new standards and preparing for the OTC opportunity. We now expect to spend $20 million of operating expense this year on our clearing efforts. Capital spending will pick up significantly in Q4 as we are now well into the buildout phase of this initiative. 
Corpedia is 2012 acquisition and our second half spending as well incremental to pre-acquisition guidance. Of course this acquisition also contributes to incremental revenues. And with NYSE's second half growth curtailed, we've taken actions to ensure that costs are also reduced to levels below last year. As a result, we expect no incremental variable spending for NYSE beyond what was reported in the first half. 
As we move through the end of the year, we will also begin to incur some transitional costs and within the IT shoring activities. These transitional costs will be segregated and reported separately, particularly as efforts accelerated to 2013. We'll provide more quantification in February on our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. We are reviving downward our full-year 2012 guidance to between $1,603,000,000 and $1,612,000,000 on a constant dollar basis using rates of 135 to euro and 160 to a pound. We also expect our core expense base to be between $1,559,000,000 and $1,568,000,000, which is about $100 million below our 2011 expense base of $1,666,000,000. 
Slide 21 details our cash and deposition as of September 30, 2012. Debt at September 30 was $2.5 billion, and we had about $350 million in cash. Our debt to EBITDA leverage ratio increased to 2.4x, reflecting weak EBITDA generation, share buybacks and the traditional weak Q3 cash flow driven by the biannual Section 31 fee reimbursement. 
We are pleased with the outcome of our recent refinancing. In total, we raised $850 million in a new 5-year note with a 2% coupon. This is comprised of refinancing of our $750 million U.S. bond and $80 million of our Eurobond that was tendered during the refinancing process. This will result in approximately $15 million and $24 million in interest expense in 2013 and 2014, respectively. 
Capital expenditures were $41 million in the quarter and $125 million year-to-date. Despite the slow level of nine-month spending versus our prior full year guidance of $200 million, we do expect a significantly higher level of capital spending in Q4 as we accelerate the buildout of our clearing facility and complete the redesign of our New York trading floor. 
We executed $120 million of stock repurchases in the third quarter, retiring 4.7 million shares at an average price of $25.46. Year-to-date, we have retired 15.9 million shares. 
Lastly, the Board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2012, which is payable on December 28. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Duncan for closing remarks."

Anyway, so my question is on expenses, Michael. So you're pure well ahead of the Project 14 expense target for not only -- well, for 2012. If you look at your guidance here, it looks like you got a pretty -- a nice uptick in 4Q expenses to the number of about $14 million at the midpoint. So I guess the question is, can we expect incremental savings beyond what you've laid out in Project 14? And can you -- I know you've talked about the 4Q run rate, but is that all just from sort of the the extra clearing cost being built in?"

There's a consolidated tape revenue. There's a proprietary data. There's U.S. versus Europe and we don't actually break down what those individual pieces those are. So part of it is for our market data weakness has been that DTA are down, volumes have been weak and more goes to TRF. What we're looking at is from consistency would what our competitors are charging particularly for example in Europe for some nondisplay things. Remember, in Europe, the tradition has been you charge by terminals. The terminal numbers have gone down as investments and our customers in general have decreased the number of terminals. But a lot of our competitors are targeting for non display, which is meaning direct benefits a more consistent with what happens in the U.S. Some of this is just consistency. Some of this enforcing compliance, which I think has been a challenge particularly in Europe due to ambiguous policies that we are cleaning up. Some of this is the things that we don't charge for that our clients do charge -- that our competitors do charge for. So we expect that some of those fees will go into effect very shortly. I think some of them went in in November, so you'll start to see partial results in the fourth quarter. I don't know if Mike is going to give specific granular guidance."

So first, to start at the 30,000-foot level, I think the long-term vision hasn't changed in terms of what the business can be. Secondly, I do honestly believe that so many of the clients are in the state of their own transition as they reinvent their own business models, and they think about managing their own expense basis. Obviously, the complexity of their infrastructure continues to be something that we hear regularly about from them that it's something they would like to manage more efficiently and more cost-effectively. So I think we are well-positioned to do that with a little more difficult to predict is as when the decision-making as some of the potential target customers will take place. As we alluded to in our remarks, the reason we're back in the away from the previously stated objective that we thought we could achieve by 2015 is that when we made that statement, we did not anticipate Capital Markets spending for technology being down 15% to 20% this year like it is. So I think we have to reevaluate of that. John and his team, John Ross and his team are going through all of that. We do believe in a long-term vision. We said from the beginning that it would probably be augmented by some acquisition. So we're not going to hesitate to look at a few things like that. And we'll be thoughtful about that. So I think we'll give a more detailed outlook for what we think that business could be in the next call.

Having worked with the and having interpreted the new requirements that will be in place as we add the functionality and the clearing house and the rules changed around that, our expectation is that $180 million number will go to something that looks like $350 million. And of that increase of $170 million, the majority of that will come on the clearing side. So if today it's $180 million and it's 1/3, 2/3 clearing exchange, we expect it will be around $350 million by this time next year and it will be a little more than 50% of that dedicated on the clearing side, a little less than 50% dedicated to the exchange side.

So these are not significant numbers, probably aggregating about more than $100 million of capital. So we generate a lot of our free cash flow in the first 2 quarters of each year, so I think it's appropriate as Duncan mentioned for us to allow our Board failry discuss the budgets and the business plans for next year and decide what we're going to do with the excess cash above and beyond what we pay out for our dividend. We are saying that clearly, one of the things we have to factor in there was a little more cash for going live with our clearing."

It's $200 million to $250 million, the sale of NZC, the scale down of LCH position and the money that we will not be putting into the investment by having reduced that stake from 20 to 12 collectively more than cover the additional monies we have to set aside for clearing. We expect to be able -- we have already made the cutter decision and we expect to be able to divest those other 2 positions early in 2013. So if you add all that up, by the time we have to set more capital aside, we will have had -- we will have more than accounted for that capital so it should not necessitate a change in other -- it shouldn't make any harder decision to think about other shareholder friendly deployments of capital, I think is the easiest way to say it."

If you don't get to ask a question, Mike and team will follow up with you guys throughout the day, so thank you for your attention on the call this morning. First on the competitive landscape, let me start with the derivatives with the interest rate derivatives first. As we've learned first hand, it's pretty difficult to dislodge an incumbent's liquidity. I think we're trying to do that here in the U.S. We're not just competing on price or technology alone, we actually think we have a pretty unique value proposition given the capital efficient clearing model. And in spite of that, it has proven difficult to dislodge the incumbent's liquidity. Having said that, we take all of these approaches seriously, and we pay cope close attention and we monitor closely, we listen to the clients are looking for. But the experience in the industry tells us that computing only on price or technology tends to be a losing proposition. In terms of the order machine with some of the equity options on the confident, we have been in dialogue with some of the other market participants. I think there are different ways we can approach that one. We have responded earlier this year by adjusting fees on some of those products. And I think that is an initiative that needs to be taken seriously. And you can say when dialogue with market participants and payers of that alternative as well as we try to find ways perhaps to work together instead of against one another. So more to come on that in the future date, and hopefully, that addresses the question. So thanks, everybody, for dialing in this morning. We're going to let you all get back to work and we're going to do the same here. And as I said, Mike and his team will follow up with any of you one on one throughout the day. Thanks again. And I hope everyone is in this area at least is slowly but surely recovering from Sandy. Thanks a lot. Bye."

Our count doesn't have any powers so I guess we're going to be doing it old-school today, but we'll -- it -- we're going to make sure we do that tonight.
Before I get into the results, I do want to take a few minutes to talk about Hurricane Sandy. It was a pretty challenging week for our community here at NYSE Euronext and many of the communities in and around the East Coast. However, I couldn't be more proud of our teams that worked here nonstop over really the last week or 10 days. As usual, we led the industry from the front in helping to build the consensus that closed the markets last Monday and Tuesday, which I firmly believe was the right thing to do. And with Wednesday's historic reopening, I can attribute that to the result of truly heroic efforts on the part of many of our key people. Not only did we reopen the market smoothly when the entire surrounding area was still in darkness but we had 3 IPOs come to market last Friday, which is a testament to the resiliency of the U.S. markets.
So now let me focus on the third quarter. During the quarter, we made significant progress with new product development and our key initiatives that will drive future growth, and we'll highlight those throughout the presentation that Mike and I will do. We're focusing on those levers of our business model that are in our control and that we can influence to deliver value for our shareholders over the long term, well beyond the current lackluster trading environment. As you know, we've made a lot of headway over the last few years in diversifying our business model, a large portion of our -- although we made a lot of headway, a large portion of our revenues remain linked to trading, and our derivatives franchise in Europe has been especially impacted by macro conditions and deleveraging, driving lower levels of hedging and speculation. But contrary to what many are saying today, this is not a structural shake in the market, in my opinion, and we see the current climate as an opportunity to focus the company for growth when macro conditions return to normal. At the same time, we need to remain focused on further diversification into our technology, data and post-trade businesses.
In some respects, I feel that NYSE Euronext is ready to live out the U.S. economy, well positioned to grow under the right conditions. But for the moment, we are still facing strong macroeconomic headwinds and our results for the third quarter reflect this. We reported $0.44 for the quarter at $559 million in revenue compared to $0.71 on $704 million in revenue in the prior year third quarter.
Please turn to Slide 4. On Slide 4, I thought we'd share some year-on-year comparisons of the past 2 third quarters. The third quarter of 2011 was characterized by event-driven volatility in the U.S. and Europe, which drove strong trading volumes across all of our venues, setting new records for orders and executions. Fast forward to the third quarter of 2012 and we were at multiyear lows in terms of volatility.
In conjunction with this decline in volatility, off-exchange trading has increased more than 4% as the orders internalized more client flow in these lower-volatility markets. We continue to be frustrated with this trend and are troubled that the U.S. equity markets have gotten more opaque while the value of the public markets continues to be diminished.
Moving to the upper-right quadrant, we illustrate the decrease needed to manage risk on the short end of the curve, with rates at or near 0 and no indication from central banks that rates will be going up before 2014. Open interest is down in the front 4 quarterly tax compared to 18 months ago, but as you move out in the curve, we see more favorable trends in open interest.
Lastly, on the lower-right quadrant. While our principal trading venues have faced challenging operating conditions, our market share across U.S. equity options, European cash and U.S. cash has actually remained fairly stable and, in the case of European cash, has even increased. U.S. equities market share is also relatively strong given the aforementioned increase in off-exchange trading. So in summary, market share in our primary venues has remained stable or improved, but this has been overshadowed by deleveraging in a more typically seasonally slow summer quarter.
Please turn to Slide 5 for me. At the same time, there's plenty within our control, and Slide 5 illustrates the progress that we are making in executing against our strategy. First of all, we need to find areas for growth and diversification. We have several new product development and growth initiatives underway that should improve the company's position in the near future. We're working to launch a full-service CCP by June of 2013. More on that in another slide or 2. Our listings franchise continues to build momentum especially in terms of technology market share.
We are in the process of revamping our global data agreements, which we expect will result in additional revenue beginning in 2013. The Bank of China agreement that we recently signed is not just another MOU but a wide-ranging partnership that will, among other things, make Bank of China a general clearing member of NYSE Liffe. We are continuing to launch new products and expand participation on NYSE Liffe U.S. with the onboarding of 2 new clearing members. And lastly, we are continuing to roll out our new futures products like the Russell Europe SMID 300 Index, the new mini MSCI contracts and 3-year mid-curve options on Sterling and Euribor which we launched in July.
Second, we need to enhance our operating leverage. We continue to show cross discipline, as illustrated by our results, which Mike will outline in more detail later. Additionally, having allowed in [ph] NYSE Blue previously, we have now agreed with our partner Caisse des Dépôts in France to unwind our 60-40 joint venture BlueNext. We are also moving ahead with our shoring initiative, which will lead to opportunities to rationalize our global real estate footprint.
Thirdly, we remain committed to deploying capital in a shareholder-friendly way. In addition to the 2012 dividend and buyback that Mike will touch on, we are continuing to look at opportunities to shift things in businesses that do not support our strategic objectives. We will be looking to divest all or at least a portion of our stakes in LCH.Clearnet and MCX at the appropriate time.
Please turn to Slide 6 for me. On Slide 6, we go a little deeper into our Derivatives business. On the top half of the slide, we show the development of the MSCI index futures on Bclear. Year-to-date average daily volume is around 7,000 contracts a day, which is 82% above last year, and open interest is over 200,000 contracts, up 91% versus the prior year.
On the bottom half of the slide, we highlighted selected trends in our fixed income businesses where we are beginning to see some semblance of improvement while the market remains challenging. STIR futures open interest is showing good growth of 35% since the lows of December of 2011. The long-term growth trend in Long Gilt futures volume continues, with ADV up 6% year-over-year. And trading in Short Gilt futures is also picking up, with ADV in the third quarter up 29% sequentially. Turning to our Swapnote product: Our new market-maker program is fueling strong, with stroing volumes in Q3. ADV is up 30% quarter-over-quarter and is up 26% year-over-year, with open interest up 9% versus the third quarter of 2011.
We also launched 3-year mid-curve options on Euribor and Sterling in July, as I mentioned a minute ago. The Euribor 3-year mid-curve option is one of the fastest-growing new products for NYSE Liffe on record. In the first few months of trading, open interest is approaching 385,000 contracts, and ADV into 23,000 contracts. 
Lastly, I thought I'd give you an update on NYSE Liffe here in the U.S. where we're launching new products and expanding the number of clearing members on NYPC.
Our mini MCI futures continue to be a strong growth story since NYSE Liffe U.S. was granted the exclusive license. Volume amount [ph] and interest in the products have more than doubled since last year, and new end users are participating in our emerging and eco products as a result of the increased liquidity. Due to customer demand, we launched new futures on the MSCI World index, MSCI Emerging Markets Latin America index and the MSCI Canada Index all in Q3. In July, we launched futures on the DTCC GCF Repo Index, which continues to gain momentum with a diverse range of new market participants. ADV since launch is just over 3,000 contracts a day and more recently has grown to over 5,000 contracts a day, and open interest is rapidly approaching 50,000 contracts.
Finally, as I alluded to earlier, JPMorgan and BNP went live as NYPC clearing members during the third quarter of 2012. As members of NYPC, they will be able to realize savings through the innovative single-pot cross-margining model that is unique to NYPC and its numbers.
Please turn to Slide 7. On Slide 7, we provide you with an update on our NYSE Clearing initiative. We filed the application for our new London clearing house with the FSA and are well into the build phase for a fully in-source clearinghouse, with a targeted completion date of June of next year. This will generate cost savings from June and revenue synergies from early 2014.
With the nearest new regulatory guidance in place, all CCPs within the EU are put in a challenging position in terms of financial resources and operational requirements. In addition to anticipating a consolidation of existing CCPs, a key differentiator for NYSE Clearing is that our full-service CCP will be ""new to market."" We are building our clearing house from the bottom up, so from the start, it will reflect the new EMIR guidelines. With all CCPs working to change their current systems to the revised principles, we certainly believe that building our CCP with all the initial requirements from the very beginning gives us certain advantages and flexibility over the competition. In the future, our newly built platform should allow us to innovate faster our new products as well.
In the second quarter, we initially selected and established third-party risk and collateral system provider. This third party has consistently been recognized as a leader in derivative software development, risk management and processing for both CCPs as well as investment banks and end users. We are now working on system integration with them.
We also completed the delivery schedule of key IP releases. This has a time line which our clearing and technology teams are working diligently to meet.
Lastly, before the year end, we will be engaging with all the clearing members of NYSE Liffe Clearing. We already circulated a detailed service subscription of our CCP and the proposed business model. Once we've completed the in-sourcing, we can then extend our clearing offering, which will include migrating our continental derivatives markets in early 2014 and launching OTC clearing services in late 2013. Expanding the clearing offering will generate incremental clearing fees for us but will also provide significant offsets and capital savings for our customers as well. The single pan-European clearing platform will be able to deliver considerable operational benefits for all of our clients.
Please turn to Slide 8. I'm going to shift here to the IPO market. And on this slide, you'll see that the IPO market continues to be strong, with NYSE Euronext leading the way in capital raising. The Listings franchise has continued to strengthen, with a great showing in the number of IPOs in a pipeline which continuously grows momentum. We are proud that our brand has been able to extend its footprint both in the U.S. and into the global community.
I'd like to share with you some of the noteworthy accomplishments that we've had recently. We're #1 in global IPOs and follow-on proceeds, with over 30% more IPO proceeds and nearly 4x more follow-on proceeds than our nearest competitor. In the third quarter, we priced 19 IPOs, raising almost $10 billion collectively, while our U.S. competitor priced 17 IPOs, with a little less than $2 billion collectively. Year-to-date through October, we have cash from 55% of the U.S. technology IPO market share. We welcomed 2 new technology IPOs in the third quarter of 2012 and 4 new tech IPOs in the month of October.
The IPO market has slowed after the Facebook debut, but it has picked up again quite nicely. October was the most active month for IPOs in the U.S. so far this year, and we want -- we won more than 2/3 of the deals. These included some of the biggest and most successful IPOs of the year, Workday and Realogy. 
We are also the leading exchange for international offerings year-to-date, with $6.3 billion in proceeds raised. Some of the largest international players are choosing our market in addition to their own local market, including Santander Mexico and Banco BTG Pactual. 
Please turn to Slide 9. On this slide, we have an update on our technology services business. Over the last few years, we have assembled a superior portfolio of assets, and the long-term strategic plan has been to evolve the commercial technology business from a product and service provider to a client-focused solutions provider. Unfortunately during this transition, we hit a period of compression in financial technology spending as clients cost containment initiatives were prioritized over technology innovation and footprint expansion. Our commercial technology business has been making slow incremental progress but are underperforming relative to our expectations. However, we do have enough visibility into the business that we expect to return to top and bottom line growth in 2013. Each plan is notwithstanding, however, the challenges this year have taken us offtrack for the $1 billion revenue target which we previously announced as being a 2015 goal.
Given the softness in revenue generation, we have been focused on managing our costs effectively, a silver lining as declines are in a transitional state, which will eventually result in moving their model to an outsourced solution. We expected to create a much greater opportunity that we are well positioned to capture. With the new leadership of Jon Robson, I am confident that we have the right person in the seat and one who shares our vision for the future of the business. In the meantime, Jon and the team are working on a detailed plan to return us to growth. And Jon will be joining us on the earnings call in February to provide you with his insights as to the future of the business.
In the third quarter, we signed a landmark deal with Russell Investments to fully manage Russell's Tick platform, content and distribution. More recently, we have begun revising global data agreements which we anticipate will result in more data projects and higher market data revenue. And lastly, we announced yesterday that we have formed a new company with the Americas Trading Group in Brazil to develop a new liquidity center targeting the Brazilian market. NYSE Technologies will provide the technology for the company on commercial terms, and we will have an equity share in the venture. But contrary to reports overnight, we will not be contributing capital.
Lastly, on Slide 10, before I turn it over to Mike. I wanted to update you on a few regulatory and macro issues that are affecting our industries and many of our issuers. As always, we are leading our industry from the front on these issues. I won't address everything on this slide, but let me touch on a few important highlights.
First, in Europe, with regard to MiFid and MiFIR. While there are many more milestones ahead of the process, we are pleased with where things currently stand in the European Parliament. Of particular note, Articles 28 and 29 have been restricted to the cash markets only, which makes sense given where the cash markets are in terms of maturation.
In terms of the financial transaction tax, the proposed EU-wide tax was rejected in June. However, 11 member states have since expressed an agreement to work together on a potential FTT. Scope, territory, range and technical characteristics of that proposal are not yet known, but we are continuing to make our voice heard on the issue. In France, an FTT was implemented on August 1, and while we have seen some reduction in volumes, it has been manageable but we continue to monitor it.
Turning to the right side of the slide, in the U.S. As you know, U.S. market structure has become a widely debated topic in recent months. In my view, this is an appropriate conversation to have as investor confidence remains at record-low levels. This is in part due to macro uncertainty, which has caused a lot of investors to move to the sidelines, but it's also at least partially driven by a lack of confidence in the underlying market structure. Markets appear too complex and fragmented for individual investors, and there has been a dramatic rise in off-exchange trading which we believe harms the price and scheduling process. We believe the right thing to do is to engage in a holistic review of market structure with all participants to more closely examine some of the unintended consequences of the framework under which we operate.
At the same time, we remain committed to demonstrating leadership in the industry. One example of this was the industry's response to Knight Capital this past summer, which we helped spearhead. Bringing a letter to the SEC dated September 28, we outlined the collaboratively designed concept of the kill switch that would allow an exchange to suspend or drop order flow from a member firm or trading partner whose trades exceeded a preset risk limit.
The second more recent and obvious example of our industry leadership that we demonstrated was in response to Hurricane Sandy.
Finally, we are continuing to use our platform to advocate on important issues like the fiscal health of the United States and job creation, the latter which we think is really about access to capital for small- and medium-sized companies.
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike for a review of the quarter's financial results. Mike?"
189274,216657872,379230,"NYSE Euronext, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2012",2012-11-06,"Earnings Calls","NYSE Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Duncan, and good morning.Slide 11 provides comparative GAAP results for the third quarter of 2012. Our GAAP EPS of $0.44 per share was the same as our non-GAAP for the quarter. In the quarter, we reported an $18 million charge from merger expens",2016,"Thanks, Duncan, and good morning.
Slide 11 provides comparative GAAP results for the third quarter of 2012. Our GAAP EPS of $0.44 per share was the same as our non-GAAP for the quarter. In the quarter, we reported an $18 million charge from merger expenses and exit costs also related to P 14 efficiency initiatives. This was mitigated by some discrete tax benefits related to the reduction in the UK tax rates from 25% to 23%.
Our review of our financial results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs and discrete tax items.
Slide 12 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the quarter. Our financial results were impacted by a dramatic decline in trading volumes compared to the third quarter of 2011 which benefited from a spike in volatility, as Duncan discussed earlier. Net revenues on a reported basis were down 21% year-over-year and were 14% lower year-to-date. Transaction of volume-based revenues declined 35% year-over-year, which was somewhat offset by the late Q2 acquisition of Corpedia and slightly higher listing revenues. Costs were lower by $28 million or 7% for the quarter and are 5% lower year-to-date on a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis. For the third quarter, 38% of our other operating expenses were denominated in either euros or pounds, 61% in U.S. dollars and another 1% in other currencies.
Based on the current projections for profits and changes to U.K. tax rates, we now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 24% for the full year 2012, so the 21% effective tax rate in the quarter was the result of a tax rate true-up to adjust the year-to-date tax rate to 24% from 25%, adding $0.02 in EPS to our Q3 results.
Diluted share count was reduced by 16 million shares to 247 million this quarter.
Slide 13 provides our consolidated and segment results on a currency neutral basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened this quarter versus prior year for both the euro and the British pound by 12% and 2%, respectively. For the third quarter, 43% of our net revenues were denominated in either euros or pounds. Currency impact on net revenue for the quarter was a negative $20 million versus prior year and unfavorable by $4 million versus the previous quarter. Foreign exchange contributed an unfavorable $10 million to operating income this quarter versus prior year.
On a currency neutral basis, third quarter net revenues were down 18% and operating income decreased 37% versus the third quarter of 2011. Operationally, revenues for our Derivatives and Cash Trading and Listings businesses decreased 26% and 17%, respectively, while our commercial technology revenues were down 6%.
Slides 14 to 15 detail the financial performance for our Derivatives segment. Derivatives revenue in the third quarter of $164 million was lower by 27% year-over-year and down 10% sequentially, mostly attributable to lower trading volumes. Currencies, on a reported basis, were essentially flat but were actually lower when you adjust for the investment we are making in our U.K. clearing initiative. Derivatives accounted for 29% of our consolidated net revenues and 35% of our operating income.
Revenue capture for NYSE Liffe was lower both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The decline year-over-year was primarily due to modified pricing in fourth quarter of 2011 for the trading of the individual equity options and index futures in Amsterdam and Belgium. The decrease compared to Q2 was principally due to declines in single-stock futures DCO revenue, which is seasonally stronger in the second quarter due to the dividend arbitrage trades. These revenues are included in the revenue capture calculation, but the DCO volumes are not.
Capture for the U.S. options business is also lower. The decline in capture was principally due to the Penny Pilot pricing changes on Arca this quarter. The decline quarter-over-quarter was principally due to the Penny Pilot pricing changes and a mix shift weighted by higher market maker participation on Amex which has cap fees. We have eliminated caps on dividend trades beginning November 1.
Similarly, Slides 16 and 17 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading and Listings accounted for 50% of our consolidated net revenues and 53% of our operating income in the third quarter. Cash Trading and Listings net revenues was $282 million, down 20% versus the prior year period and down 6% compared to the second quarter of 2012. European cash market share across our 4 primary markets, which excludes off-exchange trading volume, increased to 68% in the third quarter, up from 66% in the prior year and the second quarter of 2012.
In U.S. cash equities, our market share across all tapes increased slightly sequentially but is down 200 basis points year-over-year. Non-exchange traded share or TRF share remains elevated at 32% of the U.S. equities market, up from 28% in the prior year. In response to the growth in off-exchange trading, we have launched the Retail Liquidity Provider program in Q3, which currently trades about 6 million shares a day and has shown promise.
Revenue capture for U.S. cash decreased to $0.04 per 100 shares traded and -- for Q3, favorable to the $0.038 recorded in the third quarter of 2011 but below the $0.043 cents in Q3 (sic) [Q2] 2011. The increase year-over-year was driven by a favorable mix and selected pricing changes. The decrease quarter-over-quarter was due to client mix, with certain large clients hitting volume tiers with favorable pricing.
Strong second quarter also benefited from the Russell rebalancing in June. We are implementing several initiatives, which should increase the capture for Q4.
Revenue capture for European cash on a per-transaction basis decreased to $0.54 from $0.64 in the third quarter of 2011 but increased from $0.52 in the third (sic) [second] quarter of 2012. Decline year-over-year was primarily driven by foreign exchange and declines in average daily value traded and average trade sizes, which has resulted in an increase in the number of transactions per day, artificially depressing our revenue capture on a per-transaction basis. The increase compared to the second quarter of 2012 was driven by a favorable mix over the platform.
Slide 18 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. This segment accounted for 20% of our net revenues and 12% of our operating income in the third quarter of 2012. Segment revenue was $113 million in the quarter, a decrease of $12 million from Q3 prior year. On constant exchange rates, revenues were down $7 million or 6% on the prior year. Prior year third quarter did benefit from $5 million in onetime platform sales to Warsaw and Tokyo Stock Exchanges. As expected, technology expenses were below second quarter and prior year levels as a result of proactive efforts to manage costs given the macro headwinds.
The top line growth in this segment, as Duncan discussed earlier, has been below our expectations due to the constricted technology spending environment. While we do not expect real growth this year, we do expect Q4 revenue and operating margins will be nicely above Q3 levels and look optimistically towards 2013.
Slide 19 illustrates the progress we've made toward the Project 14 efficiency stream. Costs are below $400 million for the first time in years. Current-period expenses of $388 million are down 7% year-over-year and down $8 million quarter-over-quarter. Year-to-date, we have saved $82 million of our Project 14 efficiency goal, representing 33% of the $250 million in annualized savings. We continue to be disciplined and diligent with costs by reviewing our portfolio, streamlining our business model and simplifying our technology architecture.
Looking forward, we have received regulatory approval to consolidate and redefine our market operations, functions and teams. The new approach is aimed to utilize our expertise in multi-market operations in trading product oversight as a competitive advantage in our business model.
We have planned to integrate Corporate Board Member and Corpedia into a unified corporate services offerings. We are unwinding BlueNext and evaluating other nonperforming products in the portfolio.
In the IT area, we continue to explore shoring opportunities, system architecture harmonization and ways to more efficiently utilize our data center capacity. And lastly, we are also exploring a series of initiatives to rationalize our global real estate footprint.
Slide 20 provides a reconciliation of our underlying cost base and updates our 2012 cost guidance. Q3 reported expenses of $388 million, which -- at the P 14 currency rates resulted in a rebased cost of $393 million in Q3 and $1.2 billion year-to-date. We spent a total of $11 million on growth initiatives during the quarter and $31 million year-to-date. This translates into  third quarter core expenses of $382 million and $1.169 billion year-to-date.
Expenses in the quarter included $5 million related to our settlement with the SEC on issues related to exchange market data. We also had several onetime expense benefits, which mitigated the impact.
We're updating our full year expense guidance for strategic initiatives as follows. As our clearing house bid -- build begins to take shape and accelerate, it has become clear that we will be incurring higher-than-anticipated costs for the buildout of our London clearing house. This is due in part to the complexity of the build, more regulations on client separation and the new EMIR standards and preparing for the OTC opportunity. We now expect to spend $20 million of operating expense this year on our clearing efforts. Capital spending will pick up significantly in Q4 as we are now well into the buildout phase of this initiative.
Corpedia is a 2012 acquisition, and our second half spending is well incremental to pre-acquisition guidance. Of course, this acquisition also contributes to incremental revenues. And with NYSE's second half growth curtailed, we have taken actions to ensure that costs are also reduced to levels below last year. As a result, we expect no incremental variable spending for NYSE beyond what was reported in the first half.
As we move to the end of the year, we will also begin to incur some transitional costs and in concert with our IT shoring activities. These transitional costs will be segregated and reported separately particularly as efforts accelerate into 2013. We'll provide more quantification in February on our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call.
We are revising downward our full year 2012 guidance to between 1-6-0-3 million and 1-6-1-2 million on a constant dollar basis, using rates of $1.35 to EUR 1 and $1.60 to GBP 1. We also expect our core expense base to be between 1-5-5-9 million and 1-5-6-8 million, which is about $100 million below our 2011 expense base of 1-6-6-6 million.
Slide 21 details our cash and deposition as of September 30, 2012. Gross debt at September 30 was $2.5 billion, and we had about $350 million in cash. Our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio increased to 2.4x, reflecting weak EBITDA generation, share buybacks and the traditional weak Q3 cash flows driven by the biannual Section 31 fee reimbursement.
We are pleased with the outcome of our recent refinancing. In total, we raised $850 million in a new 5-year note, with a 2% coupon. This is comprised of refinancing of our $750 million U.S. bond and $80 million of our Eurobond that was tendered during the refinancing process. This will result in approximately $15 million and $24 million in interest expense in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
Capital expenditures were $41 million in the quarter and $125 million year-to-date. Despite this low level of 9-month spending versus our prior full year guidance of $200 million, we do expect a significantly higher level of capital spending in Q4 as we accelerate the buildout of our clearing facility and complete the redesign of our New York trading floor.
We executed $120 million of stock repurchases in the third quarter, retiring 4.7 million shares at an average price of $25.46. Year-to-date, we have retired 15.9 million shares.
Lastly, the Board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2012, which is payable on December 28.
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Duncan for closing remarks."

So just before we open it up for your questions, just a quick review of what we talked about. So a very tough macro environment for us, but we remain proud of the progress we've made during the quarter and year-to-date against the Project 14 commitments. We have launched several new products, and we'll continue to launch more. And we will continue to execute on other ongoing initiatives that will drive our future growth. We also remain focused and disciplined with regard to our cost base. And as Mike has articulated, we are well ahead of our savings commitment for 2012. And finally, we will continue to look at opportunities to redeploy capital through the divestment of non-strategic stakes.
In summary, we're doing everything within our control to set the table for a return to growth, and I am extremely optimistic about the future.

Anyway, so my question is on expenses, Michael. So you appear well ahead of the Project 14 expense targets for not only -- well, for 2012. If you look at your guidance here, it looks like you got a pretty -- a nice uptick in 4Q expenses to the number of above $14 million at the midpoint. So I guess the question is, can we expect incremental savings beyond what you've laid out in Project 14? And can you -- I know you've talked about the 4Q run rate, but is that all just from sort of the extra clearing cost being built in?"

There's the consolidated tape revenue. There's the proprietary data. There's U.S. versus Europe. And we don't actually break down what are -- those individual pieces are. So part of the reason that is for our market data weakness has been that TTA [ph] is down and as volumes have been weak and more goes to TRF. What we're looking at is some consistency with what our competitors are charging, particularly for example, in Europe, for some non-display things. Remember, in Europe, the tradition has been you charge by terminals. The terminal numbers have gone down as investments sank and our customers in general have decreased the number of terminals. But a lot of our competitors are targeting for non-display, which is meaning direct data feeds, sort of more consistent with what happens in the U.S. But some of this is just consistency. Some of those are enforcing a compliance, which I think has been a challenge particularly in Europe due to ambiguous policies that we are cleaning up. And some of those are for things that we don't charge for that our clients do charge -- that our competitors do charge for. So we expect that some of those fees will go into effect very shortly. In fact, I think some of them went in, in November, so you will start to see partial results in the fourth quarter.

So first, to start at the 30,000-foot level, I think the long-term vision hasn't changed in terms of what the business can be. Secondly, I do honestly believe that so many of the clients are in a state of their own transition as they reinvent their own business models, and they think about managing their own expense bases. Obviously, the complexity with their infrastructure continues to be something that we hear regularly about from them. That is something they would like to manage more efficiently and more cost effectively. So I think we are well positioned to do that. What's a little more difficult to predict is when the decision-making in some of the potential target customers will take place. As we alluded to in our remarks, the reason we're backing away from the previously stated objective that we thought we could achieve by 2015 is that, when we made that statement, we did not anticipate capital market spending for technology being down 15% to 20% this year, well, like it is. So I think we have to reevaluate that. Jon and his team, Jon Robson and his team, are going through all of that. We do believe in a long-term vision. We said it from the beginning that it would probably be augmented by some acquisition, so we're not going to hesitate to look at a few things like that, and we'll be thoughtful about that. So I think we'll give a more detailed outlook for what we think that business can be in the next call. In the meantime, in terms of some of the immediate impact, anything you want to add to what you said to the previous question about kind of when some of this will start showing up in our result [indiscernible]?"

And to be very clear, I mean, I know everyone on the call knows this already, but we are already viewed by the regulators in the U.K. as a self-clearing registered exchange because we do clear our own products now. The piece that we're building for June of 2013 is the treasury and risk management piece where we already provide clearing services for the products that we trade now in the U.K. So we -- because of that status, we already have a good bit of capital set aside. It's roughly USD 180 million, about 1/3 of which is for clearing activities and 2/3 of which is for exchange activities. Having worked with FSA and having interpreted the new requirements that will be in place as we add the functionality in the clearing house and the rules change around that, our expectation is that $180 million number will go to something that looks like $350 million. And of -- that increase of $170 million, the majority of that will come on the clearing side. So if today it's $180 million and it's 1/3, 2/3 clearing exchange, it -- we expect it will be around $350 million by this time next year and it will be a little more than 50% of that dedicated to the clearing side and a little less than 50% dedicated to the exchange side. So if you thought that the capital we set aside that is specific to the -- in the expansion of our clearing services, if you thought that, that went up by USD 100 million to USD 150 million, that would be correct."

First on the competitive landscape, let me start with the derivatives -- with the interest rate derivatives first. As we've learned first hand, it's pretty difficult to dislodge an incumbent's liquidity. And I think we're trying to do that here in the U.S. And we're not just competing on price or technology alone, we're -- we actually think we have a pretty unique value proposition given the capital-efficient clearing model. And in spite of that, it has proven difficult to dislodge the incumbent's liquidity. Having said that, you -- we take all of these approaches seriously, and we pay close attention to them, we monitor them closely, we listen to what the clients are looking for. And -- but the experience in the industry tells us that competing only on price or technology tends to be a losing proposition. In terms of The Order Machine, with some of the equity options, on the confidence, we have been in dialogue with some of the equity market participants. I think there are different ways we can approach that one. We have responded earlier this year by adjusting fees on some of those products. And I think that is an initiative that needs to be taken seriously. And we -- you can safely assume we are in dialogue with market participants and the purveyors of that alternative as well as we try to find ways perhaps to work together instead of against one another. So more to come on that in a future date, and hopefully, that addresses the question.
Okay, so thanks, everybody, for dialing in this morning. We're going to let you all get back to work, and we're going to do the same here. And as I said, Mike and Stephen and the team will follow up with any of you who want one-on-one's out -- throughout the day.

Before I get into the results, I do want to take a few minutes to talk about Hurricane Sandy. It was a pretty challenging week for our community here at NYSE Euronext and many of the communities in and around the East Coast. However, I couldn't be more proud of our teams that worked here nonstop over really the last week or 10 days. As usual, we led the industry from the front in helping to build a consensus to close the markets last Monday and Tuesday, which I firmly believe was the right thing to do. And with Wednesday's historic reopening, I can attribute that to the result of truly heroic efforts on the part of many of our key people. Not only did we reopen the market smoothly when the entire surrounding area was still in darkness but we had 3 IPOs come to market last Friday, which is a testament to the resiliency of the U.S. markets.
So now let me focus on the third quarter. During the quarter, we made significant progress with new product development and our key initiatives that will drive future growth, and we'll highlight those throughout the presentation that Mike and I will do. We're focusing on those levers of our business model that are in our control and that we can influence to deliver value for our shareholders over the long term, well beyond the current lackluster trading environment. As you know, we've made a lot of headway over the last few years in diversifying our business model, a large portion of our -- although we've made a lot of headway, a large portion of our revenues remain linked to trading, and our derivatives franchise in Europe has been especially impacted by macro conditions and deleveraging, driving lower levels of hedging and speculation. But contrary to what many are saying today, this is not a structural shift in the market in my opinion, and we see the current climate as an opportunity to focus the company for growth when macro conditions return to normal. At the same time, we need to remain focused on further diversification into our technology, data and post-trade businesses.
In some respects, I feel about NYSE Euronext the way I do about the U.S. economy, well positioned to grow under the right conditions. But for the moment, we are still facing strong macroeconomic headwinds and our results for the third quarter reflect this. We reported $0.44 for the quarter and $559 million in revenue compared to $0.71 on $704 million in revenue in the prior year third quarter.
Please turn to Slide 4. On Slide 4, I thought we'd share some year-on-year comparisons of the past 2 third quarters. The third quarter of 2011 was characterized by event-driven volatility in the U.S. and Europe, which drove strong trading volumes across all of our venues, setting new records for orders and executions. Fast forward to the third quarter of 2012 and we were at multiyear lows in terms of volatility.
In conjunction with this decline in volatility, off-exchange trading has increased more than 4% as the orders internalized more client flow in these lower-volatility markets. We continue to be frustrated with this trend and are troubled that the U.S. equity markets have gotten more opaque while the value of the public markets continues to be diminished.
Moving to the upper-right quadrant, we illustrate the decreased need to manage risk on the short end of the curve, with rates at or near 0 and no indication from central banks that rates will be going up before 2014. Open interest is down in the front 4 quarterly tax [ph] compared to 18 months ago, but as you move out on the curve, we see more favorable trends in open interest.
Lastly, on the lower-right quadrant. While our principal trading venues have faced challenging operating conditions, our market share across U.S. equity options, European cash and U.S. cash has actually remained fairly stable and, in the case of European cash, has even increased. U.S. equities market share is also relatively strong given the aforementioned increase in off-exchange trading. So in summary, market share in our primary venues has remained stable or improved, but this has been overshadowed by deleveraging in a more typically seasonally slow summer quarter.
Please turn to Slide 5 for me. At the same time, there's plenty within our control, and Slide 5 illustrates the progress that we are making in executing against our strategy. First of all, we need to find areas for growth and diversification. We have several new product development and growth initiatives underway that should improve the company's position in the near future. We're working to launch a full-service CCP by June of 2013. More on that in another slide or 2. Our listings franchise continues to build momentum especially in terms of technology market share.
We are in the process of revamping our global data agreements, which we expect will result in additional revenue beginning in 2013. The Bank of China agreement that we recently signed is not just another MOU but a wide-ranging partnership that will, among other things, make Bank of China a general clearing member of NYSE Liffe. We are continuing to launch new products and expand participation on NYSE Liffe U.S. with the onboarding of 2 new clearing members. And lastly, we are continuing to roll out new futures products like the Russell Europe SMID 300 Index, the new mini MSCI contracts and 3-year mid-curve options on Sterling and Euribor which we launched in July.
Second, we need to enhance our operating leverage. We continue to show cost discipline, as illustrated by our results, which Mike will outline in more detail later. Additionally, having unwound NYSE Blue previously, we have now agreed with our partner Caisse des Dépôts in France to unwind our 60-40 joint venture BlueNext. We are also moving ahead with our shoring initiative, which will lead to opportunities to rationalize our global real estate footprint.
Thirdly, we remain committed to deploying capital in a shareholder-friendly way. In addition to the 2012 dividend and buyback that Mike will touch on, we are continuing to look at opportunities to shift things in businesses that do not support our strategic objectives. We will be looking to divest all or at least a portion of our stakes in LCH.Clearnet and MCX at the appropriate time.
Please turn to Slide 6 for me. On Slide 6, we go a little deeper into our Derivatives business. On the top half of the slide, we show the development of the MSCI index futures on Bclear. Year-to-date average daily volume is around 7,000 contracts a day, which is 82% above last year, and open interest is over 200,000 contracts, up 91% versus the prior year.
On the bottom half of the slide, we highlighted selected trends in our fixed income businesses where we are beginning to see some semblance of improvement while the market remains challenging. STIR futures open interest is showing good growth of 35% since the lows of December of 2011. The long-term growth trend in Long Gilt futures volume continues, with ADV up 6% year-over-year. And trading in Short Gilt futures is also picking up, with ADV in the third quarter up 29% sequentially. Turning to our Swapnote product: Our new market-maker program is fueling growth with strong volumes in Q3. ADV is up 30% quarter-over-quarter and is up 26% year-over-year, with open interest up 9% versus the third quarter of 2011.
We also launched 3-year mid-curve options on Euribor and Sterling in July, as I mentioned a minute ago. The Euribor 3-year mid-curve option is one of the fastest-growing new products for NYSE Liffe on record. In the first few months of trading, open interest is approaching 385,000 contracts, and ADV of 23,000 contracts. 
Lastly, I thought I'd give you an update on NYSE Liffe here in the U.S. where we're launching new products and expanding the number of clearing members on NYPC.
Our mini MSCI futures continue to be a strong growth story since NYSE Liffe U.S. was granted the exclusive license. Volume and open interest in the products have more than doubled since last year, and new end users are participating in our emerging and EAFE products as a result of the increased liquidity. Due to customer demand, we launched new futures on the MSCI World index, MSCI Emerging Markets Latin America index and the MSCI Canada index all in Q3. In July, we launched futures on the DTCC GCF Repo Index, which continues to gain momentum with a diverse range of new market participants. ADV since launch is just over 3,000 contracts a day and more recently has grown to over 5,000 contracts a day, and open interest is rapidly approaching 50,000 contracts.
Finally, as I alluded to earlier, JPMorgan and BNP went live as NYPC clearing members during the third quarter of 2012. As members of NYPC, they will be able to realize savings through the innovative single-pot cross-margining model that is unique to NYPC and its numbers.
Please turn to Slide 7. On Slide 7, we provide you with an update on our NYSE Clearing initiative. We filed the application for our new London clearing house with the FSA and are well into the build phase for a fully in-source clearinghouse, with a targeted completion date of June of next year. This will generate cost savings from June and revenue synergies from early 2014.
With EMIR's new regulatory guidelines in place, all CCPs within the EU are put in a challenging position in terms of financial resources and operational requirements. In addition to anticipating a consolidation of existing CCPs, a key differentiator for NYSE Clearing is that our full-service CCP will be ""new to market."" We are building our clearinghouse from the bottom up, so from the start, it will reflect the new EMIR guidelines. With all CCPs working to change their current systems to the revised principles, we certainly believe that building our CCP with all the initial requirements from the very beginning gives us certain advantages and flexibility over the competition. In the future, our newly built platform should allow us to innovate faster our new products as well.
In the second quarter, we selected and established third-party risk and collateral system provider. This third party has consistently been recognized as a leader in derivative software development, risk management and processing for both CCPs as well as investment banks and end users. We are now working on system integration with them.
We also completed the delivery schedule of key IP releases. This sets a time line which our clearing and technology teams are working diligently to meet.
Lastly, before year end, we will be engaging with all the clearing members of NYSE Liffe Clearing. We have already circulated a detailed service subscription of our CCP and the proposed business model. Once we've completed the in-sourcing, we can then extend our clearing offering, which will include migrating our continental derivatives markets in early 2014 and launching OTC clearing services in late 2013. Expanding the clearing offering will generate incremental clearing fees for us but will also provide significant offsets and capital savings for our customers as well. The single pan-European clearing platform will be able to deliver considerable operational benefits for all of our clients.
Please turn to Slide 8. I'm going to shift here to the IPO market. And on this slide, you'll see that the IPO market continues to be strong, with NYSE Euronext leading the way in capital raising. The Listings franchise has continued to strengthen, with a great showing in the number of IPOs and a pipeline which continuously builds momentum. We are proud of how our brand has been able to extend its footprint both in the U.S. and into the global community.
I'd like to share with you some of the noteworthy accomplishments that we've had recently. We're #1 in global IPOs and follow-on proceeds, with over 30% more IPO proceeds and nearly 4x more follow-on proceeds than our nearest competitor. In the third quarter, we priced 19 IPOs, raising almost $10 billion collectively, while our U.S. competitor priced 17 IPOs, with a little less than $2 billion collectively. Year-to-date through October, we have captured 55% of the U.S. technology IPO market share. We welcomed 2 new technology IPOs in the third quarter of 2012 and 4 new tech IPOs in the month of October.
The IPO market has slowed after the Facebook debut, but it has picked up again quite nicely. October was the most active month for IPOs in the U.S. so far this year, and we want -- we won more than 2/3 of the deals. These included some of the biggest and most successful IPOs of the year, Workday and Realogy. 
We are also the leading exchange for international offerings year-to-date, with $6.3 billion in proceeds raised. Some of the largest international players are choosing our market in addition to their own local market, including Santander Mexico and Banco BTG Pactual. 
Please turn to Slide 9. On this slide, we have an update on our technology services business. Over the last few years, we have assembled a superior portfolio of assets, and the long-term strategic plan has been to evolve the commercial technology business from a product and service provider to a client-focused solutions provider. Unfortunately during this transition, we hit a period of compression in financial technology spending as clients' cost containment initiatives were prioritized over technology innovation and footprint expansion. Our commercial technology business has been making slow incremental progress but are underperforming relative to our expectations. However, we do have enough visibility into the business that we expect to return to top and bottom line growth in 2013. These plans notwithstanding, however, the challenges this year have taken us offtrack for the $1 billion revenue target which we previously announced as being a 2015 goal.
Given the softness in revenue generation, we have been focused on managing our costs effectively, a silver lining if the clients are in a transitional state, which will eventually result in moving their model to an outsourced solution. We expect this to create a much greater opportunity that we are well positioned to capture. With the new leadership of Jon Robson, I am confident that we have the right person in the seat and one who shares our vision for the future of the business. In the meantime, Jon and the team are working on a detailed plan to return us to growth. And Jon will be joining us on the earnings call in February to provide you with his insights as to the future of the business.
In the third quarter, we signed a landmark deal with Russell Investments to fully manage Russell's Tick platform, content and distribution. More recently, we have begun revising global data agreements which we anticipate will result in more data products and higher market data revenue. And lastly, we announced yesterday that we have formed a new company with the Americas Trading Group in Brazil to develop a new liquidity center targeting the Brazilian market. NYSE Technologies will provide the technology for the company on commercial terms, and we will have an equity share in the venture. But contrary to reports overnight, we will not be contributing capital.
Lastly, on Slide 10, before I turn it over to Mike. I wanted to update you on a few regulatory and macro issues that are affecting our industries and many of our issuers. As always, we are leading our industry from the front on these issues. I won't address everything on this slide, but let me touch on a few important highlights.
First, in Europe, with regard to MiFid and MiFIR. While there are many more milestones ahead in the process, we are pleased with where things currently stand in the European Parliament. Of particular note, Articles 28 and 29 have been restricted to the cash markets only, which makes sense given where the cash markets are in terms of maturation.
In terms of the financial transaction tax, the proposed EU-wide tax was rejected in June. However, 11 member states have since expressed an agreement to work together on a potential FTT. Scope, territorial reach and technical characteristics of that proposal are not yet known, but we are continuing to make our voice heard on the issue. In France, an FTT was implemented on August 1, and while we have seen some reduction in volumes, it has been manageable but we continue to monitor it.
Turning to the right side of the slide and the U.S. As you know, U.S. market structure has become a widely debated topic in recent months. In my view, this is an appropriate conversation to have as investor confidence remains at record-low levels. This is in part due to macro uncertainty, which has caused a lot of investors to move to the sidelines, but it's also at least partially driven by a lack of confidence in the underlying market structure. Markets appear too complex and fragmented for individual investors, and there has been a dramatic rise in off-exchange trading which we believe harms the price and scheduling process. We believe the right thing to do is to engage in a holistic review of market structure with all participants to more closely examine some of the unintended consequences of the framework under which we operate.
At the same time, we remain committed to demonstrating leadership in the industry. One example of this was the industry's response to Knight Capital this past summer, which we helped spearhead. But in a letter to the SEC dated September 28, we outlined the collaboratively designed concept of the kill switch that would allow an exchange to suspend or drop order flow from a member firm or trading partner whose trades exceeded a preset risk limit.
The second more recent and obvious example of our industry leadership that we demonstrated was in response to Hurricane Sandy.
Finally, we are continuing to use our platform to advocate on important issues like the fiscal health of the United States and job creation, the latter of which we think is really about access to capital for small- and medium-sized companies.
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike for a review of the quarter's financial results. Mike?"
189274,216657872,379531,"NYSE Euronext, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2012",2012-11-06,"Earnings Calls","NYSE Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Duncan, and good morning.Slide 11 provides comparative GAAP results for the third quarter of 2012. Our GAAP EPS of $0.44 per share was the same as our non-GAAP for the quarter. In the quarter, we reported an $18 million charge from merger expens",2020,"Thanks, Duncan, and good morning.
Slide 11 provides comparative GAAP results for the third quarter of 2012. Our GAAP EPS of $0.44 per share was the same as our non-GAAP for the quarter. In the quarter, we reported an $18 million charge from merger expenses and exit costs also related to P 14 efficiency initiatives. This was mitigated by some discrete tax benefits related to the reduction in the U.K. tax rates from 25% to 23%.
Our review of our financial results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs and discrete tax items.
Slide 12 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the quarter. Our financial results were impacted by the dramatic decline in trading volumes compared to the third quarter of 2011 which benefited from a spike in volatility, as Duncan discussed earlier. Net revenues on a reported basis were down 21% year-over-year and were 14% lower year-to-date. Transaction or volume-based revenues declined 35% year-over-year, which was somewhat offset by the late Q2 acquisition of Corpedia and slightly higher listing revenues. Costs were lower by $28 million or 7% for the quarter and are 5% lower year-to-date on a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis. For the third quarter, 38% of our other operating expenses were denominated in either euros or pounds, 61% in U.S. dollars and another 1% in other currencies.
Based on the current projections for profits and changes to U.K. tax rates, we now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 24% for the full year 2012, so the 21% effective tax rate in the quarter was the result of a tax rate true-up to adjust the year-to-date tax rate to 24% from 25%, adding $0.02 in EPS to our Q3 results.
Diluted share count was reduced by 16 million shares to 247 million this quarter.
Slide 13 provides our consolidated and segment results on a currency neutral basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened this quarter versus prior year for both the euro and the British pound by 12% and 2%, respectively. For the third quarter, 43% of our net revenues were denominated in either euros or pounds. Currency impact on net revenue for the quarter was a negative $20 million versus prior year and unfavorable by $4 million versus the previous quarter. Foreign exchange contributed an unfavorable $10 million to operating income this quarter versus prior year.
On a currency neutral basis, third quarter net revenues were down 18% and operating income decreased 37% versus the third quarter of 2011. Operationally, revenues for our Derivatives and Cash Trading and Listings businesses decreased 26% and 17%, respectively, while our commercial technology revenues were down 6%.
Slides 14 to 15 detail the financial performance for our Derivatives segment. Derivatives revenue in the third quarter of $164 million was lower by 27% year-over-year and down 10% sequentially, mostly attributable to lower trading volumes. Expenses, on a reported basis, were essentially flat but were actually lower when you adjust for the investment we are making in our U.K. clearing initiative. Derivatives accounted for 29% of our consolidated net revenues and 35% of our operating income.
Revenue capture for NYSE Liffe was lower both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The decline year-over-year was primarily due to modified pricing in fourth quarter of 2011 for the trading of individual equity options and index futures in Amsterdam and Belgium. The decrease compared to Q2 was principally due to declines in single-stock futures Bclear revenue, which is seasonally stronger in the second quarter due to the dividend arbitrage trades. These revenues are included in the revenue capture calculation, but the Bclear volumes are not.
Capture for the U.S. options business is also lower. The decline in capture was principally due to the Penny Pilot pricing changes on Arca this quarter. The decline quarter-over-quarter was principally due to the Penny Pilot pricing changes and a mix shift weighted by higher market maker participation on Amex which has cap fees. We have eliminated caps on dividend trades beginning November 1.
Similarly, Slides 16 and 17 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading and Listings accounted for 50% of our consolidated net revenues and 53% of our operating income in the third quarter. Cash Trading and Listings net revenues was $282 million, down 20% versus the prior year period and down 6% compared to the second quarter of 2012. European cash market share across our 4 primary markets, which excludes off-exchange trading volume, increased to 68% in the third quarter, up from 66% in the prior year and the second quarter of 2012.
In U.S. cash equities, our market share across all tapes increased slightly sequentially but is down 200 basis points year-over-year. Non-exchange traded share or TRF share remains elevated at 32% of the U.S. equities market, up from 28% in the prior year. In response to the growth in off-exchange trading, we have launched the Retail Liquidity Provider program in Q3, which currently trades about 6 million shares a day and has shown promise.
Revenue capture for U.S. cash decreased to $0.04 per 100 shares traded and -- for Q3, favorable to the $0.038 recorded in the third quarter of 2011 but below the $0.043 cents in Q3 2011 (sic) [Q2 2012]. The increase year-over-year was driven by a favorable mix and selected pricing changes. The decrease quarter-over-quarter was due to client mix, with certain large clients hitting volume tiers with favorable pricing.
Strong second quarter also benefited from the Russell rebalancing in June. We are implementing several initiatives, which should increase the capture for Q4.
Revenue capture for European cash on a per-transaction basis decreased to $0.54 from $0.64 in the third quarter of 2011 but increased from $0.52 in the third (sic) [second] quarter of 2012. Decline year-over-year was primarily driven by foreign exchange and declines in average daily value traded and average trade sizes, which has resulted in an increase in the number of transactions per day, artificially depressing our revenue capture on a per-transaction basis. The increase compared to the second quarter of 2012 was driven by a favorable mix over the platform.
Slide 18 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. This segment accounted for 20% of our net revenues and 12% of our operating income in the third quarter of 2012. Segment revenue was $113 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $12 million from Q3 prior year. At constant exchange rates, revenues were down $7 million or 6% on the prior year. Prior year third quarter did benefit from $5 million in onetime platform sales to Warsaw and Tokyo Stock Exchanges. As expected, technology expenses were below second quarter and prior year levels as a result of proactive efforts to manage costs given the macro headwinds.
The top line growth in this segment, as Duncan discussed earlier, has been below our expectations due to the constricted technology spending environment. While we do not expect real growth this year, we do expect Q4 revenue and operating margins will be nicely above Q3 levels and look optimistically towards 2013.
Slide 19 illustrates the progress we've made toward the Project 14 efficiency stream. Costs are below $400 million for the first time in years. Current period expenses of $388 million are down 7% year-over-year and down $8 million quarter-over-quarter. Year-to-date, we have saved $82 million of our Project 14 efficiency goal, representing 33% of the $250 million in annualized savings. We continue to be disciplined and diligent with costs by reviewing our portfolio, streamlining our business model and simplifying our technology architecture.
Looking forward, we have received regulatory approval to consolidate and redefine our market operations, functions and teams. The new approach is aimed to utilize our expertise in multi-market operations in trading, product oversight, as a competitive advantage in our business model.
We have planned to integrate Corporate Board Member and Corpedia into a unified corporate services offerings. We are unwinding BlueNext and evaluating other nonperforming products in the portfolio.
In the IT area, we continue to explore shoring opportunities, system architecture harmonization and ways to more efficiently utilize our data center capacity. And lastly, we are also exploring a series of initiatives to rationalize our global real estate footprint.
Slide 20 provides a reconciliation of our underlying cost base and updates our 2012 cost guidance. Q3 reported expenses of $388 million, which -- at the P 14 currency rates resulted in a rebased cost of $383 million in Q3 and $1.2 billion year-to-date. We spent a total of $11 million on growth initiatives during the quarter and $31 million year-to-date. This translates into third quarter core expenses of $382 million and $1.169 billion year-to-date.
Expenses in the quarter included $5 million related to our settlement with the SEC on issues related to exchange market data. We also had several onetime expense benefits, which mitigated the impact.
We are updating our full year expense guidance for strategic initiatives as follows. As our clearinghouse bid -- build begins to take shape and accelerate, it has become clear that we will be incurring higher-than-anticipated costs for the build out of our London clearinghouse. This is due in part to the complexity of the build, more regulations on client separation and the new EMIR standards and preparing for the OTC opportunity. We now expect to spend $20 million of operating expense this year on our clearing efforts. Capital spending will pick up significantly in Q4 as we are now well into the build out phase of this initiative.
Corpedia is a 2012 acquisition, and our second half spending is all incremental to pre-acquisition guidance. Of course, this acquisition also contributes incremental revenues. And with NYSE's second half growth curtailed, we have taken actions to ensure that costs are also reduced to levels below last year. As a result, we expect no incremental variable spending for NYSE beyond what was reported in the first half.
As we move to the end of the year, we will also begin to incur some transitional costs in concert with our IT shoring activities. These transitional costs will be segregated and reported separately particularly as efforts accelerate into 2013. We will provide more quantification in February on our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call.
We are revising downward our full year 2012 guidance to between 1-6-0-3 million and 1-6-1-2 million on a constant dollar basis, using rates of $1.35 to EUR 1 and $1.60 to GBP 1. We also expect our core expense base to be between $1,559 million and $1,568 million, which is about $100 million below our 2011 expense base of $1,666 million.
Slide 21 details our cash and deposition as of September 30, 2012. Gross debt at September 30 was $2.5 billion, and we had about $350 million in cash. Our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio increased to 2.4x, reflecting weak EBITDA generation, share buybacks and the traditional weak Q3 cash flows driven by the biannual Section 31 fee reimbursement.
We are pleased with the outcome of our recent refinancing. In total, we raised $850 million in a new 5-year note, with a 2% coupon. This is comprised of refinancing of our $750 million U.S. bond and $80 million of our Eurobond that was tendered during the refinancing process. This will result in approximately $15 million and $24 million in interest expense in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
Capital expenditures were $41 million in the quarter and $125 million year-to-date. Despite this low level of 9-month spending versus our prior full year guidance of $200 million, we do expect a significantly higher level of capital spending in Q4 as we accelerate the build out of our clearing facility and complete the redesign of our New York trading floor.
We executed $120 million of stock repurchases in the third quarter, retiring 4.7 million shares at an average price of $25.46. Year-to-date, we have retired 15.9 million shares.
Last week, the board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2012, which is payable on December 28.
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Duncan for closing remarks."

We also remain focused and disciplined with regard to our cost base. And as Mike just articulated, we are well ahead of our savings commitment for 2012. And finally, we will continue to look at opportunities to redeploy capital through the divestment of non-strategic stakes.

Anyway, so my question is on expenses, Michael. So you appear well ahead of the Project 14 expense targets for not only -- well, for 2012. If you look at your guidance here, it looks like you got a pretty -- a nice uptick in 4Q expenses to the number of above $14 million at the midpoint. So I guess the question is, can we expect incremental savings beyond what you've laid out in Project 14? And can you -- I know you've talked about the 4Q run rate, but is that all just from sort of the extra clearing cost being built in?"

You're accurate in your assessment of the fourth quarter, we expect the savings to continue. And as I indicated, we expect to be about $100 million favorable for the year against the $250 million. So again, I think we'd like to defer that to the February call where we provide a little more guidance about the upcoming year.

There's the consolidated tape revenue. There's the proprietary data. There's U.S. versus Europe. And we don't actually break down where those individual pieces are. So part of the reason is for our market data weakness has been that TTA [ph] is down and as volumes have been weak and more goes to TRF. What we're looking at is some consistency with what our competitors are charging, particularly for example, in Europe, for some non-display things. Remember, in Europe, the tradition has been you charge by terminals. The terminal numbers have gone down as investments sank and our customers in general have decreased the number of terminals. But a lot of our competitors are charging for non-display, which is meaning direct data feeds, sort of more consistent with what happens in the U.S. But some of this is just consistency. Some of it is enforcing of compliance, which I think has been a challenge particularly in Europe due to ambiguous policies that we are cleaning up. And some of it is for things that we don't charge for that our clients do charge -- that our competitors do charge for. So we expect that some of those fees will go into effect very shortly. In fact, I think some of them went in, in November, so you'll start to see partial results in the fourth quarter. I don't know, Mike, but we're not giving -- going to give specific granular guidance."

So first, to start at the 30,000-foot level, I think the long-term vision hasn't changed in terms of what the business can be. Secondly, I do honestly believe that as so many of the clients are in a state of their own transition as they reinvent their own business models, and they think about managing their own expense bases, obviously the complexity of their infrastructure continues to be something that we hear regularly about from them. That is something they would like to manage more efficiently and more cost effectively. So I think we are well positioned to do that. What's a little more difficult to predict is when the decision-making at some of the potential target customers will take place. As we alluded to in our remarks, the reason we're backing away from the previously stated objective that we thought we could achieve by 2015 is that, when we made that statement, we did not anticipate capital market spending for technology being down 15% to 20% this year, well, like it is. So I think we have to reevaluate that. Jon and his team, Jon Robson and his team, are going through all of that. We do believe in a long-term vision. We've said from the beginning that it would probably be augmented by some acquisition, so we're not going to hesitate to look at a few things like that, and we'll be thoughtful about that. So I think we'll give a more detailed outlook for what we think that business can be in the next call. In the meantime, in terms of some of the immediate impact, anything you want to add to what you said to the previous question about kind of when some of this will start showing up in our result [indiscernible]?"

The piece that we're building for June of 2013 is the treasury and risk management piece but we already provide clearing services for the products that we trade now in the U.K. So we -- because of that status, we already have a good bit of capital set aside. It's roughly USD 180 million, about 1/3 of which is for clearing activities and 2/3 of which is for exchange activities. Having worked with the FSA and having interpreted the new requirements that will be in place as we add the functionality in the clearinghouse and the rules change around that, our expectation is that $180 million number will go to something that looks like $350 million. And of that increase of $170 million, the majority of that will come on the clearing side. So if today it's $180 million and it's 1/3, 2/3 clearing exchange, it -- we expect it will be around $350 million by this time next year and it would be a little more than 50% of that dedicated to the clearing side and a little less than 50% dedicated to the exchange side.

If you didn't get to ask a question, Mike and team will follow up with you guys throughout the day. So thank you for your attention on the call this morning. Further to the competitive landscape, let me start with the derivatives -- with the interest rate derivatives first. As we've learned firsthand, it's pretty difficult to dislodge an incumbent's liquidity. And I think we're trying to do that here in the U.S. And we're not just competing on price or technology alone, we're -- we actually think we have a pretty unique value proposition given the capitally efficient clearing model. And in spite of that, it has proven difficult to dislodge the incumbent's liquidity. Having said that, you -- we take all of these approaches seriously, and we pay close attention to them, we monitor them closely, we listen to what the clients are looking for. And -- but the experience in the industry tells us that competing only on price or technology tends to be a losing proposition. In terms of The Order Machine, with some of the equity options on the continent, we have been in dialogue with some of the other market participants. I think there are different ways we can approach that one. We have responded earlier this year by adjusting fees on some of those products. And I think that is an initiative that needs to be taken seriously. And we -- you can safely assume we are in dialogue with market participants and the purveyors of that alternative as well as we try to find ways perhaps to work together instead of against one another. So more to come on that at a future date, and hopefully, that addresses the question.
Okay, so thanks, everybody, for dialing in this morning. We're going to let you all get back to work, and we're going to do the same here. And as I said, Mike and Stephen and the team will follow up with any of you who want the one-on-ones throughout the day.
Thanks again. And I hope everyone is -- in this area at least, is slowly but surely recovering from Sandy. Thanks a lot. Bye."

Our town doesn't have any power so I guess we're going to be doing it old-school today, but we'll -- it -- we're going to make sure we do that tonight.
Before I get into the results, I do want to take a few minutes to talk about Hurricane Sandy. It was a pretty challenging week for our community here at NYSE Euronext and many of the communities in and around the East Coast. However, I couldn't be more proud of our teams that worked here nonstop over really the last week or 10 days. As usual, we led the industry from the front in helping to build a consensus to close the markets last Monday and Tuesday, which I firmly believe was the right thing to do. And with Wednesday's historic reopening, I can attribute that to the result of truly heroic efforts on the part of many of our key people. Not only did we reopen the market smoothly when the entire surrounding area was still in darkness but we had 3 IPOs come to market last Friday, which is a testament to the resiliency of the U.S. markets.
So now let me focus on the third quarter. During the quarter, we made significant progress with new product development and our key initiatives that will drive future growth, and we'll highlight those throughout the presentation that Mike and I will do. We're focusing on those levers of our business model that are in our control and that we can influence to deliver value for our shareholders over the long term, well beyond the current lackluster trading environment. As you know, we've made a lot of headway over the last few years in diversifying our business model, a large portion of our -- although we've made a lot of headway, a large portion of our revenues remain linked to trading, and our derivatives franchise in Europe has been especially impacted by macro conditions and deleveraging, driving lower levels of hedging and speculation. But contrary to what many are saying today, this is not a structural shift in the market in my opinion, and we see the current climate as an opportunity to focus the company for growth when macro conditions return to normal. At the same time, we need to remain focused on further diversification into our technology, data and post-trade businesses.
In some respects, I feel about NYSE Euronext the way I do about the U.S. economy, well positioned to grow under the right conditions. But for the moment, we are still facing strong macroeconomic headwinds and our results for the third quarter reflect this. We reported $0.44 for the quarter and $559 million in revenue compared to $0.71 on $704 million in revenue in the prior year third quarter.
Please turn to Slide 4. On Slide 4, I thought we'd share some year-on-year comparisons of the past 2 third quarters. The third quarter of 2011 was characterized by event-driven volatility in the U.S. and Europe, which drove strong trading volumes across all of our venues, setting new records for orders and executions. Fast forward to the third quarter of 2012 and we were at multiyear lows in terms of volatility.
In conjunction with this decline in volatility, off-exchange trading has increased more than 4% as the orders internalized more client flow in these lower-volatility markets. We continue to be frustrated with this trend and are troubled that the U.S. equity markets have gotten more opaque while the value of the public markets continues to be diminished.
Moving to the upper-right quadrant, we illustrate the decreased need to manage risk on the short end of the curve, with rates at or near 0 and no indication from central banks that rates will be going up before 2014. Open interest is down in the front 4 quarterly tax [ph] compared to 18 months ago, but as you move out on the curve, we see more favorable trends in open interest.
Lastly, on the lower-right quadrant. While our principal trading venues have faced challenging operating conditions, our market share across U.S. equity options, European cash and U.S. cash has actually remained fairly stable and, in the case of European cash, has even increased. U.S. equities market share is also relatively strong given the aforementioned increase in off-exchange trading. So in summary, market share in our primary venues has remained stable or improved, but this has been overshadowed by deleveraging in a more typically seasonally slow summer quarter.
Please turn to Slide 5 for me. At the same time, there's plenty within our control, and Slide 5 illustrates the progress that we are making in executing against our strategy. First of all, we need to find areas for growth and diversification. We have several new product development and growth initiatives underway that should improve the company's position in the near future. We're working to launch a full-service CCP by June of 2013. More on that in another slide or 2. Our listings franchise continues to build momentum especially in terms of technology market share.
We are in the process of revamping our global data agreements, which we expect will result in additional revenue beginning in 2013. The Bank of China agreement that we recently signed is not just another MOU but a wide-ranging partnership that will, among other things, make Bank of China a general clearing member of NYSE Liffe. We are continuing to launch new products and expand participation on NYSE Liffe U.S. with the onboarding of 2 new clearing members. And lastly, we are continuing to roll out new futures products like the Russell Europe SMID 300 Index, the new mini MSCI contracts and 3-year mid-curve options on Sterling and Euribor which we launched in July.
Second, we need to enhance our operating leverage. We continue to show cost discipline, as illustrated by our results, which Mike will outline in more detail later. Additionally, having unwound NYSE Blue previously, we have now agreed with our partner Caisse des Dépôts in France to unwind our 60-40 joint venture BlueNext. We are also moving ahead with our shoring initiative, which will lead to opportunities to rationalize our global real estate footprint.
Thirdly, we remain committed to deploying capital in a shareholder-friendly way. In addition to the 2012 dividend and buyback that Mike will touch on, we are continuing to look at opportunities to shift things in businesses that do not support our strategic objectives. We will be looking to divest all or at least a portion of our stakes in LCH.Clearnet and MCX at the appropriate time.
Please turn to Slide 6 for me. On Slide 6, we go a little deeper into our Derivatives business. On the top half of the slide, we show the development of the MSCI index futures on Bclear. Year-to-date average daily volume is around 7,000 contracts a day, which is 82% above last year, and open interest is over 200,000 contracts, up 91% versus the prior year.
On the bottom half of the slide, we highlighted selected trends in our fixed income businesses where we are beginning to see some semblance of improvement while the market remains challenging. STIR futures open interest is showing good growth of 35% since the lows of December of 2011. The long-term growth trend in Long Gilt futures volume continues, with ADV up 6% year-over-year. And trading in Short Gilt futures is also picking up, with ADV in the third quarter up 29% sequentially. Turning to our Swapnote product: Our new market-maker program is fueling growth with strong volumes in Q3. ADV is up 30% quarter-over-quarter and is up 26% year-over-year, with open interest up 9% versus the third quarter of 2011.
We also launched 3-year mid-curve options on Euribor and Sterling in July, as I mentioned a minute ago. The Euribor 3-year mid-curve option is one of the fastest-growing new products for NYSE Liffe on record. In the first few months of trading, open interest is approaching 385,000 contracts, and ADV of 23,000 contracts. 
Lastly, I thought I'd give you an update on NYSE Liffe here in the U.S. where we're launching new products and expanding the number of clearing members on NYPC.
Our mini MSCI futures continue to be a strong growth story since NYSE Liffe U.S. was granted the exclusive license. Volume and open interest in the products have more than doubled since last year, and new end users are participating in our emerging and EAFE products as a result of the increased liquidity. Due to customer demand, we launched new futures on the MSCI World index, MSCI Emerging Markets Latin America index and the MSCI Canada index all in Q3. In July, we launched futures on the DTCC GCF Repo Index, which continues to gain momentum with a diverse range of new market participants. ADV since launch is just over 3,000 contracts a day and more recently has grown to over 5,000 contracts a day, and open interest is rapidly approaching 50,000 contracts.
Finally, as I alluded to earlier, JPMorgan and BNP went live as NYPC clearing members during the third quarter of 2012. As members of NYPC, they will be able to realize savings through the innovative single-pot cross-margining model that is unique to NYPC and its numbers.
Please turn to Slide 7. On Slide 7, we provide you with an update on our NYSE Clearing initiative. We filed the application for our new London clearing house with the FSA and are well into the build phase for a fully in-source clearinghouse, with a targeted completion date of June of next year. This will generate cost savings from June and revenue synergies from early 2014.
With EMIR's new regulatory guidelines in place, all CCPs within the EU are put in a challenging position in terms of financial resources and operational requirements. In addition to anticipating a consolidation of existing CCPs, a key differentiator for NYSE Clearing is that our full-service CCP will be ""new to market."" We are building our clearinghouse from the bottom up, so from the start, it will reflect the new EMIR guidelines. With all CCPs working to change their current systems to the revised principles, we certainly believe that building our CCP with all the initial requirements from the very beginning gives us certain advantages and flexibility over the competition. In the future, our newly built platform should allow us to innovate faster our new products as well.
In the second quarter, we selected and established third-party risk and collateral system provider. This third party has consistently been recognized as a leader in derivative software development, risk management and processing for both CCPs as well as investment banks and end users. We are now working on system integration with them.
We also completed the delivery schedule of key IP releases. This sets a time line which our clearing and technology teams are working diligently to meet.
Lastly, before year end, we will be engaging with all the clearing members of NYSE Liffe Clearing. We have already circulated a detailed service subscription of our CCP and the proposed business model. Once we've completed the in-sourcing, we can then extend our clearing offering, which will include migrating our continental derivatives markets in early 2014 and launching OTC clearing services in late 2013. Expanding the clearing offering will generate incremental clearing fees for us but will also provide significant offsets and capital savings for our customers as well. The single pan-European clearing platform will be able to deliver considerable operational benefits for all of our clients.
Please turn to Slide 8. I'm going to shift here to the IPO market. And on this slide, you'll see that the IPO market continues to be strong, with NYSE Euronext leading the way in capital raising. The Listings franchise has continued to strengthen, with a great showing in the number of IPOs and a pipeline which continuously builds momentum. We are proud of how our brand has been able to extend its footprint both in the U.S. and into the global community.
I'd like to share with you some of the noteworthy accomplishments that we've had recently. We're #1 in global IPOs and follow-on proceeds, with over 30% more IPO proceeds and nearly 4x more follow-on proceeds than our nearest competitor. In the third quarter, we priced 19 IPOs, raising almost $10 billion collectively, while our U.S. competitor priced 17 IPOs, with a little less than $2 billion collectively. Year-to-date through October, we have captured 55% of the U.S. technology IPO market share. We welcomed 2 new technology IPOs in the third quarter of 2012 and 4 new tech IPOs in the month of October.
The IPO market has slowed after the Facebook debut, but it has picked up again quite nicely. October was the most active month for IPOs in the U.S. so far this year, and we want -- we won more than 2/3 of the deals. These included some of the biggest and most successful IPOs of the year, Workday and Realogy. 
We are also the leading exchange for international offerings year-to-date, with $6.3 billion in proceeds raised. Some of the largest international players are choosing our market in addition to their own local market, including Santander Mexico and Banco BTG Pactual. 
Please turn to Slide 9. On this slide, we have an update on our technology services business. Over the last few years, we have assembled a superior portfolio of assets, and the long-term strategic plan has been to evolve the commercial technology business from a product and service provider to a client-focused solutions provider. Unfortunately during this transition, we hit a period of compression in financial technology spending as clients' cost containment initiatives were prioritized over technology innovation and footprint expansion. Our commercial technology business has been making slow incremental progress but are underperforming relative to our expectations. However, we do have enough visibility into the business that we expect to return to top and bottom line growth in 2013. These plans notwithstanding, however, the challenges this year have taken us offtrack for the $1 billion revenue target which we previously announced as being a 2015 goal.
Given the softness in revenue generation, we have been focused on managing our costs effectively, a silver lining if the clients are in a transitional state, which will eventually result in moving their model to an outsourced solution. We expect this to create a much greater opportunity that we are well positioned to capture. With the new leadership of Jon Robson, I am confident that we have the right person in the seat and one who shares our vision for the future of the business. In the meantime, Jon and the team are working on a detailed plan to return us to growth. And Jon will be joining us on the earnings call in February to provide you with his insights as to the future of the business.
In the third quarter, we signed a landmark deal with Russell Investments to fully manage Russell's Tick platform, content and distribution. More recently, we have begun revising global data agreements which we anticipate will result in more data products and higher market data revenue. And lastly, we announced yesterday that we have formed a new company with the Americas Trading Group in Brazil to develop a new liquidity center targeting the Brazilian market. NYSE Technologies will provide the technology for the company on commercial terms, and we will have an equity share in the venture. But contrary to reports overnight, we will not be contributing capital.
Lastly, on Slide 10, before I turn it over to Mike. I wanted to update you on a few regulatory and macro issues that are affecting our industries and many of our issuers. As always, we are leading our industry from the front on these issues. I won't address everything on this slide, but let me touch on a few important highlights.
First, in Europe, with regard to MiFid and MiFIR. While there are many more milestones ahead in the process, we are pleased with where things currently stand in the European Parliament. Of particular note, Articles 28 and 29 have been restricted to the cash markets only, which makes sense given where the cash markets are in terms of maturation.
In terms of the financial transaction tax, the proposed EU-wide tax was rejected in June. However, 11 member states have since expressed an agreement to work together on a potential FTT. Scope, territorial reach and technical characteristics of that proposal are not yet known, but we are continuing to make our voice heard on the issue. In France, an FTT was implemented on August 1, and while we have seen some reduction in volumes, it has been manageable but we continue to monitor it.
Turning to the right side of the slide and the U.S. As you know, U.S. market structure has become a widely debated topic in recent months. In my view, this is an appropriate conversation to have as investor confidence remains at record-low levels. This is in part due to macro uncertainty, which has caused a lot of investors to move to the sidelines, but it's also at least partially driven by a lack of confidence in the underlying market structure. Markets appear too complex and fragmented for individual investors, and there has been a dramatic rise in off-exchange trading which we believe harms the price and scheduling process. We believe the right thing to do is to engage in a holistic review of market structure with all participants to more closely examine some of the unintended consequences of the framework under which we operate.
At the same time, we remain committed to demonstrating leadership in the industry. One example of this was the industry's response to Knight Capital this past summer, which we helped spearhead. But in a letter to the SEC dated September 28, we outlined the collaboratively designed concept of the kill switch that would allow an exchange to suspend or drop order flow from a member firm or trading partner whose trades exceeded a preset risk limit.
The second more recent and obvious example of our industry leadership that we demonstrated was in response to Hurricane Sandy.
Finally, we are continuing to use our platform to advocate on important issues like the fiscal health of the United States and job creation, the latter of which we think is really about access to capital for small- and medium-sized companies.
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike for a review of the quarter's financial results. Mike?"
189274,216657872,381267,"NYSE Euronext, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2012",2012-11-06,"Earnings Calls","NYSE Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Duncan, and good morning.Slide 11 provides comparative GAAP results for the third quarter of 2012. Our GAAP EPS of $0.44 per share was the same as our non-GAAP for the quarter. In the quarter, we reported an $18 million charge from merger expens",2020,"Thanks, Duncan, and good morning.
Slide 11 provides comparative GAAP results for the third quarter of 2012. Our GAAP EPS of $0.44 per share was the same as our non-GAAP for the quarter. In the quarter, we reported an $18 million charge from merger expenses and exit costs also related to P 14 efficiency initiatives. This was mitigated by some discrete tax benefits related to the reduction in the U.K. tax rates from 25% to 23%.
Our review of our financial results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs and discrete tax items.
Slide 12 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the quarter. Our financial results were impacted by the dramatic decline in trading volumes compared to the third quarter of 2011 which benefited from a spike in volatility, as Duncan discussed earlier. Net revenues on a reported basis were down 21% year-over-year and were 14% lower year-to-date. Transaction or volume-based revenues declined 35% year-over-year, which was somewhat offset by the late Q2 acquisition of Corpedia and slightly higher listing revenues. Costs were lower by $28 million or 7% for the quarter and are 5% lower year-to-date on a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis. For the third quarter, 38% of our other operating expenses were denominated in either euros or pounds, 61% in U.S. dollars and another 1% in other currencies.
Based on the current projections for profits and changes to U.K. tax rates, we now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 24% for the full year 2012, so the 21% effective tax rate in the quarter was the result of a tax rate true-up to adjust the year-to-date tax rate to 24% from 25%, adding $0.02 in EPS to our Q3 results.
Diluted share count was reduced by 16 million shares to 247 million this quarter.
Slide 13 provides our consolidated and segment results on a currency neutral basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened this quarter versus prior year for both the euro and the British pound by 12% and 2%, respectively. For the third quarter, 43% of our net revenues were denominated in either euros or pounds. Currency impact on net revenue for the quarter was a negative $20 million versus prior year and unfavorable by $4 million versus the previous quarter. Foreign exchange contributed an unfavorable $10 million to operating income this quarter versus prior year.
On a currency neutral basis, third quarter net revenues were down 18% and operating income decreased 37% versus the third quarter of 2011. Operationally, revenues for our Derivatives and Cash Trading and Listings businesses decreased 26% and 17%, respectively, while our commercial technology revenues were down 6%.
Slides 14 to 15 detail the financial performance for our Derivatives segment. Derivatives revenue in the third quarter of $164 million was lower by 27% year-over-year and down 10% sequentially, mostly attributable to lower trading volumes. Expenses, on a reported basis, were essentially flat but were actually lower when you adjust for the investment we are making in our U.K. clearing initiative. Derivatives accounted for 29% of our consolidated net revenues and 35% of our operating income.
Revenue capture for NYSE Liffe was lower both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The decline year-over-year was primarily due to modified pricing in fourth quarter of 2011 for the trading of individual equity options and index futures in Amsterdam and Belgium. The decrease compared to Q2 was principally due to declines in single-stock futures Bclear revenue, which is seasonally stronger in the second quarter due to the dividend arbitrage trades. These revenues are included in the revenue capture calculation, but the Bclear volumes are not.
Capture for the U.S. options business is also lower. The decline in capture was principally due to the Penny Pilot pricing changes on Arca this quarter. The decline quarter-over-quarter was principally due to the Penny Pilot pricing changes and a mix shift weighted by higher market maker participation on Amex which has cap fees. We have eliminated caps on dividend trades beginning November 1.
Similarly, Slides 16 and 17 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading and Listings accounted for 50% of our consolidated net revenues and 53% of our operating income in the third quarter. Cash Trading and Listings net revenues was $282 million, down 20% versus the prior year period and down 6% compared to the second quarter of 2012. European cash market share across our 4 primary markets, which excludes off-exchange trading volume, increased to 68% in the third quarter, up from 66% in the prior year and the second quarter of 2012.
In U.S. cash equities, our market share across all tapes increased slightly sequentially but is down 200 basis points year-over-year. Non-exchange traded share or TRF share remains elevated at 32% of the U.S. equities market, up from 28% in the prior year. In response to the growth in off-exchange trading, we have launched the Retail Liquidity Provider program in Q3, which currently trades about 6 million shares a day and has shown promise.
Revenue capture for U.S. cash decreased to $0.04 per 100 shares traded and -- for Q3, favorable to the $0.038 recorded in the third quarter of 2011 but below the $0.043 cents in Q3 2011 (sic) [Q2 2012]. The increase year-over-year was driven by a favorable mix and selected pricing changes. The decrease quarter-over-quarter was due to client mix, with certain large clients hitting volume tiers with favorable pricing.
Strong second quarter also benefited from the Russell rebalancing in June. We are implementing several initiatives, which should increase the capture for Q4.
Revenue capture for European cash on a per-transaction basis decreased to $0.54 from $0.64 in the third quarter of 2011 but increased from $0.52 in the third (sic) [second] quarter of 2012. Decline year-over-year was primarily driven by foreign exchange and declines in average daily value traded and average trade sizes, which has resulted in an increase in the number of transactions per day, artificially depressing our revenue capture on a per-transaction basis. The increase compared to the second quarter of 2012 was driven by a favorable mix over the platform.
Slide 18 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. This segment accounted for 20% of our net revenues and 12% of our operating income in the third quarter of 2012. Segment revenue was $113 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $12 million from Q3 prior year. At constant exchange rates, revenues were down $7 million or 6% on the prior year. Prior year third quarter did benefit from $5 million in onetime platform sales to Warsaw and Tokyo Stock Exchanges. As expected, technology expenses were below second quarter and prior year levels as a result of proactive efforts to manage costs given the macro headwinds.
The top line growth in this segment, as Duncan discussed earlier, has been below our expectations due to the constricted technology spending environment. While we do not expect real growth this year, we do expect Q4 revenue and operating margins will be nicely above Q3 levels and look optimistically towards 2013.
Slide 19 illustrates the progress we've made toward the Project 14 efficiency stream. Costs are below $400 million for the first time in years. Current period expenses of $388 million are down 7% year-over-year and down $8 million quarter-over-quarter. Year-to-date, we have saved $82 million of our Project 14 efficiency goal, representing 33% of the $250 million in annualized savings. We continue to be disciplined and diligent with costs by reviewing our portfolio, streamlining our business model and simplifying our technology architecture.
Looking forward, we have received regulatory approval to consolidate and redefine our market operations, functions and teams. The new approach is aimed to utilize our expertise in multi-market operations in trading, product oversight, as a competitive advantage in our business model.
We have planned to integrate Corporate Board Member and Corpedia into a unified corporate services offerings. We are unwinding BlueNext and evaluating other nonperforming products in the portfolio.
In the IT area, we continue to explore shoring opportunities, system architecture harmonization and ways to more efficiently utilize our data center capacity. And lastly, we are also exploring a series of initiatives to rationalize our global real estate footprint.
Slide 20 provides a reconciliation of our underlying cost base and updates our 2012 cost guidance. Q3 reported expenses of $388 million, which -- at the P 14 currency rates resulted in a rebased cost of $383 million in Q3 and $1.2 billion year-to-date. We spent a total of $11 million on growth initiatives during the quarter and $31 million year-to-date. This translates into third quarter core expenses of $382 million and $1.169 billion year-to-date.
Expenses in the quarter included $5 million related to our settlement with the SEC on issues related to exchange market data. We also had several onetime expense benefits, which mitigated the impact.
We are updating our full year expense guidance for strategic initiatives as follows. As our clearinghouse bid -- build begins to take shape and accelerate, it has become clear that we will be incurring higher-than-anticipated costs for the build out of our London clearinghouse. This is due in part to the complexity of the build, more regulations on client separation and the new EMIR standards and preparing for the OTC opportunity. We now expect to spend $20 million of operating expense this year on our clearing efforts. Capital spending will pick up significantly in Q4 as we are now well into the build out phase of this initiative.
Corpedia is a 2012 acquisition, and our second half spending is all incremental to pre-acquisition guidance. Of course, this acquisition also contributes incremental revenues. And with NYSE's second half growth curtailed, we have taken actions to ensure that costs are also reduced to levels below last year. As a result, we expect no incremental variable spending for NYSE beyond what was reported in the first half.
As we move to the end of the year, we will also begin to incur some transitional costs in concert with our IT shoring activities. These transitional costs will be segregated and reported separately particularly as efforts accelerate into 2013. We will provide more quantification in February on our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call.
We are revising downward our full year 2012 guidance to between 1-6-0-3 million and 1-6-1-2 million on a constant dollar basis, using rates of $1.35 to EUR 1 and $1.60 to GBP 1. We also expect our core expense base to be between $1,559 million and $1,568 million, which is about $100 million below our 2011 expense base of $1,666 million.
Slide 21 details our cash and deposition as of September 30, 2012. Gross debt at September 30 was $2.5 billion, and we had about $350 million in cash. Our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio increased to 2.4x, reflecting weak EBITDA generation, share buybacks and the traditional weak Q3 cash flows driven by the biannual Section 31 fee reimbursement.
We are pleased with the outcome of our recent refinancing. In total, we raised $850 million in a new 5-year note, with a 2% coupon. This is comprised of refinancing of our $750 million U.S. bond and $80 million of our Eurobond that was tendered during the refinancing process. This will result in approximately $15 million and $24 million in interest expense in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
Capital expenditures were $41 million in the quarter and $125 million year-to-date. Despite this low level of 9-month spending versus our prior full year guidance of $200 million, we do expect a significantly higher level of capital spending in Q4 as we accelerate the build out of our clearing facility and complete the redesign of our New York trading floor.
We executed $120 million of stock repurchases in the third quarter, retiring 4.7 million shares at an average price of $25.46. Year-to-date, we have retired 15.9 million shares.
Last week, the board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2012, which is payable on December 28.
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Duncan for closing remarks."

We also remain focused and disciplined with regard to our cost base. And as Mike just articulated, we are well ahead of our savings commitment for 2012.

Anyway, so my question is on expenses, Michael. So you appear well ahead of the Project 14 expense targets for not only -- well, for 2012. If you look at your guidance here, it looks like you got a pretty -- a nice uptick in 4Q expenses to the number of above $14 million at the midpoint. So I guess the question is, can we expect incremental savings beyond what you've laid out in Project 14? And can you -- I know you've talked about the 4Q run rate, but is that all just from sort of the extra clearing cost being built in?"

There's the consolidated tape revenue. There's the proprietary data. There's U.S. versus Europe. And we don't actually break down where those individual pieces are. So part of the reason is for our market data weakness has been that TTA [ph] is down and as volumes have been weak and more goes to TRF. What we're looking at is some consistency with what our competitors are charging, particularly for example, in Europe, for some non-display things. Remember, in Europe, the tradition has been you charge by terminals. The terminal numbers have gone down as investments sank and our customers in general have decreased the number of terminals. But a lot of our competitors are charging for non-display, which is meaning direct data feeds, sort of more consistent with what happens in the U.S. But some of this is just consistency. Some of it is enforcing of compliance, which I think has been a challenge particularly in Europe due to ambiguous policies that we are cleaning up. And some of it is for things that we don't charge for that our clients do charge -- that our competitors do charge for. So we expect that some of those fees will go into effect very shortly. In fact, I think some of them went in, in November, so you'll start to see partial results in the fourth quarter.

So first, to start at the 30,000-foot level, I think the long-term vision hasn't changed in terms of what the business can be. Secondly, I do honestly believe that as so many of the clients are in a state of their own transition as they reinvent their own business models, and they think about managing their own expense bases, obviously the complexity of their infrastructure continues to be something that we hear regularly about from them. That is something they would like to manage more efficiently and more cost effectively. So I think we are well positioned to do that. What's a little more difficult to predict is when the decision-making at some of the potential target customers will take place. As we alluded to in our remarks, the reason we're backing away from the previously stated objective that we thought we could achieve by 2015 is that, when we made that statement, we did not anticipate capital market spending for technology being down 15% to 20% this year, well, like it is. So I think we have to reevaluate that. Jon and his team, Jon Robson and his team, are going through all of that. We do believe in a long-term vision. We've said from the beginning that it would probably be augmented by some acquisition, so we're not going to hesitate to look at a few things like that, and we'll be thoughtful about that. So I think we'll give a more detailed outlook for what we think that business can be in the next call.

The piece that we're building for June of 2013 is the treasury and risk management piece but we already provide clearing services for the products that we trade now in the U.K. So we -- because of that status, we already have a good bit of capital set aside. It's roughly USD 180 million, about 1/3 of which is for clearing activities and 2/3 of which is for exchange activities. Having worked with the FSA and having interpreted the new requirements that will be in place as we add the functionality in the clearinghouse and the rules change around that, our expectation is that $180 million number will go to something that looks like $350 million. And of that increase of $170 million, the majority of that will come on the clearing side. So if today it's $180 million and it's 1/3, 2/3 clearing exchange, it -- we expect it will be around $350 million by this time next year and it would be a little more than 50% of that dedicated to the clearing side and a little less than 50% dedicated to the exchange side.

And then we have sort of market data fees and co-lo and other things like that. But that's not different than almost any of other big broker participants because they also use co-lo in direct feeds. So we're somewhat skeptical about these numbers. And we've seen these studies that are actually not consistent even between -- among themselves. So what we do believe is that any of the proposed rules that we have seen would not have material effect on our finances. In summary, Mike, I don't know if you have anything to add to that."

It will save us operating expenses because these are businesses that are in a loss position. I think what Duncan alluded to is the potential dispositions that could generate capital are the sale of our stake in MCX; as well as we have a 9% stake in LCH and as part of the LSE transaction, we've agreed to tender a portion of that. So that, if that transaction was completed, we would get cash back for that. So these are not significant numbers, probably aggregating about a little more than $100 million of capital. So we generate a lot of our free cash flow in the first 2 quarters of each year, so I think it's appropriate, as Duncan mentioned, for us to allow our board to thoroughly discuss the budgets and the business plans for next year and decide what we're going to do with the excess cash above and beyond what we pay out for our dividend. We are saying that, clearly, one of the things we have to factor in there is a little more cash for going live with our clearing."

And I think, to provide -- to put a little finer point on it, if I can: We get asked a lot, when people are reading about some of the new rules, in terms of how much more we have to set aside for the additional clearing services in the U.K. If you listen to my answer to Ed's question earlier -- I think it was Ed's question -- or Dan's question, rather, sorry. The -- it's $100 million to $150 million. The sale of MCX, the scale-down of the LCH position and the money that we will not be putting into the cutter [ph] investment by having reduced that stake from 20 to 12, collectively, more than cover the additional monies we have to set aside for clearing. We expect to be able to -- we've already made the cutter [ph] decision and we expect to be able to divest those other 2 positions early in 2013. So if you add all that up, by the time we have to set more capital aside, we will have had -- we will have more than accounted for that capital, so it shouldn't necessitate a change in other -- it shouldn't make any harder decision to think about other shareholder-friendly deployments of capital, I think, is the easiest way to say it."

If you didn't get to ask a question, Mike and team will follow up with you guys throughout the day. So thank you for your attention on the call this morning. Further to the competitive landscape, let me start with the derivatives -- with the interest rate derivatives first. As we've learned firsthand, it's pretty difficult to dislodge an incumbent's liquidity. And I think we're trying to do that here in the U.S. And we're not just competing on price or technology alone, we're -- we actually think we have a pretty unique value proposition given the capitally efficient clearing model. And in spite of that, it has proven difficult to dislodge the incumbent's liquidity. Having said that, you -- we take all of these approaches seriously, and we pay close attention to them, we monitor them closely, we listen to what the clients are looking for. And -- but the experience in the industry tells us that competing only on price or technology tends to be a losing proposition. In terms of The Order Machine, with some of the equity options on the continent, we have been in dialogue with some of the other market participants. I think there are different ways we can approach that one. We have responded earlier this year by adjusting fees on some of those products. And I think that is an initiative that needs to be taken seriously. And we -- you can safely assume we are in dialogue with market participants and the purveyors of that alternative as well as we try to find ways perhaps to work together instead of against one another. So more to come on that at a future date, and hopefully, that addresses the question.
Okay, so thanks, everybody, for dialing in this morning. We're going to let you all get back to work, and we're going to do the same here. And as I said, Mike and Stephen and the team will follow up with any of you who want the one-on-ones throughout the day.
Thanks again. And I hope everyone is -- in this area at least, is slowly but surely recovering from Sandy. Thanks a lot. Bye."
