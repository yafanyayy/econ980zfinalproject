And good morning, everyone and thank you for participating in the call today. As most of you I think all of you know I'll be retiring from PPL at the end of March so this will be my last earnings call with you. Obviously it's been a real thrill with serving PPL for the last 6 or so years as Chairman and CEO and certainly has been a highlight of my career. A lot have changed, a lot of interesting transactions throughout the sector and certainly, many many many challenges that we try to seek, finding the opportunities within the realm of challenge. 
I would say that PPL is fundamentally a very strong copy and we've made significant progress over the past few years in further strengthening the foundation, which we can continue to grow the value for the shareowners and I am real confident that we're going to see the best years of PPL ahead as a result of the work we've done over the last several years. We've got a great team in place under Bill Spence's leadership. I'm sure he'll turn that confidence into a reality. So I thank all of you on the phone for your interest in the company and for your diligence in assessing PPL's performance over the years of my tenure. 
So I wish each of you continued success and good fortune in your areas out there. And again, I think you'll see PPL flourish under its new portfolio structure and a lot of opportunities lie out there ahead for us. So today I'll talk a little, just a little bit about the overview of 2011 results and talk a little bit about our positioning for the future then Bill will provide an overview of our '11 operational performance. A review of future prospects for each of our business settings and a bit of discussion on our 2012 earnings forecast. And then Paul Farr, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide very detailed financial review before we turn to your questions. 
As you saw in the announcement, fourth quarter earnings of $0.69 per share compared with $0.73 in the fourth quarter of 2010. Earnings from ongoing operations for the fourth quarter were $0.70 per share compared with $0.83 in the same period a year ago. Our reported earnings and our earnings from ongoing operations were each $0.13 per share lower than a year ago due to dilution from the April common stock issuance. For the quarter, reported earnings and ongoing earnings were pressured by lower wholesale electricity margins at our Supply segment. 
Turning to the year end results, we announced 2011 reported earnings of $2.61 a share, an increase of $0.44 per share over 2010. Our 2011 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.72 per share compared with $3.13 per share in 2010. The '11 earnings from ongoing operations reflect dilution of $0.75 per share due to the June 2010 and the April 2011 issuances of common stock to fund the Kentucky and U.K. acquisitions. Strong '11 results were driven by solid performance in each of our business segments and I'm also pleased that we're able to announce this morning a 3% increase in our annualized dividend. Our quarterly dividend will now be $0.36 per share. 
The increase is further indication of our continued confidence in the strength of our portfolio and our prospects for future growth of the company. Before turning the call over to Bill and Paul, I would like to review some of the significant factors that position us well for the future clearly we think our business mix has shifted significantly towards rate regulated earnings providing a stability and security to our earnings forecast, dividend and credit ratings. 
Approximately 70% of our projected 2012 earnings per share will come from regulated businesses and we expect compound annual rate base growth in these businesses of nearly 8% over the next 5 years. That growth would result in an $8.1 billion increase in the asset base of our regulated companies by 2016, the equivalent of adding another large regulated utility to the portfolio. Much of this rate base growth come from planned CapEx that's already been reviewed by various regulators with very little lag in earning a return for shareowners. 
The business mix improvements we've made over the past 2 years of result in an excellent business risk profile rating from S&P, putting us in a category with only 2 other companies in our sector. So our stable earnings mix also makes us our dividend more secured against platform for continued growth and while wholesale electricity prices remain depressed, our high-quality competitive gemcitabine provides upside and stronger energy markets. Baseload plants and PJM are complemented by a flexible mix of gas part units that would position us well on the largest wholesale market in the world. 
Fuel mix of our fleet differentiates PPL from many other power producers in the sector. Diverse fuel mix provides us competitive advantages in a variety of market conditions over fleets that are heavily dependent on one fuel source. Over the past several years, I believe that our management team has consistently proven its ability to make the right strategic and tactical calls. Already our team in the U.K. has made meaningful improvements in the Midlands operations achieving the financial objectives we announced at that side of the deal was signed and subsequently financed. 
While we have accomplished a great deal, challenges certainly remain. I'm confident however, that Bill and his team of excellent executives will continue to turn these challenges into opportunities and growth for our shareowners. So I'll now turn the call over to Bill, PPL's new CEO. Bill?"

In guiding PPL through a very challenging time, Jim not only ensured the company weather challenging marketing conditions, he led the implementation of the strategy that has significantly strengthened the company. Under Jim's leadership, PPL fundamentally repositioned itself with 2 transformational acquisitions and aggressive hedging program that has added tremendous shareowner value and operational performance that ranks among the best in our industry. Congratulations, Jim, on an outstanding career and thanks for all you've done for PPL. I'm honored also to have been selected to carry on your excellent leadership and speaking of carrying on, let's next turn now to Slide 6. 
As Jim noted, 2011 was a very successful year for the company. PPL has now let 12 consecutive quarters of very solid performance and 3 consecutive years of exceeding the midpoint of our ongoing earnings guidance. And as Jim mentioned, we've competed 2 transformational acquisitions in extraordinary fashion. In 2011 we acquired and permit be finance essential networks in the U.K. we implemented our integration plan very close to targeted cost and at the high-end of our expected range of synergies we overcame extended nuclear outages in or market conditions in our Supply business and our Electric utilities in Kentucky and Pennsylvania provided solid results in a lackluster economy. 
I'll briefly review each of the 4 business segments starting with the U.K. Our WPD CEO Robert Symons and his team developed a very aggressive efficient integration plan following our acquisition of the 2 Central Networks utility operation last April converting. I'm very happy to report that all that significant operational integration is now complete and that Western Power Distribution is now serving over 7 million customers with a radical improvement in WPD Midland's operations in just 9 months. This is possibly one of the most dramatic changes ever made in the U.K. utility industry and I expect WPD Midlands will now join WPD's South less than WPD's South Wales at the U.K. front tier performers on several incentive measures. 
These dramatic improvements are appearing in 4 key areas. The percentage of customers store to service within 1 hour of the high-voltage; minutes that customers are without service; the number of customers without service for more than 18 hours; and the number of customer interruptions per 100 customers. There are charts in the appendix at today's presentation that detail some of the significant improvements. While these measures are expected to result in incentive revenue opportunities for the company beginning in 2013, customers in the Midland region of the U.K. are already seeing the benefits of our ownership and our proven operating model. 
Our experience in the first 9 months of operating the larger WPD has confirmed our belief that this acquisition will create significant benefits for our customers and PPL's shareowners. Turning back to the U.S., we achieved a significant milestone when the Kentucky Public Service Commission unanimously approve the settlement of a critical environmental cost recovery rate case for LG&E and KU. As a result of the settlement and KPSE action, we now have the approval and the cost recovery mechanism to move ahead with approximately $2.3 billion in environmental upgrades necessary at our regulated coal fire plant in Kentucky. 
The agreement provides for a 10.1% return on equity for these projects, which will be completed over the next several years. In Pennsylvania, our electric distribution operations certainly had its challenging year facing 2 of the most damaging storms in the company's history in just a 2-month period. In addition to significant flooding in some areas of our territory. In all cases our experienced and dedicated crews did an extraordinary job restoring service to customers at very difficult circumstances. In the restoration effort, we received excellent help from other utilities from our mutual assistance program and from PPL's sister companies LG&E and KU. 
Regarding customer service, PPL Electric Utilities, LG&E and KU, have continued to garner additional JD power awards. In total, the 3 companies now have 32 JD power awards more than any other utility in the U.S. Turning to the Supply business segment, we were able to achieve our 2011 earnings expectations despite the extended outages at our Susquehanna nuclear plant, which caused us nearly $100 million in pretax margins. Our team brought both units back in it service within just 6 weeks and they've operated reliably ever since. 
And the rest of our Supply business, including our marketing operation and our other power plants rose to the challenge significantly offsetting the loss of nuclear output demonstrating the value of our diverse fleet I'm also pleased with the work our cool group did in 2011 negotiating a long-term goal delivery. Love the details of the contract a confidential, I can say that we were able to negotiate a multi-year contracts and is expected to provide more stable coal transportation costs. 
Coupled with our other transportation arrangements, we expect to maintain overall transport costs in the low to mid-$20 per ton range for the next several years. In summary, over the past 3 years, PPL's made and financed bold acquisitions depleted fish served integrations executed value correct accretive generation hedges. This is in addition to strong regulatory performance. Our resulting business mix of high-quality utilities and diverse competitive generation provide the strong foundation that Jim talked about creating shareholder value. 
As Jim said, we believe PPL's best years are yet to come. Before discussing our earnings forecast for 2012, let me take a few minutes to review the positioning of each of the poor business segments. Starting with international regulated segments, the headline here and that the U.K. operation is a highly attractive rate regulated business with expectations of significant growth. The U.K. regulatory system provides network operators with pre-approved 5-year forward-looking revenues, which are inflation-adjusted and taken into account capital spending, as well as O&M cost. In addition we have the ability to earn incentive revenues and we face no volumetric risk. 
This results in a real-time return of and return capital investment without the lag that is often the norm in U.S. regulated businesses. WPD is the top-performing electricity distribution business in the U.K. leading the way in capital and operating cost efficiency, customer service and reliability. In the past 7 years, we've earned more than 380 million of incentive revenues, the highest percentage of bonus revenue among U.K. electricity distributors. As I mentioned earlier we have completely transformed the Midland operation in just 9 months, clearly positioning us to earn additional incentive revenues. 
PPL Kentucky operations represent a very positive case of what you see is what you get. LG&E and KU our efficient well-run utilities that are also projected to have significant rate base growth in the coming years as a result of the constructive regulatory climate that focused on long-term needs of customers, we have in place mechanisms that provides timely return on a substantial portion of the CapEx plan over the next 5 years. We currently estimate compounded annual growth in our Kentucky rate base of 9.6% over the next 5 years. We're also forecasting significant growth in both our transmission and distribution rate base in Pennsylvania. On the transmission side we now estimated compound annual growth base rate of nearly 22% through 2016. 
This is driven by the 145-mile Susquehanna-Roseland transmission project and other initiatives to improve aging transmission facilities in Pennsylvania, including a recently announced significant new project in the market area. There have been some recent positive developments regarding the approval process for the Susquehanna-Roseland line and we hope to receive approval from the National Park Service before the end of this year. 
We're also continuing to upgrade aging infrastructure on our distribution system, which covers 29 counties in Pennsylvania. Our distribution improvement efforts are expected to result in a 6% compound annual base growth over the next 5 years. A related positive development on this comes from the legislative initiative to provide alternative rate mechanism in the state. This mechanism would permit the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission to authorize recovery of costs for infrastructure improvement projects to our distribution system improvement charge. 
This legislation was passed by the State House incentive within a year be introduced. The Senate bill passed unanimously and then moved back to the house for concurrence we're also passed unanimously just passed just the evening. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett has been supportive of the legislation and we expect them to sign the bill within the next week. The legislation will take effect within 60 days the governor signing we would anticipate a model to RF and other PSE guidance to be completed this year and companies will then be in the position to file for recovery using the new mechanism early next year. 
While the industry continues to face the challenge of low wholesale power prices our competitive generation business continues to be well-positioned, having the diversity to capture value in a variety of market conditions. In PJM, we have more than 2400 megawatts of low marginal cost nuclear and hydro facilities in addition to the 2,800 megawatts of efficient super units that have state-of-the-art emission control equipment to put them substantially compliant with new and admission standards without any major investments. We did not believe Karen for prices reflect the cost of compliant with and industry-wide expected coal plant closures. 
Our fundamental analysis suggest floor power prices are not reflecting the incremental cost necessary to comply with PPA rules, which we estimate to be in the $3 to $5 per megawatt-hour range. Of course, notwithstanding this fundamental analysis, the current market reality is our prices remain soft. PPL's well-positioned in these challenging markets and I point to a couple of factors. We've been very successful on hedging our generation for '12 and '13 and have one of the strongest hedge profiles in the sector. But beyond hedging, I believe an often overlook and highly attractive aspect of our fleet is the more than 2,400 megawatts of gas fired plants we have in PJM. Our gas-fired assets are capturing an increased share of the markets as they've been running at near baseload production levels. 
For example, in 2011 they ran at a combined capacity factor of 78%, that's up from 43% in 2009. Our ghastly can benefit from lower gas prices displacing less efficient coal units this should help offset some tonnage start associated with our coal assets. And of course this assumes precisely the benefit of the diversity. Our flexibility and fuel type dispatch response and technology to provide opportunities and reduced volatility under a variety of market conditions. 
And to further enhance our fuel diversity, we are exploring options operate some of our coal units of natural gas. Turning to the next slide, we provide a regular look at hedge positions for 2012 and 2013. We increased hedged levels for both years and provided a range from area just reflecting potential variability and generation production and our use of up options. Inch and cost of variability the hedge volumes. Focusing on 2013, the additional hedges were primarily for off-peak power. You may remember that during the second quarter call, we actively hedged 2013 to capture an increase in power prices and at that time I indicated those hedges were advised towards on peak power. The hedges we executed since the third quarter essentially bring our book down between on peak and off-peak. 
Looking at the intermediate and peaking data, you can see we've increased our expected production from the gas-fired units caused by the market dynamics that I described earlier. This increase partially offsets our lower expected output from the baseload coal fleet. Before entering the call over to fall that we summarize our 2012 earnings forecast and then ask Paul to take you through the details. This morning we announced the 2012 earnings forecast of $2.15 to $2.45 per share. While this forecast is as expected lower than the results we achieved in 2011, I want to highlight several important points before Paul provides a detailed review of our 2012 guidance. 
The largest driver is an expected to decline in energy capacity margins from our supply business as higher price hedges are rolling off. I don't think that's a surprise to any of you on the call. The lower supply margins are partially offset by 4 additional months of earnings from the Midlands utilities. Again I don't believe this is an expected however, it's important to note that our forecast for international exceeds the expectations relative to 2012 net income we previously communicated to you. As you will see from Paul's slides and what may not be as expected, we are planning to spend significantly more in improving our customer service and reliability in Pennsylvania and Kentucky. 
This increase amounts to about $0.15 per share compared with spending in 2011. As you know, many utilities, including PPL were hit with devastating storms in 2011 while PPL companies are responded very well ,- we believe there are areas for improvement that will help us to an even better job when faced with such challenges in the future. We believe the proactive approach will not only improve service to our customers but will maintain and improve our inventory margin as we faced rate proceedings in 2013 and beyond. 
Finally I want to highlight that our supply business operating expenses in 2012 are roughly $0.10 per share higher than 2011. This increase is driven by more plant fossil outages and higher cost that are Susquehanna nuclear plant response to anticipated in our initiatives. In closing, I'd say that 2011 was another solid year for PPL's particularly in terms of challenges met and opportunities seized. We're well-positioned for 2012 and our announced dividend increase reflects our optimism in the PPL strategy. Now let me turn the call over to Paul."

As outlined on this slide, the largest positive driver of earnings from ongoing operations in the fourth quarter came out of the U.K. and was primarily due to earnings from the Midlands",1263,"Let's move to Slide 13 to review fourth quarter and year end results. As outlined on this slide, the largest positive driver of earnings from ongoing operations in the fourth quarter came out of the U.K. and was primarily due to earnings from the Midlands acquisitions. This positive driver was more than offset by the combined impact of dilution of $0.13 per share as a result of the common stock issued in April to fund the Midlands acquisition and lower energy market that we expected. 
Full year 2011 earnings from ongoing operations were favorably impacted by the financial performance of our utilities in U.K. and Kentucky. These positive drivers were offset by dilution of $0.75 per share, resulting from the common stock issued in June 2010 to fund the Kentucky acquisition and the common stock issued in April of last year to fund the Midlands acquisition. 
As forecasted our Supply segment had lower margins in 2011 compared to a year ago. Because the Kentucky acquisition did not close until November 1, 2010, the fourth quarter results are not fully comparable. However, I'd like to remind everyone that the Kentucky regulated segment earnings included for major items the operating results at KU and LG&E the holding company cost LKE interest expense associated with the 2010 equity unit issuance and dilution of $0.11 per share. 
Let's move now to the International Regulated segments earnings drivers on Slide 14. Our International Regulated segment earned $0.87 per share in 2011, a $0.34 increase over 2010. This increase was due to the operating results of the Midlands utilities net of interest expense of $0.05 per share associated with the 2011 equity earning issuance. Higher earnings in WPD's legacy business resulting from higher delivery revenue primarily driven by higher prices and a more favorable currency exchange rate. This was partially offset by higher pension expense, higher income taxes and dilution of $0.24 per share. 
Moving to Slide 15, our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.31 per share in 2011, a $0.04 increase over 2010. This increase was the net result of higher delivery marches primary dip to distribution base rate increase that went into effect in April 1 of last year. Lower O&M lower taxes primary dip to Pennsylvania state tax benefits related to 100% bonus depreciation last year and dilution of $0.09 per share. Turning now to Supply on Slide 16, this segment earned $1.14 per share in 2011, a decrease of $1.13 per share compared to 2010. 
Lower earnings in this segment were driven primarily by lower margins as a result of energy and capacity prices in the East, lower baseload generation, lower basis and a higher delivered coal prices. This was partially offset by higher margin on coal and merriment sales contracts. Also impact in 2011 results were higher O&M at Susquehanna and our fossil hydroelectric stations in the East and the West higher income tax S primarily due to valuation analysis on Pennsylvania operating loss carry forwards that were driven by lower projected future taxable income, including the depreciation and/or forward energy prices. Finally dilution of $0.31 per share. 
Turning now to Slide 17, as Bill already mentioned we are announcing our 2012 earnings forecast range of $2.15 to $2.45 with the midpoint of $2.30 per share. This slide shows the year-over-year change in earnings by key drivers within each segment. The $0.13 impact of dilution in federal moves from the segment earnings and is shown as a separate line item in the graph. We expect increased earnings from the International Regulated segment primarily due to an additional 4 months of earnings from the Midlands businesses basically our 4 highest earnings months of the year, and an annualized increase in delivery revenue of 9.5% effective April 1. 
Offsetting these positive earnings drivers are higher O&M, higher depreciation, higher income taxes and a less favorable currency exchange rates. We expect lower earnings from our Supply segment in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to lower energy margin as a result of lower energy and capacity prices and higher fuel costs partially offset by higher nuclear and coal generation output. Higher O&M primarily due to an additional plant outages at our Eastern fossil and hydroelectric stations higher depreciation, higher income taxes in an assumption although are realized decommissioning trust earnings we experienced in 2011. 
The lower earnings from the Pennsylvania regulated segment are primarily due to higher O&M as a result of plant increases customer reliability teamwork and customer service cost as Bill mentioned in higher depreciation resulting from higher plant and service. We also expect higher income tax has as a result of the 2011 Pennsylvania State tax benefits related to both depreciation that will not continue in 2012. 
These negative earnings drivers are expected to be partially offset by higher delivery revenue primarily on the transmission side of the business. We expect lower earnings from the Kentucky regulated segment a deserted regulatory initiatives in the areas of customer service gas pipeline safety and infrastructure security increased operating and maintenance cost from additional plant or plant outages and higher baseline spending we also expect higher depreciation as a result of higher plant and service these increased costs will be partially offset by higher budgeted electricity and gas margins due to expected low growth our growing ECR rate base lease rate increase in Virginia and the FERC. 
On Slide 18, we provided updates on our free cash flow before dividends. For 2011, this graph obviously excludes the impact of approximately $5.8 million necessary to fund the Midlands acquisitions. Our 2011 projected free cash flow before dividend had not changed materially since the third quarter call. A decrease in actual capital expenditures was due to lower capital spending in the Supply and Kentucky regulated segments, partially offset by higher capital spending in international. The changing CapEx was almost entirely offset by a change in other net investing activities. 
The larger driver of 2012 free cash flow before dividends is projected capital expenditures of $3.8 billion, primarily at our regulated businesses. The details of our projected capital expenditures and related rate base growth can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Partially offsetting the increase of capital spending is higher expected cash from operations in the International Regulated segment primarily due to the initial 4 months of Midlands operations versus 2011. Cash from operations also reflects projected pension contributions of around $400 million for the year. 
Due to large fluctuation that can occur in certain cash flow items like changes in working capital and collateral requirements on power hedges, starting at 2012, we no longer plan to discuss quarter-over-quarter changes to our year end production of free cash flow before dividends. We will provide an annual estimate of free cash flow before dividends before the upcoming year as a timing announced earnings guidance you can obviously trying the company's actual free cash flow before dividends using our SEC filings though. 
Finally, turning to Slide 19, as Jim mentioned earlier, we have raised annualized dividend to 2.9% to $1.44 effective with the April dividend payment. This dividend level represents a 63% payout ratio based on the midpoint of our 2012 earnings forecast and is expected to be more than covered by our regulated earnings. The combination of the acquisitions we completed over the last 2 years, the diversity of the competitive generation fleet and the growth prospects of our utility business clearly permit us to look at flexibility in growing the dividend in the future. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim for question-and-answer period."

But the fact is with the mix that we have today, we are very much well-positioned to combat something like this compared to where we were 18 months ago. So I think as we sit here today, we really feel great about the transformational acquisitions we've done and where we are relative to the commodity cycle."

As most of you -- I think all of you know, I'll be retiring from PPL at the end of March, so this will be my last earnings call with you. Obviously, it's been a real thrill with serving PPL for the last 6 or so years as Chairman and CEO, and it certainly has been a highlight of my career. A lot have changed, a lot of interesting transactions throughout the sector and certainly, many, many, many challenges that we've tried to seek, finding the opportunities within that realm of challenge. 
I would say that PPL is fundamentally a very strong company, and we've made significant progress over the past few years in further strengthening the foundation, which we can continue to grow the value for the shareowners. And I am real confident that you're going to see the best years of PPL ahead as a result of the work we've done over the last several years. We've got a great team in place under Bill Spence's leadership. I'm sure he'll turn that confidence into a reality. So I thank all of you on the phone for your interest in the company and for your diligence in assessing PPL's performance over the years of my tenure. 
So I wish each of you continued success and good fortune in your areas out there. And again, I think you'll see PPL flourish under its new portfolio structure, and a lot of opportunities lie out there ahead for us. 
So today I'll talk a little, just a little bit about the overview of 2011 results and talk a little bit about our positioning for the future. Then Bill will provide an overview of our '11 operational performance, a review of future prospects for each of our business segments and a bit of discussion on our 2012 earnings forecast. And then Paul Farr, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide very detailed financial review before we turn to your questions. 
As you saw in the announcement, fourth quarter earnings of $0.69 per share compared with $0.73 in the fourth quarter of 2010. Earnings from ongoing operations for the fourth quarter were $0.70 per share compared with $0.83 in the same period a year ago. Our reported earnings and our earnings from ongoing operations were each $0.13 per share lower than a year ago due to dilution from the April 11 common stock issuance. For the quarter, both reported earnings and ongoing earnings were pressured by lower wholesale electricity margins at our Supply segment. 
Turning to the year-end results, we announced 2011 reported earnings of $2.61 per share, an increase of $0.44 per share over 2010. Our 2011 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.72 per share compared with $3.13 per share in 2010. Now the '11 earnings from ongoing operations reflect dilution of $0.75 per share due to the June 2010 and the April 2011 issuances of common stock to fund the Kentucky and U.K. acquisitions. Strong '11 results were driven by solid performance in each of our business segments, and I'm also pleased that we're able to announce this morning a rough 3% increase in our annualized dividend. Our quarterly dividend will now be $0.36 per share. The increase is further indication of our continued confidence in the strength of our portfolio and our prospects for future growth of the company. 
Before turning the call over to Bill and Paul, I'd like to review some of the significant factors that position us well for the future. Clearly, we think our business mix has shifted significantly towards rate-regulated earnings, providing us stability and security to our earnings forecast, dividend and credit ratings. 
Approximately 70% of our projected 2012 earnings per share will come from regulated businesses, and we expect compound annual rate base growth in these businesses of nearly 8% over the next 5 years. That growth would result in an $8.1 billion increase in the asset base of our regulated companies by 2016, the equivalent of adding another large regulated utility to the portfolio. Much of this rate base growth comes from planned CapEx that's already been reviewed by various regulators with very little lag in earning a return for shareowners. 
The business mix improvements we've made over the past 2 years of have resulted in an excellent business risk profile rating from S&P, putting us in a category with only 2 other companies in our sector. So our stable earnings mix also makes our dividend more secured and gives us platform for continued growth. And while wholesale electricity prices remain depressed, our high-quality competitive Ghent fleet provides upside in stronger energy markets. Baseload plants and PJM are complemented by a flexible mix of gas-fired units that'll position us well on the largest wholesale market in the world. 
Fuel mix of our fleet differentiates PPL from many other power producers in the sector. Diverse fuel mix provides us competitive advantages in a variety of market conditions over fleets that are heavily dependent on one fuel source. Over the past several years, I believe that our management team has consistently proven its ability to make the right strategic and tactical calls. Already our team in the U.K. has made meaningful improvements in the Midlands operations, achieving the financial objectives we announced at that time the deal was signed and subsequently financed. 
While we have accomplished a great deal, challenges certainly remain. I'm confident, however, that Bill and his team of excellent executives will continue to turn these challenges into opportunities and growth for our shareowners. 
So I'll now turn the call over to Bill, the PPL's new CEO. Bill?"

I'd like to first take this opportunity to thank Jim on behalf of the executive team and all the employees of PPL for his outstanding leadership in the company over the past 6 years. In guiding PPL through a very challenging time, Jim not only ensured the company weather-challenging market conditions, he led the implementation of the strategy that has significantly strengthened the company. 
Under Jim's leadership, PPL fundamentally repositioned itself with 2 transformational acquisitions and aggressive hedging program that has added tremendous shareholder value and operational performance that ranks among the best in our industry. Congratulations, Jim, on an outstanding career, and thanks for all you've done for PPL. I'm honored also to have been selected to carry on your excellent leadership. 
And speaking of carrying on, let's next turn now to Slide 6. As Jim noted, 2011 was a very successful year for the company. PPL has had now 12 consecutive quarters of very solid performance and 3 consecutive years of exceeding the midpoint of our ongoing earnings guidance. And as Jim mentioned, we've completed 2 transformational acquisitions in an extraordinary fashion. In 2011 we seamlessly acquired and permanently financed Central Networks in the U.K. We implemented our integration plan very close to targeted cost and at the high-end of our expected range of synergies. We overcame extended nuclear outages in poor market conditions in our Supply business, and our Electric Utilities in Kentucky and Pennsylvania provided solid results in a lackluster economy. 
I'll briefly review each of the 4 business segments starting with the U.K. Our WPD CEO, Robert Symons, and his team developed a very aggressive efficient integration plan following our acquisition of the 2 Central Networks utility operation last April. I'm very happy to report that all that significant operational integration is now complete and that Western Power Distribution is now serving over 7 million customers with a radical improvement in WPD Midland's operations in just 9 months. This is possibly one of the most dramatic changes ever made in the U.K. utility industry, and I expect WPD Midlands will now join WPD South less than WPD South Wales as the U.K.'s front-tier performers on several incentive measures. 
These dramatic improvements are appearing in 4 key areas: percentage of customers restored to service within one hour of high-voltage fault; minutes that customers are without service; the number of customers without service for more than 18 hours; and the number of customer interruptions per 100 customers. There are charts in the appendix of today's presentation that detail some of these significant improvements. While these measures are expected to result in incentive revenue opportunities for the company beginning in 2013, customers in the Midland region of the U.K. are already seeing the benefits of our ownership and our proven operating model. 
Our experience in the first 9 months of operating the larger WPD has confirmed our belief that this acquisition will create significant benefits for our customers and PPL's shareowners. 
Turning back to the U.S., we achieved a significant milestone when the Kentucky Public Service Commission unanimously approved the settlement of a critical environmental cost recovery case for LG&E and KU. As a result of the settlement and KPSC action, we now have the approval and the cost recovery mechanism to move ahead with approximately $2.3 billion in environmental upgrades necessary at our regulated coal fire plant in Kentucky. 
The agreement provides for a 10.1% return on equity for these projects, which will be completed over the next several years. In Pennsylvania, our electric distribution operations certainly had its challenging year, facing 2 of the most damaging storms in the company's history in just a 2-month period. In addition to significant flooding in some areas of our territory. In all cases, our experienced and dedicated crews did an extraordinary job restoring service to customers at very difficult circumstances. In the restoration effort, we received excellent help from other utilities from our mutual assistance program and from PPL's sister companies LG&E and KU. 
Regarding customer service, PPL Electric Utilities, LG&E and KU have continued to garner additional J.D. Power awards. In total, the 3 companies now have 32 J.D. Power awards more than any other utility in the U.S. 
Turning to the Supply business segment, we were able to achieve our 2011 earnings expectations despite the extended outages at our Susquehanna nuclear plant, which caused us nearly $100 million in pretax margins. Our team brought both units back in it service within just 6 weeks, and they've operated reliably ever since. 
And the rest of our Supply business, including our marketing operation and our other power plants rose to the challenge, significantly offsetting the loss of nuclear output, demonstrating the value of our diverse fleet. I'm also pleased with the work our coal group did in 2011, negotiating a long-term rail contract for coal delivery. While the details of the contract are confidential, I can say that we were able to negotiate a multi-year contract that is expected to provide more stable coal transportation cost.
Coupled with our other transportation arrangements, we expect to maintain overall transport cost in the low to mid-$20-per-ton range for the next several years. 
In summary, over the past 3 years, PPL's made and financed bold acquisitions, completed swift integrations and executed value-accretive generation hedges. This is in addition to the strong operational regulatory performance. Our resulting business mix of high-quality utilities and diverse competitive generation provide the strong foundation that Jim talked about, creating shareholder value. As Jim said, we believe PPL's best years are yet to come. 
Before discussing our earnings forecast for 2012, let me take a few minutes to review the positioning of each of the 4 business segments. Starting with the International Regulated segment, the headline here is that the U.K. operation is a highly-attractive rate-regulated business with expectations of significant growth. The U.K. regulatory system provides network operators with pre-approved 5-year forward-looking revenues, which are inflation-adjusted and taken into account capital spending, as well as O&M cost. In addition we have the ability to earn incentive revenues, and we face no volumetric risk. This results in a real-time return of and return on capital investment without the lag that is often the norm in the U.S. regulated businesses. 
WPD is the top-performing electricity distribution business in the U.K., leading the way in capital and operating cost efficiency, customer service and reliability. In the past 7 years, we've earned more than $380 million of incentive revenues, the highest percentage of bonus revenue among U.K. electricity distributors. As I mentioned earlier we have completely transformed the Midland operation in just 9 months, clearly positioning us to earn additional incentive revenues. 
PPL Kentucky operations represent a very positive case of ""what you see is what you get."" LG&E and KU are efficient well-run utilities that are also projected to have significant rate base growth in the coming years. As the result of the constructive regulatory climate that's focused on the long-term needs of customers, we have in place mechanisms that provide for timely return on a substantial portion of the CapEx plan over the next 5 years. We currently estimate compound annual growth in our Kentucky rate base of 9.6% over the next 5 years. We're also forecasting significant growth in both our transmission and distribution rate base in Pennsylvania. On the transmission side, we now estimated a compound annual growth base rate of nearly 22% through 2016. 
This is driven by the 145-mile Susquehanna-Roseland transmission project and other initiatives to improve aging transmission facilities in Pennsylvania, including a recently announced significant new project in the Pocono Mountain area. There have been some recent positive developments regarding the approval process for the Susquehanna-Roseland line, and we hope to receive approval from the National Park Service before the end of this year. 
We're also continuing to upgrade aging infrastructure on our distribution system, which covers 29 counties in Pennsylvania. Our distribution improvement efforts are expected to result in a 6% compound annual base growth over the next 5 years. A related positive development on this front comes from the legislative initiative to provide alternative ratemaking mechanism in the state. This mechanism would permit the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to authorize recovery of costs for pre-approved infrastructure improvement projects to our distribution system improvement charge. 
This legislation was passed by the State House incentive within a year of being introduced. The Senate bill passed unanimously and then moved back to the House for concurrence, where it also passed unanimously just as passed to [ph] the evening. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett has been supportive of the legislation, and we would expect them to sign the bill within the next week. The legislation will take effect within 60 days of the governor signing. We would anticipate the model tariff and other PUC guidance to be completed this year, and companies will then be in the position to file for recovery using the new mechanism early nex year's. 
While the industry continues to face the challenge of low wholesale power prices, our competitive generation business continues to be well positioned, having the diversity to capture value in a variety of market conditions. In PJM, we have more than 2400 megawatts of low marginal cost nuclear and hydro facilities in addition to the 2,800 megawatts of efficient supercritical coal units that have state-of-the-art emission control equipment that put them substantially in compliance with new and admission standards without any major investments. We do not believe current forward prices reflect the costs that comply with MATS or CSAPR rules and industry-wide expected coal plant closures. Our fundamental analysis suggests forward power prices are not reflecting the incremental costs necessary to comply with EPA rules, which we estimate to be in the $3 to $5 per megawatt-hour range. Of course, notwithstanding this fundamental analysis, the current market reality is power prices remain soft. 
PPL's well positioned in these challenging markets, and I point to a couple of factors. We've been very successful on hedging our generation for '12 and '13 and have one of the strongest hedge profiles in the sector. But beyond hedging, I believe an often overlooked and highly attractive aspect of our fleet is the more than 2,400 megawatts of gas-fired plants we have in PJM. Our gas-fired assets are capturing an increased share of the markets as they've been running at near baseload production levels. 
For example, in 2011 they ran at a combined capacity factor of 78%, that's up from 43% in 2009. Our gas fleet can benefit from lower gas prices. Displacing less efficient coal units, this should help offset some unhedged dark spread risks associated with our coal assets. And of course, this is precisely the benefit of fleet diversity. Our flexibility and fuel type, dispatch response and technology type provide opportunities and reduce volatility under a variety of market conditions.  And to further enhance our fuel diversity, we are exploring options to operate some of our coal units of natural gas. 
Turning to the next slide, we provide a regular look at hedge positions for 2012 and 2013. We've increased hedged levels for both years and provided a range for our hedges, reflecting potential variability and generation production and our use of up options. Each can cost some variability in the hedge volumes. 
Focusing on 2013, the additional hedges were primarily for off-peak power. You may remember that during the second quarter call, we actively hedged 2013 to capture an increase in power prices, and at that time I indicated those hedges were advised towards on peak power. The hedges we executed since the third quarter essentially bring our booking balance between on peak and off-peak. 
Looking at the intermediate and peaking data, you can see we've increased our expected production from the gas-fired units caused by the market dynamics that I described earlier. This increase partially offsets our lower expected output from the baseload coal fleet. 
Before I turn the call over to Paul, let me summarize our 2012 earnings forecast, and then I'll ask Paul to take you through the details. This morning we announced the 2012 earnings forecast of $2.15 to $2.45 per share. While this forecast is, as expected, lower than the results we achieved in 2011, I want to highlight several important points before Paul provides a detailed review of our 2012 guidance. 
The largest driver is an expected decline in energy and capacity margins from our Supply business as higher price hedges are rolling off. I don't think that's a surprise to any of you on the call. The lower supply margins are partially offset by 4 additional months of earnings from the Midlands utilities. Again, I don't believe this is unexpected. However, it's important to note that our forecast for International exceeds the expectations relative to 2012 net income we'd previously communicated to you. As you will see from Paul's slides and what may not be as expected, we are planning to spend significantly more in improving our customer service and reliability in Pennsylvania and Kentucky. 
This increase amounts to about $0.15 per share compared with spending in 2011. As you know, many utilities, including PPL, were hit with devastating storms in 2011. While PPL companies responded very well, we believe there are areas for improvement that will help us do an even better job when faced with such challenges in the future. We believe the proactive approach will not only improve service to our customers but will maintain or improve our inventory margin as we faced rate proceedings in 2013 and beyond. 
Finally, I wanted to highlight that our Supply business operating expenses in 2012 are roughly $0.10 per share higher than 2011. This increase is driven by more plant fossil outages and higher costs at our Susquehanna nuclear plant, some in response to anticipated NRC initiatives. 
In closing, I'd say that 2011 was another solid year for PPL's, particularly in terms of challenges met and opportunities seized. We're well positioned for 2012, and our announced dividend increase reflects our optimism in the PPL strategy. 
Now let me turn the call over to Paul."
185508,157005525,219565,"PPL Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2012",2012-02-10,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 13 to review fourth quarter and year-end results. As outlined on this slide, the largest positive driver of earnings from ongoing operations in the fourth quarter came out of the U.K. and was p",1281,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 13 to review fourth quarter and year-end results. As outlined on this slide, the largest positive driver of earnings from ongoing operations in the fourth quarter came out of the U.K. and was primarily due to earnings from the Midlands acquisition. This positive driver was more than offset by the combined impact of dilution of $0.13 per share as a result of the common stock issued in April to fund the Midlands acquisition and lower energy margins, as we expected. 
Full year 2011 earnings from ongoing operations were favorably impacted by the financial performance of our utilities in U.K. and Kentucky. These positive drivers were offset by dilution of $0.75 per share, resulting from the common stock issued in June 2010 to fund the Kentucky acquisition and the common stock issued in April of last year to fund the Midlands acquisition. 
As forecasted our Supply segment had lower margins in 2011 compared to a year ago. Because the Kentucky acquisition did not close until November 1, 2010, the fourth quarter results are not fully comparable. However, I'd like to remind everyone that the Kentucky Regulated segment earnings include 4 major items: the operating results at KU and LG&E, the holding company costs at LKE, interest expense associated with the 2010 equity unit issuance and dilution of $0.11 per share. 
Let's move now to the International Regulated segment earnings drivers on Slide 14. Our International Regulated segment earned $0.87 per share in 2011, a $0.34 increase over 2010. This increase was due to the operating results of the Midlands utilities, net of interest expense of $0.05 per share associated with the 2011 equity unit issuance, higher earnings in WPD's legacy businesses resulting from higher delivery revenue primarily driven by higher prices and a more favorable currency exchange rate. This was partially offset by higher pension expense, higher income taxes and dilution of $0.24 per share. 
Moving to Slide 15, our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.31 per share in 2011, a $0.04 increase over 2010. This increase was the net result of higher delivery margins, primary due to the distribution base rate increase that went into effect in April 1 of last year, lower O&M -- lower taxes primary due to a Pennsylvania state tax benefit related to the 100% bonus depreciation last year and dilution of $0.09 per share. 
Turning now to Supply on Slide 16, this segment earned $1.14 per share in 2011, a decrease of $1.13 per share compared to 2010. Lower earnings in this segment were driven primarily by lower margins as a result of energy and capacity prices in the East, lower baseload generation, lower basis and higher delivered coal prices. This was partially offset by higher margin on coal requirement sales contracts. Also impacted 2011 results were higher O&M at Susquehanna in our fossil and hydroelectric stations in the East and the West, higher income taxes, primarily due to valuation allowances on Pennsylvania net operating loss carryforwards that were driven by lower projected future taxable income, including the impacts of bonus depreciation and lower forward energy prices. Finally, dilution of $0.31 per share. 
Turning now to Slide 17, as Bill already mentioned, we are announcing our 2012 earnings forecast range of $2.15 to $2.45 with the midpoint of $2.30 per share. This slide shows the year-over-year change in earnings by key drivers within each segment. The $0.13 impact of dilution in has been removed from the segment earnings and is shown as a separate line item on the graph. We expect decreased earnings from the International Regulated segment primarily due to an additional 4 months of earnings from the Midlands businesses, basically our 4 highest earning months of the year, and an annualized increase in delivery revenue of 9.5% effective April 1. 
Partially offsetting these positive earnings drivers are higher O&M, higher depreciation, higher income taxes and a less favorable currency exchange rate. We expect lower earnings from our Supply segment in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to lower energy margin, as a result of lower energy and capacity prices, and higher fuel costs, partially offset by higher nuclear and coal generation output, higher O&M primarily due to additional plant outages at our Eastern fossil and hydroelectric stations, higher depreciation, higher income taxes and an assumption of lower realized nuclear decommissioning trust earnings that we experienced in 2011. 
The lower earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment are primarily due to higher O&M as a result of plant increases and system reliability work and customer service costs, as Bill mentioned, and higher, depreciation resulting from higher plant and service. We also expect higher income taxes as a result of the 2011 Pennsylvania State tax benefits related to bonus depreciation that will not continue into 2012. 
These negative earnings drivers are expected to be partially offset by higher delivery revenue, primarily on the transmission side of the business. We expect lower earnings from the Kentucky Regulated segment due to certain regulatory initiatives in the areas of customer service, gas pipeline safety and infrastructure security, increased operating and maintenance costs from additional plant or plant outages and higher baseline spending. We also expect higher depreciation as a result of higher plant and service. These increased costs will be partially offset by higher budgeted electricity and gas margins due to expected low growth, our growing ECR rate base and base rate increases from Virginia and the FERC. 
On Slide 18, we provide updates on our free cash flow before dividends. For 2011, this graph obviously excludes the impact of approximately $5.8  billion necessary to fund the Midlands acquisitions. Our 2011 projected free cash flow before dividend has not changed materially since the third quarter call. A decrease in actual capital expenditures was due to lower capital spending in the Supply and Kentucky Regulated segments, partially offset by higher capital spending in International. The changing CapEx was almost entirely offset by a change in other net investing activities. 
The largest driver of 2012 free cash flow before dividends is projected capital expenditures of $3.8 billion, primarily at our tate regulated businesses. The details of our projected capital expenditures and related rate base growth can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. 
Partially offsetting the increase of capital spending is higher expected cash from operations in the International Regulated segment, primarily due to the additional 4 months of Midlands operations versus 2011. Cash from operations also reflects projected pension contributions of around $400 million for the year. 
Due to large fluctuations that can occur in certain cash flow items like changes in working capital and collateral requirements on power hedges, starting at 2012, we no longer plan to discuss quarter-over-quarter changes to our year-end projections of free cash flows before dividends. We will provide an annual estimate of free cash flow before dividends for the upcoming year at the time we announce earnings guidance. You can obviously track the company's actual free cash flow before dividends using our SEC filings, though. 
Finally, turning to Slide 19, as Jim mentioned earlier, we have raised the annualized dividend 2.9% to $1.44 effective with the April dividend payment. This dividend level represents a 63% payout ratio based on the midpoint of our 2012 earnings forecast and is expected to be more than covered by our rate regulated earnings. The combination of the acquisitions we completed over the last 2 years, the diversity of the competitive generation fleet and the growth prospects of our utility businesses clearly permit us to look at flexibility in growing the dividend in the future. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim for the question-and-answer period."

One of the reasons why obviously beyond just having rate case filings that we expect for next year like we have multiple fronts. Clearly, the commodity markets are dynamically changing, and the environmental regulations dates obviously make it difficult to predict earnings on an intermediate forecast basis. I would expect as we look at current forward collar prices that we would be able to offset much of the decline that could come from margin declines with rate regulated earnings growth, that would be a combination of those rate case filings I've talked about, the ECR spending in Kentucky the, normal formula rate adjustments at we've got coming through the FERC jurisdictional transmission in Pennsylvania Electric Utilities, as well as obviously in this year in 2013, on an annualized basis starting April 1, I talked about the 9.5% revenue increase for that asset base, and that's going to continue to grow in '14 and beyond. I'd expect we'd be able to offset much of it. The question is obviously what happens between now and the time that we layer in the hedges that secure most or all of 2013, which I wouldn't expect to happen until we move further in the year, obviously. And then '14 as we've talked about in the past, is fairly open. So it just depends upon on what happened in those commodity markets. I think, For what we have control over, we've executed very well in terms of the rate case filings and the settlements in those areas, and I'd expect we'll do the same in '13. The thing that we don't have control over is the commodity markets."

Yes, if you take a look at the slide and compare it to where we were at the end of the last quarter, on the 2012 side, expected generation in the intermediate went up from 6.2 gigawatts to 6.9, so that's substantial increase there. That is displacing, if you will, some coal generation, not so much on our own coal generation, but other less efficient units in the market. On the baseload side, you see most of the drop is in the East, although there is some drop in the West quarter-over-quarter. And for 2012, for example, we're at 46.2 gigawatts at the end of the last quarter and we're at 45.5 gigawatts in the East this quarter. That drop is really a combination of 2 things. One is more plant outages on the coal fleet but also less runtime, particularly in the off-peak hours from the coal fleet based on the current soft power prices."

And at the same time, we're growing our dividends so that people -- dividend is important, too. They're being paid that dividend while we wait for probably a couple of years for prices to start to move up. But they will move up, given the ultimate retirement of coal and demand picking back up.

As most of you -- I think all of you know, I'll be retiring from PPL at the end of March, so this will be my last earnings call with you. Obviously, it's been a real thrill with serving PPL for the last 6 or so years as Chairman and CEO, and it certainly has been a highlight of my career. A lot have changed, a lot of interesting transactions throughout the sector and certainly, many, many, many challenges that we've tried to seek, finding the opportunities within that realm of challenge. 
I would say that PPL is fundamentally a very strong company, and we've made significant progress over the past few years in further strengthening the foundation, which we can continue to grow the value for the share-owners. And I am real confident that you're going to see the best years of PPL ahead as a result of the work we've done over the last several years. We've got a great team in place under Bill Spence's leadership. I'm sure he'll turn that confidence into a reality. So I thank all of you on the phone for your interest in the company and for your diligence in assessing PPL's performance over the years of my tenure. 
So I wish each of you continued success and good fortune in your areas out there. And again, I think you'll see PPL flourish under its new portfolio structure, and a lot of opportunities lie out there ahead for us. 
So today I'll talk a little, just a little bit about the overview of 2011 results and talk a little bit about our positioning for the future. Then Bill will provide an overview of our '11 operational performance, a review of future prospects for each of our business segments, and a bit of discussion on our 2012 earnings forecast. And then Paul Farr, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide very detailed financial review before we turn to your questions. 
As you saw in the announcement, fourth quarter earnings of $0.69 per share compared with $0.73 in the fourth quarter of 2010. Earnings from ongoing operations for the fourth quarter were $0.70 per share compared with $0.83 in the same period a year ago. Our reported earnings and our earnings from ongoing operations were each $0.13 per share lower than a year ago due to dilution from the April 11 common stock issuance. For the quarter, both reported earnings and ongoing earnings were pressured by lower wholesale electricity margins at our Supply segment. 
Turning to the year-end results, we announced 2011 reported earnings of $2.61 per share, an increase of $0.44 per share over 2010. Our 2011 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.72 per share compared with $3.13 per share in 2010. Now the '11 earnings from ongoing operations reflect dilution of $0.75 per share due to the June 2010 and the April 2011 issuances of common stock to fund the Kentucky and U.K. acquisitions. Strong '11 results were driven by solid performance in each of our business segments, and I'm also pleased that we're able to announce this morning a rough 3% increase in our annualized dividend. Our quarterly dividend will now be $0.36 per share. The increase is further indication of our continued confidence in the strength of our portfolio and our prospects for future growth of the company. 
Before turning the call over to Bill and Paul, I'd like to review some of the significant factors that position us well for the future. Clearly, we think our business mix has shifted significantly towards rate-regulated earnings, providing us stability and security to our earnings forecast, dividend and credit ratings. 
Approximately 70% of our projected 2012 earnings per share will come from regulated businesses, and we expect compound annual rate base growth in these businesses of nearly 8% over the next 5 years. That growth would result in an $8.1 billion increase in the asset base of our regulated companies by 2016, the equivalent of adding another large regulated utility to the portfolio. Much of this rate base growth comes from planned CapEx, that's already been reviewed by various regulators with very little lag in earning a return for shareowners. 
The business mix improvements we've made over the past 2 years of have resulted in an excellent business risk profile rating from S&P, putting us in a category with only 2 other companies in our sector. So our stable earnings mix also makes our dividend more secured and gives us platform for continued growth. And while wholesale electricity prices remain depressed, our high-quality competitive Ghent fleet provides upside in stronger energy markets. Baseload plants and PJM are complemented by a flexible mix of gas-fired units that'll position us well on the largest wholesale market in the world. 
Fuel mix of our fleet differentiates PPL from many other power producers in the sector. Diverse fuel mix provides us competitive advantages in a variety of market conditions over fleets that are heavily dependent on one fuel source. Over the past several years, I believe that our management team has consistently proven its ability to make the right strategic and tactical calls. Already our team in the U.K. has made meaningful improvements in the Midlands operations, achieving the financial objectives we announced at the time the deal was signed and subsequently financed. 
While we have accomplished a great deal, challenges certainly remain. I'm confident, however, that Bill and his team of excellent executives will continue to turn these challenges into opportunities and growth for our shareowners. 
So I'll now turn the call over to Bill, the PPL's new CEO. Bill?"

I'd like to first take this opportunity to thank Jim on behalf of the executive team and all the employees of PPL for his outstanding leadership in the company over the past 6 years. In guiding PPL through a very challenging time, Jim not only ensured the company weather challenging market conditions, he led the implementation of the strategy that has significantly strengthened the company. 
Under Jim's leadership, PPL fundamentally repositioned itself with 2 transformational acquisitions and aggressive hedging program that has added tremendous shareholder value and operational performance that ranks among the best in our industry. Congratulations, Jim, on an outstanding career, and thanks for all you've done for PPL. I'm honored also to have been selected to carry on your excellent leadership. 
And speaking of carrying on, let's next turn now to Slide 6. As Jim noted, 2011 was a very successful year for the company. PPL has had now 12 consecutive quarters of very solid performance and 3 consecutive years of exceeding the midpoint of our ongoing earnings guidance. And as Jim mentioned, we've completed 2 transformational acquisitions in an extraordinary fashion. In 2011 we seamlessly acquired and permanently financed Central Networks in the U.K. We implemented our integration plan very close to targeted cost and at the high-end of our expected range of synergies. We overcame extended nuclear outages in poor market conditions in our Supply business, and our Electric Utilities in Kentucky and Pennsylvania provided solid results in a lackluster economy. 
I'll briefly review each of the 4 business segments starting with the U.K. Our WPD CEO, Robert Symons, and his team developed a very aggressive efficient integration plan, following our acquisition of the 2 Central Networks utility operations last April. I'm very happy to report that all of that significant operational integration is now complete, and that Western Power Distribution is now serving over 7 million customers with a radical improvement in WPD Midland's operations in just 9 months. This is possibly one of the most dramatic changes ever made in the U.K. utility industry, and I expect WPD Midlands will now join WPD South West than WPD South Wales as the U.K.'s front-tier performers on several incentive measures. 
These dramatic improvements are appearing in 4 key areas: percentage of customers restored to service within one hour of high-voltage fault; minutes that customers are without service; the number of customers without service for more than 18 hours; and the number of customer interruptions per 100 customers. There are charts in the appendix of today's presentation that detail some of these significant improvements. While these measures are expected to result in incentive revenue opportunities for the company beginning in 2013, customers in the Midland region of the U.K. are already seeing the benefits of our ownership and our proven operating model. 
Our experience in the first 9 months of operating the larger WPD has confirmed our beliefs, that this acquisition will create significant benefits for our customers and PPL's shareowners. 
Turning back to the U.S., we achieved a significant milestone when the Kentucky Public Service Commission unanimously approved the settlement of a critical environmental cost recovery case for LG&E and KU. As a result of the settlement and KPSC action, we now have the approval and the cost recovery mechanism to move ahead with approximately $2.3 billion in environmental upgrades necessary at our regulated coal fire plant in Kentucky. 
The agreement provides for a 10.1% return on equity for these projects, which will be completed over the next several years. In Pennsylvania, our electric distribution operations certainly had its challenging year, facing 2 of the most damaging storms in the company's history in just a 2-month period. In addition to significant flooding in some areas of our territory. In all cases, our experienced and dedicated crews did an extraordinary job restoring service to customers at very difficult circumstances. In the restoration effort, we received excellent help from other utilities from our mutual assistance program and from PPL's sister companies LG&E and KU. 
Regarding customer service, PPL Electric Utilities, LG&E and KU have continued to garner additional J.D. Power awards. In total, the 3 companies now have 32 J.D. Power awards more than any other utility in the U.S. 
Turning to the Supply business segment, we were able to achieve our 2011 earnings expectations despite the extended outages at our Susquehanna nuclear plant, which caused us nearly $100 million in pretax margins. Our team brought both units back in it service within just 6 weeks, and they've operated reliably ever since. 
And the rest of our Supply business, including our marketing operation and our other power plants rose to the challenge, significantly offsetting the loss of nuclear output, demonstrating the value of our diverse fleet. I'm also pleased with the work our coal group did in 2011, negotiating a long-term rail contract for coal delivery. While the details of the contract are confidential, I can say that we were able to negotiate a multi-year contract that is expected to provide more stable coal transportation cost.
Coupled with our other transportation arrangements, we expect to maintain overall transport cost in the low to mid-$20-per-ton range for the next several years. 
In summary, over the past 3 years, PPL's made and financed bold acquisitions, completed swift integrations and executed value-accretive generation hedges. This is in addition to the strong operational regulatory performance. Our resulting business mix of high-quality utilities and diverse competitive generation provide the strong foundation that Jim talked about, creating shareholder value. As Jim said, we believe PPL's best years are yet to come. 
Before discussing our earnings forecast for 2012, let me take a few minutes to review the positioning of each of the 4 business segments. Starting with the International Regulated segment, the headline here is that the U.K. operation is a highly-attractive rate-regulated business with expectations of significant growth. The U.K. regulatory system provides network operators with pre-approved 5-year forward-looking revenues, which are inflation-adjusted and take into account capital spending, as well as O&M cost. In addition we have the ability to earn incentive revenues, and we face no volumetric risk. This results in a real-time return of and return on capital investment without the lag that is often the norm in the U.S. regulated businesses. 
WPD is the top-performing electricity distribution business in the U.K., leading the way in capital and operating cost efficiency, customer service and reliability. In the past 7 years, we've earned more than $380 million of incentive revenues, the highest percentage of bonus revenue among U.K. electricity distributors. As I mentioned earlier we have completely transformed the Midland operation in just 9 months, clearly positioning us to earn additional incentive revenues. 
PPL Kentucky operations represent a very positive case of ""what you see is what you get."" LG&E and KU are efficient well-run utilities that are also projected to have significant rate base growth in the coming years. As the result of the constructive regulatory climate that's focused on the long-term needs of customers, we have in place mechanisms that provide for timely return on a substantial portion of the CapEx plan over the next 5 years. We currently estimate compound annual growth in our Kentucky rate base of 9.6% over the next 5 years. We're also forecasting significant growth in both our transmission and distribution rate base in Pennsylvania. On the transmission side, we now estimate a compound annual growth base rate of nearly 22% through 2016. 
This is driven by the 145-mile Susquehanna-Roseland transmission project and other initiatives to improve aging transmission facilities in Pennsylvania, including a recently announced significant new project in the Pocono Mountain area. There have been some recent positive developments regarding the approval process for the Susquehanna-Roseland line, and we hope to receive approval from the National Park Service before the end of this year. 
We're also continuing to upgrade aging infrastructure on our distribution system, which covers 29 counties in Pennsylvania. Our distribution improvement efforts are expected to result in a 6% compound annual base growth over the next 5 years. A related positive development on this front comes from the legislative initiative to provide an alternative ratemaking mechanism in the state. This mechanism would permit the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to authorize recovery of costs for pre-approved infrastructure improvement projects to our distribution system improvement charge. 
This legislation was passed by the State House incentive within a year of being introduced. The Senate bill passed unanimously and then moved back to the House for concurrence, where it also passed unanimously just this past Tuesday evening. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett has been supportive of the legislation, and we would expect them to sign the bill within the next week. The legislation will take effect within 60 days of the governor signing. We would anticipate the model tariff and other PUC guidance to be completed this year, and companies would then be in the position to file for recovery using the new mechanism early next year. 
While the industry continues to face the challenge of low wholesale power prices, our competitive generation business continues to be well positioned, having the diversity to capture value in a variety of market conditions. In PJM, we have more than 2400 megawatts of low marginal cost nuclear and hydro facilities, in addition to the 2,800 megawatts of efficient supercritical coal units that have state-of-the-art emission control equipment that put them substantially in compliance with new emission standards without any major investments. We do not believe current forward prices reflect the costs that comply with MATS or CSAPR rules and industry-wide expected coal plant closures. Our fundamental analysis suggests forward power prices are not reflecting the incremental costs necessary to comply with EPA rules, which we estimate to be in the $3 to $5 per megawatt-hour range. Of course, notwithstanding this fundamental analysis, the current market reality is power prices remain soft. 
PPL's well positioned in these challenging markets, and I point to a couple of factors. We've been very successful on hedging our generation for '12 and '13 and have one of the strongest hedge profiles in the sector. But beyond hedging, I believe an often overlooked and highly attractive aspect of our fleet, is the more than 2,400 megawatts of gas-fired plants we have in PJM. Our gas-fired assets are capturing an increased share of the markets, as they've been running at near baseload production levels. 
For example, in 2011 they ran at a combined capacity factor of 78%, that's up from 43% in 2009. Our gas fleet can benefit from lower gas prices. Displacing less efficient coal units, this should help offset some unhedged dark spread risks associated with our coal assets. And of course, this is precisely the benefit of fleet diversity. Our flexibility and fuel type, dispatch response and technology type provide opportunities and reduce volatility under a variety of market conditions.  And to further enhance our fuel diversity, we are exploring options to operate some of our coal units of natural gas. 
Turning to the next slide, we provide a regular look at hedge positions for 2012 and 2013. We've increased hedged levels for both years, and provided a range for our hedges, reflecting potential variability and generation production and our use of options. Each can cost some variability in the hedge volumes. 
Focusing on 2013, the additional hedges were primarily for off-peak power. You may remember that during the second quarter call, we actively hedged 2013 to capture an increase in power prices, and at that time I indicated those hedges were biased towards on peak power. The hedges we executed since the third quarter essentially bring our booking balance between on peak and off-peak. 
Looking at the intermediate and peaking data, you can see we've increased our expected production from the gas-fired units caused by the market dynamics, that I described earlier. This increase partially offsets our lower expected output from the baseload coal fleet. 
Before I turn the call over to Paul, let me summarize our 2012 earnings forecast, and then I'll ask Paul to take you through the details. This morning we announced the 2012 earnings forecast of $2.15 to $2.45 per share. While this forecast is, as expected, lower than the results we achieved in 2011, I want to highlight several important points before Paul provides a detailed review of our 2012 guidance. 
The largest driver is an expected decline in energy and capacity margins from our Supply business, as higher price hedges are rolling off. I don't think that's a surprise to any of you on the call. The lower supply margins are partially offset by 4 additional months of earnings from the Midlands utilities. Again, I don't believe this is unexpected. However, it's important to note that our forecast for International, exceeds the expectations relative to 2012 net income we'd previously communicated to you. As you will see from Paul's slides and what may not be as expected, we are planning to spend significantly more in improving our customer service and reliability in Pennsylvania and Kentucky. 
This increase amounts to about $0.15 per share compared with spending in 2011. As you know, many utilities, including PPL, were hit with devastating storms in 2011. While PPL companies responded very well, we believe there are areas for improvement that will help us do an even better job, when faced with such challenges in the future. We believe the proactive approach will not only improve service to our customers, but will maintain or improve our regulatory margin as we faced rate proceedings in 2013 and beyond. 
Finally, I wanted to highlight that our Supply business operating expenses in 2012 are roughly $0.10 per share higher than 2011. This increase is driven by more plant fossil outages and higher costs at our Susquehanna nuclear plant, some in response to anticipated NRC initiatives. 
In closing, I'd say that 2011 was another solid year for PPL's, particularly in terms of challenges met and opportunities seized. We're well positioned for 2012, and our announced dividend increase reflects our optimism in the PPL strategy. 
Now let me turn the call over to Paul."
185508,157005525,219673,"PPL Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2012",2012-02-10,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 13 to review fourth quarter and year-end results. As outlined on this slide, the largest positive driver of earnings from ongoing operations in the fourth quarter came out of the U.K. and was p",1281,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 13 to review fourth quarter and year-end results. As outlined on this slide, the largest positive driver of earnings from ongoing operations in the fourth quarter came out of the U.K. and was primarily due to earnings from the Midlands acquisition. This positive driver was more than offset by the combined impact of dilution of $0.13 per share as a result of the common stock issued in April to fund the Midlands acquisition and lower energy margins, as we expected. 
Full year 2011 earnings from ongoing operations were favorably impacted by the financial performance of our utilities in U.K. and Kentucky. These positive drivers were offset by dilution of $0.75 per share, resulting from the common stock issued in June 2010 to fund the Kentucky acquisition and the common stock issued in April of last year to fund the Midlands acquisition. 
As forecasted our Supply segment had lower margins in 2011 compared to a year ago. Because the Kentucky acquisition did not close until November 1, 2010, the fourth quarter results are not fully comparable. However, I'd like to remind everyone that the Kentucky Regulated segment earnings include 4 major items: the operating results at KU and LG&E, the holding company costs at LKE, interest expense associated with the 2010 equity unit issuance and dilution of $0.11 per share. 
Let's move now to the International Regulated segment earnings drivers on Slide 14. Our International Regulated segment earned $0.87 per share in 2011, a $0.34 increase over 2010. This increase was due to the operating results of the Midlands utilities, net of interest expense of $0.05 per share associated with the 2011 equity unit issuance, higher earnings in WPD's legacy businesses, resulting from higher delivery revenue primarily driven by higher prices and a more favorable currency exchange rate. This was partially offset by higher pension expense, higher income taxes and dilution of $0.24 per share. 
Moving to Slide 15, our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.31 per share in 2011, a $0.04 increase over 2010. This increase was the net result of higher delivery margins, primary due to the distribution base rate increase that went into effect in April 1 of last year. Lower O&M -- lower taxes primary due to a Pennsylvania state tax benefit related to the 100% bonus depreciation last year and dilution of $0.09 per share. 
Turning now to Supply on Slide 16, this segment earned $1.14 per share in 2011, a decrease of $1.13 per share compared to 2010. Lower earnings in this segment were driven primarily by lower regulatory margins as a result of energy and capacity prices in the East, lower baseload generation, lower basis and higher delivered coal prices. This was partially offset by higher margin on coal requirement sales contracts. Also impacted 2011 results were higher O&M at Susquehanna in our fossil and hydroelectric stations in the East and the West, higher income taxes, primarily due to valuation allowances on Pennsylvania net operating loss carryforwards, that were driven by lower projected future taxable income, including the impacts of bonus depreciation and lower forward energy prices. Finally, dilution of $0.31 per share. 
Turning now to Slide 17, as Bill already mentioned, we are announcing our 2012 earnings forecast range of $2.15 to $2.45 with the midpoint of $2.30 per share. This slide shows the year-over-year change in earnings by key drivers within each segment. The $0.13 impact of dilution has been removed from the segment earnings and is shown as a separate line item on the graph. We expect increased earnings from the International Regulated segment primarily due to an additional 4 months of earnings from the Midlands businesses, basically our 4 highest earning months of the year, and an annualized increase in delivery revenue of 9.5% effective April 1. 
Partially offsetting these positive earnings drivers are higher O&M, higher depreciation, higher income taxes and a less favorable currency exchange rate. We expect lower earnings from our Supply segment in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to lower energy margin, as a result of lower energy and capacity prices, and higher fuel costs, partially offset by higher nuclear and coal generation output, higher O&M primarily due to additional plant outages at our Eastern fossil and hydroelectric stations, higher depreciation, higher income taxes and an assumption of lower realized nuclear decommissioning trust earnings that we experienced in 2011. 
The lower earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment are primarily due to higher O&M, as a result of plant increases and system reliability work and customer service costs, as Bill mentioned, and higher, depreciation resulting from higher plant and service. We also expect higher income taxes as a result of the 2011 Pennsylvania State tax benefits related to bonus depreciation that will not continue into 2012. 
These negative earnings drivers are expected to be partially offset by higher delivery revenue, primarily on the transmission side of the business. We expect lower earnings from the Kentucky Regulated segment due to certain regulatory initiatives in the areas of customer service, gas pipeline safety and infrastructure security, increased operating and maintenance costs from additional plant or plant outages and higher baseline spending. We also expect higher depreciation as a result of higher plant and service. These increased costs will be partially offset by higher budgeted electricity and gas margins due to expected low growth, our growing ECR rate base and base rate increases from Virginia and the FERC. 
On Slide 18, we provide updates on our free cash flow before dividends. For 2011, this graph obviously excludes the impact of approximately $5.8  billion necessary to fund the Midlands acquisitions. Our 2011 projected free cash flow before dividend has not changed materially since the third quarter call. A decrease in actual capital expenditures was due to lower capital spending in the Supply and Kentucky Regulated segments, partially offset by higher capital spending in International. The changing CapEx was almost entirely offset by a change in other net investing activities. 
The largest driver of 2012 free cash flow before dividends is projected capital expenditures of $3.8 billion, primarily at our rate regulated businesses. The details of our projected capital expenditures and related rate base growth can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. 
Partially offsetting the increase of capital spending is higher expected cash from operations in the International Regulated segment, primarily due to the additional 4 months of Midlands operations versus 2011. Cash from operations also reflects projected pension contributions of around $400 million for the year. 
Due to large fluctuations that can occur in certain cash flow items like changes in working capital and collateral requirements on power hedges, starting at 2012, we no longer plan to discuss quarter-over-quarter changes to our year-end projections of free cash flows before dividends. We will provide an annual estimate of free cash flow before dividends for the upcoming year at the time, we announce earnings guidance. You can obviously track the company's actual free cash flow before dividends using our SEC filings, though. 
Finally, turning to Slide 19, as Jim mentioned earlier, we have raised the annualized dividend 2.9% to $1.44 effective with the April dividend payment. This dividend level represents a 63% payout ratio based on the midpoint of our 2012 earnings forecast, and is expected to be more than covered by our rate regulated earnings. The combination of the acquisitions we completed over the last 2 years, the diversity of the competitive generation fleet and the growth prospects of our utility businesses clearly permit us to look at flexibility in growing the dividend in the future. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim for the question-and-answer period."

On previous calls, you mentioned your expectations for higher power prices in '13 and '14, and it looks like you still hold that view. But for the moment, we basically have a stay in CSAPR. We've seen substantial decline in forward natural gas and power prices. And so if this actually materializes, given these facts, do you see enough drivers on the regulated side to offset those headwinds and any impact from the converts to drive earnings growth in '13 and '14 from 2012?"

One of the reasons why obviously beyond just having rate case filings, that we expect for next year like we have multiple fronts. Clearly, the commodity markets are dynamically changing, and the environmental regulations stays obviously make it difficult to predict earnings on an intermediate forecast basis. I would expect as we look at current forward collar prices that we would be able to offset much of the decline that could come from margin declines with rate regulated earnings growth, that would be a combination of those rate case filings I've talked about, the ECR spending in Kentucky the, normal formula rate adjustments that we've got coming through the FERC jurisdictional transmission in Pennsylvania Electric Utilities, as well as obviously in this year in 2013, on an annualized basis starting April 1, I talked about the 9.5% revenue increase for that asset base, and that's going to continue to grow in '14 and beyond. I'd expect we'd be able to offset much of it. The question is obviously what happens between now and the time that we layer in the hedges that secure most or all of 2013, which I wouldn't expect to happen until we move further in the year, obviously. And then '14 as we've talked about in the past, is fairly open. So it just depends upon on what happened in those commodity markets. I think, For what we have control over, we've executed very well in terms of the rate case filings and the settlements in those areas, and I'd expect we'll do the same in '13. The thing that we don't have control over is the commodity markets."

And we think that's a pretty substantial amount to go for, anyway. So I would think that we would file, as I mentioned earlier, some time early next year, and then we would probably lean towards the tracking-type mechanism more so than the forward test year, but we haven't made that determination yet. And that's just based on our early read of that. As it relates to Kentucky, we have not announced formally any plan to issue a rate or to file a rate case. Typically if we were to do so, we need to file that about 6 months in anticipation of the targeted date for implementation, 6 to 9 months in that range.

First I'll kick off the call with an overview of our first quarter results and operational highlights for the first 3 months of the year then Paul will provide more details on our segment performance for the quarter. Following his remarks, we'll turn to your questions. With that, let's go ahead and get started. Today we announced reported first quarter earnings of $0.93 per share, up from $0.82 in the first quarter of 2011. Earnings from ongoing operations for the quarter were $0.70 per share compared with $0.84 a share in the same period last year. 
Our first quarter earnings from ongoing operations reflect $0.14 per share of dilution from our April 2011 common stock issuance to finance our acquisition of the Midlands utilities in the U.K.  As you can see in our segment results for the quarter we have very strong performance in the U.K., including the successful integration of the Midlands operations. This quarterly results demonstrate the value of our expansion and to diversify regulatory jurisdiction and the attainment of a more predictable earnings profile. 
While our competitive supply segment has become a relatively smaller piece of the pie, our supply team continues to successfully navigate through these very challenging commodity markets. Paul will go into additional details on a segment-by-segment basis but the weather-driven weakness in our domestic regulated business were offset by the strength of our U.K. operations and very good Supply segment performance. 
So despite the impact of the mild winter, our first quarter results keep us solidly on track to achieve our 2012 earnings forecasts. Today we are reaffirming our forecast of $2.11 or rather $2.15 to $2.45 per share in earnings from ongoing operations. Now let's turn to a brief operational overview for the quarter. Starting in the U.K., Western Power Distribution has fully integrated the Midlands operation on schedule and within budget. 
As you can see from the slides in the appendix to today's presentation, WPD employees have already made dramatic improvements in performance resulting in material benefits not only for our customers but for our shareholders as well. Our current assessment in the case that annual cash cost savings for the maintenance operations will be higher than what we projected during the acquisition announcement and equity financing last spring. 
These cost reductions are not coming at the expense of customer service, rather just the opposite. In just 12 months Midlands customers have seen a 40% reduction in customer minutes lost and important measure of performance in the U.K. We've also accomplish a 96% reduction in customers out of service for more than 18 hours, a 26% improvement in the number of customers restored in just 1 hour and a 22% improvement in the number of interruptions per 100 customers. 
These customer service performance improvements will result in additional incentive revenues in the future for WPD. We also believe that these improvements will further cement WPD's reputation as the gold standard for net operations in the U.K. We recently received some very good Susquehanna-Roseland Transmission Line project. National Park Service confirmed our preferred route to the Delaware water gap as the most desirable alternative. 
We expect a final record of decision for the national park service in October. This timing it will allow us to have the line is service to meet the 2015 PJM peak demand. In our competitive supply business, we completed the acquisition of a 700 megawatt gas-fired power plant in central Pennsylvania. The purchase of the AES plant represented an excellent opportunity for us to expand our gas fleet at an attractive valuation and in our own backyard. 
All of our competitive power plants had high availability during the quarter, and our gas-fired units saw increased run times as a result of low natural gas prices and a displacement of higher cost coal units. Our combined cycle gas units are already seeing close to maximum run times. For example, our lower Mount Bethel [ph] was operating at a 92% capacity factor in the first quarter. Ironwood had very strong numbers as well but that unit underwent a plant outage during a portion of the quarter. Our 
energy market and trading operations is driving value from these assets through our expert knowledge of market dynamics. Our team has done an excellent job in job capturing value and excuting hedges at the right time and as you can see on our hedge disclosure slide in the appendix, we've updated it to reflect that to show results through the first quarter, and the termination of the southern Montana contract. The modest change in coal prices reflects the lower coal burns this year shifting some of the deliveries to next year. 
Our hedge levels for power in 2014 are not materially different from the 10% to 20% we discussed on our year end call in early February. We have chosen to keep our hedging at this level because we don't see value locking in prices that we think are currently artificially low. We continue to believe that current power prices did not appropriately reflect the cost of pie with mass and CSAPR rules were all anticipated coal plant closures. 
We also believe we can see even further heat rate expansion as gas and power prices continue to decouple in the forward years. Finally we see current forwards being disproportionately affected by the short term weather, economic and gas market dynamics. These factors and the competitiveness of our mid Atlantic fleet lead us to believe that there is more upside opportunity for 2014 than downside risk at this point. 
On the nuclear front Susquehanna Unit 1 is in the midst of its refueling outage. You may have seen our recent press release indicating we've identified several cracks in low pressure turbine blades on Unit 1 and we'll be scheduling an inspection of unit 2 turbine blades as well. As we said in our release the financial impact of these replacements is not expected to be material. 
Moving now to the Pennsylvania regulated segment, I'll provide you with a summary of the distribution rate case increase request that PPL Electric Utilities filed with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission just at the end of March. We expect that any approved increase will go into effect January 12013. Slide 7 provide some details of the request. We expect the PUC, following its normal procedure to announce its plans to conduct a formal proceeding on the request. These proceedings will include technical and public input hearings during the summer, an administrative law judge recommend a decision in the fall and a final PUC vote, which is expected in December. 
As indicated on the slide, a 1% change in the allowed ROE amounts to about $23 million in revenue. This case does not include any request for alternative rate treatment or a mechanism other than the Pennsylvania act 11 law. That law does not permit filing of disks before January 1, 2013. As always we'll keep you posted on the rate case developments and we provided a docket number here so you can follow the proceeding. 
As I mentioned earlier, our first quarter results provide us with additional validation of the robustness of PPL's current portfolio. Because of the geographic and regulatory diversity of our business, we remain on track to achieve our earnings forecasts despite some of the mildest winter weather that our domestic utilities have ever seen. Over the past several months I've been asked numerous times about potential changes in the company strategy under my leadership of PPL. 
I've obviously been very involved in our strategic direction for some time and I believe time as proven they value of the steps in taken over the past several years. Going forward, our focus is going to be on delivering high quality service to our customers the remaining flexible and our competitive supply business to respond dynamic market conditions. I believe our current business mix is one of the most attractive in the sector as we have significant growth opportunities in each of our regulated business segments and a very competitive generation fleet. 
With 70% of our 2012 ongoing earnings coming from growing rate regulated businesses, we have a very solid platform for continued growth. We're forecasting compound annual rate base growth of about 8% over the next 5 years in our utility operations in the U.S. and the U.K. The resulting $8 billion of net rate base growth will come from infrastructure investments, much of which have already been approved by regulatory agencies or recovered in formulary. This includes to improve environmental cost recovery spending in Kentucky, our approved capital spending in the U.K. through early 2015 and transmission projects in the U.S. We also receive regulatory approval yesterday from the Kentucky Public Service Commission to both acquire and build gas-fired generation in Kentucky. 
Our regulated utilities are recognized for high-quality customer service, excellent reliability and positive storm response, which as you know are keys to successful long-term regulatory relationships and customer satisfaction. PPL will continue to be sharply focused on these important areas. While many of us await improved fundamentals in the electric commodity sector, PPL's favorable mix of nuclear, coal, gas and hydro facilities gives us flexibility in the current market and will provide significant upside potential when markets ultimately recover. 
In summary, I continue to believe that PPL's current strategic position is a compelling one and our focus will be on the execution and delivery of the commitment that we made to customers in our shareholders. I'll look forward to your questions following Paul's comments. Paul?"

Before I provide details of the earnings drivers for the first quarter, I first want to discuss the equity financing that we completed in early April through a forward transaction. This offering combined with our existing management comp programs fulfill the $350 million of equity need for the year that we have consistently communicated. 
We decided to issue the stock through the use of a forward contract in order to de-risk the exposure we have and accomplish that without affecting the expectations we set regarding share count and EPS for the year. In fact, the EPS impact is actually pushed out slightly beyond the late 2012 timeframe that we have recently communicated to you. As part of our internal comprehensive risk management program and for the same reasons we have generation fuel interest rates are currency for known exposures we use this forward transaction to mitigate risk around our equity need. 
Beyond the derisking benefit we also wanted to meet a potential overhang on the stock with several of you have recently voiced as a concern. Given the current state of commodity markets there's been concern that we may need additional equity beyond the $350 million previously communicated. We do not. 
The regulated acquisition we completed combined with modest and most equity to fund rate base growth provide credit stability that will help us endure prolonged weak commodity markets. With that, let's move to Slide 8 to review our first quarter results. PPL's first quarter earnings from ongoing operations are down from a year ago driven by $0.14 per share of dilution associated with the April issue last year of common stock to finance the Midlands acquisition. 
Lower energy margins at the supply segment and lower electricity due to the extremely mild weather experience in our U.S. service territories. These negative drivers were significantly offset by strong operating results in the U.K., including the Midlands operations and we acquired April 1 of last year. Let's turn to the Kentucky regulated segment earnings drivers on Slide 9. Our Kentucky regulated segment earned $0.06 in the first quarter, a$0.09 decrease compared to last year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower margins due to lower retail electric volumes from mild weather, which impacted margins by $0.03, as well as lower operations systems sales. 
We had higher O&M primarily due to the increased scope of scheduled generation outages in 2012, higher depreciation due to higher plant and service and dilution of $0.01 per share. Moving to Slide 10, our U.K. regulated segment earned of $0.31 per share in the first quarter, a 15% increase over last year. The increase was due to the operating results of the Midlands utilities, net of interest expense associated with the 2011 equity units and higher delivery margins in our legacy WPD operation primarily driven by net impact of higher prices and lower volumes. 
These positive earnings drivers were partially offset by higher O&M, including higher pension expense higher U.S. income taxes and dilution of $0.06 per share. Turning now to our Pennsylvania regulated segment on Slide 11. This segment earned $0.06 per share in the first quarter, a $0.05 decrease compared to a year ago. This decrease was the net result of lower delivery margins of $0.02 primarily due to unseasonably mild weather, modestly higher O&M, higher depreciation again due to higher plant and service and dilution of $0.01 per share. 
Moving now to Slide 12, our Supply segment earned $0.27 per share in the first quarter, a decrease of $0.15 compared to last year. This decrease was primarily the net result of lower Eastern energy margins driven by both lower energy and capacity prices and partially offset by higher nuclear generation. Higher O&M lower income taxes primarily due to a lower state effective tax rate, and finally dilution of $0.06 per share. 
And with that, by way of review, I'd like to turn the call back to Bill for the Q&A period."

So we have a sizable fleet around 20,000 megawatts so we do have the scale in good markets and I think as Paul mentioned earlier, we have the ability to weather the down cycles now with the commodity cycle because of the robustness of the regulated businesses. So overall, I've feel like it's if it for the company to continues to be a fit for the company and potential upside as the go into the future. And just a final now from an environmental perspective, I think you're aware that on a competitive fleet side, we're very well equipped to deal with them back to the CSAPR we're not looking at any major new incremental investments of environmental side."

We appreciate your continued interest in PPL, and as always, we look forward to answering your questions.

First I'll kick off the call with an overview of our first quarter results and operational highlights for the first 3 months of the year, then Paul will provide more details on our segment performance for the quarter. Following his remarks, we'll turn to your questions. With that, let's go ahead and get started.
Today we announced reported first quarter earnings of $0.93 per share, up from $0.82 in the first quarter of 2011. Earnings from ongoing operations for the quarter were $0.70 per share compared with $0.84 a share in the same period last year. Our first quarter earnings from ongoing operations reflect $0.14 per share of dilution from our April 2011 common stock issuance to finance our acquisition of the Midlands utilities in the U.K.  As you can see in our segment results for the quarter, we had very strong performance in the U.K., including the successful integration of the Midlands operations. These quarterly results demonstrate the value of our expansion and into diversified regulatory jurisdictions and the attainment of a more predictable earnings profile. While our Competitive Supply segment has become a relatively smaller piece of the pie, our Supply team continues to successfully navigate through these very challenging commodity markets. Paul will go into additional details on a segment-by-segment basis but the weather-driven weakness in our Domestic Regulated business were offset by the strength of our U.K. operations and very good Supply segment performance.
So despite the impact of the mild winter, our first quarter results keep us solidly on track to achieve our 2012 earnings forecast. Today we are reaffirming our forecast of $2.11 -- or rather, $2.15 to $2.45 per share in earnings from ongoing operations.
Now let's turn to a brief operational overview for the quarter.
Starting in the U.K., Western Power Distribution has fully integrated the Midlands operations on schedule and within budget. As you can see from the slides in the appendix to today's presentation, WPD employees have already made dramatic improvements in performance, resulting in material benefits not only for our customers but for our shareholders as well. Our current assessment in the case that annual cash cost savings, for the Midlands operations, will be higher than what we projected during the acquisition announcement and equity financing last spring.  These cost reductions are not coming at the expense of customer service, rather just the opposite. In just 12 months Midland customers have seen a 40% reduction in customer minutes lost, an important measure of performance in the U.K. We've also accomplish a 96% reduction in customers out of service for more than 18 hours, a 26% improvement in the number of customers restored in just 1 hour, and a 22% improvement in the number of interruptions per 100 customers. These customer service performance improvements will result in additional incentive revenues in the future for WPD. We also believe that these improvements will further cement WPD's reputation as the gold standard for network operations in the U.K.
We recently received some very good Susquehanna-Roseland Transmission Line project. The National Park Service confirmed our preferred route through the Delaware Water Gap as the most desirable alternative. We expect a final record of decision from the National Park Service in October. This timing it will allow us to have the line is service to meet the 2015 PJM peak demand.
In our Competitive Supply business, we completed the acquisition of a 700 megawatt gas-fired power plant in central Pennsylvania. The purchase of the AES Ironwood plant represented an excellent opportunity for us to expand our gas fleet at an attractive valuation, and in our own backyard. All of our competitive power plants had high availability during the quarter and our gas-fired units saw increased run times as a result of low natural gas prices and a displacement of higher cost coal units. Our combined cycle gas units are already seeing close to maximum run times. For example, our Lower Mount Bethel was operating at a 92% capacity factor in the first quarter. Ironwood had very strong numbers as well but that unit underwent a plant outage during a portion of the quarter.
Our energy market and trading operation is driving value from these assets through our expert knowledge of market dynamics. Our team has done an excellent job in job capturing value and executing hedges at the right time, and as you can see on our hedge disclosure slide in the appendix, we've updated it to reflect actual results through the first quarter and the termination of the Southern Montana contract. The modest change in coal prices reflects the lower coal burns this year, shifting some of the deliveries to next year. Our hedge levels for power in 2014 are not materially different from the 10% to 20% we discussed on our year end call in early February. We have chosen to keep our hedging at this level because we don't see value locking in prices that we think are, currently, artificially low. We continue to believe that current forward power prices do not appropriately reflect the cost to comply with MATS and CSAPR rules or all anticipated coal plant closures. We also believe we can see even further heat rate expansion as gas and power prices continue to decouple in the forward years.
Finally we see current forwards being disproportionately affected by the short term weather, economic and gas market dynamics. These factors and the competitiveness of our mid-Atlantic fleet lead us to believe that there is more upside opportunity for 2014, than downside risk, at this point.
On the nuclear front Susquehanna Unit 1 is in the midst of its refueling outage. You may have seen our recent press release indicating we've identified several cracks on low pressure turbine blades on Unit 1 and will be scheduling an inspection of unit 2 turbine blades as well. As we said in our release, the financial impact of these replacements is not expected to be material.
Moving now to the Pennsylvania Regulated segment.
I'll provide you with a summary of the distribution rate case increase request that PPL Electric Utilities filed with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission just at the end of March. We expect that any approved increase would go into effect January 1, 2013. Slide 7 provide some details of the request. We expect the PUC, following its normal procedure, to announce its plans to conduct a formal proceeding on the request. These proceedings will include technical and public input hearings during the summer, an administrative law judge-recommend decision in the fall and a final PUC vote, which is expected in December. As indicated on the slide, a 1% change in the allowed ROE amounts to about $23 million in revenue. This case does not include any request for alternative rate treatment or a DSIC mechanism under the new Pennsylvania Act 11 law. That law does not permit filing of DSIC before January 1, 2013.
As always we'll keep you posted on the rate case developments and we provided a docket number here so you can follow the proceeding.
As I mentioned earlier, our first quarter results provide us with additional validation of the robustness of PPL's current portfolio. Because of the geographic and regulatory diversity of our business, we remain on track to achieve our earnings forecasts despite some of the mildest winter weather that our domestic utilities have ever seen. Over the past several months I've been asked numerous times about potential changes in the company strategy under my leadership of PPL. I've obviously been very involved in our strategic direction for some time and I believe time as proven they value of the steps we've taken over the past several years. Going forward, our focus is going to be on delivering high-quality service to our customers and remaining flexible in our Competitive Supply business to respond to dynamic market conditions. I believe our current business mix is one of the most attractive in the sector as we have significant growth opportunities in each of our Regulated business segments and a very competitive generation fleet.
With 70% of our 2012 ongoing earnings coming from growing rate-regulated businesses, we have a very solid platform for continued growth. We're forecasting compound annual rate base growth of about 8% over the next 5 years in our utility operations in the U.S. and the U.K. The resulting $8 billion of net rate base growth will come from infrastructure investments, much of which have already been approved by regulatory agencies or recovered in formula rates. This includes the improved environmental cost recovery spending in Kentucky, our approved capital spending in the U.K. through early 2015 and transmission projects in the U.S. We also received regulatory approval, yesterday from the Kentucky Public Service Commission, to both acquire and build gas-fired generation in Kentucky. Our regulated utilities are recognized for high-quality customer service, excellent reliability and positive storm response which, as you know, are keys to successful long-term regulatory relationships and customer satisfaction. PPL will continue to be sharply focused on these important areas. While many of us await improved fundamentals in the electric commodity sector, PPL's favorable mix of nuclear, coal, gas and hydro facilities gives us flexibility in the current market, and will provide significant upside potential when markets ultimately recover.
In summary, I continue to believe that PPL's current strategic position is a compelling one and our focus will be on the execution and delivery of the commitments that we've made to customers in our share owners. I look forward to your questions following Paul's comments. Paul?"

Before I provide details of the earnings drivers for the first quarter, I first want to discuss the equity financing that we completed in early April through a forward transaction. This offering, combined with our",670,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Before I provide details of the earnings drivers for the first quarter, I first want to discuss the equity financing that we completed in early April through a forward transaction. This offering, combined with our existing DRIP and management comp programs, fulfills the $350 million of equity need for the year that we have consistently communicated. We decided to issue the stock through the use of a forward contract in order to de-risk the equity exposure we had and accomplished that without affecting the expectations we set regarding share count and EPS for the year. In fact, the EPS impact is actually pushed out slightly beyond the late 2012 timeframe that we recently communicated to you. As part of our internal comprehensive risk management program and for the same reasons we had generation, output, fuel, interest rate, our currency for known exposures, we used this forward transaction to mitigate risk around our equity need. Beyond the de-risking benefit we also wanted to alleviate a potential overhang on the stock which several of you have recently voiced as a concern. Given the current state of commodity markets there has been concern that we may need additional equity beyond the $350 million previously communicated. We do not.  The regulated acquisitions we completed, combined with modest amounts of equity to fund rate base growth, provide credit stability that will help us endure prolonged weak commodity markets.
With that, let's move to Slide 8 to review our first quarter results.
PPL's first quarter earnings from ongoing operations are down from a year ago, driven by $0.14 per share of dilution associated with the April issuance, last year, of common stock to finance the Midlands acquisition; lower energy margins at the Supply segment; and lower electricity sales due to the extremely mild weather experienced in our U.S. service territories. These negative drivers were significantly offset by strong operating results in the U.K., including the Midlands operations that we acquired April 1 of last year.
Let's turn to the Kentucky Regulated segment earnings drivers on Slide 9.
Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.06 per share in the first quarter, a $0.09 decrease compared to last year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower margins due to lower retail electric volumes from mild weather, which impacted margins by $0.03, as well as lower op system sales. We had higher O&M primarily due to the increased scope of scheduled generation outages in 2012, higher depreciation due to higher plant and service and dilution of $0.01 per share.
Moving to Slide 10.
Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.31 per share in the first quarter, a 15% increase over last year. The increase was due to the operating results of the Midlands utilities, net of interest expense associated with the 2011 equity units and higher delivery margins in our legacy WPD operation, primarily driven by the net impact of higher prices and lower volumes. These positive earnings drivers were partially offset by higher O&M, including higher pension expense; higher U.S. income taxes; and dilution of $0.06 per share.
Turning now to our Pennsylvania Regulated segment on Slide 11.
This segment earned $0.06 per share in the first quarter, a $0.05 decrease compared to a year ago. This decrease was the net result of lower delivery margins of $0.02, primarily due to unseasonably mild weather; modestly higher O&M; higher depreciation, again due to higher plant; and service and dilution of $0.01 per share.
Moving now to Slide 12.
Our Supply segment earned $0.27 per share in the first quarter, a decrease of $0.15 compared to last year. This decrease was primarily the net results of lower Eastern energy margins, driven by both lower energy and capacity prices, and partially offset by higher nuclear generation; higher O&M; lower income taxes, primarily due to a lower state effective tax rate; and finally, dilution of $0.06 per share. 
And with that, by way of review, I'd like to turn the call back to Bill for the Q&A period."

And after that program is complete, the cash flows are relatively robust there. The CapEx programs, I would look at, kind of projecting forward, the levels of the spend that we got in both EU and in WPD. There are strong opportunities and needs to put capital to work there, but the big build in Kentucky does have some finite into it.

From a credit perspective, as I indicated, we've got $1.15 billion that's converting in mid-'13 we've got $950 million converting in April of '14 related to the equity converts that we did as part of both deals. Effectively, what will happen is that equity happens at core, if you will, and will get injected into supply allowing supply to de-lever. The 2 rating agencies -- well I'll talk about the 3, but S&P -- I'll talk about 2 in the 3. S&P looks at PPL on a consolidated credit basis and so they look at consolidated FFO and consolidated debt. That movement down to supply would be, effectively, inconsequential to them, which is effectively taking debt that's at Supply and moving it up the core. And in all this, we're trying to maintain investment grade credit ratings, obviously for Supply, which enables us to get the liquidity at reasonable prices to do the hedging. For Moody's, they [indiscernible] for us on entity by entity basis and I think -- I won't speak for them, but if we can maintain 20%-ish FFO at the debt metrics, I think we can maintain investment grade. We'd like to be more robust and I think, by the time we get out a couple of years, we'll see some of the fundamental benefits that Bill talked about in terms of power prices, in terms of tighter capacity margins and that will clearly provide opportunity for the fleet. So on a year by year basis, you could can look at things and they may look a little tight, but I think you can put it in reasonable enough time horizon, and with the amount of incremental small equity needs that I talked about, year-on-year, we can manage through this."

First I'll kick off the call with an overview of our first quarter results and operational highlights for the first 3 months of the year, then Paul will provide more details on our segment performance for the quarter. Following his remarks, we'll turn to your questions. With that, let's go ahead and get started.
Today we announced reported first quarter earnings of $0.93 per share, up from $0.82 in the first quarter of 2011. Earnings from ongoing operations for the quarter were $0.70 per share compared with $0.84 a share in the same period last year. Our first quarter earnings from ongoing operations reflect $0.14 per share of dilution from our April 2011 common stock issuance to finance our acquisition of the Midlands utilities in the U.K.  As you can see in our segment results for the quarter, we had very strong performance in the U.K., including the successful integration of the Midlands operations. These quarterly results demonstrate the value of our expansion and into diversified regulatory jurisdictions and the attainment of a more predictable earnings profile. While our Competitive Supply segment has become a relatively smaller piece of the pie, our Supply team continues to successfully navigate through these very challenging commodity markets. Paul will go into additional details on a segment-by-segment basis but the weather-driven weakness in our Domestic Regulated businesses were offset by the strength of our U.K. operations and very good Supply segment performance.
So despite the impact of the mild winter, our first quarter results keep us solidly on track to achieve our 2012 earnings forecast. Today we are reaffirming our forecast of $2.11 -- or rather, $2.15 to $2.45 per share in earnings from ongoing operations.
Now let's turn to a brief operational overview for the quarter.
Starting in the U.K., Western Power Distribution has fully integrated the Midlands operations on schedule and within budget. As you can see from the slides in the appendix to today's presentation, WPD employees have already made dramatic improvements in performance, resulting in material benefits not only for our customers but our shareholders as well. Our current assessment in the case that annual cash cost savings, for the Midlands operations, will be higher than what we projected during the acquisition announcement and equity financing last spring.  These cost reductions are not coming at the expense of customer service, rather just the opposite. In just 12 months Midland customers have seen a 40% reduction in customer minutes lost, an important measure of performance in the U.K. We've also accomplished a 96% reduction in customers out of service for more than 18 hours, a 26% improvement in the number of customers restored in just 1 hour, and a 22% improvement in the number of interruptions per 100 customers. These customer service performance improvements will result in additional incentive revenues in the future for WPD. We also believe that these improvements will further cement WPD's reputation as the gold standard for network operations in the U.K.
We recently received some very good news on the Susquehanna-Roseland Transmission Line project. The National Park Service confirmed our preferred route through the Delaware Water Gap as the most desirable alternative. We expect a final record of decision from the National Park Service in October. This timing will allow us to have the line is service to meet the 2015 PJM peak demand.
In our Competitive Supply business, we completed the acquisition of a 700 megawatt gas-fired power plant in central Pennsylvania. The purchase of the AES Ironwood plant represented an excellent opportunity for us to expand our gas fleet at an attractive valuation, and in our own backyard. All of our competitive power plants had high availability during the quarter and our gas-fired units saw increased run times as a result of low natural gas prices and a displacement of higher cost coal units. Our combined cycle gas units are already seeing close to maximum run times. For example, our Lower Mount Bethel was operating at a 92% capacity factor in the first quarter. Ironwood had very strong numbers as well but that unit underwent a plant outage during a portion of the quarter.
Our energy market and trading operation is driving value from these assets through our expert knowledge of market dynamics. Our team has done an excellent job in capturing value and executing hedges at the right time, and as you can see on our hedge disclosure slide in the appendix, we've updated it to reflect actual results through the first quarter and the termination of the Southern Montana contract. The modest change in coal prices reflects the lower coal burns this year, shifting some of the deliveries to next year. Our hedge levels for power in 2014 are not materially different from the 10% to 20% we discussed on our year end call in early February. We have chosen to keep our hedging at this level because we don't see value locking in prices that we think are, currently, artificially low. We continue to believe that current forward power prices do not appropriately reflect the cost to comply with MATS and CSAPR rules or all anticipated coal plant closures. We also believe we can see even further heat rate expansion as gas and power prices continue to decouple in the forward years.
Finally we see current forwards being disproportionately affected by the short term weather, economic and gas market dynamics. These factors and the competitiveness of our mid-Atlantic fleet lead us to believe that there is more upside opportunity for 2014, than downside risk, at this point.
On the nuclear front Susquehanna Unit 1 is in the midst of its refueling outage. You may have seen our recent press release indicating we've identified several cracks on low pressure turbine blades on Unit 1 and will be scheduling an inspection of unit 2 turbine blades as well. As we said in our release, the financial impact of these replacements is not expected to be material.
Moving now to the Pennsylvania Regulated segment.
I'll provide you with a summary of the distribution rate case increase request that PPL Electric Utilities filed with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission just at the end of March. We expect that any approved increase would go into effect January 1, 2013. Slide 7 provides some details of the request. We expect the PUC, following its normal procedure, to announce its plans to conduct a formal proceeding on the request. These proceedings will include technical and public input hearings during the summer, an administrative law judge-recommended decision in the fall and a final PUC vote, which is expected in December. As indicated on the slide, a 1% change in the allowed ROE amounts to about $23 million in revenue. This case does not include any request for alternative rate treatment or a DSIC mechanism under the new Pennsylvania Act 11 law. That law does not permit filing of DSICs before January 1, 2013.
As always we'll keep you posted on the rate case developments and we provided a docket number here so you can follow the proceeding.
As I mentioned earlier, our first quarter results provide us with additional validation of the robustness of PPL's current portfolio. Because of the geographic and regulatory diversity of our business, we remain on track to achieve our earnings forecast, despite some of the mildest winter weather that our domestic utilities have ever seen. Over the past several months I've been asked numerous times about potential changes in the company strategy under my leadership of PPL. I've obviously been very involved in our strategic direction for some time and I believe time has proven the value of the steps we've taken over the past several years. Going forward, our focus is going to be on delivering high-quality service to our customers and remaining flexible in our Competitive Supply business to respond to dynamic market conditions. I believe our current business mix is one of the most attractive in the sector as we have significant growth opportunities in each of our Regulated business segments and a very competitive generation fleet.
With 70% of our 2012 ongoing earnings coming from growing rate-regulated businesses, we have a very solid platform for continued growth. We're forecasting compound annual rate base growth of about 8% over the next 5 years in our utility operations in the U.S. and the U.K. The resulting $8 billion of net rate based growth will come from infrastructure investments, much of which have already been approved by regulatory agencies or recovered in formula rates. This includes the improved environmental cost recovery spending in Kentucky, our approved capital spending in the U.K. through early 2015 and transmission projects in the U.S. We also received regulatory approval, yesterday from the Kentucky Public Service Commission, to both acquire and build gas-fired generation in Kentucky. Our regulated utilities are recognized for high-quality customer service, excellent reliability and positive storm response which, as you know, are keys to successful long-term regulatory relationships and customer satisfaction. PPL will continue to be sharply focused on these important areas. While many of us await improved fundamentals in the electric commodity sector, PPL's favorable mix of nuclear, coal, gas and hydro facilities gives us flexibility in the current market, and will provide significant upside potential when markets ultimately recover.
In summary, I continue to believe that PPL's current strategic position is a compelling one and our focus will be on the execution and delivery of the commitments that we've made to customers and our share owners. I look forward to your questions following Paul's comments. Paul?"

Before I provide details of the earnings drivers for the first quarter, I first want to discuss the equity financing that we completed in early April through a forward transaction. This offering, combined with our existing DRIP and management comp programs, fulfills the $350 million of equity need for the year that we have consistently communicated. We decided to issue the stock through the use of a forward contract in order to de-risk the equity exposure we had and accomplish that without affecting the expectations we set regarding share count and EPS for the year. In fact, the EPS impact is actually pushed out slightly beyond the late 2012 timeframe that we recently communicated to you. As part of our internal comprehensive risk management program and for the same reasons we had generation, output, fuel, interest rates, our currency for known exposures, we used this forward transaction to mitigate risk around our equity need. Beyond the de-risking benefit we also wanted to alleviate a potential overhang on the stock which several of you have recently voiced as a concern. Given the current state of commodity markets there has been concern that we may need additional equity beyond the $350 million previously communicated. We do not.  The regulated acquisitions we completed, combined with modest amounts of equity to fund rate base growth, provide credit stability that will help us endure prolonged weak commodity markets.
With that, let's move to Slide 8 to review our first quarter financial results.
PPL's first quarter earnings from ongoing operations are down from a year ago, driven by $0.14 per share of dilution associated with the April issuance, last year, of common stock to finance the Midlands acquisition; lower energy margins at the Supply segment; and lower electricity sales due to the extremely mild weather experienced in our U.S. service territories. These negative drivers were significantly offset by strong operating results in the U.K., including the Midlands operations that we acquired April 1 of last year.
Let's turn to the Kentucky Regulated segment earnings drivers on Slide 9.
Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.06 per share in the first quarter, a $0.09 decrease compared to last year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower margins due to lower retail electric volumes from mild weather, which impacted margins by $0.03, as well as lower op system sales. We had higher O&M primarily due to the increased scope of scheduled generation outages in 2012, higher depreciation due to higher plant and service and dilution of $0.01 per share.
Moving to Slide 10.
Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.31 per share in the first quarter, a 15% increase over last year. The increase was due to the operating results of the Midlands utilities, net of interest expense associated with the 2011 equity units and higher delivery margins in our legacy WPD operation, primarily driven by the net impact of higher prices and lower volumes. These positive earnings drivers were partially offset by higher O&M, including higher pension expense; higher U.S. income taxes; and dilution of $0.06 per share.
Turning now to our Pennsylvania Regulated segment on Slide 11.
This segment earned $0.06 per share in the first quarter, a $0.05 decrease compared to a year ago. This decrease was the net result of lower delivery margins of $0.02, primarily due to unseasonably mild weather; modestly higher O&M; higher depreciation, again due to higher plant and service and dilution of $0.01 per share.
Moving now to Slide 12.
Our Supply segment earned $0.27 per share in the first quarter, a decrease of $0.15 compared to last year. This decrease was primarily the net result of lower Eastern energy margins, driven by both lower energy and capacity prices, and partially offset by higher nuclear generation; higher O&M; lower income taxes, primarily due to a lower state effective tax rate; and finally, dilution of $0.06 per share. 
And with that, by way of review, I'd like to turn the call back to Bill for the Q&A period."

From a credit perspective, as I indicated, we've got $1.15 billion that's converting in mid-'13 we've got $950 million converting in April of '14 related to the equity converts that we did as part of both deals. Effectively, what will happen is that equity happens at core, if you will, and will get injected into supply allowing supply to de-lever. The 2 rating agencies -- well I'll talk about the 3, but S&P -- I'll talk about 2 in the 3. S&P looks at PPL on a consolidated credit basis and so they look at consolidated FFO and consolidated debt. That movement down to supply would be, effectively, inconsequential to them, which is effectively taking debt that's at Supply and moving it up the core. And in all this, we're trying to maintain investment grade credit ratings, obviously for Supply, which enables us to get the liquidity at reasonable prices to do the hedging. For Moody's, they [indiscernible] for us on an entity by entity basis and I think -- I won't speak for them, but if we can maintain 20%-ish FFO at the debt metrics, I think we can maintain investment grade. We'd like to be more robust and I think, by the time we get out a couple of years, we'll see some of the fundamental benefits that Bill talked about in terms of power prices, in terms of tighter capacity margins and that will clearly provide opportunity for the fleet. So on a year by year basis, you could can look at things and they may look a little tight, but I think you can put it in a reasonable enough time horizon, and with the amount of incremental small equity needs that I talked about, year-on-year, we can manage through this."

I’m joined on the call this morning by Paul Farr, PPL’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for the Q&A session are the Presidents of all business segments; Vic Staffieri, President and CEO of LG&EKU, our Kentucky Regulated business; Rick Klingensmith, President of PPL Global, who has responsibility for UK regulated operations and our Energy Services businesses; Greg Dudkin, President of PPL Electric Utilities, our Pennsylvania Regulated segment; and Dave DeCampli, President of our competitive market Supply segment.
To get started today, I have an overview of our second quarter results and a few operational highlights, then Paul will provide more details on our segment performance in the quarter and following his remarks we will turn to your questions.
Today we announced the second quarter reported earnings of $0.46 per share up from $0.35 in the same quarter a year ago. Earnings from ongoing operations for the quarter were $0.51 per share compared with $0.45 per share in the same period last year.
For the first six months of the year, our reported earnings were $1.39 per share, up from $1.13 per share in the first six months of 2011. Ongoing earnings were $1.21 a share for the first half of the year versus $1.26 per share in the same period a year ago.
Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations include $0.02 per share dilution from the common stock issued and April 2011 financed acquisition of the Midlands utilizes in the UK. For the first six months, dilution amounted to $0.13 per share. Strong results from our UK operations were a major drag from the improvement in both ongoing and reported earnings in the second quarter.
Strong earnings from the UK operations and the ability of our supply group to effectively manage unplanned outage challenges at our Susquehanna nuclear plant has put us solidly on course to achieve our 2012 earnings forecast. We are reaffirming our forecast of $2.15 to $2.45 per share in earnings from ongoing operations.
Before we join for a more detailed discussion of our financial results, I’ll provide a brief operational overview for the quarter. As I mentioned on previous call, our management team in the UK has dramatically improved the customer performance of our Midlands utility.
I’m pleased to tell you that we recently - that all four of our distribution companies have now been ordered the Customer Service Excellence Standard, the highest customer service honor in the UK. This is the first time for our Midlands companies and the 20th year for our legacy South West [and South Wales] to receive the award. As we continue to see improved performance related to the number and duration of outages and regulatory metrics. This performance improvement is detailed to you in the appendix.
Turning to the domestic operations, PPL’s electric delivery operation in Pennsylvania once again has ranked highest among large electric utilities in the Eastern United States for residential customer satisfaction in a survey conducted by J.D. Power and Associates. The award is the company’s 18th overall since J.D. Power and Associates began studying customer satisfaction among electric utilities. Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric were part of the J.D. Power report on midsize utilities in the Midwest Region and also had strong customer satisfaction standards.
So, also there is some good news in the Susquehanna nuclear plant, when inspections concluded with no indications of cracking were found on Unit 2’s turbine blades at the facility. We returned to units of service on June 15 after the inspection analysis of this plant by discovery of small cracks on some Unit 1 blades. Unit 1 in Susquehanna returned to service on June 7 after refueling outage and has concluded replacement of a small number of turbine blades that did not cracked. We’ve installed additional diagnostic equipments on both turbines to validate suspected causes that are early under review and we are conducting additional inspection next year on Unit 1.
The utilities in Kentucky have each requested rate increases to be effective in January 2013. Louisville Gas and Electric has requested a $62.1 million increase in electric rates and a $17.2 million increase in natural gas rates. Kentucky Utilities has requested an $82.4 million increase in electric rates. The requested ROE in each case is 11%. New rates are expected to take effect January 2013.
In Pennsylvania, consideration of PPL Electric Utilities rate increase request is continuing. An administrative law judge appointed by the State Public Utility Commission has helped public input hearings on the company’s $104 million increase request. Evidentiary hearings are being held this week and we expect some decision by December. Also on the operational front, it’s worth noting that PPL’s power plants and electric delivery systems at Pennsylvania and Kentucky have performed very well during the prolonged heat spells over the last couple of months.
Generally, our power plants were invariably an important part for generation and our transportation and distribution systems handled the stress by demand very well. We out gained some significant challenges in the second quarter across all four segments. Our Supply business continues to do a pretty good job in managing through challenging commodity markets. We continue to be optimistic that we’ll see some modest increase in wholesale energy prices by 2013.
Finally, I’d like to update you on a couple of initiatives, we continue to refine internally. As you are aware, we have talked about the need to raise equity over the next 12 years to fund the very robust capital plan at all of the regulated utilities. We are looking very closely at rates significantly reduced and potentially eliminate equity needs beyond normal debt issuances and share issued for management comp. We will escalate planning process now and this is a key focus. We will provide you with specific details at an appropriate time, but we believe this objective is very realistic based on our preliminary planning.
Additionally, the Supply segment continues to refine its plans on how to protect the release if power markets decline further. The directive is to develop plans to maintain positive earnings in the Supply segment should profits worsen compared to (inaudible). I want to be clear although that we do not believe this will happen, but performing this analysis is informative and should be in support (inaudible). I’m confident both of these initiatives, will address some of your concerns and we will certainly provide further detail as our plans are firmed up.
In conclusion, we are very pleased with our upgrade. The Midlands acquisition continues to prove to be highly successful. The Supply segment continues to perform very well and managed to reach challenges and our domestic Regulated segments are progressing through the rate fees. We have solid financial plans in place that stress value through a variety of economic conditions and we are optimistic about the future prospects.
I look forward to your questions following Paul’s comments. With that I will turn it over to Paul.

Let’s move to Slide 7 to review our second quarter financial results. PPL’s second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were higher than last year primarily driven by strong operating results from the UK including a full quarter of earnings from the Midlands businesses versus two months of results that were included in our second quarter last year. This positive drive was partially offset by lower earnings in the Supply segment as a result of flat energy margins and higher O&M compared to a year ago.
Let’s turn to the Kentucky Regulated segment earnings drivers on Slide 8. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.07 per share in second quarter, $0.01 increase over last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes resulting from newer (inaudible) compared to the year ago.
Moving now to Slide 9, our UK Regulated segment, earned $0.31 per share in the second quarter a $0.10 increase over last year. This increase was due to the operating results of the Midlands utilities that included an additional month of operations as well as performance improvements.
Higher delivery revenue at WPD Southwest and South Wales is primarily driven by higher net prices and lower financing costs. These positive earnings drivers were partially offset by higher O&M, including higher pension expense, less favorable currency exchange rates and dilution of $0.01 per share.
Turning to our Pennsylvania Regulated segment on Slide 10, this segment earned $0.05 per share in the quarter, $0.01 decrease compared to last year. This decrease was primarily due to higher O&M as a result of higher payroll related expenses and higher legislation management costs.
Moving now to Slide 11, our Supply segment earned $0.03 per share in the second quarter a decrease of $0.04 compared to last year. This decrease was driven by the net result of lower West energy margins, primarily as a result of the termination of a seven-month (inaudible) contract in connection with that company’s bankruptcy. Higher Eastern Energy margins driven by higher nuclear generation partially offset by lower baseload energy and capacity prices, higher O&M primarily at the Susquehanna nuclear station, higher depreciation and dilution of $0.01 per share.
With that, I will turn the call back to Bill for the Q&A period.

As you commented, the grid did come out with a service disappointment, and it asked for additional capital to be spent in their [networks], as well as they have requested the higher (inaudible) initial proposals that came out of Ofgem what we see are they are really coming in line with what we are currently seeing for electricity distribution price control review that we are currently operating in.

As we execute on the rate base growth plans, which are a little robust in the domestic utilities than they are in the UK business, these are further offset, and again as Bill mentioned earlier, we’re into rate cases with both domestic utilities perhaps to try to get those utilities back for utilities back towards more accessible levels of earned R&D.

The regulated utilities are under earning, but we are in for rate cases on both of those domestically. WPD is executing very strongly against the plan that we have when we acquired utilities.

Also joining us for the Q&A session are the Presidents of all business segments; Vic Staffieri, President and CEO of LG&EKU, our Kentucky Regulated business; Rick Klingensmith, President of PPL Global, who has responsibility for UK regulated operations and our Energy Services businesses; Greg Dudkin, President of PPL Electric Utilities, our Pennsylvania Regulated segment; and Dave DeCampli, President of our competitive market Supply segment.
To get started today, I have an overview of our second quarter results and a few operational highlights, then Paul will provide more details on our segment performance in the quarter and following his remarks we will turn to your questions.
Today we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.46 per share up from $0.35 in the same quarter a year ago. Earnings from ongoing operations for the quarter were $0.51 per share compared with $0.45 per share in the same period last year.
For the first six months of the year, our reported earnings were $1.39 per share, up from $1.13 per share in the first six months of 2011. Ongoing earnings were $1.21 a share for the first half of the year versus $1.26 per share in the same period a year ago.
Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations include $0.02 per share dilution from the common stock issued and April 2011 financed acquisition of the Midlands utilizes in the UK. For the first 6 months, dilution amounted to $0.13 per share. Strong results from our UK operations were a major drag from the improvement in both ongoing and reported earnings in the second quarter.
Strong earnings from the UK operations and the ability of our supply group to effectively manage unplanned outage challenges at our Susquehanna nuclear plant has put us solidly on course to achieve our 2012 earnings forecast. We are reaffirming our forecast of $2.15 to $2.45 per share in earnings from ongoing operations.
Before we go into a more detailed discussion of our financial results, I’ll provide a brief operational overview for the quarter. As I mentioned on previous calls, our management team in the UK has dramatically improved the customer performance of our Midlands utility.
I’m pleased to tell you that we recently -- that all 4 of our distribution companies have now been ordered the Customer Service Excellence Standard, the highest customer service honor in the UK. This is the first time for our Midlands companies and the 20th year for our legacy South West and South Wales to receive the award. As we continue to see improved performance related to the number and duration of outages and regulatory metrics. This performance improvement is detailed to you in the appendix.
Turning to the domestic operations, PPL’s electric delivery operation in Pennsylvania once again has ranked highest among large electric utilities in the Eastern United States for residential customer satisfaction in a survey conducted by J.D. Power and Associates. The award is the company’s 18th overall since J.D. Power and Associates began studying customer satisfaction among electric utilities. Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric were part of the J.D. Power report on midsize utilities in the Midwest Region and also had strong customer satisfaction standards.
So, also there is some good news in the Susquehanna nuclear plant, when inspections concluded with no indications of cracking were found on Unit 2’s turbine blades at the facility. We returned to units of service on June 15 after the inspection analysis of this plant by discovery of small cracks on some Unit 1 blades. Unit 1 in Susquehanna returned to service on June 7 after refueling outage and has concluded replacement of a small number of turbine blades that did not cracked. We’ve installed additional diagnostic equipments on both turbines to validate suspected causes that are early under review and we are conducting additional inspection next year on Unit 1.
The utilities in Kentucky have each requested rate increases to be effective in January 2013. Louisville Gas and Electric has requested a $62.1 million increase in electric rates and a $17.2 million increase in natural gas rates. Kentucky Utilities has requested an $82.4 million increase in electric rates. The requested ROE in each case is 11%. New rates are expected to take effect January 2013.
In Pennsylvania, consideration of PPL Electric Utilities rate increase request is continuing. An administrative law judge appointed by the State Public Utility Commission has helped public input hearings on the company’s $104 million increase request. Evidentiary hearings are being held this week and we expect an initial decision by December. Also on the operational front, it’s worth noting that PPL’s power plants and electric delivery systems at Pennsylvania and Kentucky have performed very well during the prolonged heat spells over the last couple of months.
Generally, our power plants were invariably an important part for generation and our transportation and distribution systems handled the stress by demand very well. We out gained some significant challenges in the second quarter across all 4 segments. Our Supply business continues to do a pretty good job in managing through challenging commodity markets. We continue to be optimistic that we’ll see some modest increase in wholesale energy prices by 2013.
Finally, I’d like to update you on a couple of initiatives, we continue to refine internally. As you are aware, we have talked about the need to raise equity over the next 12 years to fund the very robust capital plan at all of the regulated utilities. We are looking very closely at rates significantly reduced and potentially eliminate equity needs beyond normal debt issuances and share issued for management comp. We will escalate planning process now and this is a key focus. We will provide you with specific details at an appropriate time, but we believe this objective is very realistic based on our preliminary planning.
Additionally, the Supply segment continues to refine its plans on how to protect the release if power markets decline further. The directive is to develop plans to maintain positive earnings in the Supply segment should profits worsen compared to [indiscernible]. I want to be clear although that we do not believe this will happen, but performing this analysis is informative and should be in support [indiscernible].  I’m confident both of these initiatives, will address some of your concerns and we will certainly provide further detail as our plans are firmed up.
In conclusion, we are very pleased with our upgrade. The Midlands acquisition continues to prove to be highly successful. The Supply segment continues to perform very well and managed to reach challenges and our domestic Regulated segments are progressing through the rate fees. We have solid financial plans in place that stress value through a variety of economic conditions and we are optimistic about the future prospects.
I look forward to your questions following Paul’s comments. With that I will turn it over to Paul."

PPL’s second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were higher than last year primarily driven by strong operating results from the UK including a full quarter of earnings from the Midlands businesses versus 2 months of results that were included in our second quarter last year. This positive drive was partially offset by lower earnings in the Supply segment as a result of flat energy margins and higher O&M compared to a year ago.
Let’s turn to the Kentucky Regulated segment earnings drivers on Slide 8. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.07 per share in second quarter, $0.01 increase over last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes resulting from newer [indiscernible] compared to the year ago.
Moving now to Slide 9, our UK Regulated segment, earned $0.31 per share in the second quarter a $0.10 increase over last year. This increase was due to the operating results of the Midlands utilities that included an additional month of operations as well as performance improvements.
Higher delivery revenue at WPD Southwest and South Wales is primarily driven by higher net prices and lower financing costs. These positive earnings drivers were partially offset by higher O&M, including higher pension expense, less favorable currency exchange rates and dilution of $0.01 per share.
Turning to our Pennsylvania Regulated segment on Slide 10, this segment earned $0.05 per share in the quarter, $0.01 decrease compared to last year. This decrease was primarily due to higher O&M as a result of higher payroll related expenses and higher legislation management costs.
Moving now to Slide 11, our Supply segment earned $0.03 per share in the second quarter a decrease of $0.04 compared to last year. This decrease was driven by the net result of lower West energy margins, primarily as a result of the termination of a 7-month [indiscernible] contract in connection with that company’s bankruptcy. Higher Eastern Energy margins driven by higher nuclear generation partially offset by lower baseload energy and capacity prices, higher O&M primarily at the Susquehanna nuclear station, higher depreciation and dilution of $0.01 per share.
With that, I will turn the call back to Bill for the Q&A period."

They will go through the process through the rest of this year with some final proposals that will be published in the November and December timeframe.
As you commented, the grid did come out with a service disappointment, and it asked for additional capital to be spent in their metrics, as well as they have requested the higher [indiscernible] initial proposals that came out of Ofgem what we see are they are really coming in line with what we are currently seeing for electricity distribution price control review that we are currently operating in.

I’m joined on the call this morning by Paul Farr, PPL’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for the Q&A session are the Presidents of all business segments; Vic Staffieri, President and CEO of LG&EKU, our Kentucky Regulated business; Rick Klingensmith, President of PPL Global, who has responsibility for U.K. regulated operations and our Energy Services businesses; Greg Dudkin, President of PPL Electric Utilities, our Pennsylvania Regulated segment; and Dave DeCampli, President of our competitive market Supply segment.
To get started today, I have an overview of our second quarter results and a few operational highlights, then Paul will provide more details on our segment performance in the quarter and following his remarks we will turn to your questions.
Today we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.46 per share up from $0.35 in the same quarter a year ago. Earnings from ongoing operations for the quarter were $0.51 per share compared with $0.45 per share in the same period last year.
For the first 6 months of the year, our reported earnings were $1.39 per share, up from $1.13 per share in the first 6 months of 2011. Ongoing earnings were $1.21 a share for the first half of the year versus $1.26 per share in the same period a year ago.
Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations include $0.02 per share dilution from the common stock issued and April 2011 financed acquisition of the Midlands utilizes in the U.K. For the first 6 months, dilution amounted to $0.13 per share. Strong results from our U.K. operations were a major drag from the improvement in both ongoing and reported earnings in the second quarter.
Strong earnings from the U.K. operations and the ability of our supply group to effectively manage unplanned outage challenges at our Susquehanna nuclear plant has put us solidly on course to achieve our 2012 earnings forecast. We are reaffirming our forecast of $2.15 to $2.45 per share in earnings from ongoing operations.
Before we go into a more detailed discussion of our financial results, I’ll provide a brief operational overview for the quarter. As I mentioned on previous calls, our management team in the U.K. has dramatically improved the customer performance of our Midlands utility.
I’m pleased to tell you that we recently -- that all 4 of our distribution companies have now been ordered the Customer Service Excellence Standard, the highest customer service honor in the U.K. This is the first time for our Midlands companies and the 20th year for our legacy South West and South Wales to receive the award. As we continue to see improved performance related to the number and duration of outages and regulatory metrics. This performance improvement is detailed to you in the appendix.
Turning to the domestic operations, PPL’s electric delivery operation in Pennsylvania once again has ranked highest among large electric utilities in the Eastern United States for residential customer satisfaction in a survey conducted by J.D. Power and Associates. The award is the company’s 18th overall since J.D. Power and Associates began studying customer satisfaction among electric utilities. Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric were part of the J.D. Power report on midsize utilities in the Midwest Region and also had strong customer satisfaction standards.
So also there is some good news in the Susquehanna nuclear plant, when inspections concluded with no indications of cracking were found on Unit 2’s turbine blades at the facility. We returned to units of service on June 15 after the inspection analysis of this plant by discovery of small cracks on some Unit 1 blades. Unit 1 in Susquehanna returned to service on June 7 after refueling outage and has concluded replacement of a small number of turbine blades that did not cracked. We’ve installed additional diagnostic equipments on both turbines to validate suspected causes that are early under review and we are conducting additional inspection next year on Unit 1.
The utilities in Kentucky have each requested rate increases to be effective in January 2013. Louisville Gas and Electric has requested a $62.1 million increase in electric rates and a $17.2 million increase in natural gas rates. Kentucky Utilities has requested an $82.4 million increase in electric rates. The requested ROE in each case is 11%. New rates are expected to take effect January 2013.
In Pennsylvania, consideration of PPL Electric Utilities rate increase request is continuing. An administrative law judge appointed by the State Public Utility Commission has helped public input hearings on the company’s $104 million increase request. Evidentiary hearings are being held this week and we expect an initial decision by December. Also on the operational front, it’s worth noting that PPL’s power plants and electric delivery systems at Pennsylvania and Kentucky have performed very well during the prolonged heat spells over the last couple of months.
Generally, our power plants were invariably an important part for generation and our transportation and distribution systems handled the stress by demand very well. We out gained some significant challenges in the second quarter across all 4 segments. Our Supply business continues to do a pretty good job in managing through challenging commodity markets. We continue to be optimistic that we’ll see some modest increase in wholesale energy prices by 2013.
Finally, I’d like to update you on a couple of initiatives, we continue to refine internally. As you are aware, we have talked about the need to raise equity over the next 12 years to fund the very robust capital plan at all of the regulated utilities. We are looking very closely at rates significantly reduced and potentially eliminate equity needs beyond normal debt issuances and share issued for management comp. We will escalate planning process now and this is a key focus. We will provide you with specific details at an appropriate time, but we believe this objective is very realistic based on our preliminary planning.
Additionally, the Supply segment continues to refine its plans on how to protect the release if power markets decline further. The directive is to develop plans to maintain positive earnings in the Supply segment should profits worsen compared to [indiscernible]. I want to be clear although that we do not believe this will happen, but performing this analysis is informative and should be in support [indiscernible]. I’m confident both of these initiatives, will address some of your concerns and we will certainly provide further detail as our plans are firmed up.
In conclusion, we are very pleased with our upgrade. The Midlands acquisition continues to prove to be highly successful. The Supply segment continues to perform very well and managed to reach challenges and our domestic Regulated segments are progressing through the rate fees. We have solid financial plans in place that stress value through a variety of economic conditions and we are optimistic about the future prospects.
I look forward to your questions following Paul’s comments. With that I will turn it over to Paul."

Let’s move to Slide 7 to review our second quarter financial results. PPL’s second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were higher than last year primarily driven by strong operating results from the U.K. including a full quarter of earnings from the Midlands businesses versus 2 months of results that were included in our second quarter last year. This positive drive was partially offset by lower earnings in the Supply segment as a result of flat energy margins and higher O&M compared to a year ago.
Let’s turn to the Kentucky Regulated segment earnings drivers on Slide 8. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.07 per share in second quarter, $0.01 increase over last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes resulting from newer [indiscernible] compared to the year ago.
Moving now to Slide 9, our U.K. Regulated segment, earned $0.31 per share in the second quarter a $0.10 increase over last year. This increase was due to the operating results of the Midlands utilities that included an additional month of operations as well as performance improvements.
Higher delivery revenue at WPD Southwest and South Wales is primarily driven by higher net prices and lower financing costs. These positive earnings drivers were partially offset by higher O&M, including higher pension expense, less favorable currency exchange rates and dilution of $0.01 per share.
Turning to our Pennsylvania Regulated segment on Slide 10, this segment earned $0.05 per share in the quarter, $0.01 decrease compared to last year. This decrease was primarily due to higher O&M as a result of higher payroll related expenses and higher legislation management costs.
Moving now to Slide 11, our Supply segment earned $0.03 per share in the second quarter a decrease of $0.04 compared to last year. This decrease was driven by the net result of lower West energy margins, primarily as a result of the termination of a 7-month [indiscernible] contract in connection with that company’s bankruptcy. Higher Eastern Energy margins driven by higher nuclear generation partially offset by lower baseload energy and capacity prices, higher O&M primarily at the Susquehanna nuclear station, higher depreciation and dilution of $0.01 per share.
With that, I will turn the call back to Bill for the Q&A period."

As we execute on the rate base growth plans, which are a little robust in the domestic utilities than they are in the U.K. business, these are further offset, and again as Bill mentioned earlier, we’re into rate cases with both domestic utilities perhaps to try to get those utilities back for utilities back towards more accessible levels of earned R&D.

Joining me on the call today are Paul Farr, PPL's Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer, as well as the President of our 4 business segments who will participate in the Q&A session today. To get started, I'll provide an overview of our third quarter results and a few operational highlights. Then Paul will provide more details on our segment performance for the quarter. We will try to keep call brief and focus primarily on the events of the quarter as I know your day is full of earnings calls and we'll see many of you next week at EEI. But before turning things off impact of hurricane Sandy. The hurricane caused considerable damage in parts of eastern Pennsylvania has served by our PPL Electric Utilities affiliate. This was the largest storm to hit PPL Electric Utilities serviced territory causing outages to over 500,000 customers. PPL Electric Utilities assembled the largest workforce in its history more than 5,000 people to undo Sandy's damage. By Sunday night, power have been restored to 99% of the afeected customers, the remaining work wrapped up on Tuesday. Some of our neighboring utilities closer to the coast fared significantly worse. They have sent contractor crews that have completed work for PPL Electric Utilities to New Jersey and in New York Utilities to assist in the rebuilding of their devastating communities. I know this was a very trying time for our customers and I'd really like to thank them for their understanding and their patients as we work diligently to restore their power. The PA Governor's Office and PUC showed strong leadership in working with the utility industry to ensure we had solid communications and very well coordinated assistance especially through PMAP and community emergency management organizations. I'd also like to recognize the hard work of PPL employees from Pennsylvania to Kentucky, as well as workers from other state utilities who assisted us in our restoration efforts. 
So now let's move onto earnings. Today, we announced third quarter reported earnings of $0.61 per share compared with $0.76 in the same quarter of 2011. Earnings from ongoing operations for the quarter was $0.72 per share versus $0.76 per share in the same period a year ago. For the first 3 months of the year, our reported earnings were $2 per share up from $1.91 per share in the first 9 months of 2011. Ongoing earnings were $1.93 per share for the first 3 quarters of the year versus $2.02 per share in the same period last year. Our results in the third quarter, and through the first 9 months of the year are strong evidence that we're delivering on the promises of our transformational acquisitions in 2010 and 2011. As expected, our rate-regulated businesses are providing financial stability as we continue to effectively manage through challenging wholesale market power crisis. I'm very pleased with both our financial and operational performance, given what the markets and mother nature have challenged us with. 
Now turning to Slide 5, strong earnings from the U.K. utilities and the ability of our supply group to manage outage challenges at ours our Susquehanna  nuclear plant have put us in a position to raise the midpoint of our 2012 earnings forecast. In fact, we're updating our 2012 forecast range to $2.30 to $2.40 and earnings from ongoing operation, making the midpoint of our guidance $2.35 per share. 
Before we move to Paul's comments let me take a few minutes for an operational all overview. Starting in Kentucky, now that we've signed contracts with various vendors we've updated our estimate of capital spending necessary to complete our previously discussed environmental compliance projects. We now estimate these projects will come in closer to $2.5 billion of reduction of $500 million from our original forecast. We're able to deliver these savings to customers in Kentucky because we proactively address EPA regulations and we're able to secure bids before others. These savings will contribute significantly to our objective of reducing equity needs over the next few years. Paul will provide more details on this effort in a few moments, including other CapEx reductions, higher dividend flows from the U.K. and O&M and savings. Despite the capital spending reductions we expect our rate base in Kentucky to grow at a compound annual rate of over 8% through 2016. In addition, it's likely we will need to deploy capital in the 2016 and 2017 timeframe to replace the bluegrass facility and potentially other coal-fired generation capacity. But we'll clearly have the internal cash flow to support such investments at that time. As for the rate case proceedings in Kentucky, we are moving along as planned. A settlement conference has been scheduled for November 13 and 14 with public hearing scheduled to take place later this month. We continue to anticipate an order from the commission in late December or early January with new rates effective shortly thereafter. I've mentioned on previous calls that our management team in the U.K. has dramatically improved customer service performance of our Midland utilities. This improved performance continues to translate into benefits for WPD customers, as well as PPL shareowners. I'm pleased to report that WPD is forecasting for the regulatory year ended March 31, 2012 to have earned over $80 million in performance bonuses for the 4 U.K. utilities, most of which comes from the Midlands businesses. This was due to our ability to deliver reliability customers at front-tier level performance. These bonuses will be reflected in our revenues in the 12-month period starting April 1, 2013. We can say with pride that our 4 network utilities are now among the best customers service providers in Great Britain. Turning to the domestic operations in Pennsylvania, in early October PPL Electric Utilities received final approval for the National Park Service to root the Susquehanna-Roseland Transmission Line through the park. This was the final permit required for this major grid upgrade that will improve electric service for millions of people in the Northeast saving consumers more than an estimated $200 million per year and creating about 2,000 jobs during its construction. The rate case in Pennsylvania is proceeding headed towards a final commission decision in December. We're of course disappointed by the ALJ's recommended decision that would produce an allowed return on equity of 9.74%. The ALJ recommendation would result in a $64 million increase in distribution revenues compared from the $104 million increase we had proposed when we filed our case. Today, we are filing detailed exceptions to this ALJ recommendation. We remain hopeful that the PUC's final decision will reflect a higher return on equity than this recommendation, especially in light of our need to continue replacing aging infrastructure and our strong customer service record. At our Supply segment, we resumed generating electricity from Unit 1 of the Susquehanna nuclear plant yesterday. We shut down the unit October 22 to inspect the Unit 1 turbine. The inspection confirmed data obtained from diagnostic equipment we installed earlier in this year to monitor for conditions that could lead to turbine blade crash. This is good news because it confirms the root cause analysis and enables us to move forward with a long-term solution. During the just completed outage on Unit 1, we replaced a small number of cracked blades. Based on similar data from the diagnostic equipment on the other Unit 2 turbine, we plan to shut that unit down for inspection and replace any cracked blades we discover. We're finalizing our plans with the vendor on a long-term solution that we believe will resolve the cracking issue and can be implemented starting in the first half of 2013. We're revising the estimated after-tax financial impact of these inspections to $25 million to $30 million as we've been able to complete them more rapidly than initially expected. 
On Slide 7, we provide updated detail on the competitive Supply segment hedges. We've adjusted our expected output levels for 2012 to reflect actual results through September 30 and our forecast for the remainder of this year. The decline in our expected Eastern baseload generation is primarily driven by the Susquehanna outage. For 2013, we've reduced our coal hedges in the East as we continue to manage our coal levels by working with coal suppliers to defer, renegotiate, or buyout existing coal contracts. We've also provided our 2014 hedged details for the first time as we've layered on additional power hedges and have hedged now approximately 1/2 of our 2014 baseload output. By the end of 2012 we would expect to be 60% to 90% hedged for 2014. 
In conclusion, we're very pleased with our results for the first 9 months and confident this business mix is producing the shareowner benefits we expected. The Midlands acquisition continues to prove to be highly successful. The Supply segment continues to perform well and manage through the current market and operational challenges and our domestic regulated segments are progressing through the rate proceedings and executing on the rate base growth opportunities. I'll look forward to your question following Paul's comments. Paul?"

Let's move the Slide 8 to review our third quarter financial results. PPL's third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were lower than last year, primarily driven by lower earnings at the Supply segment as a result of lower energy margins, higher O&M and higher depreciation, which were partially offset by higher earnings in the U.K. primarily driven by higher delivery revenue. We've outlined on Slide 9 the Kentucky regulated segment earning drivers. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the third quarter, a $0.01 decrease compared to last year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower retail margins as a result of lower residential consumption partially offset by higher industrial load compared to a year ago. Moving now to Slide 10, our U.K. regulated segment earned $0.28 per share in the third quarter, a $0.06 increase over last year. This increase was due to higher earnings at WPD Midlands and higher delivery revenue at WPD Southwest and South Wales primarily driven by higher prices. These positive earnings drivers were partially offset by higher pension expense at the 2 legacy companies and less favorable currency exchange rates. Turning to our Pennsylvania regulated segment on Slide 11, this segment earned $0.06 per share in the quarter, a $0.01 increase compared to last year. This increase was primarily due to higher transmission and distribution margins and lower financing costs, partially offset by higher O&M. Moving to Slide 12, our Supply segment earned $0.26 per share in the third quarter, a decrease of $0.10 compared to last year. This decrease was driven by lower Eastern energy margins, primarily due to lower hedged energy prices, lower Western energy margins primarily due to lower volumes, higher O&M, higher depreciation and higher financing costs. Turning to Slide 13, we have updated our CapEx plans to reflect the changes for the lower projected ECR capital spending in Kentucky. As Bill discussed, this represents a $500 million reduction for 2012 through 2016 from our original plan. We are still finalizing our business planning process but I have identified an additional $200 million to $300 million of supply CapEx that can be eliminated over the next several years that have not currently reflected in this chart. These capital reductions will provide additional financial flexibility while we continue to manage through a low commodity price environment. Turning to Slide 14, we have updated our rate base growth projections with the only change being the reduced easy our spending in Kentucky. We now project more than $7.5 billion in increase in rate base from 2012 to 2016 resulting in the 7.5% compound annual growth rate. We realize the reduced capital spending in Kentucky has an impact in future EPS but this is significantly offset by the elimination of the equity needed to fund those investments. Obviously, the almost $700 million to $800 million of reduced CapEx in supply in Kentucky is a major driver to eliminating equity needs beyond our group issuance. We also expect to repatriate an additional $30 million to $30 million per year above our previous expectations from the U.K. driven by our forecasted strong annual revenue bonuses and performance ahead of plan on cost synergies. We continue to evaluate our level of spending and have made progress on that front, but Fukushima-related cost and the need for additional outages at Susquehanna over the next few years to implement the permanent fix for the blade cracking issue are expected to absorb that benefit in the near term. Beyond this time, we do see opportunity to reduce supply O&M. 
Given the significant attention dividends have received during this earnings season, let me end with our commitment to the dividend, which we view as an extremely important piece of our total share of return. The current dividend level represents a 61% payout ratio based on the midpoint of our revised 2012 earnings forecast and is much more than covered by our rate-regulated earnings. As we have been indicating, we expect modest increases to the dividend through lower part of the commodity cycle and as we deploy significant capital on our rate-regulated rate businesses. This intention is reflected in the dividend increase that we announced earlier this year. Our dividend is secure and we clearly see adequate flexibility for future growth as we execute and our rate-regulated growth strategy. With that by way of review, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A period."

As for your first part of the question on the cost to replace the blades and the ultimate fix, on the replacement side, the cost for the O&M associated with the outage, as well as the replacement cost, those have been already factored into the numbers that we have provided today, the $25 million to $30 million after-tax.

So all that as Dave mentioned, I think in the $50 million to $60 million kind of range. The bigger unknown is around the filtered vents, which as I commented earlier, we don't have a good estimate yet because we're not exactly sure what the NRC maybe looking for. When it comes to the turbine blades, the majority of our expense to due to permanent fix will probably come next year. Now we'll come with some unscheduled outages, so we're going to have on the units, it's not in the refueling, we'll have a special outage to put in the permanent fix. And then the scheduled outage may hopefully wouldn't take much longer but it could be a little bit longer so O&M for 2013 will be a bit higher now as I mentioned on the last call, we have a number of initiatives underway to trim our O&M and capital expenses practically in the Supply segment and there, we would expect some of the O&M savings for 2013 would be offset by the increase outage that we have to take next year.

And thanks for dialing in. Joining me on the call today are Paul Farr, PPL's Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer, as well as the presidents of our 4 business segments, who will participate in the Q&A session today. To get started, I'll provide an overview of our third quarter results and a few operational highlights. Then Paul will provide more details on our segment performance for the quarter. We will try to keep this call brief and focus primarily on the events of the quarter as I know your day is full of earnings calls, and we'll see many of you next week at EEI. 
But before turning to earnings, I'll update you on the impact of Hurricane Sandy. The hurricane caused considerable damage in parts of Eastern Pennsylvania served by our PPL Electric Utilities affiliate. This was the largest storm to hit PPL Electric Utilities-serviced territory, causing outages to over 500,000 customers. PPL Electric Utilities assembled the largest workforce in its history, more than 5,000 people, to undo Sandy's damage. By Sunday night, power had been restored to 99% of the affected customers, the remaining work wrapped up on Tuesday. Some of our neighboring utilities closer to the coast fared significantly worse. They have sent contractor crews that have completed work for PPL Electric Utilities to New Jersey and New York utilities to assist in the rebuilding of their devastated communities. 
I know this was a very trying time for our customers, and I'd really like to thank them for their understanding and patience as we work diligently to restore their power. The PA Governor's Office and PUC showed strong leadership in working with the utility industry to ensure we had solid communications and very well coordinated assistance, especially through FEMA and community emergency management organizations. I'd also like to recognize the hard work of PPL employees from Pennsylvania to Kentucky, as well as workers from out-of-state utilities, who assisted us in our restoration efforts. 
So now let's move onto earnings. Today, we announced third quarter reported earnings of $0.61 per share compared with $0.76 in the same quarter of 2011. Earnings from ongoing operations for the quarter were $0.72 per share versus $0.76 per share in the same period a year ago. For the first 3 months of the year, our reported earnings were $2 per share, up from $1.91 per share in the first 9 months of 2011. Ongoing earnings were $1.93 per share for the first 3 quarters of the year versus $2.02 per share in the same period last year. 
Our results in the third quarter and through the first 9 months of the year are strong evidence that we are delivering on the promises of our transformational acquisitions in 2010 and 2011. As expected, our rate-regulated businesses are providing financial stability as we continue to effectively manage through challenging wholesale market power crisis. I'm very pleased with both our financial and operational performance, given what the markets and Mother Nature have challenged us with. 
Now turning to Slide 5. Strong earnings from the U.K. utilities and the ability of our supply group to manage outage challenges at our Susquehanna  nuclear plant have put us in a position to raise the midpoint of our 2012 earnings forecast. In fact, we're updating our 2012 forecast range to $2.30 to $2.40 per share and earnings from ongoing operations, making the midpoint of our guidance $2.35 per share. 
Before we move to Paul's comments, let me take a few minutes for an operational overview. Starting in Kentucky. Now that we've signed contracts with various vendors we've updated our estimate of capital spending necessary to complete our previously discussed environmental compliance projects. We now estimate these projects will come in closer to $2.5 billion, a reduction of $500 million from our original forecast. We're able to deliver these savings to customers in Kentucky because we proactively addressed EPA regulations and were able to secure bids before others. These savings will contribute significantly to our objective of reducing equity needs over the next few years. Paul will provide more details on this effort in a few moments, including other CapEx reductions, higher dividend flows from the U.K. and O&M savings. 
Despite the capital spending reductions, we expect our rate base in Kentucky to grow at a compound annual rate of over 8% through 2016. In addition, it's likely we will need to deploy capital in the 2016 and 2017 timeframe to replace the Bluegrass facility and potentially other coal-fired generation capacity. But we'll clearly have the internal cash flow to support such investments at that time. 
As for the rate case proceedings in Kentucky, we are moving along as planned. A settlement conference has been scheduled for November 13 and 14 with public hearing scheduled to take place later this month. We continue to anticipate an order from the commission in late December or early January with new rates effective shortly thereafter. 
I've mentioned on previous calls that our management team in the U.K. has dramatically improved the customer service performance of our Midlands utilities. This improved performance continues to translate into benefits for WPD customers, as well as PPL shareowners. I'm pleased to report that WPD is forecasting for the regulatory year ended March 31, 2012, to have earned over $80 million in performance bonuses for the 4 U.K. utilities, most of which comes from the Midlands businesses. This was due to our ability to deliver reliability to customers at front tier-level performance. These bonuses will be reflected in our revenues in the 12-month period starting April 1, 2013. We can say with pride that our 4 network utilities are now among the best customer service providers in Great Britain. 
Turning to the domestic operations in Pennsylvania. In early October, PPL Electric Utilities received final approval from the National Park Service to route the Susquehanna-Roseland Transmission Line through the park. This was the final permit required for this major grid upgrade that will improve electric service for millions of people in the Northeast, saving consumers more than an estimated $200 million per year and creating about 2,000 jobs during its construction. The rate case in Pennsylvania is proceeding, headed towards a final commission decision in December. We're, of course, disappointed by the ALJ's recommended decision that would produce an allowed return on equity of 9.74%. The ALJ recommendation would result in a $64 million increase in distribution revenues compared with the $104 million increase we had proposed when we filed our case. Today, we are filing detailed exceptions to this ALJ recommendation. We remain hopeful that the PUC's final decision will reflect a higher return on equity than this recommendation, especially in light of our need to continue replacing aging infrastructure and our strong customer service record. 
At our supply segment, we resumed generating electricity from Unit 1 of the Susquehanna nuclear plant yesterday. We shut down the unit October 20 to inspect the Unit 1 turbine. The inspection confirmed data obtained from diagnostic equipment we installed earlier in this year to monitor for conditions that could lead to turbine blade crash. This is good news because it confirms the root cause analysis and enables us to move forward with a long-term solution. During the just-completed outage on Unit 1, we replaced a small number of cracked blades. Based on similar data from the diagnostic equipment on the Unit 2 turbine, we plan to shut that unit down for inspection and replace any cracked blades we discover. We're finalizing our plans with a vendor on a long-term solution that we believe will resolve the cracking issue and can be implemented starting in the first half of 2013. We're revising the estimated after-tax financial impact of these inspections to $25 million to $30 million as we've been able to complete them more rapidly than initially expected. 
On Slide 7, we provide updated detail on the competitive supply segment hedges. We've adjusted our expected output levels for 2012 to reflect the actual results through September 30 and our forecast for the remainder of this year. The decline in our expected Eastern baseload generation is primarily driven by the Susquehanna outage. For 2013, we've reduced our coal hedges in the East as we continue to manage our coal levels by working with coal suppliers to defer, renegotiate or buy out existing coal contracts. We've also provided our 2014 hedge details for the first time as we've layered on additional power hedges and have hedged now approximately 1/2 of our 2014 baseload output. By the end of 2012, we would expect to be 60% to 90% hedged for 2014. 
In conclusion, we're very pleased with our results through the first 9 months and confident this business mix is producing the shareowner benefits we expected. The Midlands acquisition continues to prove to be highly successful. The supply segment continues to perform well and manage through the current market and operational challenges. And our domestic regulated segments are progressing through the rate proceedings and executing on the rate base growth opportunities. I'll look forward to your question following Paul's comments. Paul?"

Let's move the Slide 8 to review our third quarter financial results. PPL's third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were lower than last year, primarily driven by lower earnings at the supply segment as a r",747,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move the Slide 8 to review our third quarter financial results. PPL's third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were lower than last year, primarily driven by lower earnings at the supply segment as a result of lower energy margins, higher O&M and higher depreciation, which were partially offset by higher earnings in the U.K., primarily driven by higher delivery revenue. 
We've outlined on Slide 9 the Kentucky regulated segment earnings drivers. Our Kentucky regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the third quarter, a $0.01 decrease compared to last year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower retail margins as a result of lower residential consumption, partially offset by higher industrial load compared to a year ago. 
Moving now to Slide 10. Our U.K. regulated segment earned $0.28 per share in the third quarter, a $0.06 increase over last year. This increase was due to higher earnings at WPD Midlands and higher delivery revenue at WPD South West and South Wales, primarily driven by higher prices. These positive earnings drivers were partially offset by higher pension expense at the 2 legacy companies and less favorable currency exchange rates. 
Turning to our Pennsylvania regulated segment on Slide 11. This segment earned $0.06 per share in the quarter, a $0.01 increase compared to last year. This increase was primarily due to higher transmission and distribution margins and lower financing costs, partially offset by higher O&M. 
Moving to Slide 12. Our supply segment earned $0.26 per share in the third quarter, a decrease of $0.10 compared to last year. This decrease was driven by lower Eastern energy margins, primarily due to lower hedged energy prices; lower Western energy margins, primarily due to lower volumes; higher O&M; higher depreciation; and higher financing costs. 
Turning to Slide 13. We have updated our CapEx plan to reflect the changes for the lower projected ECR capital spending in Kentucky. As Bill discussed, this represents a $500 million reduction for 2012 to 2016 from our original plan. We are still finalizing our business planning process but have identified an additional $200 million to $300 million of supply CapEx that can be eliminated over the next several years that is not currently reflected in this chart. These capital reductions will provide additional financial flexibility while we continue to manage through a low commodity price environment. 
Turning to Slide 14. We have updated our rate base growth projections with the only change being the reduced ECR spending in Kentucky. We now project to more than $7.5 billion in increase in rate base from 2012 to 2016 resulting in a 7.5% compound annual growth rate. We realized the reduced capital spending in Kentucky has an impact on future EPS, but this is significantly offset by the elimination of the equity needed to fund those investments. Obviously, the almost $700 million to $800 million in reduced CapEx in supply and Kentucky is a major driver to eliminating equity needs beyond our DRIP issuance. We also expect to repatriate an additional $30 million to $50 million per year above our previous expectations from the U.K. driven by our forecast of strong annual revenue bonuses and performance ahead of plan on cost synergies. We continue to evaluate our level of O&M spending and have made progress on that front. But Fukushima-related costs and the need for additional outages at Susquehanna over the next few years to implement the permanent fix for the blade cracking issue are expected to absorb that benefit in the near term. Beyond this timeframe, we do see opportunity to reduce supply O&M. 
Given the significant attention dividends have received during this earnings season, let me end with our commitment to the dividend, which we view as an extremely important piece of our total shareowner return. The current dividend level represents a 61% payout ratio based on the midpoint of our revised 2012 earnings forecast and is much more than covered by our rate-regulated earnings. As we have been indicating, we expect modest increases to the dividend through the low parts of the commodity cycle and as we deploy significant capital on our rate-regulated utility businesses. This intention is reflected in the dividend increase that we announced earlier this year. Our dividend is secure and we clearly see added flexibility for future growth as we execute on our rate-regulated growth strategy. 
With that by way of review, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A period."

And that would be a little bit more costly. But again, I don't think in the overall context of PPL that those costs of capital would be unmanageable. As for your first part of your question on the costs to replace the blades and the ultimate fix, on the replacement side, the costs for the O&M associated with the outage, as well as the replacement cost, those have been already factored into the numbers that we have provided today, that $25 million to $35 million after-tax. In terms of the fix, we're still determining exactly what those costs would be. But again, I don't think that they're going to be unmanageable for us."

Well, on the cost for Fukushima-related, as we mentioned, the first part of it is pretty well-known. And that's making changes to everything but the filtered vents, the items that the NRC and the industry is on the same page with, which will allow us to respond a bit better in an unlikely event of a challenge to off-site power in particular, as well as maintaining appropriate levels and understanding where the water levels are and the spent fuel pools, as well as the temperature. So those instrumentation changes are relatively small and low capital cost items. So all of that, as Dave mentioned, I think in the $50 million to $60 million kind of range. The bigger unknown is around the filtered vents, which as I commented earlier, we don't have a good estimate yet because we're not exactly sure what the NRC maybe looking for. When it comes to the turbine blades, the majority of our expense to do the permanent fix will probably come next year. Now we'll come with some unscheduled outages, so we're going to have on the units, it's not in the refueling, we'll have a special outage to put in the permanent fix. And then the scheduled outage may -- hopefully wouldn't take much longer, but it could be a little bit longer. So O&M for 2013 will be a bit higher now. As I mentioned on the last call, we have a number of initiatives underway to trim our O&M and capital expenses, particularly in the supply segment. And there, we would expect some of the O&M savings for 2013 would be offset by the increased outage that we have to take next year. So that's kind of a rundown of where we see the supply business from an O&M and capital perspective."

Of course, in the U.K., it's all returned off and on immediately as we spend it.

Joining me on the call today are Paul Farr, PPL's Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer, as well as the presidents of our 4 business segments, who will participate in the Q&A session today. To get started, I'll provide an overview of our third quarter results and a few operational highlights. Then Paul will provide more details on our segment performance for the quarter. We will try to keep this call brief and focus primarily on the events of the quarter, as I know your day is full of earnings calls and we'll see many of you next week at EEI. 
But before turning to earnings, I'll update you on the impact of Hurricane Sandy. The hurricane caused considerable damage in parts of Eastern Pennsylvania served by our PPL Electric Utilities affiliate. This was the largest storm to hit PPL Electric Utilities-serviced territory, causing outages to over 500,000 customers. PPL Electric Utilities assembled the largest workforce in its history, more than 5,000 people, to undo Sandy's damage. By Sunday night, power had been restored to 99% of the affected customers, the remaining work wrapped up on Tuesday. Some of our neighboring utilities closer to the coast fared significantly worse. We have sent contractor crews that have completed work for PPL Electric Utilities to New Jersey and New York utilities to assist in the rebuilding of their devastated communities. 
I know this was a very trying time for our customers, and I'd really like to thank them for their understanding and patience as we work diligently to restore their power. The PA Governor's Office and PUC showed strong leadership in working with the utility industry to ensure we had solid communications and very well coordinated assistance, especially through FEMA and community emergency management organizations. I'd also like to recognize the hard work of PPL employees from Pennsylvania to Kentucky, as well as workers from out-of-state utilities, who assisted us in our restoration efforts. 
So now let's move onto earnings. Today, we announced third quarter reported earnings of $0.61 per share compared with $0.76 in the same quarter of 2011. Earnings from ongoing operations for the quarter were $0.72 per share versus $0.76 per share in the same period a year ago. For the first 3 months of the year, our reported earnings were $2 per share, up from $1.91 per share in the first 9 months of 2011. Ongoing earnings were $1.93 per share for the first 3 quarters of the year versus $2.02 per share in the same period last year. 
Our results in the third quarter and through the first 9 months of the year are strong evidence that we are delivering on the promises of our transformational acquisitions in 2010 and 2011. As expected, our rate-regulated businesses are providing financial stability as we continue to effectively manage through challenging wholesale market power crisis. I'm very pleased with both our financial and operational performance, given what the markets and Mother Nature have challenged us with. 
Now turning to Slide 5. Strong earnings from the U.K. utilities and the ability of our supply group to manage outage challenges at our Susquehanna  nuclear plant have put us in a position to raise the midpoint of our 2012 earnings forecast. In fact, we're updating our 2012 forecast range to $2.30 to $2.40 per share and earnings from ongoing operations, making the midpoint of our guidance $2.35 per share. 
Before we move to Paul's comments, let me take a few minutes for an operational overview. Starting in Kentucky. Now that we've signed contracts with various vendors, we've updated our estimate of capital spending necessary to complete our previously discussed environmental compliance projects. We now estimate these projects will come in closer to $2.5 billion, a reduction of $500 million from our original forecast. We're able to deliver these savings to customers in Kentucky because we proactively addressed EPA regulations and were able to secure bids before others. These savings will contribute significantly to our objective of reducing equity needs over the next few years. Paul will provide more details on this effort in a few moments, including other CapEx reductions, higher dividend flows from the U.K. and O&M savings. 
Despite the capital spending reductions, we expect our rate base in Kentucky to grow at a compound annual rate of over 8% through 2016. In addition, it's likely we will need to deploy capital in the 2016 and 2017 time frame to replace the Bluegrass facility and potentially other coal-fired generation capacity. But we'll clearly have the internal cash flow to support such investments at that time. 
As for the rate case proceedings in Kentucky, we are moving along as planned. A settlement conference has been scheduled for November 13 and 14 with public hearing scheduled to take place later this month. We continue to anticipate an order from the commission in late December or early January with new rates effective shortly thereafter. 
I've mentioned on previous calls that our management team in the U.K. has dramatically improved the customer service performance of our Midlands utilities. This improved performance continues to translate into benefits for WPD customers, as well as PPL shareowners. I'm pleased to report that WPD is forecasting for the regulatory year ended March 31, 2012 to have earned over $80 million in performance bonuses for the 4 U.K. utilities, most of which comes from the Midlands businesses. This was due to our ability to deliver reliability to customers at front tier-level performance. These bonuses will be reflected in our revenues in the 12-month period starting April 1, 2013. We can say with pride that our 4 network utilities are now among the best customer service providers in Great Britain. 
Turning to the domestic operations in Pennsylvania. In early October, PPL Electric Utilities received final approval from the National Park Service to route the Susquehanna-Roseland Transmission Line through the park. This was the final permit required for this major grid upgrade that will improve electric service for millions of people in the Northeast, saving consumers more than an estimated $200 million per year and creating about 2,000 jobs during its construction. The rate case in Pennsylvania is proceeding, headed towards a final commission decision in December. We're of course disappointed by the ALJ's recommended decision that would produce an allowed return on equity of 9.74%. The ALJ recommendation would result in a $64 million increase in distribution revenues compared with the $104 million increase we had proposed when we filed our case. Today, we are filing detailed exceptions to this ALJ recommendation. We remain hopeful that the PUC's final decision will reflect a higher return on equity than this recommendation, especially in light of our need to continue replacing aging infrastructure and our strong customer service record. 
At our supply segment, we resumed generating electricity from Unit 1 of the Susquehanna nuclear plant yesterday. We shut down the unit October 20 to inspect the Unit 1 turbine. The inspection confirmed data obtained from diagnostic equipment we installed earlier in this year to monitor for conditions that could lead to turbine blade crash. This is good news because it confirms the root cause analysis and enables us to move forward with a long-term solution. During the just-completed outage on Unit 1, we replaced a small number of cracked blades. Based on similar data from the diagnostic equipment on the Unit 2 turbine, we plan to shut that unit down for inspection and replace any cracked blades we discover. We're finalizing our plans with a vendor on a long-term solution that we believe will resolve the cracking issue and can be implemented starting in the first half of 2013. We're revising the estimated after-tax financial impact of these inspections to $25 million to $30 million, as we've been able to complete them more rapidly than initially expected. 
On Slide 7, we provide updated detail on the competitive supply segment hedges. We've adjusted our expected output levels for 2012 to reflect the actual results through September 30 and our forecast for the remainder of this year. The decline in our expected Eastern baseload generation is primarily driven by the Susquehanna outage. For 2013, we've reduced our coal hedges in the East as we continue to manage our coal levels by working with coal suppliers to defer, renegotiate or buy out existing coal contracts. We've also provided our 2014 hedge details for the first time as we've layered on additional power hedges and have hedged now approximately 1/2 of our 2014 baseload output. By the end of 2012, we would expect to be 60% to 90% hedged for 2014. 
In conclusion, we're very pleased with our results through the first 9 months and confident this business mix is producing the shareowner benefits we expected. The Midlands acquisition continues to prove to be highly successful. The supply segment continues to perform well and manage through the current market and operational challenges. And our domestic regulated segments are progressing through the rate proceedings and executing on the rate base growth opportunities. I'll look forward to your question following Paul's comments.

We've outlined on Slide 9 the Kentucky regulated segment earnings drivers. Our Kentucky regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the third quarter, a $0.01 decrease compared to last year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower retail margins as a result of lower residential consumption, partially offset by higher industrial load compared to a year ago. 
Moving now to Slide 10. Our U.K. regulated segment earned $0.28 per share in the third quarter, a $0.06 increase over last year. This increase was due to higher earnings at WPD Midlands and higher delivery revenue at WPD South West and South Wales, primarily driven by higher prices. These positive earnings drivers were partially offset by higher pension expense at the 2 legacy companies and less favorable currency exchange rates. 
Turning to our Pennsylvania regulated segment on Slide 11. This segment earned $0.06 per share in the quarter, a $0.01 increase compared to last year. This increase was primarily due to higher transmission and distribution margins and lower financing costs, partially offset by higher O&M. 
Moving to Slide 12. Our supply segment earned $0.26 per share in the third quarter, a decrease of $0.10 compared to last year. This decrease was driven by lower Eastern energy margins, primarily due to lower hedged energy prices; lower Western energy margins, primarily due to lower volumes; higher O&M; higher depreciation; and higher financing costs. 
Turning to Slide 13. We have updated our CapEx plan to reflect the changes for the lower projected ECR capital spending in Kentucky. As Bill discussed, this represents a $500 million reduction for 2012 to 2016 from our original plan. We are still finalizing our business planning process, but have identified an additional $200 million to $300 million of supply CapEx that can be eliminated over the next several years that is not currently reflected in this chart. These capital reductions will provide additional financial flexibility while we continue to manage through a low commodity price environment. 
Turning to Slide 14. We have updated our rate base growth projections with the only change being the reduced ECR spending in Kentucky. We now project to more than $7.5 billion in increase in rate base from 2012 to 2016 resulting in a 7.5% compound annual growth rate. We realized the reduced capital spending in Kentucky has an impact on future EPS, but this is significantly offset by the elimination of the equity needed to fund those investments. Obviously, the almost $700 million to $800 million in reduced CapEx in supply and Kentucky is a major driver to eliminating equity needs beyond our DRIP issuance. We also expect to repatriate an additional $30 million to $50 million per year above our previous expectations from the U.K. driven by our forecast of strong annual revenue bonuses and performance ahead of plan on cost synergies. We continue to evaluate our level of O&M spending and have made progress on that front. But Fukushima-related costs and the need for additional outages at Susquehanna over the next few years to implement the permanent fix for the blade cracking issue are expected to absorb that benefit in the near term. Beyond this time frame, we do see opportunity to reduce supply O&M. 
Given the significant attention dividends have received during this earnings season, let me end with our commitment to the dividend, which we view as an extremely important piece of our total shareowner return. The current dividend level represents a 61% payout ratio based on the midpoint of our revised 2012 earnings forecast and is much more than covered by our rate-regulated earnings. As we have been indicating, we expect modest increases to the dividend through the low parts of the commodity cycle and as we deploy significant capital on our rate-regulated utility businesses. This intention is reflected in the dividend increase that we announced earlier this year. Our dividend is secure and we clearly see added flexibility for future growth as we execute on our rate-regulated growth strategy. 
With that by way of review, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A period."

Related to cost for Fukushima, we're still in the process of determining that. But as we've mentioned on previous calls, we think the capital costs will be very manageable and the real question or open question at the moment is whether the industry would be required to install filtered nets on the units, and that would be a little bit more costly. But again, I don't think in the overall context of PPL that those costs of capital would be unmanageable. As for your first part of your question on the costs to replace the blades and the ultimate fix, on the replacement side, the costs for the O&M associated with the outage, as well as the replacement costs, those have been already factored into the numbers that we have provided today, that $25 million to $35 million after-tax. In terms of the fix, we're still determining exactly what those costs would be. But again, I don't think that they're going to be unmanageable for us."

Well, on the cost for Fukushima-related, as we mentioned, the first part of it is pretty well known. And that's making changes to everything but the filtered vents, the items that the NRC and the industry is on the same page with, which will allow us to respond a bit better in an unlikely event of a challenge to off-site power in particular, as well as maintaining proper levels and understanding where the water levels are and the spent fuel pools, as well as the temperature. So those instrumentation changes are relatively small and low capital cost items. So all of that, as Dave mentioned, I think in the $50 million to $60 million kind of range. The bigger unknown is around the filtered vents, which as I commented earlier, we don't have a good estimate yet because we're not exactly sure what the NRC maybe looking for. When it comes to the turbine blades, the majority of our expense to do the permanent fix will probably come next year. That will come with some unscheduled outages, so we're going to have on the units, it's not in the refueling, we'll have a special outage to put in the permanent fix. And then the scheduled outage may -- hopefully wouldn't take much longer, but it could be a little bit longer. So O&M for 2013 will be a bit higher now. As I mentioned on the last call, we have a number of initiatives underway to trim our O&M and capital expenses, particularly in the supply segment. And there, we would expect some of the O&M savings for 2013 would be offset by the increased outage that we have to take next year.

But I think as we've said in the past, with the type of the spending we need to do on a traditional general rate case basis that we'd be probably looking at needing to file every few years. Now I would probably just remind you that a lot of the spending that we are planning to do has real-time or near-real-time recovery, particularly in Kentucky with the environmental spend. Of course in the U.K., it's all returned off and on immediately as we spend it. And then in Pennsylvania, we have a new law that was passed early this year that will allow us to file for some of the capital, about 1/3 or more of the capital, that had we planned to spend under a new ratemaking mechanism, which will allow more timely recovery. So I think overall, we feel good about our ability to keep the returns close to the authorized level because of the ratemaking constructive arrangements that we have in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky."
