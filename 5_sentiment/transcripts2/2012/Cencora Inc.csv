We gener",1391,"Thank you, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen delivered solid results in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2012.
Our revenues were up 2% to $20.4 billion. Earnings per share were up 9% to $0.62. We generated $432 million in operating cash flow and we repurchased $128 million of our shares. Our financial results were in line with our expectations and position us well to meet our objectives for the remainder of the year.
Our excellent cash generation and strong balance sheet provide us with outstanding financial flexibility and give us the ability to fund our strategic initiatives and grow our business.
AmerisourceBergen is fortunate to be an important part of a growing industry. As I discussed at our Investor Day in December, demographics in the expansion of health care coverage should you driver our growth in our industry over the next several years. In addition, launches of new pharmaceuticals as well as new indications for existing drugs should also drive sales growth. The tremendous wave of over 30 brand to generic drug conversions that we expect in our fiscal 2012 as well as additional conversions expected in subsequent years will mitigate the top line dollar growth in our industry. And it will drive tremendous value for wholesalers, healthcare providers and patients alike.
These trends bode well for AmerisourceBergen in particular. Our diverse revenue base positions us well to benefit from organic growth driven by demographics as well as from the influx of the uninsured over the next few years. Our customer mix also puts us in a favorable position to benefit from the historic influx of generics. In addition, cost-containment efforts underway by the federal government and other payers drive demand for our services most notably in our Consulting Services group.
Today, we are more entrenched than ever before with our manufactured customers and we expect that to continue to increase. As our provided customers face reimbursement and other challenges, they increasingly turn to AmerisourceBergen for help in making their healthcare practices run as efficiently as possible without sacrificing excellent patient care.
Over the last several months, a few large contracts in our industry have been the subject of much dialogue for various different reasons. Over all, however, the market continues to be competitive but stable. We continue to participate in discussions that are important to our business, our industry and our customers in Washington, D.C., educating lawmakers about our business and the value we and our customers provide in the healthcare system.
I discussed our core tenants several times over the year but they continue to drive our efforts and that's very repeating. Firstly, to corroborate to drive innovation for all stakeholders, increasing customer and supplier value, expanding our business in targeted markets, maximizing operating efficiency and maintain a high-performance culture. Our associates creatively tackle challenges and identify new opportunities to add value on a daily basis. They will focus in meeting objectives for the year both in terms of the service we provide to customers and supplies and in our financial performance and I'm honored to work with all of them.
Turning now to our business units. AmerisourceBergen Corporation had solid revenue growth in the quarter up 2%. We had positive revenue growth in both retail and institutional segments, even with the previously discussed large retail -- retail customer in September of 2011. Our ultimate segment was particularly strong in the quarter and hospitals and independents had very solid growth. We now have over 4,600 members in our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network which makes it the third largest network of pharmacies in the U.S. that is a powerful endorsement of the independent retail pharmacy play in the complex healthcare landscape today.
Patients preferred choice when determining where to fill their prescriptions and our retail customers are very adept at fulfilling unique patient needs. Our SAP implementation continues to run smoothly with 3 distributions and our conversion is complete and the remainder plans for the beginning of 2013. Our investments in our Canadian operations to support significant new business wins are also well underway. We are very pleased to be the leading distributor independent pharmacy in the Canadian market as well as the leader in Specialty Distribution and services.
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group had another strong quarter, with revenues up 4% with particularly strong performance in third-party logistics and good performance at Oncology Supply. The integration of IntrinsiQ has gone very well, and our customers have responded favorably to the tools at office. While our Specialty Group is based for oncology franchise we are an instrumental part of the commercialization strategy for any infeasible product launched in the position marketplace.
In addition, our Specialty Group often collaborates our Consulting Services group to help ensure patients have access to products by utilizing the full capabilities of our physician networks, as well as our reimbursement and patient support program expertise. For example, during the quarter, we executed very well on the launch of a new branded ophthalmology product, establishing significant market share in just the first few months of introduction. This is a great example not only of excellent cross-company collaboration, but also the strength and tremendous value of our diverse offerings.
AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services delivered a strong quarter while making excellent progress in the integration of TheraCom and Premier Source. Our Consulting and Packaging business book performed well in the quarter. And while the group only represents about 1% of our revenues, we believe our Packaging and Consulting associates are providing essential expertise to pharmaceutical manufacturers to help ensure that their products are brought to market as safely, quickly and efficiently as possible.
In addition, our reimbursement expertise helps ensure that patients who can benefit from both new and mature therapies have access to the products. 
Given the continued strength of our balance sheet, we continue to look for acquisitions that meet the criteria we had in place for quite some time. Patient increase our value offering to existing customers both up and down the channel. They should be within our established core competency and they should increase shareholder value. While we have not contemplated any further contribution from acquisitions in our guidance, we continue to be receptive to acquisitions and we continue to be interested in opportunities in pharmaceutical and Specialty Distribution services, as well as Consulting and Packaging services. While we historically have been very comfortable in that $200 million to $300 million range, we will consider selling larger if we make good strategic sense and we deliver value to our company and our shareholders.
Looking ahead, the results we've had in our first quarter have positioned us well to meet our objectives for the full fiscal year. We have a difficult comparison to overcome in 2012, but we continue to expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.74 to $2.84, an increase of 8% to 12% over fiscal 2011.
Looking further ahead to 2013, we should have a carryover from some of the launches that occur late in our fiscal 2012 including the relaunch of and we should begin to benefit from the completion of our SAP implementation.
In fiscal 2014, we should begin to see the $30 million to $40 million uninsured patient in the healthcare market driving demand for pharmaceutical that should carry over into 2015 and beyond. In addition, 2014 and 2015 are expected to be good years with generic conversions, and of course, there's a chance that biosimilars may also come to market in that timeframe.
Before I turn it over to Mike for a detailed look at the financials, I want to reiterate the confidence that I have in our business and our future because demand is strong for the products we distribute and the services we provide. We were pleased to be recently be ranked 24th on Bloomberg BusinessWeek's list of the top 50 performing companies in the U.S. in recognition of our historic financial performance and our future growth opportunities.
As I stated earlier, we have essential role in the pharmaceutical supply channel. We positioned ourselves well to benefit from generics and specialty products and we have continued to invest in our existing businesses and opportunities we see in our future.
Finally, our exceptional associates at ABC support in our industry and I'm proud to be their leader. Here is Mike."

I'm very pleased to report first quarter fiscal 2012 results on track with our internal plans, highlighted by good performance on new generic launches, strong expense discipline, significant progress towards integrating thorough comp and to our consulting group and exceptional cash generation, all of which gives us confidence in reaffirming our annual EPS guidance.
As we go through our quarterly results, keep in mind that last year's first quarter included a $12 million or $0.03 benefit reflected in gross profit from the Duane Reade contract termination last December.
So let's turn to the quarter and starting with the top line revenues were $20.4 billion, a 2.4% increase over last year's quarter. Drug company revenue was up 2% as strong growth in the alternate site hospital and independent customer groups offset the expected decline on the chain side, as this is our first quarter without the Longs CVS contract. 
The Specialty Group revenues increased 4% with our 3PL business especially strong this quarter. The Consulting group, though small to the overall company top line, had a very strong quarter in our acquisitions with TheraCom, being the biggest contributor, added about 0.6% to overall ABC revenue growth of the quarter.
Gross profit was $593 million in the quarter, up 2% from last December and gross margins of 291 basis points in the quarter, were down 1 basis point from last year. As I mentioned earlier, the prior year quarter included a $12 million benefit related to the completion of the Duane Reade contract and the contribution to current quarter gross profit from our acquired companies helped to offset this headwind.
Performance from new generic launches were in line with our expectations as were benefits from price appreciation. We give an early update during our Investor Day in December on trends with generic Lipitor Scripps. And since then, trends have normalized very much in line with our expectation of approximately a 70% conversion rate to the generic. Specialty generic trends were also in line with our expectations.
Our LIFO charge in quarter was $3.2 million compared to $9.9 million last year, reflecting the brand to generic conversions, and we continue to expect a full year charge of approximately $15 million.
We did very nice job managing our operating expenses this quarter despite our acquisition-related transaction costs and the inclusion of our acquired companies ongoing operating costs, including 2 months of TheraCom's results.
Operating expenses were $308 million, up 1.6% and included $3.6 million of acquisition-related transaction costs. Operating expenses in the quarter would have been down year-over-year ex the impact over acquisitions, fueled by a year-over-year decline in compensation costs including favorable benefit comparisons.
Keep in mind that our operating expenses are usually at their lowest level in our first quarter and should increase sequentially as we progress throughout the year.
Our guidance continues to include an annual expense increase of about 3% related primarily to our acquisitions.
Operating income of $285 million in the quarter increased 3% and operating margins expanded by 1 basis point compared to last December. Again, this year-over-year growth was slowed by the $3.6 million of acquisition costs in the current quarter and the previously mentioned $12 million gross profit benefit realized in the first quarter of fiscal '11.
Moving below the operating income line, interest expense of $23 million in the December quarter increased 18% compared to last year, primarily as a result of our $500 million 3.5% bonds that we issued in mid-November. Proceeds from this debt offering helped to fund our acquisitions and will also contribute to the retirement of our 2012 bonds that mature in mid-September. As a result, our expected interest rate expense will continue to trend higher than last year for the rest of fiscal '12.
Our effective income tax rate of 38.2% was slightly higher than last year's 38.1% and slightly below our expected annualized rate of approximately 38.4%. Our diluted earnings per share of $0.62 was up $0.05 or 9% compared to last year and exceeded our net income growth due to the reduction in our average diluted shares related to our ongoing share repurchase program. Average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 263.1 million, down over 6% from last December.
Now let's turn to our balance sheet in cash flow where trends continue to be very favorable. We generated $432 million of cash from operations in the quarter compared to using $99 million of cash in last year's first quarter. Much of that increase came from very favorable working capital at quarter end, particularly in the timing of our payments to vendors. As I have discussed often with our daily volume exceeding $300 million per business day, our quarter end working capital snapshots are subject to great volatility and one should be careful not to extrapolate the first quarter's results to the full year cash flow forecast.
Capital expenditures were $48 million in the quarter compared to $50 million last year, and as we mentioned in December, included significant investments to expand our infrastructure in Canada as well as some discretionary buyouts on leased equipment, offset in part by declining ERP spend.
We continue to expect the capital spend for the year in the $150 million range. We bought back $128 million of our shares during the quarter and we also closed our $250 million TheraCom acquisition. 
With our strong free cash flow performance in the quarter, we continue to be comfortable with our estimate of free cash flow in the range of $700 million to $800 million for all of fiscal '12. We had our normal seasonal increase in inventory in December. But despite the higher ending balance, our average day sales inventory for the quarter remained at 25, consistent with fiscal '11. Average DSOs of 17.7 in the December quarter were up slightly from 17.4 days last year and a favorable payables timing helped raise average quarterly DPOs by over 2 days compared to fiscal '11.
With our recent debt offering, our gross debt to total debt to capital ratio at the end of December was 39.9%, above our target range of 30% to 35% and will remain above the range in the next couple of quarters until we pay off our $392 million of debt, which matures in September.
Our cash balance was just under $2.4 billion at the end of December leaves us with greater financial flexibility to fund our strategic initiatives, return significant amount of capital to our shareholders and pay off our maturing debt.
Now let's turn to fiscal '12 guidance. And with our first quarter on track, our outlook is unchanged. Our diluted EPS guidance remains at a range of $2.74 to $2.84. Our assumptions behind this guidance also remain the same and include flat-to-modest revenue growth, operating margin expansion in the high single-digit to low double-digit basis point range and free cash flow in the $700 million to $800 million range. Additionally, we continue to expect to spend approximately $400 million for share repurchases.
So before I turn it back to Barbara, let me reiterate that 3 months into the year, we are performing well in our key areas in the business and despite some tough comparisons ahead in the next couple of quarters, we are well-positioned to meet our financial targets for all of fiscal '12.
Now here's Barbara for Q&A."

In our Drug company we have several large companies that are involved specialty products more on the mail-order side and on the patient delivery side.

I know you guys don't like to give quarterly guidance but straight expectations for  for Q2 or for a big number. And as we think about the branded Lipitor to generic conversion, I guess, 2 questions, one do you expect the Pfizer retention rate to stay at the 30-ish percent range? Or how quickly do you guys think that will continue to fall? And if it hovers at 30%, it could look like the most profitable period for generic Lipitor to be kind of even first month right after May when there's no limit on multisource introductions and the whack won't probably won't catch up but you can acquire the price. I guess, is it your sense that we might be, I guess, is the consensus maybe seem too ambitious for fiscal Q2? And we should be more optimistic for fiscal Q3?"

And directionally, the March quarter has always been our strongest quarter because of the timing and the impact of manufacturer, our brand price increases and the impact that has some of our fee-for-service agreements, that trend is -- continues to be our expectation this year. Certainly, the second quarter is a big quarter for the oral solid generics as well. Keep in mind, the first quarter we only had a month of the Lipitor, 2 months of the Zyprexa generics. In the second quarter, we have a full quarter benefit from those plus some new introductions. So certainly, we think the year-over-year benefit from oral solid is going to increase in the next quarter from the first quarter. So the trending I think is again very similar to where it's been historically. The second quarter continues to be our peak. The number of suppliers that come on board after the exclusionary period for Lipitor can impact our numbers somewhat. But again, we're expecting a handful of people there, and we're expecting a pretty significant price drop after exclusivity is over. As far as the 70 to 30, that's inline with our expectations if it's a little bit more generic, it helps us. It helps us. But again, I think the historical trending as far as our quarterly progression is still intact. And as I've mentioned we've got tough comparisons 2, 3 on the specialty side good performance on more solid the fourth quarter continues to be our easiest comparison."

Our revenues were up 2% to $20.4 billion. Earnings per share were up 9% to $0.62. We generated $432 million in operating cash flow and we repurchased $128 million of our shares. Our financial results were in line with our expectations and position us well to meet our objectives for the remainder of the year.
Our excellent cash generation and strong balance sheet provide us with outstanding financial flexibility and give us the ability to fund our strategic initiatives and grow our business.
AmerisourceBergen is fortunate to be an important part of a growing industry. As I discussed at our Investor Day in December, demographics in the expansion of health care coverage should you drive organic growth in our industry over the next several years. In addition, launches of new pharmaceuticals as well as new indications for existing drugs should also drive sales growth. The tremendous wave of over 30 brand to generic drug conversions that we expect in our fiscal 2012 as well as additional conversions expected in subsequent years will mitigate the top line dollar growth in our industry. It will drive tremendous value for wholesalers, healthcare providers and patients alike.
These trends bode well for AmerisourceBergen in particular. Our diverse revenue base positions us well to benefit from organic growth driven by demographics as well as from the influx of the uninsured over the next few years. Our customer mix also puts us in a favorable position to benefit from the historic influx of generics. In addition, cost-containment efforts underway by the federal government and other payers drive demand for our services most notably in our Consulting Services group.
Today, we are more entrenched than ever before with our manufactured customers and we expect that to continue to increase. As our provider customers face reimbursement and other challenges, they increasingly turn to AmerisourceBergen for help in making their healthcare practices run as efficiently as possible without sacrificing excellent patient care.
Over the last several months, a few large contracts in our industry have been the subject of much dialogue for various different reasons. Over all, however, the market continues to be competitive but stable. We continue to participate in discussions that are important to our business, our industry and our customers in Washington, D.C., educating lawmakers about our business and the value we and our customers provide to the healthcare system.
I've discussed our core tenants several times over the last year but they continue to drive our efforts and that's bare repeating. Firstly, collaborate to drive innovation for all stakeholders, increasing customer and supplier value, expanding our business in targeted markets, maximizing operating efficiency and maintain a high-performance culture. Our associates creatively tackle challenges and identify new opportunities to add value on a daily basis. They'll focus on meeting our objectives for the year, both in terms of the service we provide to customers and suppliers and in our financial performance, and I'm honored to work with beside them.
Turning now to our business units. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had solid revenue growth in the quarter, up 2%. We had positive revenue growth in both retail and institutional segments, even with the previously discussed last of the large retail -- retail customer in September of 2011. Our ultimate side segment was particularly strong in the quarter and hospitals and independents had very solid growth. 
We now have over 4,600 members in our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network which makes it the third largest network of pharmacies in the U.S. That is a powerful endorsement of the role that independent retail pharmacy plays in the complex healthcare landscape today.
Patients preferred choice when determining where to fill their prescriptions and our retail customers are very adept at fulfilling unique patient needs. Our SAP implementation continues to run smoothly with 3 distributions and a conversion's complete, and the remainder plans for the beginning of 2013. Our investments in our Canadian operations to support significant new business wins are also well underway. We are very pleased to be the leading distributor independent pharmacy in the Canadian market as well as the leader in Specialty Distribution and services.
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group had another strong quarter with revenues up 4%, with particularly strong performance in third-party logistics and good performance at Oncology Supply. The integration of IntrinsiQ has gone very well, and our customers have responded favorably to the tools at office. While our Specialty Group is based after our oncology franchise, we are an instrumental part of the commercialization strategy for any infusible product launched in the physician marketplace.
In addition, our Specialty Group often collaborates with our Consulting Services group to help ensure patients have access to products by utilizing the full capabilities of our physician networks, as well as our reimbursement and patient support program expertise. For example, during the quarter, we executed very well on the launch of a new brand of ophthalmology product, establishing significant market share in just the first few months of the introduction. This is a great example, not only of excellent cross-company collaboration, but also the strength and tremendous value of our diverse offerings.
AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services delivered a strong quarter while making excellent progress in the integration of TheraCom and Premier Source. Our Consulting and Packaging business both performed well in the quarter. And while the group only represents about 1% of our revenues, we believe our packaging and consulting associates are providing essential expertise to pharmaceutical manufacturers to help ensure that their products are brought to market as safely, quickly and efficiently as possible.
In addition, our reimbursement expertise helps ensure that patients who can benefit from both new and mature therapies have access to the products. 
Given the continued strength of our balance sheet, we continue to look for acquisitions that meet the criteria we've had in place for quite some time. They should increase our value offering to existing customers both up and down the channel. They should be within our established core competency and they should increase shareholder value. While we have not contemplated any further contribution from acquisitions in our guidance, we continue to be receptive to acquisitions and we continue to be interested in opportunities in pharmaceutical and Specialty Distribution and Services, as well as Consulting and Packaging services. While we historically have been very comfortable in the $200 million to $300 million range, we will consider selling larger if we make good strategic sense and we deliver value to our company and our shareholders.
Looking ahead, the results we've had in our first quarter have positioned us well to meet our objectives for the full fiscal year. We have a difficult comparison to overcome in 2012, but we continue to expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.74 to $2.84, an increase of 8% to 12% over fiscal 2011.
Looking further ahead to 2013, we should have a carryover from some of the launches that occur late in our fiscal 2012 including the relaunch of Oxaliplatin, and we should begin to benefit from the completion of our SAP implementation.
In fiscal 2014, we should begin to see the 30 million to 40 million uninsured patients in the healthcare market driving demand for pharmaceutical that should carry over into 2015 and beyond. In addition, 2014 and 2015 are expected to be good years with generic conversions, and of course, there's a chance that biosimilars may also come to market in that timeframe.
Before I turn it over to Mike for a detailed look at the financials, I want to reiterate the confidence that I have in our business and our future because demand is strong for the products we distribute and the services we provide. We were pleased to be recently be ranked 24th on Bloomberg Businessweek's list of the top 50 performing companies in the U.S. in recognition of our historic financial performance and our future growth opportunities.
As I stated earlier, we're playing essential role in the pharmaceutical supply channel, we positioned ourselves well to benefit from generics and specialty products, and we have continued to invest in our existing businesses and opportunities we see in our future.
Finally, our exceptional associates at ABC send a support in our industry and I'm proud to be their leader. Here is Mike."
24809,145552360,211548,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2012",2012-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone.

I'm very pleased to report first quarter fiscal 2012 results on track with our internal plans, highlighted by good performance on new generic launches, strong expense discipline, significant progress towards integrating TheraCom and to our consulting group and exceptional cash generation, all of which gives us confidence in reaffirming our annual EPS guidance.
As we go through our quarterly results, keep in mind that last year's first quarter included a $12 million or $0.03 benefit reflected in gross profit from the Duane Reade contract termination last December.
So let's turn to the quarter, and starting with the top line, revenues were $20.4 billion, a 2.4% increase over last year's quarter. Drug company revenue was up 2% as strong growth in the alternate site hospital and independent customer groups offset the expected decline on the chain side, as this is our first quarter without the Longs/CVS contract. 
The Specialty Group revenues increased 4% with our 3PL business especially strong this quarter. The Consulting group, though small to the overall company top line, had a very strong quarter in our acquisitions, with TheraCom being the biggest contributor, added about 0.6% to overall ABC revenue growth in the quarter.
Gross profit was $593 million in the quarter, up 2% from last December, and gross margins of 291 basis points in the quarter were down 1 basis point from last year. As I mentioned earlier, the prior year quarter included a $12 million benefit related to the completion of the Duane Reade contract and the contribution to current quarter gross profit from our acquired companies helped to offset this headwind.
Performance from new generic launches were in line with our expectations as were benefits from price appreciation. We gave an early update during our Investor Day in December on trends with generic Lipitor scripts. And since then, trends have normalized very much in line with our expectation of approximately a 70% conversion rate to the generic. Specialty generic trends were also in line with our expectations.
Our LIFO charge in the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $9.9 million last year, reflecting the brand to generic conversions, and we continue to expect a full year charge of approximately $15 million.
We did a very nice job managing our operating expenses this quarter despite our acquisition-related transaction costs and the inclusion of our acquired companies ongoing operating costs, including 2 months of TheraCom's results.
Operating expenses were $308 million, up 1.6% and included $3.6 million of acquisition-related transaction costs. Operating expenses in the quarter would have been down year-over-year x the impact of our acquisitions, fueled by a year-over-year decline in compensation costs including favorable benefit comparisons. Keep in mind that our operating expenses are usually at their lowest level in our first quarter and should increase sequentially as we progress throughout the year. Our guidance continues to include an annual expense increase of about 3% related primarily to our acquisitions.
Operating income of $285 million in the quarter increased 3% and operating margins expanded by 1 basis point compared to last December. Again, this year-over-year growth was slowed by the $3.6 million of acquisition costs in the current quarter and the previously mentioned $12 million gross profit benefit realized in the first quarter of fiscal '11.
Moving below the operating income line, interest expense of $23 million in the December quarter increased 18% compared to last year, primarily as a result of our $500 million, 3.5% bonds that we issued in mid-November. Proceeds from this debt offering helped to fund our acquisitions and will also contribute to the retirement of our 2012 bonds that mature in mid-September. As a result, our expected interest rate expense will continue to trend higher than last year for the rest of fiscal '12.
Our effective income tax rate of 38.2% was slightly higher than last year's 38.1% and slightly below our expected annualized rate of approximately 38.4%. Our diluted earnings per share of $0.62 was up $0.05 or 9% compared to last year and exceeded our net income growth due to the reduction in our average diluted shares related to our ongoing share repurchase program. Average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 263.1 million, down over 6% from last December.
Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flows where trends continue to be very favorable. We generated $432 million of cash from operations in the quarter compared to using $99 million of cash in last year's first quarter. Much of that increase came from a very favorable working capital at quarter end, particularly in the timing of our payments to vendors. As I have discussed often with our daily volume exceeding $300 million per business day, our quarter end working capital snapshots are subject to great volatility, and one should be careful not to extrapolate the first quarter's results to the full year cash flow forecast.
Capital expenditures were $48 million in the quarter compared to $50 million last year, and as we mentioned in December, included significant investments to expand our infrastructure in Canada as well as some discretionary buyouts on leased equipment, offset in part by declining ERP spend.
We continue to expect the capital spend for the year in the $150 million range. We bought back $128 million of our shares during the quarter and we also closed our $250 million TheraCom acquisition. 
With our strong free cash flow performance in the quarter, we continue to be comfortable with our estimate of free cash flow in the range of $700 million to $800 million for all of fiscal '12. We had our normal seasonal increase in inventory in December. But despite the higher ending balance, our average day sales in inventory for the quarter remained at 25, consistent with fiscal '11. Average DSOs of 17.7 in the December quarter were up slightly from 17.4 days last year and the favorable payables timing helped raise average quarterly DPOs by over 2 days compared to fiscal '11.
With our recent debt offering, our gross debt to total debt in capital ratio at the end of December was 39.9%, above our target range of 30% to 35%, and will remain above the range in the next couple of quarters until we pay off our $392 million of debt, which matures in September.
Our cash balance was just under $2.4 billion at the end of December leaves us with great financial flexibility to fund our strategic initiatives, return significant amounts of capital to our shareholders and pay off our maturing debt.
Now let's turn to fiscal '12 guidance. And with our first quarter on track, our outlook is unchanged. Our diluted EPS guidance remains at a range of $2.74 to $2.84. Our assumptions behind this guidance also remain the same and include flat-to-modest revenue growth, operating margin expansion in the high single-digit to low double-digit basis point range and free cash flow in the $700 million to $800 million range. Additionally, we continue to expect to spend approximately $400 million for share repurchases.
So before I turn it back to Barbara, let me reiterate that 3 months into the year, we are performing well in our key areas of the business. And despite some tough comparisons ahead in the next couple of quarters, we are well-positioned to meet our financial targets for all of fiscal '12.
Now here's Barbara for Q&A."

And if it hovers at 30%, it would look like the most profitable period for generic Lipitor to kind of be that first month right after May when there's no limit on multisource introductions and the whack probably won't catch up with the falling rate at which you guys can acquire the price.

And directionally, the March quarter has always been our strongest quarter because of the timing and the impact of manufacturer, our brand price increases and the impact that has on some of our fee-for-service agreements, that trend is -- continues to be our expectation this year. Certainly, the second quarter is a big quarter for the oral solid generics as well. Keep in mind, the first quarter, we only had a month of the Lipitor, 2 months of the Zyprexa generics. In the second quarter, we have a full quarter benefit from those plus some new introductions. So certainly, we think the year-over-year benefit from oral solids is going to increase in the next quarter from the first quarter. So the trending, I think is, again, very similar to where it's been historically. The second quarter continues to be our peak. The number of suppliers that come on board after the exclusionary period for Lipitor can impact our numbers somewhat. But again, we're expecting a handful of people there, and we're expecting a pretty significant price drop after exclusivity is over. As far as the 70:30, that's inline with our expectations. If it's a little bit more generic, it helps us. It helps us. But again, I think the historical trending, as far as our quarterly progression is still intact, and as I've mentioned, we've got tough comparisons of 2, 3 on the specialty side, but good performance on the oral solid side.

I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen delivered solid results in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2012.Our revenues were up 2% to $20.4 billion. Earnings per share were up 9% to $0.62. We gener",1400,"Thank you, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen delivered solid results in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2012.
Our revenues were up 2% to $20.4 billion. Earnings per share were up 9% to $0.62. We generated $432 million in operating cash flow and we repurchased $128 million of our shares. Our financial results were in line with our expectations and position us well to meet our objectives for the remainder of the year.
Our excellent cash generation and strong balance sheet provide us with outstanding financial flexibility and give us the ability to fund our strategic initiatives and grow our business.
AmerisourceBergen is fortunate to be an important part of a growing industry. As I discussed at our Investor Day in December, demographics in the expansion of health care coverage should drive organic growth in our industry over the next several years. In addition, launches of new pharmaceuticals as well as new indications for existing drugs should also drive sales growth. The tremendous wave of over 30 brand to generic drug conversions that we expect in our fiscal 2012 as well as additional conversions expected in subsequent years will mitigate the top line dollar growth in our industry. It will drive tremendous value for wholesalers, healthcare providers and patients alike.
These trends bode well for AmerisourceBergen in particular. Our diverse revenue base positions us well to benefit from organic growth driven by demographics as well as from the influx of the uninsured over the next few years. Our customer mix also puts us in a favorable position to benefit from the historic influx of generics. In addition, cost-containment efforts underway by the federal government and other payers drive demand for our services most notably in our Consulting Services group.
Today, we are more entrenched than ever before with our manufacture customers and we expect that to continue to increase. As our provider customers face reimbursement and other challenges, they increasingly turn to AmerisourceBergen for help in making their healthcare practices run as efficiently as possible without sacrificing excellent patient care.
Over the last several months, a few large contracts in our industry have been the subject of much dialogue for various different reasons. Overall, however, the market continues to be competitive but stable. We continue to participate in discussions that are important to our business, our industry and our customers in Washington, D.C., educating lawmakers about our business and the value we and our customers provide to the healthcare system.
I've discussed our core tenets several times over the last year but they continue to drive our efforts and that bears repeating. Firstly, collaborate to drive innovation for all stakeholders, increasing customer and supplier value, expanding our business in targeted markets, maximizing operating efficiency and maintain a high-performance culture. Our associates creatively tackle challenges and identify new opportunities to add value on a daily basis. They'll focus on meeting our objectives for the year, both in terms of the service we provide to customers and suppliers and in our financial performance, and I'm honored to work beside them.
Turning now to our business units. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had solid revenue growth in the quarter, up 2%. We had positive revenue growth in both retail and institutional segments, even with the previously-discussed loss of a large retail -- retail customer in September of 2011. Our ultimate side segment was particularly strong in the quarter and hospitals and independents had very solid growth. 
We now have over 4,600 members in our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network which makes it the third largest network of pharmacies in the U.S. That is a powerful endorsement of the role that independent retail pharmacy plays in the complex healthcare landscape today.
Patients preferred choice when determining where to fill their prescriptions and our retail customers are very adept at fulfilling unique patient needs. Our SAP implementation continues to run smoothly with redistributions and our conversions complete, and the remainder plans for the beginning of 2013. Our investments in our Canadian operations to support significant new business wins are also well underway. We are very pleased to be the leading distributor independent pharmacy in the Canadian market as well as the leader in Specialty Distribution and services.
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group had another strong quarter with revenues up 4%, with particularly strong performance in third-party logistics and good performance in Oncology Supply. The integration of IntrinsiQ has gone very well, and our customers have responded favorably to the tools at office. While our Specialty Group is based after our oncology franchise, we are an instrumental part of the commercialization strategy for any infusible product launched in the physician marketplace.
In addition, our Specialty Group often collaborates with our Consulting Services group to help ensure patients have access to products by utilizing the full capabilities of our physician networks, as well as our reimbursement and patient support program expertise. For example, during the quarter, we executed very well on the launch of a new brand of ophthalmology product, establishing significant market share in just the first few months of introduction. This is a great example, not only of excellent cross-company collaboration, but also of the strength and tremendous value of our diverse offerings.
AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services delivered a strong quarter while making excellent progress in the integration of TheraCom and Premier Source. Our Consulting and Packaging business both performed well in the quarter. And while the group only represents about 1% of our revenues, we believe our packaging and consulting associates are providing essential expertise to pharmaceutical manufacturers to help ensure that their products are brought to market as safely, quickly and efficiently as possible.
In addition, our reimbursement expertise helps ensure that patients who can benefit from both new and mature therapies have access to the products. 
Given the continued strength of our balance sheet, we continue to look for acquisitions that meet the criteria we've had in place for quite some time. They should increase our value offering to existing customers both up and down the channel. They should be within our established core competency and they should increase shareholder value. While we have not contemplated any further contribution from acquisitions in our guidance, we continue to be receptive to acquisitions and we continue to be interested in opportunities in pharmaceutical and Specialty Distribution and Services, as well as Consulting and Packaging services. While we historically have been very comfortable in the $200 million to $300 million range, we would consider selling larger if it made good strategic sense and would deliver value to our company and our shareholders.
Looking ahead, the results we've had in our first quarter have positioned us well to meet our objectives for the full fiscal year. We have a difficult comparison to overcome in 2012, but we continue to expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.74 to $2.84, an increase of 8% to 12% over fiscal 2011.
Looking further ahead to 2013, we should have a carryover from some of the launches that occur late in our fiscal 2012 including the relaunch of Oxaliplatin, and we should begin to benefit from the completion of our SAP implementation.
In fiscal 2014, we should begin to see the 30 million to 40 million uninsured patients in the healthcare market driving demand for pharmaceuticals that should carry over into 2015 and beyond. In addition, 2014 and 2015 are expected to be good years with generic conversions, and of course, there's a chance that biosimilars may also come to market in that timeframe.
Before I turn it over to Mike for a detailed look at the financials, I want to reiterate the confidence that I have in our business and our future because demand is strong for the products we distribute and the services we provide. We were pleased to be recently be ranked 24th on Bloomberg Businessweek's list of the top 50 performing companies in the U.S. in recognition of our historic financial performance and our future growth opportunities.
As I stated earlier, we play an essential role in the pharmaceutical supply channel, we positioned ourselves well to benefit from generics and specialty products, and we have continued to invest in our existing businesses and opportunities we see in our future.
Finally, our exceptional associates at ABC set us apart in our industry and I'm proud to be their leader. Here is Mike."
24809,145552360,211738,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2012",2012-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report first quarter fiscal 2012 results on track with our internal plans, highlighted by good performance on new generic launches, strong expense discipline, significant progress towards inte",1227,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report first quarter fiscal 2012 results on track with our internal plans, highlighted by good performance on new generic launches, strong expense discipline, significant progress towards integrating TheraCom into our consulting group and exceptional cash generation, all of which gives us confidence in reaffirming our annual EPS guidance.
As we go through our quarterly results, keep in mind that last year's first quarter included a $12 million or $0.03 benefit reflected in gross profit from the Duane Reade contract termination last December.
So let's turn to the quarter, and starting with the top line, revenues were $20.4 billion, a 2.4% increase over last year's quarter. Drug company revenue was up 2% as strong growth in the alternate site hospital and independent customer groups offset the expected decline on the chain side, as this is our first quarter without the Longs/CVS contract. 
The Specialty Group revenues increased 4% with our 3PL business especially strong this quarter. The Consulting group, though small to the overall company top line, had a very strong quarter in our acquisitions, with TheraCom being the biggest contributor, added about 0.6% to overall ABC revenue growth in the quarter.
Gross profit was $593 million in the quarter, up 2% from last December, and gross margins of 291 basis points in the quarter were down 1 basis point from last year. As I mentioned earlier, the prior year quarter included a $12 million benefit related to the completion of the Duane Reade contract and the contribution to current quarter gross profit from our acquired companies helped to offset this headwind.
Performance from new generic launches were in line with our expectations as were benefits from price appreciation. We gave an early update during our Investor Day in December on trends with generic Lipitor scripts. And since then, trends have normalized very much in line with our expectation of approximately a 70% conversion rate to the generic. Specialty generic trends were also in line with our expectations.
Our LIFO charge in the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $9.9 million last year, reflecting the brand to generic conversions, and we continue to expect a full year charge of approximately $15 million.
We did a very nice job managing our operating expenses this quarter despite our acquisition-related transaction costs and the inclusion of our acquired companies' ongoing operating costs, including 2 months of TheraCom's results.
Operating expenses were $308 million, up 1.6% and included $3.6 million of acquisition-related transaction costs. Operating expenses in the quarter would have been down year-over-year x the impact of our acquisitions, fueled by a year-over-year decline in compensation costs including favorable benefit comparisons. Keep in mind that our operating expenses are usually at their lowest level in our first quarter and should increase sequentially as we progress throughout the year. Our guidance continues to include an annual expense increase of about 3% related primarily to our acquisitions.
Operating income of $285 million in the quarter increased 3% and operating margins expanded by 1 basis point compared to last December. Again, this year-over-year growth was slowed by the $3.6 million of acquisition costs in the current quarter and the previously-mentioned $12 million gross profit benefit realized in the first quarter of fiscal '11.
Moving below the operating income line, interest expense of $23 million in the December quarter increased 18% compared to last year, primarily as a result of our $500 million, 3.5% bonds that we issued in mid-November. Proceeds from this debt offering helped to fund our acquisitions and will also contribute to the retirement of our 2012 bonds that mature in mid-September. As a result, our expected interest rate expense will continue to trend higher than last year for the rest of fiscal '12.
Our effective income tax rate of 38.2% was slightly higher than last year's 38.1% and slightly below our expected annualized rate of approximately 38.4%. Our diluted earnings per share of $0.62 was up $0.05 or 9% compared to last year and exceeded our net income growth due to the reduction in our average diluted shares related to our ongoing share repurchase program. Average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 263.1 million, down over 6% from last December.
Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flows where trends continue to be very favorable. We generated $432 million of cash from operations in the quarter compared to using $99 million of cash in last year's first quarter. Much of that increase came from very favorable working capital at quarter end, particularly in the timing of our payments to vendors. As I have discussed often with our daily volume exceeding $300 million per business day, our quarter end working capital snapshots are subject to great volatility, and one should be careful not to extrapolate the first quarter's results to the full year cash flow forecast.
Capital expenditures were $48 million in the quarter compared to $50 million last year, and as we mentioned in December, included significant investments to expand our infrastructure in Canada as well as some discretionary buyouts on leased equipment, offset in part by declining ERP spend.
We continue to expect the capital spend for the year in the $150 million range. We bought back $128 million of our shares during the quarter and we also closed our $250 million TheraCom acquisition. 
With our strong free cash flow performance in the quarter, we continue to be comfortable with our estimate of free cash flow in a range of $700 million to $800 million for all of fiscal '12. We had our normal seasonal increase in inventory in December. But despite the higher-ending balance, our average day sales in inventory for the quarter remained at 25, consistent with fiscal '11. Average DSOs of 17.7 in the December quarter were up slightly from 17.4 days last year and the favorable payables timing helped raise average quarterly DPOs by over 2 days compared to fiscal '11.
With our recent debt offering, our gross debt to total debt in capital ratio at the end of December was 39.9%, above our target range of 30% to 35%, and will remain above the range in the next couple of quarters until we pay off our $392 million of debt, which matures in September.
Our cash balance of just under $2.4 billion at the end of December leaves us with great financial flexibility to fund our strategic initiatives, return significant amounts of capital to our shareholders and pay off our maturing debt.
Now let's turn to fiscal '12 guidance. And with our first quarter on track, our outlook is unchanged. Our diluted EPS guidance remains at a range of $2.74 to $2.84. Our assumptions behind this guidance also remain the same and include flat-to-modest revenue growth, operating margin expansion in the high single-digit to low double-digit basis point range and free cash flow in the $700 million to $800 million range. Additionally, we continue to expect to spend approximately $400 million for share repurchases.
So before I turn it back to Barbara, let me reiterate that 3 months into the year, we are performing well in our key areas of the business. And despite some tough comparisons ahead in the next couple of quarters, we are well-positioned to meet our financial targets for all of fiscal '12.
Now here's Barbara for Q&A."

I think again our guidance for the year's, we expect that the cumulative impact of the 34 launches will offset the decline on the specialty generics side.

Those comparisons will get more difficult the next couple of quarters as they were very big quarters here for Specialty.

Or how quickly do you guys think that'll continue to fall? And if it hovers at 30%, it would look like the most profitable period for generic Lipitor to kind of be that first month right after May when there's no limit on multisource introductions and the whack probably won't catch up with the falling rate at which you guys can acquire the price.

And directionally, the March quarter has always been our strongest quarter because of the timing and the impact of manufacturer, our brand price increases and the impact that has on some of our fee-for-service agreements, that trend is -- continues to be our expectation this year. Certainly, the second quarter is a big quarter for the oral solid generics as well. Keep in mind, the first quarter, we only had a month of the Lipitor, 2 months of the Zyprexa generics. In the second quarter, we have a full quarter benefit from those plus some new introductions. So certainly, we think the year-over-year benefit from oral solids is going to increase in the next quarter from the first quarter. So the trending, I think is, again, very similar to where it's been historically. The second quarter continues to be our peak. The number of suppliers that come on board after the exclusionary period for Lipitor can impact our numbers somewhat. But again, we're expecting a handful of people there, and we're expecting a pretty significant price drop after exclusivity is over. As far as the 70:30, that's in line with our expectations. If it's a little bit more generic, it helps us. It helps us. But again, I think the historical trending, as far as quarterly progression is still intact, and as I've mentioned, we've got tough comparisons of 2 and 3 on the specialty side, but good performance on the oral solid side. And the fourth quarter continues to be our easiest comparison."

I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen delivered solid results in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2012.Our revenues were up 2% to $20.4 billion. Earnings per share were up 9% to $0.62. We gener",1400,"Thank you, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen delivered solid results in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2012.
Our revenues were up 2% to $20.4 billion. Earnings per share were up 9% to $0.62. We generated $432 million in operating cash flow and we repurchased $128 million of our shares. Our financial results were in line with our expectations and position us well to meet our objectives for the remainder of the year.
Our excellent cash generation and strong balance sheet provide us with outstanding financial flexibility and give us the ability to fund our strategic initiatives and grow our business.
AmerisourceBergen is fortunate to be an important part of a growing industry. As I discussed at our Investor Day in December, demographics in the expansion of health care coverage should drive organic growth in our industry over the next several years. In addition, launches of new pharmaceuticals as well as new indications for existing drugs should also drive sales growth. The tremendous wave of over 30 brand to generic drug conversions that we expect in our fiscal 2012 as well as additional conversions expected in subsequent years will mitigate the top line dollar growth in our industry. It will drive tremendous value for wholesalers, healthcare providers and patients alike.
These trends bode well for AmerisourceBergen in particular. Our diverse revenue base positions us well to benefit from organic growth driven by demographics as well as from the influx of the uninsured over the next few years. Our customer mix also puts us in a favorable position to benefit from the historic influx of generics. In addition, cost-containment efforts underway by the federal government and other payers drive demand for our services most notably in our Consulting Services group.
Today, we are more entrenched than ever before with our manufacture customers and we expect that to continue to increase. As our provider customers face reimbursement and other challenges, they increasingly turn to AmerisourceBergen for help in making their healthcare practices run as efficiently as possible without sacrificing excellent patient care.
Over the last several months, a few large contracts in our industry have been the subject of much dialogue for various different reasons. Overall, however, the market continues to be competitive but stable. We continue to participate in discussions that are important to our business, our industry and our customers in Washington, D.C., educating lawmakers about our business and the value we and our customers provide to the healthcare system.
I've discussed our core tenets several times over the last year but they continue to drive our efforts and that bears repeating. Firstly, collaborate to drive innovation for all stakeholders, increasing customer and supplier value, expanding our business in targeted markets, maximizing operating efficiency and maintain a high-performance culture. Our associates creatively tackle challenges and identify new opportunities to add value on a daily basis. They'll focus on meeting our objectives for the year, both in terms of the service we provide to customers and suppliers and in our financial performance, and I'm honored to work beside them.
Turning now to our business units. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had solid revenue growth in the quarter, up 2%. We had positive revenue growth in both retail and institutional segments, even with the previously-discussed loss of a large retail -- retail customer in September of 2011. Our ultimate side segment was particularly strong in the quarter and hospitals and independents had very solid growth. 
We now have over 4,600 members in our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network which makes it the third largest network of pharmacies in the U.S. That is a powerful endorsement of the role that independent retail pharmacy plays in the complex healthcare landscape today.
Patients preferred choice when determining where to fill their prescriptions and our retail customers are very adept at fulfilling unique patient needs. Our SAP implementation continues to run smoothly with redistributions and our conversions complete, and the remainder plans for the beginning of 2013. Our investments in our Canadian operations to support significant new business wins are also well underway. We are very pleased to be the leading distributor independent pharmacy in the Canadian market as well as the leader in Specialty Distribution and services.
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group had another strong quarter with revenues up 4%, with particularly strong performance in third-party logistics and good performance in Oncology Supply. The integration of IntrinsiQ has gone very well, and our customers have responded favorably to the tools at office. While our Specialty Group is based after our oncology franchise, we are an instrumental part of the commercialization strategy for any infusible product launched in the physician marketplace.
In addition, our Specialty Group often collaborates with our Consulting Services group to help ensure patients have access to products by utilizing the full capabilities of our physician networks, as well as our reimbursement and patient support program expertise. For example, during the quarter, we executed very well on the launch of a new brand of ophthalmology product, establishing significant market share in just the first few months of introduction. This is a great example, not only of excellent cross-company collaboration, but also of the strength and tremendous value of our diverse offerings.
AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services delivered a strong quarter while making excellent progress in the integration of TheraCom and Premier Source. Our Consulting and Packaging business both performed well in the quarter. And while the group only represents about 1% of our revenues, we believe our packaging and consulting associates are providing essential expertise to pharmaceutical manufacturers to help ensure that their products are brought to market as safely, quickly and efficiently as possible.
In addition, our reimbursement expertise helps ensure that patients who can benefit from both new and mature therapies have access to the products. 
Given the continued strength of our balance sheet, we continue to look for acquisitions that meet the criteria we've had in place for quite some time. They should increase our value offering to existing customers both up and down the channel. They should be within our established core competency and they should increase shareholder value. While we have not contemplated any further contribution from acquisitions in our guidance, we continue to be receptive to acquisitions and we continue to be interested in opportunities in pharmaceutical and Specialty Distribution and Services, as well as Consulting and Packaging services. While we historically have been very comfortable in the $200 million to $300 million range, we would consider selling larger if it made good strategic sense and would deliver value to our company and our shareholders.
Looking ahead, the results we've had in our first quarter have positioned us well to meet our objectives for the full fiscal year. We have a difficult comparison to overcome in 2012, but we continue to expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.74 to $2.84, an increase of 8% to 12% over fiscal 2011.
Looking further ahead to 2013, we should have a carryover from some of the launches that occur late in our fiscal 2012 including the relaunch of Oxaliplatin, and we should begin to benefit from the completion of our SAP implementation.
In fiscal 2014, we should begin to see the 30 million to 40 million uninsured patients in the healthcare market driving demand for pharmaceuticals that should carry over into 2015 and beyond. In addition, 2014 and 2015 are expected to be good years with generic conversions, and of course, there's a chance that biosimilars may also come to market in that timeframe.
Before I turn it over to Mike for a detailed look at the financials, I want to reiterate the confidence that I have in our business and our future because demand is strong for the products we distribute and the services we provide. We were pleased to be recently be ranked 24th on Bloomberg Businessweek's list of the top 50 performing companies in the U.S. in recognition of our historic financial performance and our future growth opportunities.
As I stated earlier, we play an essential role in the pharmaceutical supply channel, we positioned ourselves well to benefit from generics and specialty products, and we have continued to invest in our existing businesses and opportunities we see in our future.
Finally, our exceptional associates at ABC set us apart in our industry and I'm proud to be their leader. Here is Mike."
24809,145552360,211921,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2012",2012-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report first quarter fiscal 2012 results on track with our internal plans, highlighted by good performance on new generic launches, strong expense discipline, significant progress towards inte",1227,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report first quarter fiscal 2012 results on track with our internal plans, highlighted by good performance on new generic launches, strong expense discipline, significant progress towards integrating TheraCom into our consulting group and exceptional cash generation, all of which gives us confidence in reaffirming our annual EPS guidance.
As we go through our quarterly results, keep in mind that last year's first quarter included a $12 million or $0.03 benefit reflected in gross profit from the Duane Reade contract termination last December.
So let's turn to the quarter, and starting with the top line, revenues were $20.4 billion, a 2.4% increase over last year's quarter. Drug company revenue was up 2% as strong growth in the alternate site hospital and independent customer groups offset the expected decline on the chain side, as this is our first quarter without the Longs/CVS contract. 
The Specialty Group revenues increased 4% with our 3PL business especially strong this quarter. The Consulting group, though small to the overall company top line, had a very strong quarter in our acquisitions, with TheraCom being the biggest contributor, added about 0.6% to overall ABC revenue growth in the quarter.
Gross profit was $593 million in the quarter, up 2% from last December, and gross margins of 291 basis points in the quarter were down 1 basis point from last year. As I mentioned earlier, the prior year quarter included a $12 million benefit related to the completion of the Duane Reade contract and the contribution to current quarter gross profit from our acquired companies helped to offset this headwind.
Performance from new generic launches were in line with our expectations as were benefits from price appreciation. We gave an early update during our Investor Day in December on trends with generic Lipitor scripts. And since then, trends have normalized very much in line with our expectation of approximately a 70% conversion rate to the generic. Specialty generic trends were also in line with our expectations.
Our LIFO charge in the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $9.9 million last year, reflecting the brand to generic conversions, and we continue to expect a full year charge of approximately $15 million.
We did a very nice job managing our operating expenses this quarter despite our acquisition-related transaction costs and the inclusion of our acquired companies' ongoing operating costs, including 2 months of TheraCom's results.
Operating expenses were $308 million, up 1.6% and included $3.6 million of acquisition-related transaction costs. Operating expenses in the quarter would have been down year-over-year x the impact of our acquisitions, fueled by a year-over-year decline in compensation costs including favorable benefit comparisons. Keep in mind that our operating expenses are usually at their lowest level in our first quarter and should increase sequentially as we progress throughout the year. Our guidance continues to include an annual expense increase of about 3% related primarily to our acquisitions.
Operating income of $285 million in the quarter increased 3% and operating margins expanded by 1 basis point compared to last December. Again, this year-over-year growth was slowed by the $3.6 million of acquisition costs in the current quarter and the previously-mentioned $12 million gross profit benefit realized in the first quarter of fiscal '11.
Moving below the operating income line, interest expense of $23 million in the December quarter increased 18% compared to last year, primarily as a result of our $500 million, 3.5% bonds that we issued in mid-November. Proceeds from this debt offering helped to fund our acquisitions and will also contribute to the retirement of our 2012 bonds that mature in mid-September. As a result, our expected interest rate expense will continue to trend higher than last year for the rest of fiscal '12.
Our effective income tax rate of 38.2% was slightly higher than last year's 38.1% and slightly below our expected annualized rate of approximately 38.4%. Our diluted earnings per share of $0.62 was up $0.05 or 9% compared to last year and exceeded our net income growth due to the reduction in our average diluted shares related to our ongoing share repurchase program. Average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 263.1 million, down over 6% from last December.
Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flows where trends continue to be very favorable. We generated $432 million of cash from operations in the quarter compared to using $99 million of cash in last year's first quarter. Much of that increase came from very favorable working capital at quarter end, particularly in the timing of our payments to vendors. As I have discussed often with our daily volume exceeding $300 million per business day, our quarter end working capital snapshots are subject to great volatility, and one should be careful not to extrapolate the first quarter's results to the full year cash flow forecast.
Capital expenditures were $48 million in the quarter compared to $50 million last year, and as we mentioned in December, included significant investments to expand our infrastructure in Canada as well as some discretionary buyouts on leased equipment, offset in part by declining ERP spend.
We continue to expect the capital spend for the year in the $150 million range. We bought back $128 million of our shares during the quarter and we also closed our $250 million TheraCom acquisition. 
With our strong free cash flow performance in the quarter, we continue to be comfortable with our estimate of free cash flow in a range of $700 million to $800 million for all of fiscal '12. We had our normal seasonal increase in inventory in December. But despite the higher-ending balance, our average day sales in inventory for the quarter remained at 25, consistent with fiscal '11. Average DSOs of 17.7 in the December quarter were up slightly from 17.4 days last year and the favorable payables timing helped raise average quarterly DPOs by over 2 days compared to fiscal '11.
With our recent debt offering, our gross debt to total debt in capital ratio at the end of December was 39.9%, above our target range of 30% to 35%, and will remain above the range in the next couple of quarters until we pay off our $392 million of debt, which matures in September.
Our cash balance of just under $2.4 billion at the end of December leaves us with great financial flexibility to fund our strategic initiatives, return significant amounts of capital to our shareholders and pay off our maturing debt.
Now let's turn to fiscal '12 guidance. And with our first quarter on track, our outlook is unchanged. Our diluted EPS guidance remains at a range of $2.74 to $2.84. Our assumptions behind this guidance also remain the same and include flat-to-modest revenue growth, operating margin expansion in the high single-digit to low double-digit basis point range and free cash flow in the $700 million to $800 million range. Additionally, we continue to expect to spend approximately $400 million for share repurchases.
So before I turn it back to Barbara, let me reiterate that 3 months into the year, we are performing well in our key areas of the business. And despite some tough comparisons ahead in the next couple of quarters, we are well-positioned to meet our financial targets for all of fiscal '12.
Now here's Barbara for Q&A."

Certainly, the second quarter is a big quarter for the oral solid generics as well. Keep in mind, the first quarter, we only had a month of the Lipitor, 2 months of the Zyprexa generics. In the second quarter, we have a full quarter benefit from those plus some new introductions. So certainly, we think the year-over-year benefit from oral solids is going to increase in the next quarter from the first quarter. So the trending, I think is, again, very similar to where it's been historically. The second quarter continues to be our peak. The number of suppliers that come on board after the exclusionary period for Lipitor can impact our numbers somewhat. But again, we're expecting a handful of people there, and we're expecting a pretty significant price drop after exclusivity is over. As far as the 70:30, that's in line with our expectations. If it's a little bit more generic, it helps us. It helps us.

24809,183660881,289784,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen once again delivered solid quarterly results and our performance for the first half of our fiscal year 2012 positions us well to meet our objectives for the full year. In",2087,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen once again delivered solid quarterly results and our performance for the first half of our fiscal year 2012 positions us well to meet our objectives for the full year. In the March quarter, our revenues were up 2% to $20.1 billion. Earnings per share were up 5% to $0.81, and that's on top of a 22% increase in the prior year. We generated $236 million in operating cash flow, and we repurchased $200 million of our shares. I'm especially proud that we overcame a challenging comp 2 this quarter last year and exceeded our internal profit goal for each decision it. 
During that quarter, we also made excellent progress integrating recent acquisitions and working towards the closing of our World Courier acquisition. Our strong cash generation and high-quality balance sheet continue to provide us with outstanding financial flexibility and give us the ability to fund our strategic initiatives, grow our business and return funds to shareholders. 
AmerisourceBergen is fortunate to be an important part of a growing industry. Demographics and initiatives aimed at expanding access to healthcare and coverage -- and healthcare coverage, should continue to drive organic growth in our industry over the next several years. In addition, launches of new pharmaceuticals, as well as new indications for existing drugs should also drive sales growth over the next several years. Whether the new therapies are traditional or medications with complex biotech pharmaceuticals, AmerisourceBergen is well positioned to not only benefit from the distribution of new products, but also to offer prelaunched and commercialization services to manufacturers and to support patient access and reimbursement programs to help ensure that patients have access to large saving therapies and that the products achieve their potential in the marketplace. 
At our revenue base positions us well organic growth driven by demographics, and our customer mix puts us in a favorable position to continue to benefit from the historic influx of generics. As you know, generics mitigate the topline dollar growth in our industry that drive tremendous value for wholesalers, healthcare providers and patients alike. In addition, close scrutiny of healthcare expenses and cost-containment efforts underway by the federal government and other payers also drives demand for our services, most notably in our Consulting Services group. Over the last several years, we have significantly strengthened our relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers and we continue to look for meaningful ways to provide additional services across the supply channel to help them ensure that they need the challenges of today's changing healthcare landscape. As our provider customer face similar charges regarding cost-containment and reimbursement for services provided to patients, they increasingly turn to AmerisourceBergen. We're helping in making their healthcare practices run as efficiently and effectively as possible. 
I'll provide our customers work hard everyday to provide world-class patient care, and we believe they deserve fair reimbursement for the professional services they provide. AmerisourceBergen is an active participant participating in policy discussions in Washington, D.C. with objective of helping legislative understand our industry and our importance to our healthcare systems. 
Our associates are focused on meeting objectives for the year both in terms of providing outstanding service to customers and in our financial performance. They continue to see creative ways to meet the challenges in the diverse markets we serve and identify new opportunities to add value through collaborative innovation and by maximizing efficiency. I take great proud and enthusiasm and dedication and it is my honor to work beside them. 
Turning now to our business units. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation as expected had flat revenue for the quarter as strong performance in the institutional segments was offset by the previously disclosed loss of a large retail customer. Topline growth was also mitigated by the impact of generic convergence including decreased sales to our largest customer. Our ABDC associate did a stellar job managing several generic launches including 5 different generic products that launched within 1 week. Year-to-date, the generic launches have performed as planned and we, of course, look forward to several more launches due to come in the second half of the year. With over 4,600 members, our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network, the third largest network of pharmacies in the U.S. continues to play a crucial role in providing pharmacy care nationwide. Patients preferred choice determining prescriptions and our retail customers are very adept at fulfilling unique patient needs and is adapting to the changing needs is at the marketplace. 
Our ASP implementation continues to run smoothly with 8 distribution centers conversions, 8 distribution conversions complete, 2 additional conversions occurring tomorrow, and the remainder plans at the beginning of 2013. As we have gained expense with the new system, particularly without corporate and back-office functions, we have a ready began to realize some operational savings, which is reflected in part in a good performance we had on the expense line this quarter. Our investments in our Canadian operations to support significant new business wins continued in the March quarter. Our associates have done a tremendous job setting up 4 new distribution centers in 6 months in order to support this new business. There is still much work to be done, but we are confident that our expansion efforts will meaningful increased the value would bring to both independent pharmacies and especially provided in the Canadian market. 
As we noted in the press release, following the closing of the merger with Express Scripts and Medco in early April, we amended our existing Medco agreement to provide for the contract to end upon award and implementation of one or more new Pharmaceutical Distribution agreement with the newly combined business. Express Scripts has issued an RFP for the combined business and anticipate that the new contract or contracts will begin on October 1, 2012. We are participating fully in the competitive RFP process and we intend to pursue this opportunity to retain or grow the business under a new contract. We have had an excellent working relationship with Medco where for over 2 decades and we are excited about the opportunity to demonstrate the value we can bring to the newly combined entity. 
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group had another strong quarter with revenues up 6% with particularly strong performance in third quarter logistics and in our vaccine and physician business. Our oncology business performed well while facing a very difficult comparison due to the strong performance of the 3 large specialty generic products last year. While our Specialty Group is based for our oncology franchise, we are an instrumental part of the commercialization strategy for any infusible product launched into the physician marketplace. We continue to execute very well on the launch of a new brand of product establishing significant market share in what was the first folk quarter of the introduction. Our Specialty Group often collaborates with our Consulting Services group to help ensure patients have access to products by utilizing the full suite of capabilities of our physician networks, as well as our reimbursement and patient support program expertise. For example, we recently held a manufacture launch a new biotech product. And during the March quarter, we were able to not only achieve the leading market share for the distribution of the product, but also to provide third-party logistics, contract packaging and all of the reimbursement and patient support programs for the product across the market. We are very proud that these combined service offerings provide unmatched value to manufacturers and distinguish AmerisourceBergen in the marketplace. As we look at the products in development pipelines today, we believe that we will win even more of these opportunities in the future, which will be an important driver of our growth in the years ahead. 
Our Consulting Services group delivered a very strong quarter, while making excellent progress in the integration of TheraCom and Premier Source, which are both performing very well. The last group had the strongest quarter in the history even without the contributions from TheraCom. While the group only represents about 2% of our revenues, we believe our packaging and consulting services provide essential expertise to pharmaceutical manufacturers to help ensure that their products are brought to market as safely, quickly and efficiently as possible. In addition, our reimbursement expertise helps ensure that patients who can benefit from growth new and matured therapies have access to the products. 
We continue to make good progress towards closing our most recent acquisition World Courier. As we deepen our knowledge and understanding of their business, I am more convinced than ever that World Courier affords us the opportunity not only to acquire the market leader in premium niche clinical trial logistics services but also to begin to build out a framework to expand our consulting and commercialization services beyond North America. 
In this current quarter, we will begin operating in 50 new international markets and employ about 1,500 new associates outside North America. This is significant expansion for ABC and we are tremendously excited about welcoming the World Courier team to ABC. 
In addition, we are storing ways to potentially our niche Specialty Distribution service into select markets as well. We expect to close the acquisition next week at the end of April, and I'm very excited about the potential we see in the World Courier platform in the years ahead. 
Given the continued strength of our balance sheet, we continue to look for acquisitions that meet the criteria we've had in place for quite some time. They should increase our value offering to existing customers both up and down the channel. They should be within our established core competency and they should increase shareholder value. While we have not contemplated any further contribution from acquisitions in our guidance, we continue to be receptive to acquisitions and we continue to be interested in opportunities in pharmaceutical and Specialty Distribution and Services, as well as consulting and packaging services. While we historically have been very comfortable in the $200 million to $300 million range, we will consider selling larger as we did with World Courier if it made a good strategic sense and will deliver value to our company on our shareholders. 
Looking ahead, the results we've had in the first half of our year have positioned us well to meet our objectives for the full fiscal year. We have a difficult comparison to overcome in 2012, but we continue to expect GAAP earnings per share to be within the range of 2.74 to 2.84, and we are tracking towards the midpoint of that range. Tim will provide the details in our assumptions for the remainder of the year, but I want to highlight that we continue to remain disciplined on expenses, our cash flows are strong and we have increased our share repurchases assumption for the year. Looking further ahead to 2013, we should have a carryover from some of the launches that occurred late in our fiscal 2012 including the relaunch of Oxaliplatin and we should begin to benefit from the completion of our ASP implementation. In fiscal 2014, we should begin to see this 30 million to 40 million uninsured patients enter the healthcare market, driving demand for pharmaceuticals that should carryover into 2015 and beyond. In addition, 2014 and 2015 are expected to be good years for generic conversions. And, of course, there's a chance that may also come to market in a timeframe. 
Before turn it over to Tim, I want to reiterate the confidence that I have in our business and in our future. The modest product is strong for the products we distribute and we play essential role in pharmaceutical supply channel. We have positioned ourselves well to continue to benefit from the 2 key growth drivers, generics and specialty products, and we'll continue to invest in our distribution and in our services businesses. Over the last year, we were summating 4 investment in other areas of our business with an eye to the future. We expect demand in the specialty products to consider grow not only the U.S. but throughout the world and the commercialization and reimbursement support services we provide to manufacturers will help support that growth. As cost containment, if it continues to cross the healthcare landscape, our customers increasingly turn to us for help in meeting the challenges of the marketplace without sacrificing patient care. Finally, the vision and innovative ideas that our associates brings to market everyday help support in our industry, and I am proud to be their leader. Here is Tim."
24809,183660881,289784,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to be participating in my first earnings call as acting CFO. And I am pleased to report another solid ABC quarter, and most importantly, that our Q2 results are on track with our internal plan",1505,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to be participating in my first earnings call as acting CFO. And I am pleased to report another solid ABC quarter, and most importantly, that our Q2 results are on track with our internal plan. The highlights this quarter: Excellent topline growth at our Specialty and Consulting businesses, very good execution on new generic launches and continued focus on expense management across the organization. And finally, another quarter of strong cash generation. 
Now let's turn to the quarterly details and starting with the topline. Revenues were $20.1 billion, a 1.6% increase over last year's quarter. Drug company revenues were essentially flat, as we guided. We had strong performance in our alternate site and health system segments, offset by the loss of a large chain customer last year, as well as the impact from brand to generic conversions. 
The Specialty Group revenues increased 6% led by 2 of our businesses with above market growth. ICS, our third-party logistics business and Besse Medical, our vaccine and position office distribution business, which benefited from a full quarter impact of sales of a new ophthalmology drug. 
The Consulting group, though small to the overall topline, continues to perform well. Excluding their TheraCom acquisition, they had over 20% topline growth. TheraCom contributed just under 1% of our overall revenue growth in the quarter. 
Moving to gross profit. Gross profit was $695 million in the quarter, up 1.1% from last March with a gross margin of 3.46% in the quarter, down about 2 basis points from last year. As we have discussed in the past, our second quarter was a very top comp due to the significant contribution in the prior-year from oncology generics. In the second quarter of 2011, these oncology drugs contributed about $0.16 of EPS to our results. Our gross margin expanded 31 basis points in the March 2011 quarter. This year, we are able to effectively offset this headwind with contributions from the new Oral Solid generics. As well as the lower contribution from oncology generics, and gross profit contributions from our acquired companies. Additionally, our LIFO charge was approximately $4 million in the quarter, down $10 million from last year. We continue to expect our LIFO charge will be approximately $15 million, down significantly from last year. Our annual LIFO forecast is based on our expectation that brand price inflation will be somewhat less this year. And more importantly, we will see significant generic price deflation in the second half of our fiscal year related to key brand to generic conversions coming off exclusivity. 
Finally, the benefit we received from the new generic launches and also price appreciation was in line with our expectations. This quarter, we did an excellent job controlling our operating expenses. Operating expenses were approximately $327 million, up 1.5%. However, this amount includes the operating expenses of about $11 million from our recently acquired companies. Additionally, we had $9 million of executive severance and acquisition-related transaction costs. Operating expenses would've been down, excluding the impact of our acquisitions, due to lower compensation costs including benefits. 
Additionally, our SAP implementation is progressing well at the corporate level. The system has reached a level of stability faster than we expected enabling us to realize some early savings, especially with external consultants. 
Last quarter, our guidance was an annual expense increase of about 3% due to our acquisitions. As an organization, we continue to exercise discipline and focus on managing expenses. We now expect our total operating expenses for our base business before adding World Courier to be essentially flat for the year. 
Operating income of $368 million in the quarter increased, about 1%, while operating margin was down 2 basis points compared to last March. Our current quarter was slowed by the $9 million of executive severance and acquisition transaction costs. Excluding these non-recurring expenses, our operating income margin would've expanded 3 basis points to 1.88%. 
Moving below the operating income line, interest expense of nearly $24 million in the March quarter increased 25% compared to last year, primarily as a result of our $500 million bonds we issued back in November. The proceeds helped to fund the TheraCom acquisition and will also contribute to the retirement of our 2012 bonds that mature in mid-September. Our effective income tax rate of 38.4% was slightly higher than last year's 38.1%, and is right in line with our expected annualized rate of 38.4%. 
Our diluted GAAP earnings per share in the quarter of $0.81 increased by $0.04, or 5%, over the same quarter last year. And again, overcoming a $0.16 headwind from the contribution from specialty generics in the March 2011 quarter. Our EPS benefited from a reduction in our average diluted shares related to our ongoing share repurchase program. Average diluted shares for the quarter were approximately 262 million, down just over 6% from last March. 
Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flows, where trends continue to be very favorable. We generated $236 million of cash from operations in the quarter, bringing our 6-month total to $668 million compared to generating $577 million for the first 6 months last year. We continue to manage AR and inventory level very closely and this has benefited our working capital this year. With our daily revenue volume exceeding $300 million per business day, our quarter end working capital snapshots are subject to volatility. Therefore, our 6-month cash results cannot be extrapolated to determine a full-year cash flow estimate. 
Capital expenditures were $40 million in the quarter and $88 million for the 6 months. During the last 2 years, we put a number of capital projects on hold as we focused on SAP. We have a pipeline of attractive internal projects that we have begun to pursue as our SAP deployment moves along. Additionally, we have CapEx associated with our recent TheraCom acquisition. Because of this, we will exceed our previous target of $150 million for CapEx, and we will be closer to $200 million for the year. Even with this additional CapEx, we expect that our free cash flow will now be in the $800 million to $900 million range. 
During the quarter, we brought back $200 million of our shares. For 6 months, we've purchased $320 million of shares. At March 31, we have approximately $180 million left on our current share repurchase authorization. In terms of key financial metrics that we track, our average day sales in inventory for the quarter remained at 14 days, consistent with fiscal '11. Average DSOs of 18 days in the March quarter were up slightly from 17.3 days last year. And favorable payables timing helped raise average quarterly DPOs by over 3 days compared to Fiscal '11. 
With our recent debt offering, our gross debt to total debt in capital ratio at the end of March was 39%, above our target range of 30% to 35%. And it will remain above the range until we pay off our $400 million of debt in September. Our cash balance at March 31, was $2.3 billion. Keep in mind that we will be funding our World Courier acquisition from cash and we will be paying down debt in September, as previously mentioned. After these 2 large cash outlays, we will still have financial flexibility to fund CapEx and strategic initiatives and return to capital -- and return capital to our shareholders. 
Now let's turn to updated fiscal 2012 guidance. We expect our diluted GAAP EPS to track to the middle of the range we previously provided, $2.74 to $2.84. Our assumption for revenue growth remains unchanged, flat-to-modest revenue growth. We expect our operating margin expansion to be in the high single-digit basis points. Free cash flow will now be in the $800 million to $900 million range. And we are raising our guidance for share repurchases for the year to $500 million, which will complete our current share repurchase authorization. 
Looking ahead, I would like to remind everyone that Q3 is another challenging comparison for us because of the $0.17 EPS contribution from oncology generics last year. Also in Q3 2012, we have 2 of the large generics coming off exclusivity. When looking out to the second half of the year, we believe Q4 will be somewhat of an easier comparison with the return of Oxaliplatin for half a quarter, a few favorable year end generic launches for our drug company and favorable expense comparisons year-over-year. 
So before I turn it back to Barbara, let me reiterate that 6 months into the fiscal year we are performing well in our key areas of the business and we are well positioned to meet our financial targets for fiscal 2012. One final point, I'd like to take a moment and thank our ABC associates, especially those in the finance and accounting areas that have stepped up the largest 2 months and help support the organization and me in particular during our CFO transition period. Thanks, everyone. Here's Barbara to start our Q&A."

At least here in the U.S. we think about it as single-payer market, that hasn't been the case. We've been able to help, we have a very strong presence with new infusible products. So what we've seen is a manufacturer environment that ABC is very comfortable in contracting with that is looking for us to get into more countries. So we've been prompted to look into international opportunities by manufacturers. Then comes World Courier we're in 50 new countries as of next week, hopefully. We have 1,500 associates that are very tenured. We've been actually impressed with the quality of the World Courier associates. As you know, healthcare is very local. So we think that we have an opportunity to understand healthcare markets both organic and inquisitive opportunities with people on the ground there who speak the language, and know the trends, know who's the rock players, the ethical players, the hard quality players in that environment, and we think that, that's going to give us good opportunity. Also think that as of the product at that World Courier is managing are commercialized, as more and more of those products are commercialized and come to market as middle classes is growing in some countries that we haven't traditionally thought about as being sort of specialty consumers and products, we think we're going to have an opportunity to participate in those commercialization strategies. think about it, World Courier has handled those products, they know that treatment, they know the environment, we think that we have to recharacterize part of the business but we think we can do this.

I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen once again delivered solid quarterly results and our performance for the first half of our fiscal year 2012 positions us well to meet our objectives for the full year. In",2108,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen once again delivered solid quarterly results and our performance for the first half of our fiscal year 2012 positions us well to meet our objectives for the full year. In the March quarter, our revenues were up 2% to $20.1 billion. Earnings per share were up 5% to $0.81, and that's on top of a 22% increase in the prior year. 
We generated $236 million in operating cash flow and we repurchased $200 million of our shares. I'm especially proud that we overcame a challenging comp to this quarter, last year, and exceeded our internal profit goals for each business unit. 
During the quarter, we also made excellent progress integrating recent acquisitions and working towards the closing of our World Courier acquisition. Our strong cash generation and high-quality balance sheet continue to provide us with outstanding financial flexibility and give us the ability to fund our strategic initiatives, grow our business and return funds to shareholders. 
AmerisourceBergen is fortunate to be an important part of a growing industry. Demographics and initiatives aimed at expanding access to health care and coverage -- and healthcare coverage, should continue to drive organic growth in our industry over the next several years. In addition, launches of new pharmaceuticals, as well as new indications for existing drugs should also drive sales growth over the next several years. Whether the new therapies are traditional oral medications or complex biotech pharmaceuticals, AmerisourceBergen is well-positioned to not only benefit from the distribution of new products, but also to offer pre-launch and commercialization services to manufacturers and to support patient access and reimbursement programs to help ensure that patients have access to life-saving therapies, and that the products achieve their full potential in the marketplace. 
At our verse [ph] revenue base positions us well to benefit from organic growth driven by demographics, and our customer mix puts us in a favorable position to continue to benefit from the historic influx of generics. As you know, generics mitigate the topline dollar growth in our industry but drive tremendous value for wholesalers, health care providers and patients alike. In addition, close scrutiny of health care expenses and cost-containment efforts underway by the federal government and other payers also drives demand for our services, most notably in our Consulting Services group. 
Over the last several years, we have significantly strengthened our relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers and we continue to look for meaningful ways to provide additional services across the supply channel to help them ensure they meet the challenges of today's changing health care landscape. As our provider customers face similar challenges regarding cost -containment and reimbursement for services provided to patients, they increasingly turn to AmerisourceBergen. We help in making their health care practices run as efficiently and effectively as possible.  
Our provider customers work hard everyday to provide world-class patient care, and we believe they deserve fair reimbursement for the professional services they provide. AmerisourceBergen is an active participant participating in policy discussions in Washington, D.C. with the objective of helping legislators understand our industry and our importance to the health care systems. 
Our associates are focused on meeting our objectives for the year, both in terms of providing outstanding service to customers and in our financial performance. They continue to seek creative ways to meet the challenges in the diverse markets we serve and identify new opportunities to add value through collaborative innovation and by maximizing efficiency. I take great pride in their enthusiasm and dedication, and it is my honor to work beside them. 
Turning now to our business units. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, as expected, had flat revenue in the quarter as strong performance in the institutional segment was offset by the previously disclosed loss of a large retail customer. Topline growth was also mitigated by the impact of generic convergence, including decreased sales to our largest customer. 
Our ABDC associates did a stellar job managing several generic launches including 5 different generic products that launched within one week. Year-to-date, the generic launches have performed as planned and we, of course, look forward to several more launches still to come in the second half of the year. 
With over 4,600 members, our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network, the third largest network of pharmacies in the U.S. continues to play a crucial role in providing pharmacy care nationwide. Patients' preferred choice when determining where to fill their prescriptions and our retail customers are very adept at fulfilling unique patient needs, and is adapting to the changing needs of the marketplace. 
Our ASP implementation continues to run smoothly with 8 distribution centers conversions complete, 2 additional conversions occurring tomorrow, and the remainder plans with the beginning of 2013. As we have gained experience with the new system, particularly with the corporate and back-office functions, we have already begun to realize some operational savings, which is reflected, in part, in a good performance we had on the expense line this quarter. 
Our investments in our Canadian operations to support significant new business wins continued in the March quarter. Our associates have done a tremendous job setting up 4 new distribution centers in 6 months, in order to support this new business. There is still much work to be done, but we are confident that our expansion efforts will meaningfully increase the value we bring to both independent pharmacies and especially providers in Canadian market -- 
As we noted in the press release, following the closing of the merger with Express Scripts and Medco in early April, we amended our existing Medco agreement to provide for the contract to end upon the award and implementation of one or more new pharmaceutical distribution agreements for the newly combined business. Express Scripts has issued an RFP for the combined business, and anticipate that the new contract, or contracts, will begin on October 1, 2012. We are participating fully in the competitive RFP process and we intend to pursue this opportunity to retain or grow the business under a new contract. We have had an excellent working relationship with Medco for over 2 decades and we are excited about the opportunity to demonstrate the value we can bring to the newly combined entity. 
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group had another strong quarter with revenues up 6% with particularly strong performance in third quarter logistics, and in our vaccine and physician distribution business. Our oncology business performed well, while facing a very difficult comparison due to the strong performance of the 3 large Besse generic products last year. While our Specialty Group is best known for our oncology franchise, we are an instrumental part of the commercialization strategy for any infusible product launched into the physician marketplace. We continue to execute very well on the launch of a new brand of ophthalmology product establishing significant market share in what was the first full quarter of the introduction. 
Our Specialty Group often collaborates with our Consulting Services group to help ensure patients have access to products by utilizing the full suite of capabilities of our physician networks, as well as our reimbursement and patient support program expertise. For example, we recently helped a manufacturer launch a new biotech product. And during the March quarter, we were able to not only achieve the leading market share for the distribution of the product, but also to provide third-party logistics, contract packaging and all of the reimbursement and patient support programs for the product across the market. We are very proud that these combined service offerings provide unmatched value to manufacturers and distinguish AmerisourceBergen in the marketplace. As we look at the products in development pipelines today, we believe that we will win even more of these opportunities in the future, which will be an important driver of our growth in the years ahead. 
Our Consulting Services group delivered a very strong quarter, while making excellent progress in the integration of TheraCom and Premier Source, which are both performing very well. The last group had the strongest quarter in its history even without the contributions from TheraCom. While the group only represents about 2% of our revenues, we believe our packaging and consulting services provide essential expertise to pharmaceutical manufacturers to help ensure that their products are brought to market as safely, quickly and efficiently as possible. In addition, our reimbursement expertise helps ensure that patients who can benefit from growth new and matured therapies have access to the products. 
We continue to make good progress towards closing our most recent acquisition, World Courier. As we deepen our knowledge and understanding of their business, I am more convinced than ever that World Courier affords us the opportunity, not only to acquire the market leader in premium niche clinical trial logistics services, but also to begin to build out a framework to expand our consulting and commercialization services beyond North America. 
In this current quarter, we will begin operating in 50 new international markets and employ about 1,500 new associates outside North America. This is significant expansion for ABC and we are tremendously excited about welcoming the World Courier team to ABC. 
In addition, we are storing ways to potentially expand some of our niche Specialty Distribution service into select markets as well. We expect to close the acquisition next week, at the end of April, and I'm very excited about the potential we see in the World Courier platform in the years ahead. 
Given the continued strength of our balance sheet, we continue to look for acquisitions that meet the criteria we've had in place for quite some time. They should increase our value offering to existing customers both up and down the channel. They should be within our established core competency and they should increase shareholder value. While we have not contemplated any further contribution from acquisitions in our guidance, we continue to be receptive to acquisitions and we continue to be interested in opportunities in pharmaceutical and Specialty Distribution and Services, as well as consulting and packaging services. While we, historically, have been very comfortable in the $200 million to $300 million range, we will consider selling larger, as we did with World Courier, if it made a good strategic sense and will deliver value to our company and our shareholders. 
Looking ahead, the results we've had in the first half of our year have positioned us well to meet our objectives for the full fiscal year. We have a difficult comparison to overcome in 2012, but we continue to expect GAAP earnings per share to be within the range of 2.74 to 2.84, and we are tracking towards the midpoint of that range. Tim will provide the details in our assumptions for the remainder of the year, but I want to highlight that we continue to remain disciplined on expenses, our cash flows are strong and we have increased our share repurchases assumption for the year. 
Looking further ahead to 2013, we should have a carryover from some of the launches that occurred late in our fiscal 2012, including the relaunch of Oxaliplatin, and we should begin to benefit from the completion of our ASP implementation. In fiscal 2014, we should begin to see this 30 million to 40 million uninsured patients enter the health care market, driving demand for pharmaceuticals that should carryover into 2015 and beyond. In addition, 2014 and 2015 are expected to be good years for generic conversions. And, of course, there's a chance that biosimilars may also come to market in that timeframe. 
Before turn it over to Tim, I want to reiterate the confidence that I have in our business and in our future. Demand is strong for the products we distribute and we play an essential role in pharmaceutical supply channel. We've positioned ourselves well to continue to benefit from the 2 key growth drivers, generics and specialty products, and we have continued to invest in our distribution and in our services businesses. 
Over the last year, we were summating important investment in other areas of our business with an eye to the future. We expect demand for specialty products to continue to grow, not only the U.S. but throughout the world, and the commercialization and reimbursement support services we provide to manufacturers will help support that growth. As cost containment efforts continue to cross the health care landscape, our customers increasingly turn to us for help in meeting the challenges of the marketplace without sacrificing patient care. Finally, the vision and innovative ideas that our associates bring to market everyday set our support in our industry, and I am proud to be their leader. Here is Tim."

It's my pleasure to be participating in my first earnings call as acting CFO. And I am pleased to report another solid ABC quarter and, most importantly, that our Q2 results are on track with our internal plan.",1501,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to be participating in my first earnings call as acting CFO. And I am pleased to report another solid ABC quarter and, most importantly, that our Q2 results are on track with our internal plan. 
The highlights this quarter: excellent topline growth at our Specialty and Consulting businesses; very good execution on new generic launches and continued focus on expense management across the organization; and finally, another quarter of strong cash generation. 
Now let's turn to the quarterly details and starting with the topline. Revenues were $20.1 billion, a 1.6% increase over last year's quarter. Drug company revenues were essentially flat, as we guided. We had strong performance in our alternate site and health system segments, offset by the loss of a large chain customer last year, as well as the impact from brand to generic conversions. 
The Specialty Group revenues increased 6%, led by 2 of our businesses with above market growth. ICS, our third-party logistics business and BesseMedical, our vaccine and physician office distribution business, which benefited from a full quarter impact of sales of a new ophthalmology drug. 
The Consulting group, though small to the overall topline, continues to perform well. Excluding their TheraCom acquisition, they had over 20% topline growth. TheraCom contributed just under 1% of our overall revenue growth in the quarter. 
Moving to gross profit. Gross profit was $695 million in the quarter, up 1.1% from last March, with a gross margin of 3.46% in the quarter, down about 2 basis points from last year. As we have discussed in the past, our second quarter was a very tough comp, due to the significant contribution in the prior year from oncology generics. In the second quarter of 2011, these oncology drugs contributed about $0.16 of EPS to our results. Our gross margin expanded 31 basis points in the March 2011 quarter. This year, we are able to effectively offset this headwind with contributions from the new Oral Solid generics, as well as the lower contribution from oncology generics and gross profit contributions from our acquired companies. 
Additionally, our LIFO charge was approximately $4 million in the quarter, down $10 million from last year. We continue to expect our LIFO charge will be approximately $15 million, down significantly from last year. Our annual LIFO forecast is based on our expectation that brand price inflation will be somewhat less this year. And more importantly, we will see significant generic price deflation in the second half of our fiscal year related to key brand to generic conversions coming off exclusivity. 
Finally, the benefit we received from the new generic launches, and also price appreciation, was in line with our expectations. This quarter, we did an excellent job controlling our operating expenses. Operating expenses were approximately $327 million, up 1.5%. However, this amount includes the operating expenses of about $11 million from our recently acquired companies. Additionally, we had $9 million of executive severance and acquisition-related transaction costs. Operating expenses would've been down, excluding the impact of our acquisitions, due to lower compensation costs including benefits. 
Additionally, our SAP implementation is progressing well at the corporate level. The system has reached a level of stability faster than we expected, enabling us to realize some early savings, especially with external consultants. 
Last quarter, our guidance was an annual expense increase of about 3%, due to our acquisitions. As an organization, we continue to exercise discipline and focus on managing expenses. We now expect our total operating expenses for our base business, before adding World Courier, to be essentially flat for the year. 
Operating income of $368 million in the quarter increased about 1%, while operating margin was down 2 basis points compared to last March. Our current quarter was slowed by the $9 million of executive severance and acquisition transaction costs. Excluding these non-recurring expenses, our operating income margin would've expanded 3 basis points to 1.88%. 
Moving below the operating income line, interest expense of nearly $24 million in the March quarter increased 25% compared to last year, primarily, as a result of our $500 million bonds we issued back in November. The proceeds help to fund the TheraCom acquisition and will also contribute to the retirement of our 2012 bonds that mature in mid-September. Our effective income tax rate of 38.j4% was slightly higher than last year's 38.1%, and is right in line with our expected annualized rate of 38.4%. 
Our diluted GAAP earnings per share in the quarter of $0.81 increased by $0.04, or 5%, over the same quarter last year. And again, overcoming a $0.16 headwind from the contribution from specialty generics in the March 2011 quarter. Our EPS benefited from a reduction in our average diluted shares related to our ongoing share repurchase program. Average diluted shares for the quarter were approximately 262 million, down just over 6% from last March. 
Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flows, where trends continue to be very favorable. We generated $236 million of cash from operations in the quarter, bringing our 6-month total to $668 million, compared to generating $577 million for the first 6 months last year. We continue to manage AR and inventory levels very closely and this has benefited our working capital this year. With our daily revenue volume exceeding $300 million per business day, our quarter- end working capital snapshots are subject to volatility. Therefore, our 6-month cash results cannot be extrapolated to determine a full-year cash flow estimate. 
Capital expenditures were $40 million in the quarter and $88 million for the 6 months. During the last 2 years, we put a number of capital projects on hold as we focused on SAP. We have a pipeline of attractive internal projects that we have begun to pursue as our SAP deployment moves along. 
Additionally, we have CapEx associated with our recent TheraCom acquisition. Because of this, we will exceed our previous target of $150 million for CapEx, and we will be closer to $200 million for the year. Even with this additional CapEx, we expect that our free cash flow will now be in the $800 million to $900 million range. 
During the quarter, we brought back $200 million of our shares. For 6 months, we've purchased $320 million of shares. At March 31, we have approximately $180 million left on our current share repurchase authorization. In terms of key financial metrics that we track, our average day sales in inventory for the quarter remained at 14 days, consistent with fiscal '11. Average DSOs of 18 days in the March quarter were up slightly from 17.3 days last year. And favorable payables timing helped raise average quarterly DPOs by over 3 days compared to Fiscal '11. 
With our recent debt offering, our gross debt, the total debt and capital ratio, at the end of March, was 39%, above our target range of 30% to 35%. And it will remain above the range until we pay off our $400 million of debt in September. Our cash balance at March 31, was $2.3 billion. Keep in mind, that we will be funding our World Courier acquisition from cash and we will be paying down debt in September, as previously mentioned. After these 2 large cash outlays, we will still have financial flexibility to fund CapEx and strategic initiatives and return to capital -- and return capital to our shareholders. 
Now let's turn to updated fiscal 2012 guidance. We expect our diluted GAAP EPS to track to the middle of the range we previously provided, $2.74 to $2.84. Our assumption for revenue growth remains unchanged, flat-to-modest revenue growth. We expect our operating margin expansion to be in the high-single-digit basis points. Free cash flow will now be in the $800 million to $900 million range. And we are raising our guidance for share repurchases for the year to $500 million, which will complete our current share repurchase authorization. 
Looking ahead, I would like to remind everyone that Q3 is another challenging comparison for us because of the $0.17 EPS contribution from oncology generics last year. Also in Q3 2012, we have 2 of the large generics coming off exclusivity. When looking out to the second half of the year, we believe Q4 will be somewhat of an easier comparison. With the return of Oxaliplatin for half a quarter, a few favorable year-end generic launches for our drug company and favorable expense comparisons year-over-year. 
So before I turn it back to Barbara, let me reiterate, that 6 months into the fiscal year, we are performing well in our key areas of the business and we are well-positioned to meet our financial targets for fiscal 2012. One final point, I'd like to take a moment and thank our ABC associates, especially those in the finance and accounting areas that have stepped up the last 2 months and helped support the organization and me, in particular, during our CFO transition period. Thanks, everyone. Here's Barbara to start our Q&A."

First of all, again, we do $300 million in revenue a day, as ABC, but one of the things we've been very happy with is our specialty performance in Canada. This is -- this market works differently than it does in the U.S., but we've been able to do some joint programs, we've been able to help with more complex reimbursement environment there, including a pretty robust product market that we -- that is not generally known. At least here, in the U.S., we think about it as single-payer market, that hasn't been the case. We've been able to help, we have a very strong presence with new infusible drugs. So what we've seen is a manufacturer environment that ABC is very comfortable in contracting with, that is looking for us to get into more countries. So we've been prompted to look at international opportunities by manufacturers. Then comes World Courier, we're in 50 new countries as of next week, hopefully. We have 1,500 associates that are very tenured. We've been extremely impressed with the quality of the World Courier associates. As you know, health care is very local. So we think that we have an opportunity to understand health care markets, both organic and acquisitive opportunities, with people on the ground there who speak the language, and know the trends, know who's the rock players, the ethical players, the hard quality players in that environment. And we think that, that's going to give us a good opportunity. We also think that as the products that World Courier is managing or commercialized, as more and more of those products are commercialized and come to market as -- middle class is growing in some countries that we haven't traditionally thought about as being big Baltic and have sort of -- and especially consumers of products, we think we're going to have an opportunity to participate in those commercialization strategies. Think about it, World Courier has handled those products, they know the treatment centers, they know the environment. So we think that we have to recharacterize part of the business, but we think we can do that, so... . Long answer but, as you can tell, I'm very enthusiastic about this."

24809,183660881,290514,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen once again delivered solid quarterly results, and our performance for the first half of our fiscal year 2012 positions us well to meet our objectives for the full year. I",2113,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen once again delivered solid quarterly results, and our performance for the first half of our fiscal year 2012 positions us well to meet our objectives for the full year. In the March quarter, our revenues were up 2% to $20.1 billion. Earnings per share were up 5% to $0.81, and that's on top of a 22% increase in the prior year. 
We generated $236 million in operating cash flow and we repurchased $200 million of our shares. I'm especially proud that we overcame a challenging comp to this quarter, last year, and exceeded our internal profit goals for each business unit. 
During the quarter, we also made excellent progress integrating recent acquisitions and working towards the closing of our World Courier acquisition. Our strong cash generation and high-quality balance sheet continue to provide us with outstanding financial flexibility and give us the ability to fund our strategic initiatives, grow our business and return funds to shareholders. 
AmerisourceBergen is fortunate to be an important part of a growing industry. Demographics and initiatives aimed at expanding access to health care and coverage -- and health care coverage, should continue to drive organic growth in our industry over the next several years. In addition, launches of new pharmaceuticals, as well as new indications for existing drugs should also drive sales growth over the next several years. Whether the new therapies are traditional oral medications or complex biotech pharmaceuticals, AmerisourceBergen is well positioned to not only benefit from the distribution of new products, but also to offer pre-launch and commercialization services to manufacturers and to support patient access and reimbursement programs to help ensure that patients have access to life-saving therapies and that the products achieve their full potential in the marketplace. 
At our verse [ph] revenue base positions us well to benefit from organic growth driven by demographics, and our customer mix puts us in a favorable position to continue to benefit from the historic influx of generics. As you know, generics mitigate the topline dollar growth in our industry but drive tremendous value for wholesalers, health care providers and patients alike. In addition, close scrutiny of health care expenses and cost-containment efforts underway by the federal government and other payers also drives demand for our services, most notably in our Consulting Services group. 
Over the last several years, we have significantly strengthened our relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers, and we continue to look for meaningful ways to provide additional services across the supply channel to help them ensure they meet the challenges of today's changing health care landscape. As our provider customers face similar challenges regarding cost-containment and reimbursement for services provided to patients, they increasingly turn to AmerisourceBergen. We help in making their health care practices run as efficiently and effectively as possible.  
Our provider customers work hard every day to provide world-class patient care, and we believe they deserve fair reimbursement for the professional services they provide. AmerisourceBergen is an active participant participating in policy discussions in Washington, D.C. with the objective of helping legislators understand our industry and our importance to the health care system. 
Our associates are focused on meeting our objectives for the year, both in terms of providing outstanding service to customers and in our financial performance. They continue to seek creative ways to meet the challenges in the diverse markets we serve and identify new opportunities to add value through collaborative innovation and by maximizing efficiency. I take great pride in their enthusiasm and dedication, and it is my honor to work beside them. 
Turning now to our business units. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, as expected, had flat revenue in the quarter as strong performance in the institutional segment was offset by the previously disclosed loss of a large retail customer. Topline growth was also mitigated by the impact of generic convergence, including decreased sales to our largest customer. 
Our ABDC associates did a stellar job this quarter managing several generic launches, including 5 different generic products that launched within one week. Year-to-date, the generic launches have performed as planned and we, of course, look forward to several more launches still to come in the second half of the year. 
With over 4,600 members, our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network, the third largest network of pharmacies in the U.S., continues to play a crucial role in providing pharmacy care nationwide. Patients prefer choice when determining where to fill their prescriptions, and our retail customers are very adept at fulfilling unique patient needs and at adapting to the changing needs of the marketplace. 
Our ASHP implementation continues to run smoothly with 8 distribution centers conversions complete, 2 additional conversions occurring tomorrow, and the remainder planned for the beginning of 2013. As we have gained experience with the new system, particularly with the corporate and back-office functions, we have already begun to realize some operational savings, which is reflected, in part, in the good performance we had on the expense line this quarter. 
Our investments in our Canadian operations to support significant new business wins continued in the March quarter. Our associates have done a tremendous job setting up 4 new distribution centers in 6 months, in order to support this new business. There is still much work to be done, but we are confident that our expansion efforts will meaningfully increase the value we bring to both independent pharmacies and especially providers in the Canadian market.
As we noted in the press release, following the closing of the merger of Express Scripts and Medco in early April, we amended our existing Medco agreement to provide for the contract to end upon the award and implementation of one or more new pharmaceutical distribution agreements for the newly combined business. Express Scripts has issued an RFP for the combined business, and anticipate that the new contract, or contracts, will begin on October 1, 2012. We are participating fully in the competitive RFP process, and we intend to pursue this opportunity to retain or grow the business under a new contract. We have had an excellent working relationship with Medco for over 2 decades, and we are excited about the opportunity to demonstrate the value we can bring to the newly combined entity. 
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group had another strong quarter with revenues up 6% with particularly strong performance in third-party logistics and in our vaccine and physician distribution business. Our oncology business performed well, while facing a very difficult comparison due to the strong performance of the 3 large Besse generic products last year. While our Specialty Group is best known for our oncology franchise, we are an instrumental part of the commercialization strategy for any infusible product launched into the physician marketplace. We continue to execute very well on the launch of a new brand of ophthalmology product establishing significant market share in what was the first full quarter of the introduction. 
Our Specialty Group often collaborates with our Consulting Services group to help ensure patients have access to products by utilizing the full suite of capabilities of our physician networks, as well as our reimbursement and patient support program expertise. For example, we recently helped a manufacturer launch a new biotech product. And during the March quarter, we were able to not only achieve the leading market share for the distribution of the product, but also to provide third-party logistics, contract packaging and all of the reimbursement and patient support programs for the product across the market. We are very proud that these combined service offerings provide unmatched value to manufacturers and distinguish AmerisourceBergen in the marketplace. As we look at the products in development pipelines today, we believe that we will win even more of these opportunities in the future, which will be an important driver of our growth in the years ahead. 
Our Consulting Services group delivered a very strong quarter, while making excellent progress in the integration of TheraCom and Premier Source, which are both performing very well. The last group had the strongest quarter in its history, even without the contributions from TheraCom. While the group only represents about 2% of our revenues, we believe our packaging and consulting services provide essential expertise to pharmaceutical manufacturers to help ensure that their products are brought to market as safely, quickly and efficiently as possible. In addition, our reimbursement expertise helps ensure that patients who can benefit from both new and mature therapies have access to the products. 
We continue to make good progress towards closing our most recent acquisition, World Courier. As we deepen our knowledge and understanding of their business, I am more convinced than ever that World Courier affords us the opportunity, not only to acquire the market leader in premium niche clinical trial logistics services, but also to begin to build out a framework to expand our consulting and commercialization services beyond North America. 
In this current quarter, we will begin operating in 50 new international markets and employ about 1,500 new associates outside North America. This is significant expansion for ABC, and we are tremendously excited about welcoming the World Courier team to ABC. 
In addition, we are exploring ways to potentially expand some of our niche Specialty Distribution services into select markets as well. We expect to close the acquisition next week, at the end of April, and I'm very excited about the potential we see in the World Courier platform in the years ahead. 
Given the continued strength of our balance sheet, we continue to look for acquisitions that meet the criteria we've had in place for quite some time. They should increase our value offering to existing customers both up and down the channel, they should be within our established core competency and they should increase shareholder value. While we have not contemplated any further contribution from acquisitions in our guidance, we continue to be receptive to acquisitions and we continue to be interested in opportunities in pharmaceutical and Specialty Distribution and Services, as well as consulting and packaging services. While we, historically, have been very comfortable in the $200 million to $300 million range, we will consider selling larger, as we did with World Courier, if it made good strategic sense and would deliver value to our company and our shareholders. 
Looking ahead, the results we've had in the first half of our year have positioned us well to meet our objectives for the full fiscal year. We have a difficult comparison to overcome in 2012, but we continue to expect GAAP earnings per share to be within the range of $2.74 to $2.84, and we are tracking towards the midpoint of that range. Tim will provide the details in our assumptions for the remainder of the year, but I want to highlight that we continue to remain disciplined on expenses, our cash flows are strong and we have increased our share repurchase assumption for the year. 
Looking further ahead to 2013, we should have a carryover from some of the launches that occur late in our fiscal 2012, including the relaunch of Oxaliplatin, and we should begin to benefit from the completion of our ASHP implementation. In fiscal 2014, we should begin to see this 30 million to 40 million uninsured patients enter the health care market, driving demand for pharmaceuticals that should carry over into 2015 and beyond. In addition, 2014 and 2015 are expected to be good years for generic conversions. And, of course, there's a chance that biosimilars may also come to market in that time frame. 
Before turn it over to Tim, I want to reiterate the confidence that I have in our business and in our future. Demand is strong for the products we distribute, and we play an essential role in pharmaceutical supply channel. We've positioned ourselves well to continue to benefit from the 2 key growth drivers, generics and specialty products, and we have continued to invest in our distribution and in our services businesses. 
Over the last year, we were summating important investment in other areas of our business with an eye to the future. We expect demand for specialty products to continue to grow, not only the U.S. but throughout the world, and the commercialization and reimbursement support services we provide to manufacturers will help support that growth. As cost containment efforts continue to cross the health care landscape, our customers increasingly turn to us for help in meeting the challenges of the marketplace without sacrificing patient care. Finally, the vision and innovative ideas that our associates bring to market every day set us apart in our industry, and I am proud to be their leader. Here is Tim."

It's my pleasure to be participating in my first earnings call as acting CFO. And I am pleased to report another solid ABC quarter and, most importantly, that our Q2 results are on track with our internal plan.",1502,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to be participating in my first earnings call as acting CFO. And I am pleased to report another solid ABC quarter and, most importantly, that our Q2 results are on track with our internal plan. 
The highlights this quarter: excellent topline growth at our Specialty and Consulting businesses; very good execution on new generic launches and continued focus on expense management across the organization; and finally, another quarter of strong cash generation. 
Now let's turn to the quarterly details. And starting with the topline, revenues were $20.1 billion, a 1.6% increase over last year's quarter. Drug company revenues were essentially flat, as we guided. We had strong performance in our alternate site and health system segments, offset by the loss of a large chain customer last year, as well as the impact from brand to generic conversions. 
The Specialty Group revenues increased 6%, led by 2 of our businesses with above market growth. ICS, our third-party logistics business and Besse Medical, our vaccine and physician office distribution business, which benefited from a full quarter impact of sales of a new ophthalmology drug. 
The Consulting group, though small to the overall topline, continues to perform well. Excluding their TheraCom acquisition, they had over 20% topline growth. TheraCom contributed just under 1% of our overall revenue growth in the quarter. 
Moving to gross profit. Gross profit was $695 million in the quarter, up 1.1% from last March, with a gross margin of 3.46% in the quarter, down about 2 basis points from last year. As we have discussed in the past, our second quarter was a very tough comp, due to the significant contribution in the prior year from oncology generics. In the second quarter 2011, these oncology drugs contributed about $0.16 of EPS to our results. Our gross margin expanded 31 basis points in the March 2011 quarter. This year, we are able to effectively offset this headwind with contributions from the new oral solid generics, as well as the lower contribution from oncology generics and gross profit contributions from our acquired companies. 
Additionally, our LIFO charge was approximately $4 million in the quarter, down $10 million from last year. We continue to expect our LIFO charge will be approximately $15 million, down significantly from last year. Our annual LIFO forecast is based on our expectation that brand price inflation will be somewhat less this year. And more importantly, we will see significant generic price deflation in the second half of our fiscal year related to key brand to generic conversions coming off exclusivity. 
Finally, the benefit we received from the new generic launches, and also price appreciation, was in line with our expectations. This quarter, we did an excellent job controlling our operating expenses. Operating expenses were approximately $327 million, up 1.5%. However, this amount includes the operating expenses of about $11 million from our recently acquired companies. Additionally, we had $9 million of executive severance and acquisition-related transaction costs. Operating expenses would've been down, excluding the impact of our acquisitions, due to lower compensation costs, including benefits. 
Additionally, our SAP implementation is progressing well at the corporate level. The system has reached a level of stability faster than we expected, enabling us to realize some early savings, especially with external consultants. 
Last quarter, our guidance was an annual expense increase of about 3%, due to our acquisitions. As an organization, we continue to exercise discipline and focus on managing expenses. We now expect our total operating expenses for our base business, before adding World Courier, to be essentially flat for the year. 
Operating income of $368 million in the quarter increased about 1%, while operating margin was down 2 basis points compared to last March. Our current quarter was slowed by the $9 million of executive severance and acquisition transaction costs. Excluding these nonrecurring expenses, our operating income margin would've expanded 3 basis points to 1.88%. 
Moving below the operating income line, interest expense of nearly $24 million in the March quarter increased 25% compared to last year, primarily as a result of our $500 million bonds we issued back in November. The proceeds help to fund the TheraCom acquisition and will also contribute to the retirement of our 2012 bonds that mature in mid-September. Our effective income tax rate of 38.4% was slightly higher than last year's 38.1% and is right in line with our expected annualized rate of 38.4%. 
Our diluted GAAP earnings per share in the quarter of $0.81 increased by $0.04, or 5%, over the same quarter last year. And again, overcoming a $0.16 headwind from the contribution from specialty generics in the March 2011 quarter. Our EPS benefited from a reduction in our average diluted shares related to our ongoing share repurchase program. Average diluted shares for the quarter were approximately 262 million, down just over 6% from last March. 
Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flows, where trends continue to be very favorable. We generated $236 million of cash from operations in the quarter, bringing our 6-month total to $668 million, compared to generating $577 million for the first 6 months last year. We continue to manage AR and inventory levels very closely, and this has benefited our working capital this year. With our daily revenue volume exceeding $300 million per business day, our quarter-end working capital snapshots are subject to volatility. Therefore, our 6-month cash results cannot be extrapolated to determine a full year cash flow estimate. 
Capital expenditures were $40 million in the quarter and $88 million for the 6 months. During the last 2 years, we put a number of capital projects on hold as we focused on SAP. We have a pipeline of attractive internal projects that we have begun to pursue as our SAP deployment moves along. 
Additionally, we have CapEx associated with our recent TheraCom acquisition. Because of this, we will exceed our previous target of $150 million for CapEx, and we will be closer to $200 million for the year. Even with this additional CapEx, we expect that our free cash flow will now be in the $800 million to $900 million range. 
During the quarter, we bought back $200 million of our shares. For 6 months, we've purchased $320 million of shares. At March 31, we have approximately $180 million left on our current share repurchase authorization. In terms of key financial metrics that we track, our average day sales in inventory for the quarter remained at 14 days, consistent with fiscal '11. Average DSOs of 18 days in the March quarter were up slightly from 17.3 days last year. And favorable payables timing helped raise average quarterly DPOs by over 3 days compared to fiscal '11. 
With our recent debt offering, our gross debt, the total debt and capital ratio, at the end of March, was 39%, above our target range of 30% to 35%. And it will remain above the range until we pay off our $400 million of debt in September. Our cash balance at March 31 was $2.3 billion. Keep in mind that we will be funding our World Courier acquisition from cash and we will be paying down debt in September, as previously mentioned. After these 2 large cash outlays, we will still have financial flexibility to fund CapEx and strategic initiatives and return to capital -- and return capital to our shareholders. 
Now let's turn to updated fiscal 2012 guidance. We expect our diluted GAAP EPS to track to the middle of the range we previously provided, $2.74 to $2.84. Our assumption for revenue growth remains unchanged, flat-to-modest revenue growth. We expect our operating margin expansion to be in the high-single-digit basis points. Free cash flow will now be in the $800 million to $900 million range. And we are raising our guidance for share repurchases for the year to $500 million, which will complete our current share repurchase authorization. 
Looking ahead, I would like to remind everyone that Q3 is another challenging comparison for us because of the $0.17 EPS contribution from oncology generics last year. Also in Q3 2012, we have 2 of the large generics coming off exclusivity. When looking out to the second half of the year, we believe Q4 will be somewhat of an easier comparison. With the return of Oxaliplatin for half a quarter, a few favorable year-end generic launches for the Drug Company and favorable expense comparisons year-over-year. 
So before I turn it back to Barbara, let me reiterate, that 6 months into the fiscal year, we are performing well in our key areas of the business, and we are well positioned to meet our financial targets for fiscal 2012.

First of all, again, we do $300 million in revenue a day, as ABC, but one of the things we've been very, very happy with is our specialty performance in Canada. This is -- this market works differently than it does in the U.S., but we've been able to do some joint programs, we've been able to help with a more complex reimbursement environment there, including a pretty robust product market that we -- that is not generally known. At least here, in the U.S., we think about it as single-payer market, that hasn't been the case. We've been able to help, we have a very strong presence with new infusible drugs. So what we've seen is a manufacturer environment that ABC is very comfortable in contracting with, that is looking for us to get into more countries. So we've been prompted to look at international opportunities by manufacturers. Then comes World Courier, we're in 50 new countries as of next week, hopefully. We have 1,500 associates that are very tenured. We've been extremely impressed with the quality of the World Courier associates. As you know, health care is very local. So we think that we have an opportunity to understand health care markets, both organic and acquisitive opportunities, with people on the ground there who speak the language and know the trends, know who's the right players, the ethical players, the high quality players in that environment. And we think that, that's going to give us a good opportunity. We also think that as the products that World Courier is managing are commercialized, as more and more of those products are commercialized and come to market as -- middle class is growing in some countries that we haven't traditionally thought about as being big [indiscernible] sort of -- and especially consumers of products, we think we're going to have an opportunity to participate in those commercialization strategies. Think about it, World Courier has handled those products, they know the treatment centers, they know the environment.

I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen once again delivered solid quarterly results, and our performance for the first half of our fiscal year 2012 positions us well to meet our objectives for the full year. I",2115,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen once again delivered solid quarterly results, and our performance for the first half of our fiscal year 2012 positions us well to meet our objectives for the full year. In the March quarter, our revenues were up 2% to $20.1 billion. Earnings per share were up 5% to $0.81, and that's on top of a 22% increase in the prior year. 
We generated $236 million in operating cash flow and we repurchased $200 million of our shares. I'm especially proud that we overcame a challenging comp to this quarter, last year, and exceeded our internal profit goals for each business unit. 
During the quarter, we also made excellent progress integrating recent acquisitions and working towards the closing of our World Courier acquisition. Our strong cash generation and high-quality balance sheet continue to provide us with outstanding financial flexibility and give us the ability to fund our strategic initiatives, grow our business and return funds to shareholders. 
AmerisourceBergen is fortunate to be an important part of a growing industry. Demographics and initiatives aimed at expanding access to health care and coverage -- and health care coverage, should continue to drive organic growth in our industry over the next several years. In addition, launches of new pharmaceuticals, as well as new indications for existing drugs should also drive sales growth over the next several years. Whether the new therapies are traditional oral medications or complex biotech pharmaceuticals, AmerisourceBergen is well positioned to not only benefit from the distribution of new products, but also to offer pre-launch and commercialization services to manufacturers and to support patient access and reimbursement programs to help ensure that patients have access to life-saving therapies and that the products achieve their full potential in the marketplace. 
At our verse [ph] revenue base positions us well to benefit from organic growth driven by demographics, and our customer mix puts us in a favorable position to continue to benefit from the historic influx of generics. As you know, generics mitigate the top line dollar growth in our industry but drive tremendous value for wholesalers, health care providers and patients alike. In addition, close scrutiny of health care expenses and cost-containment efforts underway by the federal government and other payers also drives demand for our services, most notably in our Consulting Services group. 
Over the last several years, we have significantly strengthened our relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers, and we continue to look for meaningful ways to provide additional services across the supply channel to help them ensure they meet the challenges of today's changing health care landscape. As our provider customers face similar challenges regarding cost-containment and reimbursement for services provided to patients, they increasingly turn to AmerisourceBergen. We help in making their health care practices run as efficiently and effectively as possible.  
Our provider customers work hard every day to provide world-class patient care, and we believe they deserve fair reimbursement for the professional services they provide. AmerisourceBergen is an active participant participating in policy discussions in Washington, D.C. with the objective of helping legislators understand our industry and our importance to the health care system. 
Our associates are focused on meeting our objectives for the year, both in terms of providing outstanding service to customers and in our financial performance. They continue to seek creative ways to meet the challenges in the diverse markets we serve and identify new opportunities to add value through collaborative innovation and by maximizing efficiency. I take great pride in their enthusiasm and dedication, and it is my honor to work beside them. 
Turning now to our business units. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, as expected, had flat revenue in the quarter as strong performance in the institutional segment was offset by the previously disclosed loss of a large retail customer. Top line growth was also mitigated by the impact of generic convergence, including decreased sales to our largest customer. 
Our ABDC associates did a stellar job this quarter managing several generic launches, including 5 different generic products that launched within one week. Year-to-date, the generic launches have performed as planned and we, of course, look forward to several more launches still to come in the second half of the year. 
With over 4,600 members, our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network, the third largest network of pharmacies in the U.S., continues to play a crucial role in providing pharmacy care nationwide. Patients prefer choice when determining where to fill their prescriptions, and our retail customers are very adept at fulfilling unique patient needs and at adapting to the changing needs of the marketplace. 
Our ASHP implementation continues to run smoothly with 8 distribution centers conversions complete, 2 additional conversions occurring tomorrow, and the remainder planned for the beginning of 2013. As we have gained experience with the new system, particularly with the corporate and back-office functions, we have already begun to realize some operational savings, which is reflected, in part, in the good performance we had on the expense line this quarter. 
Our investments in our Canadian operations to support significant new business wins continued in the March quarter. Our associates have done a tremendous job setting up 4 new distribution centers in 6 months, in order to support this new business. There is still much work to be done, but we are confident that our expansion efforts will meaningfully increase the value we bring to both independent pharmacies and especially providers in the Canadian market.
As we noted in the press release, following the closing of the merger of Express Scripts and Medco in early April, we amended our existing Medco agreement to provide for the contract to end upon the award and implementation of one or more new pharmaceutical distribution agreements for the newly combined business. Express Scripts has issued an RFP for the combined business, and anticipate that the new contract, or contracts, will begin on October 1, 2012. We are participating fully in the competitive RFP process, and we intend to pursue this opportunity to retain or grow the business under a new contract. We have had an excellent working relationship with Medco for over 2 decades, and we are excited about the opportunity to demonstrate the value we can bring to the newly combined entity. 
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group had another strong quarter with revenues up 6% with particularly strong performance in third-party logistics and in our vaccine and physician distribution business. Our oncology business performed well, while facing a very difficult comparison due to the strong performance of the 3 large Besse generic products last year. While our Specialty Group is best known for our oncology franchise, we are an instrumental part of the commercialization strategy for any infusible product launched into the physician marketplace. We continue to execute very well on the launch of a new brand of ophthalmology product establishing significant market share in what was the first full quarter of the introduction. 
Our Specialty Group often collaborates with our Consulting Services group to help ensure patients have access to products by utilizing the full suite of capabilities of our physician networks, as well as our reimbursement and patient support program expertise. For example, we recently helped a manufacturer launch a new biotech product. And during the March quarter, we were able to not only achieve the leading market share for the distribution of the product, but also to provide third-party logistics, contract packaging and all of the reimbursement and patient support programs for the product across the market. We are very proud that these combined service offerings provide unmatched value to manufacturers and distinguish AmerisourceBergen in the marketplace. As we look at the products in development pipelines today, we believe that we will win even more of these opportunities in the future, which will be an important driver of our growth in the years ahead. 
Our Consulting Services group delivered a very strong quarter, while making excellent progress in the integration of TheraCom and Premier Source, which are both performing very well. The last group had the strongest quarter in its history, even without the contributions from TheraCom. While the group only represents about 2% of our revenues, we believe our packaging and consulting services provide essential expertise to pharmaceutical manufacturers to help ensure that their products are brought to market as safely, quickly and efficiently as possible. In addition, our reimbursement expertise helps ensure that patients who can benefit from both new and mature therapies have access to the products. 
We continue to make good progress towards closing our most recent acquisition, World Courier. As we deepen our knowledge and understanding of their business, I am more convinced than ever that World Courier affords us the opportunity, not only to acquire the market leader in premium niche clinical trial logistics services, but also to begin to build out a framework to expand our consulting and commercialization services beyond North America. 
In this current quarter, we will begin operating in 50 new international markets and employ about 1,500 new associates outside North America. This is significant expansion for ABC, and we are tremendously excited about welcoming the World Courier team to ABC. 
In addition, we are exploring ways to potentially expand some of our niche Specialty Distribution services into select markets as well. We expect to close the acquisition next week, at the end of April, and I'm very excited about the potential we see in the World Courier platform in the years ahead. 
Given the continued strength of our balance sheet, we continue to look for acquisitions that meet the criteria we've had in place for quite some time. They should increase our value offering to existing customers both up and down the channel, they should be within our established core competency and they should increase shareholder value. While we have not contemplated any further contribution from acquisitions in our guidance, we continue to be receptive to acquisitions and we continue to be interested in opportunities in pharmaceutical and Specialty Distribution and Services, as well as consulting and packaging services. While we, historically, have been very comfortable in the $200 million to $300 million range, we will consider selling larger, as we did with World Courier, if it made good strategic sense and would deliver value to our company and our shareholders. 
Looking ahead, the results we've had in the first half of our year have positioned us well to meet our objectives for the full fiscal year. We have a difficult comparison to overcome in 2012, but we continue to expect GAAP earnings per share to be within the range of $2.74 to $2.84, and we are tracking towards the midpoint of that range. Tim will provide the details in our assumptions for the remainder of the year, but I want to highlight that we continue to remain disciplined on expenses, our cash flows are strong and we have increased our share repurchase assumption for the year. 
Looking further ahead to 2013, we should have a carryover from some of the launches that occur late in our fiscal 2012, including the relaunch of Oxaliplatin, and we should begin to benefit from the completion of our ASHP implementation. In fiscal 2014, we should begin to see this 30 million to 40 million uninsured patients enter the health care market, driving demand for pharmaceuticals that should carry over into 2015 and beyond. In addition, 2014 and 2015 are expected to be good years for generic conversions. And, of course, there's a chance that biosimilars may also come to market in that time frame. 
Before turn it over to Tim, I want to reiterate the confidence that I have in our business and in our future. Demand is strong for the products we distribute, and we play an essential role in pharmaceutical supply channel. We've positioned ourselves well to continue to benefit from the 2 key growth drivers, generics and specialty products, and we have continued to invest in our distribution and in our services businesses. 
Over the last year, we were summating important investment in other areas of our business with an eye to the future. We expect demand for specialty products to continue to grow, not only the U.S. but throughout the world, and the commercialization and reimbursement support services we provide to manufacturers will help support that growth. As cost containment efforts continue to cross the health care landscape, our customers increasingly turn to us for help in meeting the challenges of the marketplace without sacrificing patient care. Finally, the vision and innovative ideas that our associates bring to market every day set us apart in our industry, and I am proud to be their leader. Here is Tim."

It's my pleasure to be participating in my first earnings call as acting CFO. And I am pleased to report another solid ABC quarter and, most importantly, that our Q2 results are on track with our internal plan. 
The highlights this quarter: excellent top line growth at our Specialty and Consulting businesses; very good execution on new generic launches and continued focus on expense management across the organization; and finally, another quarter of strong cash generation. 
Now let's turn to the quarterly details. And starting with the top line, revenues were $20.1 billion, a 1.6% increase over last year's quarter. Drug company revenues were essentially flat, as we guided. We had strong performance in our alternate site and health system segments, offset by the loss of a large chain customer last year, as well as the impact from brand to generic conversions. 
The Specialty Group revenues increased 6%, led by 2 of our businesses with above market growth. ICS, our third-party logistics business and Besse Medical, our vaccine and physician office distribution business, which benefited from a full quarter impact of sales of a new ophthalmology drug. 
The Consulting group, though small to the overall top line, continues to perform well. Excluding their TheraCom acquisition, they had over 20% top line growth. TheraCom contributed just under 1% of our overall revenue growth in the quarter. 
Moving to gross profit. Gross profit was $695 million in the quarter, up 1.1% from last March, with a gross margin of 3.46% in the quarter, down about 2 basis points from last year. As we have discussed in the past, our second quarter was a very tough comp, due to the significant contribution in the prior year from oncology generics. In the second quarter 2011, these oncology drugs contributed about $0.16 of EPS to our results. Our gross margin expanded 31 basis points in the March 2011 quarter. This year, we are able to effectively offset this headwind with contributions from the new oral solid generics, as well as the lower contribution from oncology generics and gross profit contributions from our acquired companies. 
Additionally, our LIFO charge was approximately $4 million in the quarter, down $10 million from last year. We continue to expect our LIFO charge will be approximately $15 million, down significantly from last year. Our annual LIFO forecast is based on our expectation that brand price inflation will be somewhat less this year. And more importantly, we will see significant generic price deflation in the second half of our fiscal year related to key brand to generic conversions coming off exclusivity. 
Finally, the benefit we received from the new generic launches, and also price appreciation, was in line with our expectations. This quarter, we did an excellent job controlling our operating expenses. Operating expenses were approximately $327 million, up 1.5%. However, this amount includes the operating expenses of about $11 million from our recently acquired companies. Additionally, we had $9 million of executive severance and acquisition-related transaction costs. Operating expenses would've been down, excluding the impact of our acquisitions, due to lower compensation costs, including benefits. 
Additionally, our SAP implementation is progressing well at the corporate level. The system has reached a level of stability faster than we expected, enabling us to realize some early savings, especially with external consultants. 
Last quarter, our guidance was an annual expense increase of about 3%, due to our acquisitions. As an organization, we continue to exercise discipline and focus on managing expenses. We now expect our total operating expenses for our base business, before adding World Courier, to be essentially flat for the year. 
Operating income of $368 million in the quarter increased about 1%, while operating margin was down 2 basis points compared to last March. Our current quarter was slowed by the $9 million of executive severance and acquisition transaction costs. Excluding these nonrecurring expenses, our operating income margin would've expanded 3 basis points to 1.88%. 
Moving below the operating income line, interest expense of nearly $24 million in the March quarter increased 25% compared to last year, primarily as a result of our $500 million bonds we issued back in November. The proceeds help to fund the TheraCom acquisition and will also contribute to the retirement of our 2012 bonds that mature in mid-September. Our effective income tax rate of 38.4% was slightly higher than last year's 38.1% and is right in line with our expected annualized rate of 38.4%. 
Our diluted GAAP earnings per share in the quarter of $0.81 increased by $0.04, or 5%, over the same quarter last year. And again, overcoming a $0.16 headwind from the contribution from specialty generics in the March 2011 quarter. Our EPS benefited from a reduction in our average diluted shares related to our ongoing share repurchase program. Average diluted shares for the quarter were approximately 262 million, down just over 6% from last March. 
Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flows, where trends continue to be very favorable. We generated $236 million of cash from operations in the quarter, bringing our 6-month total to $668 million, compared to generating $577 million for the first 6 months last year. We continue to manage AR and inventory levels very closely, and this has benefited our working capital this year. With our daily revenue volume exceeding $300 million per business day, our quarter-end working capital snapshots are subject to volatility. Therefore, our 6-month cash results cannot be extrapolated to determine a full year cash flow estimate. 
Capital expenditures were $40 million in the quarter and $88 million for the 6 months. During the last 2 years, we put a number of capital projects on hold as we focused on SAP. We have a pipeline of attractive internal projects that we have begun to pursue as our SAP deployment moves along. 
Additionally, we have CapEx associated with our recent TheraCom acquisition. Because of this, we will exceed our previous target of $150 million for CapEx, and we will be closer to $200 million for the year. Even with this additional CapEx, we expect that our free cash flow will now be in the $800 million to $900 million range. 
During the quarter, we bought back $200 million of our shares. For 6 months, we've purchased $320 million of shares. At March 31, we have approximately $180 million left on our current share repurchase authorization. In terms of key financial metrics that we track, our average day sales in inventory for the quarter remained at 14 days, consistent with fiscal '11. Average DSOs of 18 days in the March quarter were up slightly from 17.3 days last year. And favorable payables timing helped raise average quarterly DPOs by over 3 days compared to fiscal '11. 
With our recent debt offering, our gross debt, the total debt and capital ratio, at the end of March, was 39%, above our target range of 30% to 35%. And it will remain above the range until we pay off our $400 million of debt in September. Our cash balance at March 31 was $2.3 billion. Keep in mind that we will be funding our World Courier acquisition from cash and we will be paying down debt in September, as previously mentioned. After these 2 large cash outlays, we will still have financial flexibility to fund CapEx and strategic initiatives and return to capital -- and return capital to our shareholders. 
Now let's turn to updated fiscal 2012 guidance. We expect our diluted GAAP EPS to track to the middle of the range we previously provided, $2.74 to $2.84. Our assumption for revenue growth remains unchanged, flat-to-modest revenue growth. We expect our operating margin expansion to be in the high-single-digit basis points. Free cash flow will now be in the $800 million to $900 million range. And we are raising our guidance for share repurchases for the year to $500 million, which will complete our current share repurchase authorization. 
Looking ahead, I would like to remind everyone that Q3 is another challenging comparison for us because of the $0.17 EPS contribution from oncology generics last year. Also in Q3 2012, we have 2 of the large generics coming off exclusivity. When looking out to the second half of the year, we believe Q4 will be somewhat of an easier comparison. With the return of Oxaliplatin for half a quarter, a few favorable year-end generic launches for the Drug Company and favorable expense comparisons year-over-year. 
So before I turn it back to Barbara, let me reiterate, that 6 months into the fiscal year, we are performing well in our key areas of the business, and we are well positioned to meet our financial targets for fiscal 2012. 
One final point, I'd like to take a moment and thank our ABC associates, especially those in the finance and accounting areas that have stepped up the last 2 months and helped support the organization and me, in particular, during our CFO transition period. Thanks, everyone. Here's Barbara to start our Q&A."

First of all, again, we do $300 million in revenue a day, as ABC, but one of the things we've been very, very happy with is our specialty performance in Canada. This is -- this market works differently than it does in the U.S., but we've been able to do some joint programs, we've been able to help with a more complex reimbursement environment there, including a pretty robust product market that we -- that is not generally known. At least here, in the U.S., we think about it as single-payer market, that hasn't been the case. We've been able to help, we have a very strong presence with new infusible drugs. So what we've seen is a manufacturer environment that ABC is very comfortable in contracting with, that is looking for us to get into more countries. So we've been prompted to look at international opportunities by manufacturers. Then comes World Courier, we're in 50 new countries as of next week, hopefully. We have 1,500 associates that are very tenured. We've been extremely impressed with the quality of the World Courier associates. As you know, health care is very local. So we think that we have an opportunity to understand health care markets, both organic and acquisitive opportunities, with people on the ground there who speak the language and know the trends, know who's the right players, the ethical players, the high quality players in that environment. And we think that, that's going to give us a good opportunity. We also think that as the products that World Courier is managing are commercialized, as more and more of those products are commercialized and come to market as -- middle class is growing in some countries that we haven't traditionally thought about as being big [indiscernible] sort of -- and especially consumers of products, we think we're going to have an opportunity to participate in those commercialization strategies. Think about it, World Courier has handled those products, they know the treatment centers, they know the environment. So we think that we have to recharacterize part of the business, but we think we can do that, so long answer, but as you can tell, I'm very enthusiastic about this."

I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen once again overcame a challenging year-over-year comparison and delivered solid quarterly results. In the June quarter, our revenues were down 2% to $19.8 billio",2115,"Thank you, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen once again overcame a challenging year-over-year comparison and delivered solid quarterly results. In the June quarter, our revenues were down 2% to $19.8 billion, but our GAAP earnings per share were up 8% to $0.71. We made excellent progress integrating recent acquisitions including World Courier, which closed in early May. Our strong cash generation and high-quality balance sheet continue to provide us with an outstanding financial flexibility and give us the ability to fund our strategic initiatives, grow our business, and return funds to shareholders. Through the 9 months we are well positioned to meet objectives for the full year. 
Our diverse revenue base continues to position us well to benefit from organic growth across the entire spectrum of pharmaceutical care and our customer mix helps drive benefits from the historic influx of generics. Even as generics mitigate the top line dollar growth in our industry, IMS' healthy compounded sales growth in the U.S. in the range of 1% to 4%, and 4% to 6% worldwide through 2016. In addition, continued scrutiny of health care expenses and cost-containment efforts underway by the U.S. Federal government and commercial payers, demand continues improvement in efficiency, productivity and effectiveness across all aspects of health care. 
One of the hallmarks of the U.S. market in particular is the quality of the relationship wholesalers have with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Over the last several years, AmerisourceBergen has significantly strengthened our relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers and we continue to put an emphasis on looking for meaningful ways to provide additional services across the supply channel in order to help manufacture and meet the challenges of today's changing health care landscape. This is the strategic rationale for the material acquisitions we have made in the past 12 months. As we sit here today, we believe that both the TheraCom and World Courier acquisitions have significantly enhanced our spectrum of services at the supply channel. Moreover, they have brought a array of valuable new customers, employees and capabilities which have exceeded our pre-closing expectations. 
As our provided customer face similar challenges regarding cost containment and reimbursement for services provided to patients and new challenges such as accountable care organization, they also increasingly turn to AmerisourceBergen for help in making their health care practices run as efficiently and effectively as possible. Our provided customers deliver world-class patient care on navigating a complex wave of reimbursement. And we believe they deserve fair compensation for the professional services they provide. AmerisourceBergen continues to be an active participant in policy discussions in Washington with the objective of helping legislators understand our industry and our importance to the health care system. 
AmerisourceBergen associates remain focus on meeting objectives for the year both in terms of our financial performance and in delivering outstanding service to our customers. I take great pride in the enthusiasm and dedication of our team and I'm honored to work beside them everyday. They meet challenges with creativity and determination and they tirelessly seek new ways to meet the need of the diverse markets we serve through collaborative innovation and by maximizing efficiency. 
As we noted in our press release, we believe it was prudent to separate our manufacture services business from pharmaceuticals distribution for financial reporting purposes. We believe that disclosing this additional level of detail will increase and best understanding of our business and further improve the overall transparency of our financial reporting. Tim will cover the financials for the 2 segments, and I will now cover some of the key trends in our business units during the quarter. 
AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation revenue declined 5% due in large part to a decline in sales to our largest customer, as well as the previously reported loss of a large retail customer beginning last September. In addition, we anniversaried last years' addition of a new alternate customers in May, and top line growth continues to be mitigated the impact of generic conversions. Year-to-date, the drug company revenues are only down slightly as anticipated. Over the course of the year, the wave of generic launches has progressed as planned and the Drug Company saw significant gross margin expansion in the quarter even as in the 2 largest generics of Zyprexa and Lipitor came off exclusivity. We look forward to a few more launches still to come in our fourth quarter. 
Back in June, we held our annual tradeshow for our independent retail customers and we continue to be impressed with their resilience and their ingenuity in providing personalized patient care in the community they serve. Our Good Neighbor Pharmacy members participate actively in the largest independent network of community pharmacies in the U.S. AmerisourceBergen and our independent customers strongly believe that they play a critical role in health care throughout the country by offering a compelling value proposition to patients and payers alike. ABDC is focused on ensuring that our network, Good Neighbor Pharmacy, remains dynamic by continuous investment in programs and services to meet the challenges of community pharmacy today and in the future. The implementation of our SAP platform continues on schedule with 14 distribution center conversions complete representing over half of our distribution centers and 2/3 of our revenues. We've made excellent progress and we expect additional conversions occurring in our fourth quarter and the remainder plan through the beginning of the fiscal year 2013. 
We also continue to strengthen our Canadian operations in support of previously reported the business wins in that market. We are confident that these and other investments will meaningfully increase the value we bring to all of our customers in the U.S. and Canada. 
As were noted in the press release, we continue to participate in negotiations for the distribution contract to serve the newly combined business of Express Scripts and a former Medco. We believe we are nearing the end of the process and while we don't have the from date for an announcement, we do hope that the decision will be made within the next few weeks. We continue to be optimistic about our chances to win the business. However, it is a competitive process and we believe Express Scripts will ultimately choose the partner that they believe provides the best overall value. 
AmerisourceBergen's Specialty Group had another strong quarter with revenues up 8% driven by another particularly strong performance in third-party logistics and in our vaccine and physician distribution business. Our oncology business performed well, while facing another very difficult comparison due to the strong performance of the 3 large Specialty generic products in the June quarter last year. The comparison would ease in the September quarter as Oxaliplatin returns to the market. ABSG continues to benefit from the launch of a branded ophthalmology product earlier this year, continuing to help establish significant market share for the manufacturers. I experienced their product demonstrates the potent value of our Specialty franchise. While our undisputed strength in specialty is oncology business, we have expanded those capabilities to become an instrumental part of the commercialization strategy for any infusible product launched into the physician marketplace. As I previously discussed, we now have a keen interest going forward in further expanding those capabilities into select global markets. The acquisition of World Courier has given us not only a premium quality clinical trial logistics services provider, but also an international framework upon which to further capitalize on our strengths by driving our specialty logistics, consulting, commercialization and reimbursement services into other geographic markets. The integration of World Courier is going very well and we are very excited about the new insights and opportunities that are being discovered as we bring these 2 great organizations together and gain operational exposure to international markets. 
Our Consulting Services group continues to have a strong year as demand for commercialization, reimbursement and patient support services continues to be robust. We believe these combined services offerings distinguish AmerisourceBergen in the marketplace, provide unmatched value to manufacturers and begun important driver of our growth going forward. As manufacturers seek to bring new products to market or expand sales of existing products in a challenging health care environment, we believe that demand for the services would only increase. 
In terms of financial performance, the Consulting Services group delivered a solid quarter while making excellent progress into the further integration of TheraCom, which is performing very well. Even setting aside the contribution from TheraCom, the last group alone had outstanding results. As Tim will detail, the solid performance across our business contributed to excellent cash flow in the quarter. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we continue to explore opportunities to deploy our capital in order to increase shareholder value, including searching for acquisitions that meet the criteria we have in place for quite some time. They should increase our value offering to existing customers both up and down the channel. They should be within our established core competency and that should increase shareholder value. While we have not contemplated any further contribution from acquisitions in our guidance, we continue to be receptive to acquisitions and we continue to be investing and pharmaceutical and the specialty distribution services, as well as consulting services. We also remain committed to returning a minimum of 30% of our free cash flow disorders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. A hurdle that we have exceeded over the last several years. 
Looking ahead, the results we've had in the first 9 months of our fiscal year put us well on our way to meeting our objectives for the full fiscal year. As we stated in our press release, we have narrowed the range of our diluted EPS expectations for the full year to $2.80 to $2.84. Tim will provide the details on our assumptions for the remainder of the year, but I want to highlight that as a result of that tremendous financial flexibility, we have repurchased $540 million of our shares in the year when we spent over $800 million in acquisitions and we'll pay down about $400 million in debt in September. This speaks to the enormous strength and resilience of our business in a year of significant change for AmerisourceBergen, and indeed for the health care industry more broadly, as well as the quality of our financial planning and financial stewardship. 
As you know, we are deeply engaged in our business planning process for our fiscal 2013 and we do not yet know the future status of the business we do with our largest customer. As we noted in our press release, however, we do expect that new generic launches in both ABDC and ABSG, as well as contributions from our recent acquisitions and other favorable items will help drive earnings growth next fiscal year. They impact of customer consolidation and competitive market dynamics on our margins is expected to offset some of that growth. As our provided customers across the health landscape prepare for the full implementation of the federal government's health-care reform initiatives, we are being challenged to help find ways to reduce cost. Across the industry, big customers are getting bigger, whether they are mail order networks or independents seeking greater strength in number through joining buying groups. Over the longer term this has lead to even more stable and resilient industry. Of course, we will continue to manage our own expenses and working capital. In addition, the strength of our balance sheet afford us additional opportunity to drive shareholder value through acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. With all that in mind, our preliminary expectation is for high single digits to low double-digit diluted EPS growth in fiscal 2013. 
Over the last year, we made important investments in our business with an eye to the future while we continued to focus on helping our customers and ourselves take advantage of the unprecedented growth in generics and the many opportunities in Specialty. Demand is strong and growing for the core products we distribute and we play a essential role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, ensuring the integrity and security of the distribution of life improving and life-saving therapies. Our manufacturing services help market as efficiently as possible and that patients have access to both traditional medications and the most innovative and complex products. As cost-containment efforts mount across the health care spectrum, our customers increasingly turn to us to help to meet the challenges of the marketplace without sacrificing patient care. I take great pride in the energy and creativity our associates bring to our business. Each day I see the results of their innovative thinking and their dedication to exceeding customer expectations and I'm proud to be their leader. Here is Tim."
24809,212451049,331558,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. As you just heard, ABC delivered a solid quarter and through 9 months, our performance is tracking well to our financial targets. The key highlights this quarter was our ability to overcome the oncology generic h",1723,"Thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. As you just heard, ABC delivered a solid quarter and through 9 months, our performance is tracking well to our financial targets. The key highlights this quarter was our ability to overcome the oncology generic headwind the mentioned in the past. Going into this fiscal year, we knew that Q3 would be our toughest EPS comparison. We had consistently called out a $0.33 headwind this year from Specialty generics. Of this headwind, we anticipated about half of the $0.33 would negatively impact the third quarter. We're pleased that we are able to successfully overcome this Q3 headwind and show solid EPS growth. 
Two other highlights for the quarter. We continued our discipline in terms of managing expenses across the organization and we integrated World Courier into ABC reporting. Our results include 2 months of their operations. 
Before I start with the quarterly financial details, let me highlight that in our press release, we have expanded our disclosures to include detail for 2 reporting segments in addition to our ABC consolidated results. The pharmaceutical distribution segment includes our drug and Specialty Group operating segments. The Other segment includes our manufacturer services businesses, which consists of the consulting and World Courier operating segments. Upon review of the financial reporting requirements, we determined that there was a need to separate drug distribution and manufacturer services due to the nature of their business operations and different revenue growth rates and operating margins. The disclosure of our 2 reporting segments will improve investor transparency going forward. 
Now back to the quarterly details. I'll cover ABC consolidated results first. Starting with the top line, revenues were $19.8 billion, a 1 .9% decrease over last year's quarter. Drug Company revenues were down about 5%, offset by higher specialty revenues of nearly 8%. We also had the benefit in our June '12 revenues from 2 of our acquisitions, TheraCom and World Courier. They contributed a combined $300 million of new revenues in the current quarter. 
Moving along, gross profit was $689 million in the quarter, up 5.4% from last June with the gross margin of 3.49%. Just to remind everyone, World Courier is included in our financial results and they have a fairly high gross profit margin due to their best-in-class service model. World Courier and our other acquisitions contributed nearly $60 million to our gross profit in the current quarter. 
Our LIFO charge was $4.7 million in the quarter, down $6.7 million from last year. We expect the LIFO charge of between $12 million and $15 million for the full year, down significantly from last year. Finally, the generic benefit we received in the current June quarter from new generic launches and price appreciation was in line with our expectations. Let's move to operating expenses. 
This quarter, operating expenses were $375 million, up 11.6%. But this amount includes approximately $50 million of operating expenses related to our recent acquisitions, as well as approximately $5 million of non-recurring charges related to the World Courier transaction. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, our operating expenses would have decreased about $10 million quarter-over-quarter. Our businesses continue to do an excellent job at managing their expenses. 
Operating income of $314 million in the quarter decreased about 1%, while operating margin was up by 2 basis points compared to last June. Our third quarter was slowed by the World Courier transaction cost. And more importantly, the difficult comparison versus the prior year. 
Moving below the operating income line and other income, we had income of $4.8 million primarily related to an increase in evaluation of a note that was due to ABC from the October 2008 sale of our prior PMIS business. Interest expense of approximately $25 million in the June quarter increased 33% compared to last year. As a result of our $500 million senior notes that we issued back in November. Our effective income tax rate of 38.3% was slightly higher than last year's 38.2%, and is in line with our expected annualized rate of 38.4%. 
Our GAAP diluted earnings per share in the quarter of $0.71 increased by $0.05 or just under 8%, over the last quarter -- over the same quarter last year. Our EPS benefited from a reduction in our average diluted shares outstanding due to our ongoing share repurchase programs. Average diluted shares for the quarter were approximately $256 million, down just over 8% from last June. At June 30, 2012, we have 251 million outstanding shares. 
Let's take a few minutes discussing our some results for the June quarter. Starting with pharmaceutical distribution, total revenues were $19.4 billion, down about 3.3% over last year's quarter. Drug Company revenues were down about 5% due primarily to lower sales with former Medco, and the impact from the loss of a large chain customer last year to former Longs Drugs. Slightly over half of the decline came from lower sales to former Medco driven by generic conversions and changes in their book of business. Without these 2 negative impacts, our drug business would have had growth of 2%. Also during the quarter, the Drug Company anniversaried a large customer win from the prior June quarter. 
Specialty Group's revenue increased nearly 8% led by strong performance in 2 of its businesses with growth significantly above market rates. ICS, our third party logistics business, and Besse Medical, our vaccine and physician office distribution business. From a segment standpoint, gross profit if decreased about $25 million and our gross profit margins slipped somewhat. Most of the dollar decrease is due to the oncology generics headwind, a high-margin contributor last June quarter offset by the contribution from generic Lipitor and Zyprexa, both of exclusivity periods end during the June '12 quarter. We did have other generic launches during the quarter and also gross profit contributions from our specialty businesses. These positives were offset by the decrease in our revenues and margin pressure. It should be noted that Drug Company is viewed on its own had gross profit margin expansion of 20 basis points in the June 2012 quarter. This segment managed operating expenses very effectively especially payroll and benefit expenses, as well as external consulting expenses which enabled us to offset some of the gross profit dollars we lost with the oncology generic headwind. Overall, we're very pleased with the operating results for this segment. 
Moving to the other reporting segment, which again is consulting which includes our packaging business and World Courier. As mentioned previously, our 2 large acquisitions accounted for nearly $300 million of new revenues in the third quarter. World Courier revenues are tracking well against our expectations, which we provided back in our press release that announced the acquisition. Operating income from the Other segment increased $11 million from last year's quarter. Of this increase, about $8 million is related to our fiscal '12 acquisitions. The remaining increase is related to our legacy businesses. I'd like to highlight that our non-recurring charge of about $5 million is not included in our segment level reporting. For the June quarter, the impact of our World Courier acquisition was essentially breakeven due to the transaction costs. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated balance sheet and cash flows where trends continue to be favorable. We generated $92 million of cash from operations in the quarter, bringing our 9 month's total to $760 million. Our businesses continue to focus on working capital. In fact, our cash conversion cycle based on a rolling 4-quarter average improved by 1 day to 1.7 days based in the current June quarter, from 2.7 days in the June 2011 quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $39 million in the quarter and $128 million for the 9 months. For the full year, we are still tracking to our guidance for CapEx of $200 million. During the quarter, we bought back $186 million of our shares. For the 9 months, we purchased $514 million of shares and is slightly exceeds our March quarter guidance of $500 million. At June 30, we have $744 million left on our May 2012 share repurchase authorization. 
Our cash balance at June 30 was $1.7 billion. As we have discussed in the past, we need approximately $500 million in available cash to account for swings in working capital and to run the business. As a reminder, in mid-September, we will be using cash to retire our $400 million 5 5/8 notes. 
Now let's turn to updated fiscal 2012 guidance. We now expect our GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.80 to $2.84. This includes an estimated $20 million of non-recurring cost related primarily to transaction and severance expenses. With narrowing our EPS range, this means that we will have EPS growth of 10% to 12% this year after absorbing the $0.05 negative impact from non-recurring charges. 
Revenue. We continue to expect revenue growth to be flat or up modestly for the full year. We expect our operating margin expansion to be in the high single digits. As previously communicated, Q4 is our easiest operating income comparable for the year. Because of this, we expect most of our operating margin expansion to be achieved in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow is still tracking to finish in the $800 million to $900 million range. 
Looking ahead. We are deeply engaged in our business planning process for fiscal 2013 and are still many moving parts including, of course, the Express Scripts RFP. As Steve outlined, as large customers consolidate they are seeking better pricing which includes generic pricing. And as recent contract discussions have demonstrated, our customers want us to be part of a solution in helping them meet the economic demands of a new health care landscape. Our highs double-digit to low double-digit EPS growth great is based on the assumptions on several moving parts, and includes possible outcomes on the Express Scripts contract. Our EPS range is preliminary and we still have quite a bit of work to complete in our planning process. But it does incorporate the best information we have right now. So before I turn it back to Barbara, let me reiterate that 9 months into our fiscal year, we are well positioned to meet our financial targets for fiscal '12 and we are hard at work on our fiscal '13 plan. Here is Barbara to start our Q&A."

I've been with the company 8.5 years before the Medco. But it's very little expense. In fact, many of the characteristics of this business are what we used to call dock to dock to business. Of course, you remember that very well. There's not too much expense there. And coincidently, a lot of the facilities that we are service to Medco or our most highly efficient modern facilities, but we absolutely have opportunities to cut down our cost and like I've said, this current thinking, while it's early, really contemplates all the way from us entirely losing this business to winning it including winning the part that we currently do not service based on our base understanding of what the economic can be.

As you know, we believe we have the most diverse customer base. In this really, but driven by this generic wave and we have set out our will portfolio in both drug and specialty to really recognize the strength in generics. Hope you would buy some day and health recapitalized the opportunity that we have for generics and specialty. The sell side, I think, the biggest thing we can point to you is somewhat of an anxiety of compressed reimbursement. And just a lot of consolidation. I mean, read the headline, is not just the particular one, it's on everyone's mind. There's just that there's a lot of consolidation. We have community oncologists, for example, that are constantly getting a lot bigger and our bigger customers get a better deal. We have independent customers joining buying groups. So these are the biggest trends that I can point to. And, of course, there's a lot of marquee customers up for bid.

We're also doing more business within the health systems on generics, which is a great trend for us given our health systems presence. We also as you know we never use to talk about generics and specialty we talk about a lot. So there are a lot of very good trends for us in generics. But another trend is obviously our large PVM customer doesn't really buy any significant generics from us, which we've talked a lot about. And the larger customers, a lot of them say -- and we're doing our last round of contract negotiations there may be buying 4% to 7% of their purchases, when generics are now it's a lot higher. And those customers are getting bigger. And we have to share more of the economics of generics with them because it's a much bigger part, they're much higher profile product category to them. So those are some of the trends that we've been pointing out.

I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen once again overcame a challenging year-over-year comparison and delivered solid quarterly results. In the June quarter, our revenues were down 2% to $19.8 billio",2131,"Thank you, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen once again overcame a challenging year-over-year comparison and delivered solid quarterly results. In the June quarter, our revenues were down 2% to $19.8 billion, but our GAAP earnings per share were up 8% to $0.71. We made excellent progress integrating recent acquisitions including World Courier, which closed in early May. Our strong cash generation and high-quality balance sheet continue to provide us with outstanding financial flexibility, and give us the ability to fund our strategic initiatives, grow our business and return funds to shareholders. Through 9 months, we are well positioned to meet objectives for the full year. 
Our diverse revenue base continues to position us well to benefit from organic growth across the entire spectrum of pharmaceutical care, and our customer mix helps drive benefits from the historic influx of generics. Even as generics mitigate the top line dollar growth in our industry, IMS Health's compounded annual sales growth in the U.S. in the range of 1% to 4%, and 4% to 6% worldwide through 2016. In addition, continued scrutiny of health care expenses and cost-containment efforts underway by the U.S. Federal government and commercial payers demand continues improvement in efficiency, productivity and effectiveness across all aspects of health care. 
One of the hallmarks of the U.S. market in particular is the quality of the relationship wholesalers have with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Over the last several years, AmerisourceBergen has significantly strengthened our relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers, and we continue to put an emphasis on looking for meaningful ways to provide additional services across the supply channel in order to help manufacturers meet the challenges of today's changing health care landscape. This is the strategic rationale for the material acquisitions we have made in the past 12 months. As we sit here today, we believe that both the TheraCom and World Courier acquisitions have significantly enhanced our spectrum of services at the supply channel. Moreover, they have brought a cadre of valuable new customers, employees and capabilities, which have exceeded our pre-closing expectations. 
As our provider customers face similar challenges regarding cost containment and reimbursement for services provided to patients and new challenges such as accountable care organization, they also increasingly turn to AmerisourceBergen for help in making their health care practices run as efficiently and effectively as possible. Our provided customers deliver world-class patient care on navigating a complex wave of reimbursement. And we believe they deserve fair compensation for the professional services they provide. AmerisourceBergen continues to be an active participant in policy discussions in Washington with the objective of helping legislators understand our industry and our importance to the health care system. 
AmerisourceBergen associates remain focus on meeting objectives for the year both in terms of our financial performance and in delivering outstanding service to our customers. I take great pride in the enthusiasm and dedication of our team, and I'm honored to work besides them everyday. They meet challenges with creativity and determination, and they tirelessly seek new ways to meet the needs of the diverse markets we serve through collaborative innovation and by maximizing efficiency. 
As we noted in our press release, we believe it was prudent to separate our manufacture services business from pharmaceutical distribution for financial reporting purposes. We believe that disclosing this additional level of detail will increase investor understanding of our business and further improve the overall transparency of our financial reporting. Tim will cover the financials for the 2 segments, and I will now cover some of the key trends in our business units during the quarter. 
AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation revenue declined 5% due in large part to a decline in sales to our largest customer, as well as the previously reported loss of a large retail customer beginning last September. In addition, we anniversaried last year's addition of a new alternate site customer in May, and top line growth continues to be mitigated by the impact of generic conversions. Year-to-date, the drug company revenues are only down slightly as anticipated. Over the course of the year, the wave of generic launches has progressed as planned and the Drug Company saw significant gross margin expansion in the quarter even as the 2 largest generics of Zyprexa and Lipitor came off exclusivity. We look forward to a few more launches still to come in our fourth quarter. 
Back in June, we held our annual trade show for our independent retail customers and we continued to be impressed with their resilience and their ingenuity in providing personalized patient care in the committee -- community they serve. Our Good Neighbor Pharmacy members participate actively in the largest independent network of community pharmacies in the U.S. AmerisourceBergen and our independent customers strongly believe that they play a critical role in health care throughout the country by offering a compelling value proposition to patients and payers alike. ABDC is focused on ensuring that our network, Good Neighbor Pharmacy, remains dynamic by continuous investment in programs and services to meet the challenges of community pharmacy today and in the future. The implementation of our SAP platform continues on schedule with 14 distribution center conversions complete, representing over half of our distribution centers and 2/3 of our revenues. We've made excellent progress and we expect additional conversions occurring in our fourth quarter and the remainder planned through the beginning of fiscal year 2013. 
We also continue to strengthen our Canadian operations in support of previously reported new business wins in that market. We are confident that these and other investments will meaningfully increase the value we bring to all of our customers in the U.S. and Canada. 
As we noted in the press release, we continue to participate in negotiations for the distribution contract to serve the newly combined business of Express Scripts and the former Medco. We believe we are nearing the end of the process, and while we don't have a firm date for an announcement, we do hope that the decision will be made within the next few weeks. We continue to be optimistic about our chances to win the business. However, it is a competitive process and we believe Express Scripts will ultimately choose a partner that they believe provides the best overall value. 
AmerisourceBergen's Specialty Group had another strong quarter with revenues up 8%, driven by another particularly strong performance in third-party logistics and in our vaccine and physician distribution business. Our Oncology business performed well, while facing another very difficult comparison due to the strong performance of the 3 large Specialty generic products in the June quarter last year. The comparison will ease in the September quarter as Oxaliplatin returns to the market. ABSG continues to benefit from the launch of a branded ophthalmology product earlier this year, continuing to help establish significant market share for the manufacturers. Our experience with their product demonstrates the potent value of our Specialty franchise. While our undisputed strength in Specialty is Oncology business, we have expanded those capabilities to become an instrumental part of the commercialization strategy for any infusible product launched into the physician marketplace. As I previously discussed, we now have a keen interest going forward in further expanding those capabilities into select global markets. The acquisition of World Courier has given us not only a premium quality clinical trial logistics services provider, but also an international framework upon which to further capitalize on our strengths by driving our specialty logistics, consulting, commercialization and reimbursement services into other geographic markets. The integration of World Courier is going very well and we are very excited about the new insights and opportunities that are being discovered as we bring these 2 great organizations together and gain operational exposure to international markets. 
Our Consulting Services group continues to have a strong year as demand for commercialization, reimbursement and patient support services continues to be robust. We believe these combined services offerings distinguish AmerisourceBergen in the marketplace, provide unmatched value to manufacturers and will be an important driver of our growth going forward. As manufacturers seek to bring new products to market or expand sales of existing products in a challenging health care environment, we believe that demand for these services will only increase. 
In terms of financial performance, the Consulting Services group delivered a solid quarter while making excellent progress in the further integration of TheraCom, which is performing well. Even setting aside the contribution from TheraCom, the Lash Group alone had outstanding results. As Tim will detail, the solid performance across our business contributed to excellent cash flow in the quarter. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we continue to explore opportunities to deploy our capital in order to increase shareholder value, including searching for acquisitions that meet the criteria we have in place for quite some time. They should increase our value offering to existing customers, both up and down the channel. They should be within our established core competency and they should increase shareholder value. While we have not contemplated any further contribution from acquisitions in our guidance, we continue to be receptive to acquisitions and we continue to be interested in opportunities in pharmaceutical and specialty distribution and services, as well as consulting services. We also remain committed to returning a minimum of 30% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, a hurdle that we have handily exceeded over the last several years. 
Looking ahead, the results we've had in the first 9 months of our fiscal year put us well on our way to meeting our objectives for the full fiscal year. As we stated in our press release, we have narrowed the range of our diluted EPS expectations for the full year to $2.80 to $2.84. Tim will provide the details on our assumptions for the remainder of the year, but I want to highlight that as a result of that tremendous financial flexibility, we have repurchased $540 million of our shares in the year when we spent over $800 million on acquisitions, and we'll pay down about $400 million in debt in September. This speaks to the enormous strength and resilience of our business in a year of significant change for AmerisourceBergen, and indeed for the health care industry more broadly, as well as the quality of our financial planning and financial stewardship. 
As you know, we are deeply engaged in our business planning process for our fiscal 2013, and we do not yet know the future status of the business we do with our largest customer. As we noted in our press release, however, we do expect that new generic launches in both ABDC and ABSG, as well as contributions from our recent acquisitions and other favorable items will help drive earnings growth next fiscal year. The impact of customer consolidation and competitive market dynamics on our margins is expected to offset some of that growth. As our provider customers across the health landscape prepare for the full implementation of the federal government's health care reform initiatives, we are being challenged to help find new ways to reduce costs. Across the industry, big customers are getting bigger, whether they are mail order pharmacies, acute care networks or independents seeking greater strength in number through joining buying groups. Over the longer term, this has lead to an even more stable and resilient industry. Of course, we will continue to manage our own expenses and working capital. In addition, the strength of our balance sheet affords us additional opportunities to drive shareholder value through acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. With all that in mind, our preliminary expectation is for high single digits to low double-digit diluted EPS growth in fiscal 2013. 
Over the last year, we made important investments in our business with an eye to the future while we continued to focus on helping our customers and ourselves take advantage of the unprecedented growth in generics and the many opportunities in Specialty. Demand is strong and growing for the core products we distribute, and we play an essential role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, ensuring the integrity and security of the distribution of life-improving and life-saving therapies. Our manufacture services businesses help ensure products get to market as efficiently as possible and that patients have access to both traditional medications and the most innovative and complex products. As cost-containment efforts mount across the health care spectrum, our customers increasingly turn to us for help in meeting the challenges of the marketplace without sacrificing patient care. I take great pride in the energy and creativity our associates bring to our business. Each day, I see the results of their innovative thinking and their dedication to exceeding customer expectations, and I'm proud to be their leader. Here is Tim."

As you just heard, ABC delivered a solid quarter and through 9 months, our performance is tracking well to our financial targets. The key highlight this quarter was our ability to overcome the oncology generic he",1725,"Thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. As you just heard, ABC delivered a solid quarter and through 9 months, our performance is tracking well to our financial targets. The key highlight this quarter was our ability to overcome the oncology generic headwind we've mentioned in the past. Going into this fiscal year, we knew that Q3 would be our toughest EPS comparison. We consistently called out a $0.33 headwind this year from Specialty generics. Of this headwind, we anticipated about half of the $0.33 would negatively impact the third quarter. We're pleased that we are able to successfully overcome this Q3 headwind and show solid EPS growth. 
Two other highlights for the quarter. We continued our discipline in terms of managing expenses across the organization and we integrated World Courier into ABC reporting. Our results include 2 months of their operations. 
Before I start with the quarterly financial details, let me highlight that in our press release, we expanded our disclosures to include detail for 2 reporting segments in addition to our ABC consolidated results. The Pharmaceutical Distribution segment includes our Drug and Specialty Group operating segments. The Other segment includes our manufacturer and services businesses, which consists of the Consulting and World Courier operating segments. Upon review of the financial reporting requirements, we determined that there was a need to separate drug distribution and manufacturer services due to the nature of their business operations and different revenue growth rates and operating margins. The disclosure of our 2 reporting segments will improve investor transparency going forward. 
Now back to the quarterly details. I'll cover ABC consolidated results first. Starting with the top line, revenues were $19.8 billion, a 1 .9% decrease over last year's quarter. Drug Company revenues were down about 5%, offset by higher Specialty revenues of nearly 8%. We also had the benefit in our June '12 revenues from 2 of our acquisitions, TheraCom and World Courier. They contributed a combined $300 million of new revenues in the current quarter. 
Moving along, gross profit was $689 million in the quarter, up 5.4% from last June with a gross margin of 3.49%. Just to remind everyone, World Courier is included in our financial results and they have a fairly high gross profit margin due to their best-in-class service model. World Courier and our other acquisitions contributed nearly $60 million to our gross profit in the current quarter. 
Our LIFO charge was $4.7 million in the quarter, down $6.7 million from last year. We expect a LIFO charge of between $12 million and $15 million for the full year, down significantly from last year. Finally, the generic benefit we received in the current June quarter from new generic launches and price appreciation was in line with our expectations. Let's move to operating expenses. 
This quarter, operating expenses were $375 million, up 11.6%. But this amount includes approximately $50 million of operating expenses related to our recent acquisitions, as well as approximately $5 million of non-recurring charges related to the World Courier transaction. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, our operating expenses would have decreased about $10 million quarter-over-quarter. Our businesses continue to do an excellent job at managing their expenses. 
Operating income of $314 million in the quarter decreased about 1%, while operating margin was up by 2 basis points compared to last June. Our third quarter was slowed by the World Courier transaction cost, and more importantly, the difficult comparison versus the prior year. 
Moving below the operating income line and other income, we had income of $4.8 million primarily related to an increase in evaluation of a note that was due to ABC from the October 2008 sale of our prior PMSI business. Interest expense of approximately $25 million in the June quarter increased 33% compared to last year as a result of our $500 million senior notes that we issued back in November. Our effective income tax rate of 38.3% was slightly higher than last year's 38.2% and is in line with our expected annualized rate of 38.4%. 
Our GAAP diluted earnings per share in the quarter of $0.71 increased by $0.05 or just under 8% over the last quarter -- over the same quarter last year. Our EPS benefited from a reduction in our average diluted shares outstanding due to our ongoing share repurchase programs. Average diluted shares for the quarter were approximately $256 million, down just over 8% from last June. At June 30, 2012, we had 251 million outstanding shares. 
Let's spend a few minutes discussing our segment results for the June quarter. Starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution, total revenues were $19.4 billion, down about 3.3% over last year's quarter. Drug Company revenues were down about 5% due primarily to lower sales with former Medco and the impact from the loss of a large chain customer last year to former Longs Drugs. Slightly over half of the decline came from lower sales to former Medco, driven by generic conversions and changes in their book of business. Without these 2 negative impacts, our Drug business would have had growth of 2%. Also during the quarter, the Drug Company anniversaried a large customer win from the prior June quarter. 
Specialty Group's revenues increased nearly 8%, led by strong performance in 2 of its businesses with growth significantly above market rates, ICS, our third party logistics business, and Besse Medical, our vaccine and physician office distribution business. From a segment standpoint, gross profit decreased about $25 million and our gross profit margins slipped somewhat. Most of the dollar decrease is due to the oncology generics headwind, a high-margin contributor last June quarter, offset by the contribution from generic Lipitor and Zyprexa, both of which had their exclusivity periods end during the June '12 quarter. We did have other generic launches during the quarter and also gross profit contributions from our specialty businesses. These positives were offset by the decrease in our revenues and margin pressure. It should be noted that Drug Company is viewed on its own, had gross profit margin expansion of 20 basis points in the June 2012 quarter. This segment managed operating expenses very effectively, especially payroll and benefit expenses, as well as external consulting expenses, which enabled us to offset some of the gross profit dollars we lost with the oncology generic headwind. Overall, we're very pleased with the operating results for this segment. 
Moving to the Other reporting segment which again is Consulting, which includes our Packaging business and World Courier. As mentioned previously, our 2 large acquisitions accounted for nearly $300 million of new revenues in the third quarter. World Courier revenues are tracking well against our expectations, which we provided back in our press release that announced the acquisition. Operating income from the Other segment increased $11 million from last year's quarter. Of this increase, about $8 million is related to our fiscal '12 acquisitions. The remaining increase is related to our legacy businesses. I'd like to highlight that our non-recurring charge of about $5 million is not included in our segment level reporting. For the June quarter, the impact of our World Courier acquisition was essentially breakeven due to the transaction costs. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated balance sheet and cash flows where trends continue to be favorable. We generated $92 million of cash from operations in the quarter, bringing our 9 month's total to $760 million. Our businesses continue to focus on working capital. In fact, our cash conversion cycle, based on a rolling 4-quarter average, improved by 1 day to 1.7 days based in the current June quarter, from 2.7 days in the June 2011 quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $39 million in the quarter and $128 million for the 9 months. For the full year, we are still tracking to our guidance for CapEx of $200 million. During the quarter, we bought back $186 million of our shares. For the 9 months, we purchased $514 million of shares and this slightly exceeds our March quarter guidance of $500 million. At June 30, we have $744 million left on our May 2012 share repurchase authorization. 
Our cash balance at June 30 was $1.7 billion. As we've discussed in the past, we need approximately $500 million in available cash to account for swings in working capital and to run the business. As a reminder, in mid-September, we will be using cash to retire our $400 million 5 5/8% senior notes. 
Now let's turn to updated fiscal 2012 guidance. We now expect our GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.80 to $2.84. This includes an estimated $20 million of non-recurring costs related primarily to transaction and severance expenses. With narrowing our EPS range, this means that we will have EPS growth of 10% to 12% this year after absorbing the $0.05 negative impact from non-recurring charges. 
Revenue. We continue to expect revenue growth to be flat or up modestly for the full year. We expect our operating margin expansion to be in the high single digits. As previously communicated, Q4 is our easiest operating income comparable for the year. Because of this, we expect most of our operating margin expansion to be achieved in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow is still tracking to finish in the $800 million to $900 million range. 
Looking ahead. We are deeply engaged in our business planning process for fiscal 2013, and there are still many moving parts including, of course, the Express Scripts RFP. As Steve outlined, as large customers consolidate, they are seeking better pricing which includes generic pricing. And as recent contract discussions have demonstrated, our customers want us to be part of the solution in helping them meet the economic demands of the new health care landscape. Our high single digit to low double-digit EPS growth range is based on assumptions on several moving parts, and includes possible outcomes on the Express Scripts contract. Our EPS range is preliminary and we still have quite a bit of work to complete in our planning process, but it does incorporate the best information we have right now. So before I turn it back to Barbara, let me reiterate that 9 months into our fiscal year, we are well positioned to meet our financial targets for fiscal '12 and we are hard at work on our fiscal '13 plan. Here is Barbara to start our Q&A."

I've been with the company 8.5 years. We've always had the count. But it's very little expense. In fact, many of the characteristics of this business are what we used to call dock to dock business and of course, you remember that very well. So there's not too much expense there. And coincidently, a lot of the facilities that we service in Medco are our most highly efficient modern facilities, but we would -- we absolutely have opportunities to cut down our cost.

Many times on the fee-for-service agreements, we're really in our third generation and we've dealt with a lot of pharma consolidation, and we feel that we've -- the industry on the manufacturer side really understands the value we represent and there's no significant erosion there or anything at all. Obviously, the generic mix at AmerisourceBergen has opportunities to sell generics to almost all of our customers. As you know, we believe we have the most diverse customer base. It has really been driven by this generic wave, and we have set out our whole portfolio in both Drug and Specialty to really recognize the strength in generics. I hope you would have buy [indiscernible] someday and really capitalize on the opportunity that we have for generics and specialty. The sell side, I think, the biggest things we can point to is somewhat of an anxiety of compressed reimbursement and just a lot of consolidation. I mean, just read the headlines. It's not just that particular one that's on everyone's mind. It's -- there's just a lot of consolidation. We have community oncologists, for example, that are constantly getting a lot bigger, and our bigger customers get a better deal. We have independent customers joining buying groups. So these are the biggest trends that I can point to. And we -- I think also there's a lot of marquee customers up for bid. It's been pretty well-publicized.

So those -- without being too specific, and we don't like to comment on individual contracts, we have been in this business a long time.

Local understanding of tax laws, of who the good players are, who the bad players are.

We also, as you know, we never used to talk about generics and specialty, we talk about a lot. So there are a lot of really good trends for us in generics. But another trend is obviously, our large PBM customer doesn't really buy any significant generics from us, which we've talked about a lot. And the larger customers, a lot of them say -- when we do -- during our last round of contract negotiations, they may have been buying 4% to 7% of their purchases when generics are now, it's a lot higher.

And you're absolutely correct to think of AmerisourceBergen as specialty customers and independent pharmacies and large health system presence and big ultimate start or closed-door pharmacy businesses, and that's definitely one of the strengths of us, is our diversing our business that we serve."

I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen once again overcame a challenging year-over-year comparison and delivered solid quarterly results. In the June quarter, our revenues were down 2% to $19.8 billio",2131,"Thank you, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen once again overcame a challenging year-over-year comparison and delivered solid quarterly results. In the June quarter, our revenues were down 2% to $19.8 billion, but our GAAP earnings per share were up 8% to $0.71. We made excellent progress integrating recent acquisitions including World Courier, which closed in early May. Our strong cash generation and high-quality balance sheet continue to provide us with outstanding financial flexibility, and give us the ability to fund our strategic initiatives, grow our business and return funds to shareholders. Through 9 months, we are well positioned to meet objectives for the full year. 
Our diverse revenue base continues to position us well to benefit from organic growth across the entire spectrum of pharmaceutical care, and our customer mix helps drive benefits from the historic influx of generics. Even as generics mitigate the top line dollar growth in our industry, IMS Health's compounded annual sales growth in the U.S. in the range of 1% to 4%, and 4% to 6% worldwide through 2016. In addition, continued scrutiny of health care expenses and cost-containment efforts underway by the U.S. Federal government and commercial payers demand continues improvement in efficiency, productivity and effectiveness across all aspects of health care. 
One of the hallmarks of the U.S. market in particular is the quality of the relationship wholesalers have with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Over the last several years, AmerisourceBergen has significantly strengthened our relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers, and we continue to put an emphasis on looking for meaningful ways to provide additional services across the supply channel in order to help manufacturers meet the challenges of today's changing health care landscape. This is the strategic rationale for the material acquisitions we have made in the past 12 months. As we sit here today, we believe that both the TheraCom and World Courier acquisitions have significantly enhanced our spectrum of services at the supply channel. Moreover, they have brought a cadre of valuable new customers, employees and capabilities, which have exceeded our pre-closing expectations. 
As our provider customers face similar challenges regarding cost containment and reimbursement for services provided to patients and new challenges such as accountable care organization, they also increasingly turn to AmerisourceBergen for help in making their health care practices run as efficiently and effectively as possible. Our provider customers deliver world-class patient care on navigating a complex wave of reimbursement. And we believe they deserve fair compensation for the professional services they provide. AmerisourceBergen continues to be an active participant in policy discussions in Washington with the objective of helping legislators understand our industry and our importance to the health care system. 
AmerisourceBergen associates remain focused on meeting objectives for the year both in terms of our financial performance and in delivering outstanding service to our customers. I take great pride in the enthusiasm and dedication of our team, and I'm honored to work beside them everyday. They meet challenges with creativity and determination, and they tirelessly seek new ways to meet the needs of the diverse markets we serve through collaborative innovation and by maximizing efficiency. 
As we noted in our press release, we believe it was prudent to separate our manufacture services business from pharmaceutical distribution for financial reporting purposes. We believe that disclosing this additional level of detail will increase investor understanding of our business and further improve the overall transparency of our financial reporting. Tim will cover the financials for the 2 segments, and I will now cover some of the key trends in our business units during the quarter. 
AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation revenue declined 5% due in large part to a decline in sales to our largest customer, as well as the previously reported loss of a large retail customer beginning last September. In addition, we anniversaried last year's addition of a new alternate site customer in May, and top line growth continues to be mitigated by the impact of generic conversions. Year-to-date, the drug company revenues are only down slightly as anticipated. Over the course of the year, the wave of generic launches has progressed as planned and the Drug Company saw significant gross margin expansion in the quarter even as the 2 largest generics of Zyprexa and Lipitor came off exclusivity. We look forward to a few more launches still to come in our fourth quarter. 
Back in June, we held our annual trade show for our independent retail customers and we continued to be impressed with their resilience and their ingenuity in providing personalized patient care in the committee -- community they serve. Our Good Neighbor Pharmacy members participate actively in the largest independent network of community pharmacies in the U.S. AmerisourceBergen and our independent customers strongly believe that they play a critical role in health care throughout the country by offering a compelling value proposition to patients and payers alike. ABDC is focused on ensuring that our network, Good Neighbor Pharmacy, remains dynamic by continuous investment in programs and services to meet the challenges of community pharmacy today and in the future. The implementation of our SAP platform continues on schedule with 14 distribution center conversions complete, representing over half of our distribution centers and 2/3 of our revenues. We've made excellent progress and we expect additional conversions occurring in our fourth quarter and the remainder planned through the beginning of fiscal year 2013. 
We also continue to strengthen our Canadian operations in support of previously reported new business wins in that market. We are confident that these and other investments will meaningfully increase the value we bring to all of our customers in the U.S. and Canada. 
As we noted in the press release, we continue to participate in negotiations for the distribution contract to serve the newly combined business of Express Scripts and the former Medco. We believe we are nearing the end of the process, and while we don't have a firm date for an announcement, we do hope that the decision will be made within the next few weeks. We continue to be optimistic about our chances to win the business. However, it is a competitive process and we believe Express Scripts will ultimately choose a partner that they believe provides the best overall value. 
AmerisourceBergen's Specialty Group had another strong quarter with revenues up 8%, driven by another particularly strong performance in third-party logistics and in our vaccine and physician distribution business. Our Oncology business performed well, while facing another very difficult comparison due to the strong performance of the 3 large Specialty generic products in the June quarter last year. The comparison will ease in the September quarter as Oxaliplatin returns to the market. ABSG continues to benefit from the launch of a branded ophthalmology product earlier this year, continuing to help establish significant market share for the manufacturers. Our experience with their product demonstrates the potent value of our Specialty franchise. While our undisputed strength in Specialty is Oncology business, we have expanded those capabilities to become an instrumental part of the commercialization strategy for any infusible product launched into the physician marketplace. As I previously discussed, we now have a keen interest going forward in further expanding those capabilities into select global markets. The acquisition of World Courier has given us not only a premium quality clinical trial logistics services provider, but also an international framework upon which to further capitalize on our strengths by driving our specialty logistics, consulting, commercialization and reimbursement services into other geographic markets. The integration of World Courier is going very well and we are very excited about the new insights and opportunities that are being discovered as we bring these 2 great organizations together and gain operational exposure to international markets. 
Our Consulting Services group continues to have a strong year as demand for commercialization, reimbursement and patient support services continues to be robust. We believe these combined service offerings distinguish AmerisourceBergen in the marketplace, provide unmatched value to manufacturers and will be an important driver of our growth going forward. As manufacturers seek to bring new products to market or expand sales of existing products in a challenging health care environment, we believe that demand for these services will only increase. 
In terms of financial performance, the Consulting Services group delivered a solid quarter while making excellent progress in the further integration of TheraCom, which is performing well. Even setting aside the contribution from TheraCom, the Lash Group alone had outstanding results. As Tim will detail, the solid performance across our business contributed to excellent cash flow in the quarter. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we continue to explore opportunities to deploy our capital in order to increase shareholder value, including searching for acquisitions that meet the criteria we have in place for quite some time. They should increase our value offering to existing customers, both up and down the channel. They should be within our established core competency and they should increase shareholder value. While we have not contemplated any further contribution from acquisitions in our guidance, we continue to be receptive to acquisitions and we continue to be interested in opportunities in pharmaceutical and specialty distribution and services, as well as consulting services. We also remain committed to returning a minimum of 30% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, a hurdle that we have handily exceeded over the last several years. 
Looking ahead, the results we've had in the first 9 months of our fiscal year put us well on our way to meeting our objectives for the full fiscal year. As we said in our press release, we have narrowed the range of our diluted EPS expectations for the full year to $2.80 to $2.84. Tim will provide the details on our assumptions for the remainder of the year, but I want to highlight that as a result of that tremendous financial flexibility, we have repurchased $540 million of our shares in the year when we spent over $800 million on acquisitions, and we'll pay down about $400 million in debt in September. This speaks to the enormous strength and resilience of our business in a year of significant change for AmerisourceBergen, and indeed for the health care industry more broadly, as well as the quality of our financial planning and financial stewardship. 
As you know, we are deeply engaged in our business planning process for our fiscal 2013, and we do not yet know the future status of the business we do with our largest customer. As we noted in our press release, however, we do expect that new generic launches in both ABDC and ABSG, as well as contributions from our recent acquisitions and other favorable items will help drive earnings growth next fiscal year. The impact of customer consolidation and competitive market dynamics on our margins is expected to offset some of that growth. As our provider customers across the health landscape prepare for the full implementation of the federal government's health care reform initiatives, we are being challenged to help find new ways to reduce costs. Across the industry, big customers are getting bigger, whether they are mail order pharmacies, acute care networks or independents seeking greater strength in number through joining buying groups. Over the long term, this should lead to an even more stable and resilient industry. Of course, we will continue to manage our own expenses and working capital. In addition, the strength of our balance sheet affords us additional opportunities to drive shareholder value through acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. With all that in mind, our preliminary expectation is for high single digits to low double-digit diluted EPS growth in fiscal 2013. 
Over the last year, we made important investments in our business with an eye to the future while we continued to focus on helping our customers and ourselves take advantage of the unprecedented growth in generics and the many opportunities in Specialty. Demand is strong and growing for the core products we distribute, and we play an essential role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, ensuring the integrity and security of the distribution of life-improving and life-saving therapies. Our manufacture services businesses help ensure products get to market as efficiently as possible and that patients have access to both traditional medications and the most innovative and complex products. As cost-containment efforts mount across the health care spectrum, our customers increasingly turn to us for help in meeting the challenges of the marketplace without sacrificing patient care. I take great pride in the energy and creativity our associates bring to our business. Each day, I see the results of their innovative thinking and their dedication to exceeding customer expectations, and I'm proud to be their leader. Here is Tim."

As you just heard, ABC delivered a solid quarter and through 9 months, our performance is tracking well to our financial targets.

As you just heard, ABC delivered a solid quarter and through 9 months, our performance is tracking well to our financial targets. The key highlight this quarter was our ability to overcome the oncology generic headwind we've mentioned in the past. Going into this fiscal year, we knew that Q3 would be our toughest EPS comparison. We consistently called out a $0.33 headwind this year from Specialty generics. Of this headwind, we anticipated about half of the $0.33 would negatively impact the third quarter. We're pleased that we are able to successfully overcome this Q3 headwind and show solid EPS growth. 
Two other highlights for the quarter. We continued our discipline in terms of managing expenses across the organization and we integrated World Courier into ABC reporting. Our results include 2 months of their operations. 
Before I start with the quarterly financial details, let me highlight that in our press release, we expanded our disclosures to include detail for 2 reporting segments in addition to our ABC consolidated results. The Pharmaceutical Distribution segment includes our Drug and Specialty Group operating segments. The Other segment includes our manufacturer and services businesses, which consists of the Consulting and World Courier operating segments. Upon review of the financial reporting requirements, we determined that there was a need to separate drug distribution and manufacturer services due to the nature of their business operations and different revenue growth rates and operating margins. The disclosure of our 2 reporting segments will improve investor transparency going forward. 
Now back to the quarterly details. I'll cover ABC consolidated results first. Starting with the top line, revenues were $19.8 billion, a 1 .9% decrease over last year's quarter. Drug Company revenues were down about 5%, offset by higher Specialty revenues of nearly 8%. We also had the benefit in our June '12 revenues from 2 of our acquisitions, TheraCom and World Courier. They contributed a combined $300 million of new revenues in the current quarter. 
Moving along, gross profit was $689 million in the quarter, up 5.4% from last June with a gross margin of 3.49%. Just to remind everyone, World Courier is included in our financial results and they have a fairly high gross profit margin due to their best-in-class service model. World Courier and our other acquisitions contributed nearly $60 million to our gross profit in the current quarter. 
Our LIFO charge was $4.7 million in the quarter, down $6.7 million from last year. We expect a LIFO charge of between $12 million and $15 million for the full year, down significantly from last year. Finally, the generic benefit we received in the current June quarter from new generic launches and price appreciation was in line with our expectations. Let's move to operating expenses. 
This quarter, operating expenses were $375 million, up 11.6%. But this amount includes approximately $50 million of operating expenses related to our recent acquisitions, as well as approximately $5 million of non-recurring charges related to the World Courier transaction. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, our operating expenses would have decreased about $10 million quarter-over-quarter. Our businesses continue to do an excellent job at managing their expenses. 
Operating income of $314 million in the quarter decreased about 1%, while operating margin was up by 2 basis points compared to last June. Our third quarter was slowed by the World Courier transaction cost, and more importantly, the difficult comparison versus the prior year. 
Moving below the operating income line and other income, we had income of $4.8 million primarily related to an increase in evaluation of a note that was due to ABC from the October 2008 sale of our prior PMSI business. Interest expense of approximately $25 million in the June quarter increased 33% compared to last year as a result of our $500 million senior notes that we issued back in November. Our effective income tax rate of 38.3% was slightly higher than last year's 38.2% and is in line with our expected annualized rate of 38.4%. 
Our GAAP diluted earnings per share in the quarter of $0.71 increased by $0.05 or just under 8% over the last quarter -- over the same quarter last year. Our EPS benefited from a reduction in our average diluted shares outstanding due to our ongoing share repurchase programs. Average diluted shares for the quarter were approximately $256 million, down just over 8% from last June. At June 30, 2012, we had 251 million outstanding shares. 
Let's spend a few minutes discussing our segment results for the June quarter. Starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution, total revenues were $19.4 billion, down about 3.3% over last year's quarter. Drug Company revenues were down about 5% due primarily to lower sales with former Medco and the impact from the loss of a large chain customer last year , the  former Longs Drugs. Slightly over half of the decline came from lower sales to former Medco, driven by generic conversions and changes in their book of business. Without these 2 negative impacts, our Drug business would have had growth of 2%. Also during the quarter, the Drug Company anniversaried a large customer win from the prior June quarter. 
Specialty Group's revenues increased nearly 8%, led by strong performance in 2 of its businesses with growth significantly above market rates, ICS, our third party logistics business, and Besse Medical, our vaccine and physician office distribution business. From a segment standpoint, gross profit decreased about $25 million and our gross profit margins slipped somewhat. Most of the dollar decrease is due to the oncology generics headwind, a high-margin contributor last June quarter, offset by the contribution from generic Lipitor and Zyprexa, both of which had their exclusivity periods end during the June '12 quarter. We did have other generic launches during the quarter and also gross profit contributions from our specialty businesses. These positives were offset by the decrease in our revenues and margin pressure. It should be noted that Drug Company as viewed on its own, had gross profit margin expansion of 20 basis points in the June 2012 quarter. This segment managed operating expenses very effectively, especially payroll and benefit expenses, as well as external consulting expenses, which enabled us to offset some of the gross profit dollars we lost with the oncology generic headwind. Overall, we're very pleased with the operating results for this segment. 
Moving to the Other reporting segment which again is Consulting, which includes our Packaging business and World Courier. As mentioned previously, our 2 large acquisitions accounted for nearly $300 million of new revenues in the third quarter. World Courier revenues are tracking well against our expectations, which we provided back in our press release that announced the acquisition. Operating income from the Other segment increased $11 million from last year's quarter. Of this increase, about $8 million is related to our fiscal '12 acquisitions. The remaining increase is related to our legacy businesses. I'd like to highlight that our non-recurring charge of about $5 million is not included in our segment level reporting. For the June quarter, the impact of our World Courier acquisition was essentially breakeven due to the transaction costs. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated balance sheet and cash flows where trends continue to be favorable. We generated $92 million of cash from operations in the quarter, bringing our 9 month's total to $760 million. Our businesses continue to focus on working capital. In fact, our cash conversion cycle, based on a rolling 4-quarter average, improved by 1 day to 1.7 days based in the current June quarter, from 2.7 days in the June 2011 quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $39 million in the quarter and $128 million for the 9 months. For the full year, we are still tracking to our guidance for CapEx of $200 million. During the quarter, we bought back $186 million of our shares. For the 9 months, we purchased $514 million of shares and this slightly exceeds our March quarter guidance of $500 million. At June 30, we have $744 million left on our May 2012 share repurchase authorization. 
Our cash balance at June 30 was $1.7 billion. As we've discussed in the past, we need approximately $500 million in available cash to account for swings in working capital and to run the business. As a reminder, in mid-September, we will be using cash to retire our $400 million 5 5/8% senior notes. 
Now let's turn to updated fiscal 2012 guidance. We now expect our GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.80 to $2.84. This includes an estimated $20 million of non-recurring costs related primarily to transaction and severance expenses. With narrowing our EPS range, this means that we will have EPS growth of 10% to 12% this year after absorbing the $0.05 negative impact from non-recurring charges. 
Revenue. We continue to expect revenue growth to be flat or up modestly for the full year. We expect our operating margin expansion to be in the high single digits. As previously communicated, Q4 is our easiest operating income comparable for the year. Because of this, we expect most of our operating margin expansion to be achieved in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow is still tracking to finish in the $800 million to $900 million range. 
Looking ahead. We are deeply engaged in our business planning process for fiscal 2013, and there are still many moving parts including, of course, the Express Scripts RFP. As Steve outlined, as large customers consolidate, they are seeking better pricing which includes generic pricing. And as recent contract discussions have demonstrated, our customers want us to be part of the solution in helping them meet the economic demands of the new health care landscape. Our high single digit to low double-digit EPS growth range is based on assumptions on several moving parts, and includes possible outcomes on the Express Scripts contract. Our EPS range is preliminary and we still have quite a bit of work to complete in our planning process, but it does incorporate the best information we have right now. So before I turn it back to Barbara, let me reiterate that 9 months into our fiscal year, we are well positioned to meet our financial targets for fiscal '12 and we are hard at work on our fiscal '13 plan. Here is Barbara to start our Q&A."

So absolutely, if we lose Express Scripts, don't forget our current business is -- really a lot of the greenfield that we set up during the merge is really set up to handle big mail order business that we've done with Medco traditionally for as long as I can remember. I've been with the company 8.5 years. We've always had the count. But it's very little expense. In fact, many of the characteristics of this business are what we used to call dock to dock business and of course, you remember that very well. So there's not too much expense there. And coincidently, a lot of the facilities that we service in Medco are our most highly efficient modern facilities, but we would -- we absolutely have opportunities to cut down our cost.

Many times on the fee-for-service agreements, we're really in our third generation and we've dealt with a lot of pharma consolidation, and we feel that we've -- the industry on the manufacturer side really understands the value we represent and there's no significant erosion there or anything at all. Obviously, the generic mix at AmerisourceBergen has opportunities to sell generics to almost all of our customers. As you know, we believe we have the most diverse customer base. It has really been driven by this generic wave, and we have set out our whole portfolio in both Drug and Specialty to really recognize the strength in generics. I hope you would have buy [indiscernible] someday and really capitalize on the opportunity that we have for generics and specialty. The sell side, I think, the biggest things we can point to is somewhat of an anxiety of compressed reimbursement and just a lot of consolidation. I mean, just read the headlines. It's not just that particular one that's on everyone's mind. It's -- there's just a lot of consolidation. We have community oncologists, for example, that are constantly getting a lot bigger, and our bigger customers get a better deal. We have independent customers joining buying groups. So these are the biggest trends that I can point to. And we -- I think also there's a lot of marquee customers up for bid. It's been pretty well-publicized. VA process, definitely the SR process has really kicked up some dust, I could say, from other customers. So those -- without being too specific, and we don't like to comment on individual contracts, we have been in this business a long time.

I think our business in specialty is -- and we're talking about this with a customer the other day that everyone has a different definition of specialty. When AmerisourceBergen says specialty, we're really talking about physician administrative products and related services to manufacturers. I think when a PBM says specialty, it usually means patient self-administrative products. And so I think that, that's pretty well defined. And we actually think that there's a lot of opportunities to collaborate in those areas including with our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network and there's an opportunity to do potentially more specialty in the community. And we do take our specialty franchise and expertise very seriously there, and think that we afford a lot of AmerisourceBergen customers that are interested in this area, an opportunity to gain from our expertise, including in the policy area and the manufacturer relations area. The first part of your question had to do with Express Scripts and the overall value we provide. I think that was more of a comment that the economic deals. I mean, there's a very few companies that are qualified to be the provider to Express Scripts so it's a small universe. And I think economics is part of it, experience is part of it. And I don't think, honestly, that any of the qualifications have really materially changed since the start of this process, which has been pretty quick if you think about it compared to some of the other ones that we've seen in the recent past."

The ASP's pretty high so that's a positive, but there's no at risk, there's no exclusivity period, so we're going to have several manufacturers and we think that the pricing will be very dynamic. It's probably going to be more akin to, again, the specialty drugs and they're different than all the solids. The prices never get quite as low, but it's going to be more akin to the expiry of 180-day exclusivity period than it is to a new generic injectable launch is what I'd say.

Ricky, apologies for your last name, [indiscernible] but we do have, we believe, the most diverse customer base within our industry. And we are very proud of the strong independent business that we have. We're also doing more business within the health systems on generics, which is a great trend for us given our health systems presence. We also, as you know, we never used to talk about generics and specialty, we talk about a lot. So there are a lot of really good trends for us in generics. But another trend is obviously, our large PBM customer doesn't really buy any significant generics from us, which we've talked about a lot. And the larger customers, a lot of them say -- when we do -- during our last round of contract negotiations, they may have been buying 4% to 7% of their purchases were generics and now, it's a lot higher. And those customers are getting bigger. And we have to share more of the economics on generics with them because it's a much bigger part, they're much higher profile product category to them. So those are some of the trends that we've been pointing out. And you're absolutely correct to think of AmerisourceBergen as specialty customers and independent pharmacies and large health system presence and big ultimate start or closed-door pharmacy businesses, and that's definitely one of the strengths of us, is our diversity in our business that we serve."

Before we begin, I just want to say a few words about the storm we have all experienced over the last few days.

I want to thank our ABC associates who have worked highly to ensure that we would continue to be able to meet the needs of our customers and the patients we all ultimately serve throughout this difficult week. 
Turning now to our results. I'm delighted to report solid results for our fourth quarter and our fiscal year 2012. In my first full fiscal year as CEO, we overcame a challenging year-over-year comparison while executing very well on generic conversions. We renewed and expanded our contract with our largest customer, we integrate our 4 acquisitions and we returned funds in excess of free cash flow to shareholders. 
In the September quarter, our revenues were down 4% to $19.5 billion, but our GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were up 23% to $0.65. For the fiscal year, our revenues were down about 0.5% to $79.5 million, and our earnings per share were up 10% to $2.76, which excludes $0.04 driven by Anderson. I Am very pleased with the performance that AmerisourceBergen associates delivered in fiscal 2012. We executed extremely well against our key strategies of generics and specialty and we are well positioned heading into fiscal 2013. 
In addition, we made important investments in our forward-looking strategies of expanding our manufacture services business and beginning to build out our international platform for growth. 
This morning, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved a 62% increase in our annual dividend and authorized a new $750 million share repurchase program. We completed a $650 million accelerated share repurchase program during this quarter, bringing our repurchases for the fiscal year to nearly $1.2 billion. We are confident to undertaking this capital deployment initiatives due to the tremendous underlying strength and resilience of our business. Since the merger that created AmerisourceBergen, we have generated free cash flow of $8.8 billion. Of this amount, we have returned $6.6 million to investors by share repurchases and $600 million through dividends. In total, we returned 82% of our 11-year free cash flow to our shareholders. Truly outstanding performance for our business.
I am very proud that in fiscal 2012, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, repaid $450 million in debt, completed nearly $800 million in acquisitions and repurchased over $1 billion of our stop. And heading into next year, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our high-quality balance sheet, combined with our ability to generate cash affords us the opportunity to continue to invest in our business, find our strategic initiatives and return value to shareholders. Our legacy of outstanding financial stewardship is one of the bed rocks in the foundation of AmerisourceBergen program and one which gives us a firm footing upon which to grow our business in the years ahead. 
Another important aspect of our financial stewardship has been our careful management of our existing assets, investing in care for receptive to acquisitions and divesting of assets that do not serve our long-term objectives. This morning, we announced that we are pursuing the sale of Anderson, our contract pharmaceutical Packaging business. While Anderson Bracken is a market leader, had excellent customer relationships, talented and dedicated enough associates, has performed well and is on a growth trajectory, we have not realized significant synergies between Alison Bracken and our other larger business. We remain committed to expanding our remaining manufacturer services businesses with a particular focus on expanding our Consulting Services and specialty third-party logistics business in the U.S. and in select global markets. 
The acquisitions we made this year support those efforts and we've made excellent progress on the integrations and all 4 are performing as expected. 
The 2 largest acquisitions, TheraCom and World Courier, made modest contributions to our earnings in fiscal 2012 and are expected to contribute more meaningfully in fiscal 2013. TheraCom's part of whatever fastest growing business to Consulting group, and we expected demand for the services this group provides will increase as manufacturers seek to bring products to market as efficiently as possible and to demonstrate the value of the products in the marketplace. 
The integration of World Courier is also progressing very well and we are pleased with the performance of its core business as it has transitioned to becoming part of AmerisourceBergen. As these 2 businesses have comp together, our cultures and our vision for the future have aligned seamlessly. And I'm more excited than ever about the potential we now have to begin to expand our marketing specialty, 3PL consulting and other manufacture services outside the U.S. 
After a year of substantial change, I believe we are very well positioned to continue to add to our legacy of success and innovation in the years ahead. Our diverse revenue base continues to position us well to benefit from organic growth across the entire spectrum of pharmaceutical care. While overall, pharmaceutical market growth will likely continue to be slowing in calendar 2013, IMS Health sees compounded annual sales growth in the U.S. in the range of 1% to 4% and 4% to 6% worldwide through 2016. We are part of a strong and stable industry and we have demonstrated both resilience and solid performance in a variety of economic and market situations. 
As changes continue to roll across the U.S. health care markets for both our manufacture and health care provider customers, the opportunity for us to provide value should continue to increase. One of the hallmarks of the U.S. market is the quality of our relationships, wholesalers we have with pharmaceutical manufacturers. And we continue to put an emphasis on looking for meaningful ways to provide additional services across the supply channel in order to help them meet the challenges in today's changing health care landscape. 
Just last week, I served on an international wholesale panel at the ISW, International Federation of Pharmaceutical Wholesalers biannual meeting. I was again reminded by listening to the comments of others on the panel about the robust and transparent relationship we are privileged to enjoy with both our provider and manufacturer customers here in the U.S. 
Turning now to our 2 operating segments. Tim will provide the details can see results but I would like to highlight a few key trends. In the pharmaceutical distribution segment, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a truly stellar year, delivering strong performance on generics and a historic year for new launches. That drug companies performance helped overcome a $0.33 headwind in EPS due to a difficult comparison with specialty generic performance in the prior year. In addition, strong results in our U.S.-based business offset disappointing results in a much more Canadian distribution business. With reimbursement changes challenge the market and further unforeseen reimbursement cuts are on the horizon. 
In addition, we continue to work out some issues with the implementation of our large retail contract. While the distribution marketing candidate is challenged, the small but growing specialty business in Canada continues to gain traction. 
Drug Company revenues in the September quarter declined 8% due in large part to a larger-than-expected decline in sales, our largest customers, as well as the previously reported loss of a large retail customer beginning last September. 
For fiscal year 2012, the drug companies revenues are down 2%, somewhat lower than anticipated. However, when adjusting for non-recurring items, the Drug Company demonstrated disciplined expense management, gross margin expansion and she can't operating margin expansion. In addition we renewed and expanded the contract with our largest customer and began to serve a significantly higher volume with their customer beginning on October 1. As you would expect with ABC, the conversion has proceeded very well and we are excited about the relationship we are developing with our largest customer. 
Given the difficult generic comparison we will have in the Drug Company in fiscal year 2013, we are optimizing our resources to ensure that they are deployed and utilized in a most efficient manner possible. Some of those efforts resulted in a severance charge as we reported in our fourth quarter. One example is that we are leveraging some of the efficiencies gained through the ASP implementation particularly in back-office and adversative areas, which has allowed us to reduce the number of our Drug Company operating regions from 4 to 3 regions. As you would expect, we continue to look at ways to streamline our operations but we never sacrifice our ability to provide world-class service to our customers. 
Another example of where we continue to invade is in our Good Neighbor Pharmacy program, which is the largest independent network of community pharmacies in the U.S. We believe our pharmacy customers play a critical role in the health care throughout the company country by offering a compelling value position to patients and payers alike. We negotiate on behalf of GFP members to ensure that they continue to have access to third-party networks. Looking ahead, we are working with GFP number shortstop them ensure they are able to take full advantage of the expansion of health care under the health reform legislation. The Drug Company has performed admirably over the last few years while the overall market is inflected down. 
The implementation of our SAP platform continues on schedule with 20 distribution center conversions complete and 6 remaining. We have made excellent progress and we expect the remaining conversions to be completed by the end of the March quarter in 2013. We are confident that these and other investments will continue to meaningfully increase the value we bring to all of our customers. 
The Drug Company is, and always will be, the foundation of AmerisourceBergen Corporation. The excellent consistent financial operative performance it has achieved over the years and the resilience it has demonstrated are hallmarks of the value we provide. Furthermore, the Drug Company is the key driver in our ability to generate tremendous cash flow and as such, enables us to fund our growth initiatives. We take deep pride in this business and while it's performance in fiscal 2013 would be quite as strong as it has been historically, we expect it to return to its normal growth rate in fiscal 2014 and beyond. 
AmerisourceBergen's Specialty Group had another strong quarter with revenues up 6% in the quarter, which led to record revenue for the full fiscal year 2012. Revenue growth was driven by another particularly strong performance in third-party logistics and our vaccine and physician distribution business. Our oncology business performed well at a difficult comparison. We were, however, somewhat disappointed in the processing of our in release in mid-August. ABSG to continue to benefit, however, from the launch of a branded ophthalmology product earlier this year, continuing to help establish significant market share for the manufacturer. Our success in ophthalmology market demonstrates the unique value proposition of our specialty franchise. While our undisputed strength in specialties and oncology business, we have expanded those capabilities to become an instrumental part of the commercialization strategy for any complex products launch into the physician marketplace and beyond. 
Our Consulting Services group achieved strong results for the fiscal year, as demand for commercialization, reimbursement and patient support services continues to be robust. We believe this compound service offerings distinguished AmerisourceBergen in the marketplace and will be an important driver of our growth going forward. As manufacturers seek to bring new products to market, we expect sales of existing products in a challenging health care environment, we believe demand for these services will only increase. 
In terms of financial performance, the Consulting group delivered a solid quarter while making excellent progress in the integration of TheraCom, which is performing well. Even setting aside the contribution from TheraCom, the last group alone had outstanding results. 
As Tim will detail, the solid performance across our business once again contributed to excellent cash flow in the quarter. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we continue to explore opportunities to deploy our capital in order to increase shareholder value, including searching for acquisitions that meet the criteria we've had in place for quite some time. That should increase our value offering to existing customers both up and down the channel. That should be within our established core competency and that should increase shareholder value. While we have not contemplated any further contribution from acquisitions in our guidance, we continue to be receptive to acquisitions and we continue to be interested in opportunities in pharmaceutical and Specialty Distribution and Services, as well as Consulting Services. 
We also remain committed to returning a minimum of 30% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. A hurdle that we have exceeded over the last several years. 
Looking ahead, our performance in fiscal 2012 sets us up very well for continued success in fiscal 2013. As we stated in our press release, our guidance for GAAP EPS growth from continued operations in fiscal 2013 is to be in the range of $3.06 $3.16, an 11% to 14% increase over the $2.76 that we earned in fiscal 2012, excluding, of course, the contribution from Anderson bracken. Tim will provide the details in our assumptions for next year but I would like to hide it but we continue to tremendous financial flexibility. We are undertaking initiatives across our business to help ensure that we are efficient and effective as we can possibly be. 
The enormous strength and resilience of our business and that year's significant change at AmerisourceBergen and for the health care industry more broadly, reinforces my confidence in the long-term prospects for our business. 
Demand is strong and growing for the core products we distribute and we play an essential role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, ensuring the integrity and security of the distribution of life-improving and life-saving therapies. Over the last year, we've made important investments in our future while we continued to focus on helping our customers and ourselves take advantage of the unprecedented growth in generics and the many opportunities in specialty. 
Our distribution business is not only a cornerstone of AmerisourceBergen, but it's a cornerstone in a stable and growing industry. Our manufacturer service businesses help ensure products get to market as efficiently as possible and that patient have access to both traditional medications in the most innovative and complex products. 
Lastly, I believe that we both have an exceptional management team with a diverse background and deep experience that is excited about the opportunities we have in front of us. The knowledge, passion and creativity our associates bring to the market each day set us apart from our peers. I think them all for the work they do to continue to drive innovative solutions in a dynamic environment. I am proud to be their leader. Here is Tim."
24809,222419523,375167,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2012",2012-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We had a solid finish to what has been a good year. We're pleased with our financial results and we have momentum entering our new fiscal year. So let's start with our review of fiscal 2012. We wi",2400,"Thanks, Steve, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We had a solid finish to what has been a good year. We're pleased with our financial results and we have momentum entering our new fiscal year. So let's start with our review of fiscal 2012. We will compare our performance against the guidance we gave back in July when we discussed Q3 results. 
Our revenue expectation for fiscal 2012 was flat to modest growth. We were off a little bit. We finished down about 0.5%. This was due primarily to sales to our largest customer being lower than what we estimated. This decrease was offset by revenues from our 2 large acquisitions, TheraCom and World Courier. 
In fiscal 2012, our operating margin expanded by 10 basis points, which was slightly above our expectation. This is the seventh consecutive year of expanded our operating margins. 
Free cash flow, we have $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the year, and this exceeded our expectation of $800 million to $900 million. Finally, our GAAP diluted EPS entered a $2.80, a 10% increase over our GAAP EPS from fiscal 2011. This EPS amount includes $0.04 from Anderson Bracken, which we classified as a discontinued operation. As Steve mentioned, we plan to divest the business within the next 6 months. 
You may recall that our guidance assume $20 million of nonrecurring charges for the fiscal year. Our $2.80 GAAP EPS includes $31 million of nonrecurring charges. That's $11 million higher than we expected in the equivalent of $0.03. Excluding this $0.03 negative impact, our EPS results for the fiscal year would have been $2.83. 
One more important item, cash deployment. As Steve mentioned, our board approved a 62% increase in our annual dividend per share, $0.84. Why do we increase our diluted now? Three reasons. One, the long-term financial outlook for our core distribution business continues to be very positive; two, we expect growing contributions from our recent acquisition; and three, we continue to generate consistent, significant, free cash flow. 
We were pleased that we can provide added value to shareholders. Looking ahead, we expect to grow our annual dividend approximately in line with our earnings growth. We believe that our business will generate enough excess capital to continue with meaningful share repurchases and, at the same time, to have flexibility to complete acquisitions in the strategic areas that we've discussed in the past. 
We also announced that we completed an accelerated share repurchase for nearly $650 million, about 17 million shares. Additionally, our board approved a new share repurchase authorization of $750 million. We still have about $97 million remaining on our May 2012 authorization. In total, we had approximately $850 million remaining on share repurchase authorizations. 
Now let's move to our fourth quarter results, starting with the top line. Revenues were $19.5 billion, down 4.4% compared to last year's quarter. Drug Company revenues were down about 8% and were partially offset by and specialty revenues that were up nearly 6%. Our acquisitions contributed a combined $335 million of new revenues. 
Gross profit was approximately $720 million in the quarter, up 19% from last September with a gross margin of 3.70%. Our acquisitions, primarily World Courier, contributed $76 million in the current quarter. We also benefited from a $15 million of antitrust settlements. We consider this income nonrecurring. 
Finally, in the quarter, we have a LIFO credit of $11 million. This credit reduced our fiscal year LIFO charge to about $1 million less than we expected. Two factors contributed to our fourth quarter LIFO credit: One, our sales of brand inventory were especially high at the end of the quarter due to the purchasing patterns of a few large customers; and two, our mix of inventory was weighted heavily towards generic inventory at our LIFO calculation date. 
Let's move to operating expenses. This quarter, operating expenses were $423 million, up 15%. This amount includes $65 million related to the operating expenses of our acquired companies. Also included is $29 million of nonrecurring charges related to optimizing our field operations and corporate organization. As you come to expect from ABC, we continue to manage our expenses tightly. Excluding acquisitions and non-recurring costs, our comparable operating expenses would have decreased about $10 million or 3% compared to the same quarter last year. 
Operating income of $296 million in the quarter increased about 25%. Our operating margin was 1.52%, up by 35 basis points compared to last September quarter. When excluding the nonrecurring items from both the fourth quarter 2012 and 2011, our operating income is up $44 million or 16%. This growth demonstrates our strong performance in our core drug business, as well is contributions from our acquisitions. 
Moving below the operating income line. Interest expense of approximately $24 million in the September quarter increased 22% compared to last year. This is a result of issuing new Senior Notes back in mid-November. As a reminder, we repaid $400 million of debt in September 2012. 
Moving to income taxes. We had an increase in our effective income tax rate in the current quarter to 41.6%. This rate is higher than our normal tax rate of 38.6%. The primary reason for the increase is that we recorded a tax valuation allowance against our Canadian drug distribution business due to their operating loss. Going forward, we expect our ABC annualized tax rate to be about 39%. 
Our GAAP diluted earnings per share in the quarter of $0.66 increased by $0.12 or 22% over the same quarter last year. In the current quarter, again, the negative impact of non-recurring items was $0.03. Our EPS benefited from a 9% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. At September 30, 2012, we had 235 million outstanding shares. 
Let's spend a few minutes discussing our segment results for the September quarter. Starting with pharmaceutical distribution. Total revenues were $19.1 billion, down just under 6% versus the same quarter last year. Drug Company revenues were down about 8%. The decrease was due to 3 primary drivers: One, branded generic conversions offset by very strong brand price appreciation; two, lower sales to our largest customers; and three, the negative impact from the loss of the pharma long-lost drugs last year about $400 million. 
Specialty Group's revenues increased 6%, led by strong performance in 3 of its businesses with growth significantly above market rates especially medical, ESD and ICS. Pharmaceutical distribution gross profit increased about $33 million when comparing the fourth quarter of 2012 to the same quarter last year. And our growth gross profit margin increased 35 basis points to 3.23%. Most of the increase is due to our Drug Company business where we had strong generic revenue percentage growth in the low teens, due in part to 3 meaningful launches in the quarter. This segment also benefited from the LIFO credit. 
As expected, we did see gross profit dollars associated with specialty oncology generic drugs decreased substantially specifically docetaxel, a negative impact of $0.06. We did have a minimal positive impact from the relaunch of Oxaliplatin, below expectations due to market pricing. This segment managed operating expenses very effectively. Overall, expense has decreased approximately $11 million or 3%. We continue to review spending in our distribution businesses to ensure we're at appropriate levels. 
Pharmaceutical distribution operating income grew 16% or nearly $44 million to $308 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase was primarily the result of strong performance in our Drug Company business, which offset disappointing results in our Canadian distribution business. Overall, we're very pleased with the operating results for this segment. 
Moving to the other reporting segment. As a reminder, this segment is comprised of Consulting Services and World Courier. TheraCom, our November 2011 acquisition, is included in Consulting Services. As discussed previously, our Anderson Bracken Packaging business has been excluded since this business is reported now as a discontinued operation. Segment revenues increased nearly $350 million to $422 million in the fourth quarter 2012. As mentioned previously, World Courier and TheraCom accounted for nearly $335 million of this increase. The revenues are tracking well against our expectations. 
Operating income increased $21 million for the same quarter. About $6.5 million of the increase is related to an intangible impairment expense we incurred in the fourth quarter 2011 in one of our consulting businesses. Our acquisitions contributed about $0.02 to our Q4 2012 EPS. 
Let's switch to our fiscal year performance. I'll highlight a few key points. Back at Investor Day, we discussed the large negative headwind from Oxaliplatin that we've had this fiscal year, about $100 million of loss gross profit. Our Drug Company business more than offset this headwind. This year, they launched over 30 generic drugs, negotiated a number of sizable contracts, managed expenses tightly and implemented SAP in 16 DCs. On a fiscal year basis, Drug Company, excluding Canada, grew their operating margin a very strong 18 basis points. And finally, it was a record revenue year for our Specialty business, $16.4 billion of total revenues, a lot to be pleased about. 
Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flows. Capital expenditures were $164 million for the year, lower than expectations as a large DC automation project is shifting to fiscal 2013. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion, better than expected. This is our ninth straight year where free cash flow exceeded our net income from continuing operations. The increase was primarily due to improved committed capital at our specialty business where certain manufacturers provide extended payment terms. 
Our gross debt to total debt in capital ratio at the end of September was 37%, which is slightly higher than our target range of 30% to 35%. This is due to accelerating our share repurchases. This percentage will gradually decrease during the year. During this fiscal year, we bought back just under $1.2 billion of our shares. This amount far exceeds our original guidance of $400 million for the year. Our philosophy has consistently been to gives upsize return to shareholders if we haven't otherwise deployed our capital and when market conditions permit. We're pleased that we have continued with this practice in fiscal 2012. Our cash balance of about $1.1 billion at September 30 leaves us with financial flexibility as we move forward. 
Now let's turn to expectations for 2013, EPS. We expect GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.06 to $3.16. This translates to EPS growth of 11% to 14%. We're using $2.76 as our base EPS. This number excludes the $0.04 from the AndersonBrecon discontinued operations. 
Revenues. We expect revenue growth to be in the 6% to 9% range driven primarily by our new Express Scripts contract. This customer will represent just over 20% of our revenues. As a comparison, the Pharma Medco represented nearly 17% of our revenues in fiscal 2012. 
Operating income. As discussed in the past, our Express Scripts business is for brand drugs and is bolt like in nature, meaning that the business very low operating income margin. Our operating margin assumption also includes the loss of a large food drug combo retail buying group during the year. And most importantly, fewer oral solid generic launches. 
In terms of operating expenses, excluding nonrecurring expenses, we expect operating expenses to increase 12% to 14% in fiscal 2013. However, most of these increase is related to the full year impact of World Courier. Excluding this impact, our growth in OpEx is primarily due to cost to service our large customer and general wage and benefit inflation, offset by cost savings from our network and corporate optimization efforts. Again, our current assumptions do not include any meaningful nonrecurring expenses for fiscal 2013. 
The items that I just covered all impact our operating impact and margin. For fiscal 2013, we expect our operating impact dollars to grow 3% to 5% while our operating income margin will decrease in the low double-digit basis point range, probably in the low teens. 
Free cash flow. We expect that our free cash flow will be in the $750 million to $850 million range. Capital expenditures should be in the $180 million range with less ERP spend but new spending on a number of business initiatives. 
Share repurchases. We are assuming at least $200 million in share repurchases. The lower amount is due to ABC completing an ASR in Q4 2012. 
Let's transition and cover high-level expectations on our segment. We can start with pharmaceutical distribution. For the Drug Company, we expect revenues to grow in the 6% to 9% range, again, due primarily to the new Express Scripts contract. On the Specialty side, we expect to grow in the 7% to 9% range, which is considerably above market growth. This includes solid growth in our oncology drug business. 
Our segment operating income margin will decline in the mid double-digit basis point range. Again, this decrease is due to our new Express Scripts contract that significantly increases our mix of lower margin brand business, the impact of previously discussed customer contract renewals and fewer generics lunching year-over-year. It is important to note that after we anniversary the impact of the Express Scripts contract, we expect to return to our normal pace of annual operating income margin expansion. 
Moving to the Other segment. Revenues will increase significantly as we have World Courier for the full year versus the 5 months in fiscal year 2012. This should benefit the Other segment by about $300 million. Combined, the Consulting group and World Courier are expected to contribute 8% to 10% of our total operating income in fiscal 2013. As a reminder, we do not give quarterly guidance but I will say that directionally, our EPS growth will be higher in quarters 3 and 4. As you know, Q2 is traditionally our strongest EPS quarter but we will have a tough comparative against Q2 2012 due to the contributions from generic, Lipitor and Zyprexa. 
I know that our comments today were longer than usual due to all the moving parts, so thanks for your attention. And let me finish by reiterating we're pleased with our results for the quarter and the year. We expect solid performance in fiscal 2013 and a challenging year for generic launches. And we're working on a number of internal initiatives to streamline and strengthen our business. The future continues to look very bright for AmerisourceBergen.

The contract Packaging business has been successful and has grown significantly since we established it really about in quite several years ago. The business has always operated as a separate entity while under the ABC umbrella. And while we have been pleased with this performance, we've not really realized that many synergy opportunity between contract packaging and our other lines of business. The way that we've been running the company since I've been CEO, I think we really do look at the company holistically even more so as we react to the marketplace. So I think as we've done some deep analysis, there aren't really enough touch points on the overall business development with manufacturers to warrant pertaining this is a separate entity going forward. And also the business is growing and I think the capital needs there are going to increase and we just see that for better opportunities to invest our capital going forward."

Before we begin, I just want to say a few words about the storm we have all experienced over the last few days. Our thoughts are with all of those who have lost loved ones, lost their homes and have otherwise been severely impacted by the storm. I want to thank our ABC associates who have worked tirelessly to ensure that we would continue to be able to meet the needs of our customers and the patients we all ultimately serve throughout this difficult week.
Turning now to our results. I'm delighted to report solid results for our fourth quarter and our fiscal year 2012. In my first full fiscal year as CEO, we overcame a challenging year-over-year comparison while executing very well on generic conversions. We renewed and expanded our contract with our largest customer, we integrated 4 acquisitions and we returned funds in excess of our free cash flow to shareholders.
In the September quarter, our revenues were down 4% to $19.5 billion, but our GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were up 23% to $0.65. For the fiscal year, our revenues were down about 0.5% to $79.5 billion, and our earnings per share were up 10% to $2.76, which excludes $0.04 earned by AndersonBrecon. I'm very pleased with the performance that AmerisourceBergen associates delivered in fiscal 2012. We executed extremely well against our key strategies of generics and specialty, and we are well positioned heading into fiscal 2013.
In addition, we made important investments in our more forward-looking strategies of expanding our manufacture services businesses and beginning to build out our international platform for growth.
This morning, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved a 62% increase in our annual dividend and authorized a new $750 million share repurchase program. We completed a $650 million accelerated share repurchase program during this quarter, bringing our repurchases for the fiscal year to nearly $1.2 billion. We are confident undertaking this capital deployment initiatives due to the tremendous underlying strength and resilience of our business. Since the merger that created AmerisourceBergen, we have generated free cash flow of $8.8 billion. Of this amount, we have returned $6.6 billion to investors by share repurchases and $600 million through dividends. In total, we returned 82% of our 11-year free cash flow to our shareholders. Truly outstanding performance for our business.
I am very proud that in fiscal 2012, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, repaid $450 million in debt, completed nearly $800 million in acquisitions and repurchased over $1 billion of our stock. And heading into next year, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our high-quality balance sheet, combined with our ability to generate cash, affords us the opportunity to continue to invest in our business, find our strategic initiatives and return value to shareholders. Our legacy of outstanding financial stewardship is one of the bedrocks in the foundation of AmerisourceBergen and one which gives us a firm footing upon which to grow our business in the years ahead.
Another important aspect of our financial stewardship has been our careful management of our existing assets, investing in care for these selected acquisitions and divesting of assets that do not serve our long-term objectives. This morning, we announced that we are pursuing the sale of AndersonBrecon, our contract pharmaceutical packaging business. While AndersonBrecon is a market leader, has excellent customer relationships, talented and dedicated associates, has performed well and is on a growth trajectory, we have not realized significant synergies between AndersonBrecon and our other lines of business. We remain committed to expanding our remaining manufacture services businesses with a particular focus on expanding our Consulting Services and specialty third-party logistics business in the U.S. and in select global markets.
The acquisitions we've made this year support those efforts and we've made excellent progress on the integrations, and all 4 are performing as expected.
The 2 largest acquisitions, TheraCom and World Courier, made modest contributions to our earnings in fiscal 2012 and are expected to contribute more meaningfully in fiscal 2013. TheraCom is part of one of our fastest growing business units, the Consulting Group. And we expect the demand for the services that this group provides will increase as manufacturers seek to bring products to market as efficiently as possible and to demonstrate the value of the products in the marketplace.
The integration of World Courier is also progressing very well, and we are pleased with the performance of its core business as it is transitioned to becoming part of AmerisourceBergen. As these 2 businesses have come together, our cultures and our vision for the future have aligned seamlessly. And I'm more excited than ever about the potential we now have to begin to expand our marketing specialty, 3PL consulting and other manufacture services outside the U.S.
After a year of substantial change, I believe we are very well positioned to continue to add to our legacy of success and innovation in the years ahead. Our diverse revenue base continues to position us well to benefit from organic growth across the entire spectrum of pharmaceutical care. While overall, pharmaceutical market growth will likely continue to be slow in calendar 2013, IMS Health sees compounded annual sales growth in the U.S. in the range of 1% to 4% and 4% to 6% worldwide through 2016. We are part of a strong and stable industry, and we have demonstrated both resilience and solid performance in a variety of economic and market situations.
As changes continue to roll across the U.S. health care markets for both our manufacture and health care provider customers, the opportunity for us to provide value should continue to increase. One of the hallmarks of the U.S. market is the quality of our relationships wholesalers have with pharmaceutical manufacturers. And we continue to put an emphasis on looking for meaningful ways to provide additional services across the supply channel in order to help them meet the challenges in today's changing health care landscape.
Just last week, I served on an international wholesale panel at the IFPW, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Wholesalers biannual meeting. I was again reminded by listening to the comments of others on the panel about the robust and transparent relationship we are privileged to enjoy with both our provider and manufacturer customers here in the U.S.
Turning now to our 2 operating segments. Tim will provide the detailed financial results, but I would like to highlight a few key trends. In the pharmaceutical distribution segment, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a truly stellar year, delivering strong performance on generics in a historic year for new launches. The Drug Company's performance helped overcome a $0.33 headwind in EPS due to a difficult comparison with specialty generic performance in the prior year. In addition, strong results in our U.S.-based business offset disappointing results in our much more like Canadian distribution business where reimbursement changes have challenged the market and further unforeseen reimbursement cuts are on the horizon.
In addition, we continue to work out some issues with the implementation of our large retail contract. While the distribution marketing in Canada is challenged, the small but growing specialty business in Canada continues to gain traction.
Drug Company revenues in the September quarter declined 8% due in large part to a larger than expected decline in sales of our largest customer, as well as the previously reported loss of a large retail customer beginning last September.
For fiscal year 2012, the Drug Company's revenues are down 2%, somewhat lower than anticipated. However, when adjusting for nonrecurring items, the Drug Company demonstrated disciplined expense management, gross margin expansion and significant operating margin expansion. In addition, we renewed and expanded the contract with our largest customer and began to serve a significantly higher volume with their customer beginning on October 1. As you would expect with ABC, the conversion has proceeded very well, and we are excited about the relationship we are developing with our largest customer.
Given the difficult generic comparison we will have in the Drug Company in fiscal year 2013, we are optimizing our resources to ensure that they are deployed and utilized in a most efficient manner possible. Some of those efforts resulted in the severance charges we recorded in our fourth quarter. One example is that we are leveraging some of the efficiencies gained through the SAP implementation, particularly in back-office administrative areas, which has allowed us to reduce the numbers of our Drug Company operating regions from 4 to 3 regions. As you would expect, we continue to look at ways to streamline our operations, but we never sacrifice our ability to provide world-class service to our customers.
Another example of where we continue to invade is in our Good Neighbor Pharmacy program, which is the largest independent network of community pharmacies in the U.S. We believe our pharmacy customers play a critical role in the health care throughout the country by offering a compelling value proposition to patients and payers alike. We negotiate on behalf of GNP members to ensure that they continue to have access to third-party networks. Looking ahead, we are working with GNP members towards in order to help them ensure they are able to take full advantage of the expansion of health care under the health reform legislation. The Drug Company has performed admirably over the last few years while the overall market is inflected down.
The implementation of our SAP platform continues on schedule with 20 distribution center conversions complete and 6 remaining. We have made excellent progress, and we expect the remaining conversions to be completed by the end of the March quarter in 2013. We are confident that these and other investments will continue to meaningfully increase the value we bring to all of our customers.
The Drug Company is and always will be the foundation of AmerisourceBergen Corporation. The excellent and consistent financial and operating performance it has achieved over the years and the resilience it has demonstrated are hallmarks of the value we provide. Furthermore, the Drug Company is a key driver in our ability to generate tremendous cash flow and as such, enables us to fund our growth initiatives. We take deep pride in this business, and while it's performance in fiscal 2013  won't be quite as strong as it has been historically, we expect it to return to its normal growth rate in fiscal 2014 and beyond.
AmerisourceBergen's Specialty Group had another strong quarter with revenues up 6% in the quarter, which led to record revenue for the full fiscal year 2012. Revenue growth was driven by another particularly strong performance in third-party logistics and in our vaccine and physician distribution business. Our oncology business performed well at a difficult comparison. We were, however, somewhat disappointed in the processing of our Oxaliplatin during its release in mid-August.
ABSG thus continue to benefit, however, from the launch of a branded ophthalmology product earlier this year, continuing to help establish significant market share for the manufacturer. Our success in the ophthalmology market demonstrates the unique value proposition of our specialty franchise while our undisputed strength in specialty is our  oncology business. We've expanded those capabilities to become the instrumental part of the commercialization strategy for any complex product launched into the physician marketplace and beyond.
Our Consulting Services group achieved strong results for the fiscal year as demand for commercialization, reimbursement and patient support services continues to be robust. We believe this compound service offerings distinguish AmerisourceBergen in the marketplace and will be an important driver of our growth going forward. As manufacturers seek to bring new products to market, we'll expand sales of existing products in a challenging health care environment. We believe the demand for these services will only increase.
In terms of financial performance, the Consulting group delivered a solid quarter while making excellent progress in the integration of TheraCom, which is performing well. Even setting aside the contribution from TheraCom, the Lash group alone had outstanding results.
As Tim will detail, the solid performance across our business once again contributed to excellent cash flow in the quarter. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we continue to explore opportunities to deploy our capital in order to increase shareholder value, including searching for acquisitions that meet the criteria we've had in place for quite some time. That should increase our value offering to existing customers both up and down the channel. That should be within our established core competency and that should increase shareholder value. While we have not contemplated any further contribution from acquisitions in our guidance, we continue to be receptive to acquisitions, and we continue to be interested in opportunities in the pharmaceutical and Specialty Distribution and Services, as well as Consulting Services.
We also remain committed to returning a minimum of 30% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, a hurdle that we have handily exceeded over the last several years.
Looking ahead, our performance in fiscal 2012 sets us up very well for continued success in fiscal 2013. As we stated in our press release, our guidance for GAAP EPS growth from continued operations in fiscal 2013 is to be in the range of $3.06 to $3.16, an 11% to 14% increase over the $2.76 that we earned in fiscal 2012, excluding, of course, the contribution from AndersonBrecon.
Tim will provide the details and our assumptions for next year, but I want to highlight that we continue to have tremendous financial flexibility, we are undertaking initiatives across our entire business to help ensure that we are as efficient and effective as we can possibly be.
The enormous strength and resilience of our business in a year of significant change for AmerisourceBergen and for the health care industry more broadly, reinforces my confidence in the long-term prospects for our business.
Demand is strong and growing for the core products we distribute, and we play an essential role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, ensuring the integrity and security of the distribution of life-improving and life-saving therapies.
Over the last year, we've made important investments in our future while we continue to focus on helping our customers and ourselves take advantage of the unprecedented growth in generics and the many opportunities in specialty.
Our distribution business is not only a cornerstone of AmerisourceBergen, but it's a cornerstone in a stable and growing industry. Our manufacture services businesses help ensure products get to market as efficiently as possible and that patients have access to both traditional medications in the most innovative and complex products.
Lastly, I believe that we have both an exceptional management team with a diverse background and deep experience that is excited about the opportunities we have in front of us. The knowledge, passion and creativity our associates bring to the market each day set us apart from our peers. I thank them all for the work they do to continue to drive innovative solutions in a dynamic environment. I am proud to be their leader. Here is Tim."
24809,222419523,375474,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2012",2012-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We had a solid finish to what has been a good year. We're pleased with our financial results, and we have momentum entering our new fiscal year. So let's start with our review of fiscal 2012. We w",2394,"Thanks, Steve, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We had a solid finish to what has been a good year. We're pleased with our financial results, and we have momentum entering our new fiscal year. So let's start with our review of fiscal 2012. We will compare our performance against the guidance we gave back in July when we discussed Q3 results.
Our revenue expectation for fiscal 2012 was flat to modest growth. We were off a little bit. We finished down about 0.5%. This was due primarily to sales to our largest customer being lower than what we estimated. This decrease was offset by revenues from our 2 large acquisitions, TheraCom and World Courier.
In fiscal 2012, our operating margin expanded by 10 basis points, which was slightly above our expectation. This is the seventh consecutive year we expanded our operating margins.
Free cash flow. We have $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the year, and this exceeded our expectation of $800 million to $900 million. Finally, our GAAP diluted EPS entered a $2.80, a 10% increase over our GAAP EPS from fiscal 2011. This EPS amount includes $0.04 from AndersonBrecon, which we classified as the discontinued operation. As Steve mentioned, we plan to divest the business within the next 6 months.
You may recall that our guidance assume $20 million of nonrecurring charges for the fiscal year. Our $2.80 GAAP EPS includes $31 million of nonrecurring charges. That's $11 million higher than we expected and the equivalent of $0.03. Excluding this $0.03 negative impact, our EPS results for the fiscal year would have been $2.83.
One more important item, cash deployment. As Steve mentioned, our board approved a 62% increase in our annual dividend per share, $0.84. Why do we increase our dividend now? Three reasons: One, the long-term financial outlook for our core distribution business continues to be very positive; two, we expect growing contributions from our recent acquisitions; and three, we continue to generate consistent, significant, free cash flow.
We were pleased that we can provide added value to shareholders. Looking ahead, we expect to grow our annual dividend approximately in line with our earnings growth. We believe that our business will generate enough excess capital to continue with meaningful share repurchases and at the same time, to have flexibility to complete acquisitions in the strategic areas that we've discussed in the past.
We also announced that we completed an accelerated share repurchase for nearly $650 million, about 17 million shares. Additionally, our board approved a new share repurchase authorization of $750 million. We still have about $97 million remaining on our May 2012 authorization. In total, we have approximately $850 million remaining on share repurchase authorizations.
Now let's move to our fourth quarter results, starting with the top line. Revenues were $19.5 billion, down 4.4% compared to last year's quarter. Drug Company revenues were down about 8% and were partially offset by specialty revenues that were up nearly 6%. Our acquisitions contributed a combined $335 million of new revenues.
Gross profit was approximately $720 million in the quarter, up 19% from last September with a gross margin of 3.70%. Our acquisitions, primarily World Courier, contributed $76 million in the current quarter. We also benefited from a $15 million of antitrust settlements. We consider this income nonrecurring.
Finally, in the quarter, we had a LIFO credit of $11 million. This credit reduced our fiscal year LIFO charge to about $1 million less than we expected. Two factors contributed to our fourth quarter LIFO credit: One, our sales of brand inventory were especially high at the end of the quarter due to the purchasing patterns of a few large customers; and two, our mix of inventory was weighted heavier towards generic inventory at our LIFO calculation date.
Let's move to operating expenses. This quarter, operating expenses were $423 million, up 15%. This amount includes $65 million related to the operating expenses of our acquired companies. Also included is $29 million of nonrecurring charges related to optimizing our field operations and corporate organization. As you've come to expect from ABC, we continue to manage our expenses tightly. Excluding acquisitions and nonrecurring costs, our comparable operating expenses would have decreased about $10 million or 3% compared to the same quarter last year.
Operating income of $296 million in the quarter increased about 25%. Our operating margin was 1.52%, up by 35 basis points compared to last September quarter. When excluding the nonrecurring items from both the fourth quarter 2012 and 2011, our operating income is up $44 million or 16%. This growth demonstrates our strong performance in our core drug business, as well as contributions from our acquisitions.
Moving below the operating income line. Interest expense of approximately $24 million in the September quarter increased 22% compared to last year. This is a result of issuing new Senior Notes back in mid-November. As a reminder, we repaid $400 million of debt in September 2012.
Moving to income taxes. We had an increase in our effective income tax rate in the current quarter to 41.6%. This rate is higher than our normal tax rate of 38.6%. The primary reason for the increase is that we recorded a tax valuation allowance against our Canadian drug distribution business due to their operating loss. Going forward, we expect our ABC annualized tax rate to be about 39%.
Our GAAP diluted earnings per share in the quarter is $0.66, increased by $0.12 or 22% over the same quarter last year. In the current quarter, again, the negative impact of nonrecurring items was $0.03. Our EPS benefited from a 9% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. At September 30, 2012, we had 235 million outstanding shares.
Let's spend a few minutes discussing our segment results for the September quarter. Starting with pharmaceutical distribution. Total revenues were $19.1 billion, down just under 6% versus the same quarter last year. Drug Company revenues were down about 8%. The decrease was due to 3 primary drivers: One, branded generic conversions offset by very strong brand price appreciation; two, lower sales to our largest customer; and three, the negative impact from the loss of former Longs Drugs last year about $400 million.
Specialty Group's revenues increased 6%, led by strong performance in 3 of its businesses with growth significantly above market rates, especially medical, ASD and ICS. Pharmaceutical distribution gross profit increased about $33 million when comparing the fourth quarter 2012 to the same quarter last year. And our gross profit margin increased 35 basis points to 3.23%. Most of the increase is due to our Drug Company business where we had strong generic revenue percentage growth in the low teens, due in part to 3 meaningful launches in the quarter. This segment also benefited from the LIFO credit.
As expected, we did see gross profit dollars associated with specialty oncology generic drugs decrease substantially, specifically gemcitabine and docetaxel, a negative impact of $0.06. We did have a minimal positive impact from the relaunch of Oxaliplatin, below expectations due to market pricing. This segment managed operating expenses very effectively. Overall, expense has decreased approximately $11 million or 3%. We continue to review spending in our distribution businesses to ensure we're at appropriate levels.
Pharmaceutical distribution operating income grew 16% or nearly $44 million to $308 million in the fourth quarter 2012. The increase was primarily the result of strong performance in our Drug Company business, which offset disappointing results in our Canadian distribution business. Overall, we're very pleased with the operating results for this segment.
Moving to the other reporting segment. As a reminder, this segment is comprised of Consulting Services and World Courier. TheraCom, our November 2011 acquisition, is included in Consulting Services. As discussed previously, our AndersonBrecon Packaging business has been excluded since this business is reported now as a discontinued operation. Segment revenues increased nearly $350 million to $422 million in the fourth quarter 2012. As mentioned previously, World Courier and TheraCom accounted for nearly $335 million of this increase. The revenues are tracking well against our expectations.
Operating income increased $21 million for the same quarter. About $6.5 million of the increase is related to an intangible impairment expense we incurred in the fourth quarter 2011 in one of our consulting businesses. Our acquisitions contributed about $0.02 to our Q4 2012 EPS. 
Let's switch to our fiscal year performance. I'll highlight a few key points. Back at Investor Day, we discussed the large negative headwind from Oxaliplatin that we've had this fiscal year, about $100 million of loss gross profit. Our Drug Company business more than offset this headwind. This year, they launched over 30 generic drugs, negotiated a number of sizable contracts, managed expenses tightly and implemented SAP in 16 DCs. On a fiscal year basis, Drug Company, excluding Canada, grew their operating income margin a very strong 18 basis points. And finally, it was a record revenue year for our Specialty business, $16.4 billion of total revenues, a lot to be pleased about.
Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flows. Capital expenditures were $164 million for the year, lower than expectations as a large DC automation project is shifting to fiscal 2013. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion, better than expected. This is our ninth straight year where free cash flow exceeded our net income from continuing operations. The increase was primarily due to improved committed capital at our specialty business where certain manufacturers provide extended payment terms.
Our gross debt to total debt in capital ratio at the end of September was 37%, which is slightly higher than our target range of 30% to 35%. This is due to accelerating our share repurchases. This percentage will gradually decrease during the year. During the fiscal year, we bought back just under $1.2 billion of our shares. This amount far exceeds our original guidance of $400 million for the year. Our philosophy has consistently been to upsize return to shareholders if we haven't otherwise deployed our capital and when market conditions permit. We're pleased that we continued with this practice in fiscal 2012. Our cash balance of about $1.1 billion at September 30 leaves us with financial flexibility as we move forward.
Now let's turn to expectations for 2013, EPS. We expect GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.06 to $3.16. This translates to EPS growth of 11% to 14%. We're using $2.76 as our base EPS. This number excludes the $0.04 from the AndersonBrecon discontinued operations.
Revenues. We expect revenue growth to be in the 6% to 9% range, driven primarily by our new Express Scripts contract. This customer will represent just over 20% of our revenues. As a comparison, the former Medco represented nearly 17% of our revenues in fiscal 2012.
Operating income. As discussed in the past, our Express Scripts business is for brand drugs and is bulk like in nature, meaning that the business has very low operating income margin. Our operating income margin assumption also includes the loss of a large food drug combo retail buying group during the year and most importantly, fewer oral solid generic launches.
In terms of operating expenses, excluding nonrecurring expenses, we expect operating expenses to increase 12% to 14% in fiscal 2013. However, most of these increases related to the full year impact of World Courier. Excluding this impact, our growth in OpEx is primarily due to cost to service our large customer and general wage and benefit inflation, offset by cost savings from our network and corporate optimization efforts. Again, our current assumptions do not include any meaningful nonrecurring expenses for fiscal 2013.
The items that I just covered all impact our operating impact and margin. For fiscal 2013, we expect our operating impact dollars to grow 3% to 5%, while our operating income margin will decrease in the low double-digit basis point range, probably in the low teens.
Free cash flow. We expect that our free cash flow will be in the $750 million to $850 million range. Capital expenditures should be in the $180 million range with less ERP spending but new spending on a number of business initiatives.
Share repurchases. We are assuming at least $200 million in share repurchases. The lower amount is due to ABC completing an ASR in Q4 2012.
Let's transition and cover high-level expectations on our segment. We can start with pharmaceutical distribution. For the Drug Company, we expect revenues to grow in the 6% to 9% range, again, due primarily to the new Express Scripts contract. On the Specialty side, we expect to grow in the 7% to 9% range, which is considerably above market growth. This includes solid growth in our oncology drug business.
Our segment operating income margin will decline in a mid-double-digit basis point range. Again, this decrease is due to our new Express Scripts contract that significantly increases our mix of lower margin brand business, the impact of previously discussed customer contract renewals and fewer generics lunching year-over-year. It is important to note that after we anniversary the impact of the Express Scripts contract, we expect to return to our normal pace of annual operating income margin expansion.
Moving to the Other segment. Revenues will increase significantly as we have World Courier for the full year versus the 5 months in fiscal year 2012. This should benefit the Other segment by about $300 million. Combined, the Consulting group and World Courier are expected to contribute 8% to 10% of our total operating income in fiscal 2013.
As a reminder, we do not give quarterly guidance, but I will say that directionally, our EPS growth will be higher in quarters 3 and 4. As you know, Q2 is traditionally our strongest EPS quarter, but we will have a tough comparative against Q2 2012 due to the contributions from generic Lipitor and Zyprexa.
I know that our comments today were longer than usual due to all the moving parts, so thanks for your attention. And let me finish by reiterating, we're pleased with our results for the quarter and the year. We expect solid performance in fiscal 2013 in a challenging year for generic launches. And we're working on a number of internal initiatives to streamline and strengthen our business. The future continues to look very bright for AmerisourceBergen.
Now here's Barbara for Q&A."

Turning now to our results. I'm delighted to report solid results for our fourth quarter and our fiscal year 2012. In my first full fiscal year as CEO, we overcame a challenging year-over-year comparison while executing very well on generic conversions. We renewed and expanded our contract with our largest customer, we integrated 4 acquisitions and we returned funds in excess of our free cash flow to shareholders.
In the September quarter, our revenues were down 4% to $19.5 billion, but our GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were up 23% to $0.65. For the fiscal year, our revenues were down about 0.5% to $79.5 billion, and our earnings per share were up 10% to $2.76, which excludes $0.04 earned by AndersonBrecon. I'm very pleased with the performance that AmerisourceBergen associates delivered in fiscal 2012. We executed extremely well against our key strategies of generics and specialty, and we are well positioned heading into fiscal 2013.
In addition, we made important investments in our more forward-looking strategies of expanding our manufacture services businesses and beginning to build out our international platform for growth.
This morning, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved a 62% increase in our annual dividend and authorized a new $750 million share repurchase program. We completed a $650 million accelerated share repurchase program during this quarter, bringing our repurchases for the fiscal year to nearly $1.2 billion. We are confident undertaking these capital deployment initiatives due to the tremendous underlying strength and resilience of our business. Since the merger that created AmerisourceBergen, we have generated free cash flow of $8.8 billion. Of this amount, we have returned $6.6 billion to investors by share repurchases and $600 million through dividends. In total, we returned 82% of our 11-year free cash flow to our shareholders. Truly outstanding performance for our business.
I am very proud that in fiscal 2012, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, repaid $450 million in debt, completed nearly $800 million in acquisitions and repurchased over $1 billion of our stock. And heading into next year, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our high-quality balance sheet, combined with our ability to generate cash, affords us the opportunity to continue to invest in our business, find our strategic initiatives and return value to shareholders. Our legacy of outstanding financial stewardship is one of the bedrocks in the foundation of AmerisourceBergen and one which gives us a firm footing upon which to grow our business in the years ahead.
Another important aspect of our financial stewardship has been our careful management of our existing assets, investing in carefully selected acquisitions and divesting of assets that do not serve our long-term objectives. This morning, we announced that we are pursuing the sale of AndersonBrecon, our contract pharmaceutical packaging business. While AndersonBrecon is a market leader, has excellent customer relationships, talented and dedicated associates, has performed well and is on a growth trajectory, we have not realized significant synergies between AndersonBrecon and our other lines of business. We remain committed to expanding our remaining manufacture services businesses with a particular focus on expanding our Consulting Services and specialty third-party logistics business in the U.S. and in select global markets.
The acquisitions we've made this year support those efforts and we've made excellent progress on the integrations, and all 4 are performing as expected.
The 2 largest acquisitions, TheraCom and World Courier, made modest contributions to our earnings in fiscal 2012 and are expected to contribute more meaningfully in fiscal 2013. TheraCom is part of one of our fastest growing business units, the Consulting Group. And we expect the demand for the services that this group provides will increase as manufacturers seek to bring products to market as efficiently as possible and to demonstrate the value of the products in the marketplace.
The integration of World Courier is also progressing very well, and we are pleased with the performance of its core business as it is transitioned to becoming part of AmerisourceBergen. As these 2 businesses have come together, our cultures and our vision for the future have aligned seamlessly. And I'm more excited than ever about the potential we now have to begin to expand our marketing specialty, 3PL consulting and other manufacture services outside the U.S.
After a year of substantial change, I believe we are very well positioned to continue to add to our legacy of success and innovation in the years ahead. Our diverse revenue base continues to position us well to benefit from organic growth across the entire spectrum of pharmaceutical care. While overall pharmaceutical market growth will likely continue to be slow in calendar 2013, IMS Health sees compounded annual sales growth in the U.S. in the range of 1% to 4% and 4% to 6% worldwide through 2016. We are part of a strong and stable industry, and we have demonstrated both resilience and solid performance in a variety of economic and market situations.
As changes continue to roll across the U.S. healthcare markets for both our manufacture and healthcare provider customers, the opportunity for us to provide value should continue to increase. One of the hallmarks of the U.S. market is the quality of our relationships wholesalers have with pharmaceutical manufacturers. And we continue to put an emphasis on looking for meaningful ways to provide additional services across the supply channel in order to help them meet the challenges of today's changing healthcare landscape.
Just last week, I served on an international wholesale panel at the IFPW, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Wholesalers biannual meeting. I was again reminded by listening to the comments of others on the panel about the robust and transparent relationship we are privileged to enjoy with both our provider and manufacturer customers here in the U.S.
Turning now to our 2 operating segments. Tim will provide the detailed financial results, but I would like to highlight a few key trends. In the pharmaceutical distribution segment, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a truly stellar year, delivering strong performance on generics in a historic year for new launches. The Drug Company's performance helped overcome a $0.33 headwind in EPS due to a difficult comparison with specialty generic performance in the prior year. In addition, strong results in our U.S.-based business offset disappointing results in our much smaller Canadian distribution business where reimbursement changes have challenged the market and further unforeseen reimbursement cuts are on the horizon.
In addition, we continue to work out some issues with the implementation of our large retail contract. While the distribution market in Canada is challenged, the small but growing specialty business in Canada continues to gain traction.
Drug Company revenues in the September quarter declined 8% due in large part to a larger than expected decline in sales of our largest customer, as well as the previously reported loss of a large retail customer beginning last September.
For fiscal year 2012, the Drug Company's revenues are down 2%, somewhat lower than anticipated. However, when adjusting for nonrecurring items, the Drug Company demonstrated disciplined expense management, gross margin expansion and significant operating margin expansion. In addition, we renewed and expanded the contract with our largest customer and began to serve a significantly higher volume with that customer beginning on October 1. As you would expect with ABC, the conversion has proceeded very well, and we are excited about the relationship we are developing with our largest customer.
Given the difficult generic comparison we will have in the Drug Company in fiscal year 2013, we are optimizing our resources to ensure that they are deployed and utilized in the most efficient manner possible. Some of those efforts resulted in the severance charges we recorded in our fourth quarter. One example is that we are leveraging some of the efficiencies gained through the SAP implementation, particularly in back-office administrative areas, which has allowed us to reduce the numbers of our Drug Company operating regions from 4 to 3 regions. As you would expect, we continue to look at ways to streamline our operations, but we never sacrifice our ability to provide world-class service to our customers.
Another example of where we continue to invest in our Good Neighbor Pharmacy program, which is the largest independent network of community pharmacists in the U.S. We believe our pharmacy customers play a critical role in the healthcare throughout the country by offering a compelling value proposition to patients and payers alike. We negotiate on behalf of GNP members to ensure that they continue to have access to third-party networks. Looking ahead, we are working with GNP member stores in order to help them ensure they are able to take full advantage of the expansion of healthcare under the health reform legislation. The Drug Company has performed admirably over the last few years while the overall market has been flat to down.
The implementation of our SAP platform continues on schedule with 20 distribution center conversions complete and 6 remaining. We have made excellent progress and we expect the remaining conversions to be completed by the end of the March quarter in 2013. We are confident that these and other investments will continue to meaningfully increase the value we bring to all of our customers.
The Drug Company is and always will be the foundation of AmerisourceBergen Corporation. The excellent consistent financial and operating performance it has achieved over the years and the resilience it has demonstrated are hallmarks of the value we provide. Furthermore, the Drug Company is a key driver in our ability to generate tremendous cash flow and as such, enables us to fund our growth initiatives. We take deep pride in this business, and while its performance in fiscal 2013 won't be quite as strong as it has been historically, we expect it to return to its normal growth rate in fiscal 2014 and beyond.
AmerisourceBergen's Specialty Group had another strong quarter with revenues up 6% in the quarter, which led to record revenue for the full fiscal year 2012. Revenue growth was driven by another particularly strong performance in third-party logistics and in our vaccine and physician distribution business. Our oncology business performed well as a difficult comparison East [ph]. We were, however, somewhat disappointed in the pricing of our Oxaliplatin during its release in mid August.
ABSG discontinued a benefit, however, from the launch of a branded ophthalmology product earlier this year, continuing to help establish significant market share for the manufacturer. Our success in the ophthalmology market demonstrates the unique value proposition of our specialty franchise while our undisputed strength in specialty is our oncology business, we've expanded those capabilities to become the instrumental part of the commercialization strategy for any complex product launched into the physician marketplace and beyond.
Our Consulting Services group achieved strong results for the fiscal year as demand for commercialization, reimbursement and patient support services continues to be robust. We believe these combined service offerings distinguish AmerisourceBergen in the marketplace and will be an important driver of our growth going forward. As manufacturers seek to bring new products to market, or expand sales of existing products in a challenging healthcare environment, we believe the demand for these services will only increase.
In terms of financial performance, the Consulting group delivered a solid quarter while making excellent progress in the integration of TheraCom, which is performing well. Even setting aside the contribution from TheraCom, the Lash group alone had outstanding results.
As Tim will detail, the solid performance across our business once again contributed to excellent cash flow in the quarter. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we continue to explore opportunities to deploy our capital in order to increase shareholder value, including searching for acquisitions that meet the criteria we've had in place for quite some time. That should increase our value offering to existing customers both up and down the channel. That should be within our established core competency and that should increase shareholder value. While we have not contemplated any further contribution from acquisitions in our guidance, we continue to be receptive to acquisitions, and we continue to be interested in opportunities in the pharmaceutical and Specialty Distribution Services, as well as Consulting Services.
We also remain committed to returning a minimum of 30% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, a hurdle that we have handily exceeded over the last several years.
Looking ahead, our performance in fiscal 2012 sets us up very well for continued success in fiscal 2013. As we stated in our press release, our guidance for GAAP EPS growth from continued operations in fiscal 2013 is to be in the range of $3.06 to $3.16, an 11% to 14% increase over the $2.76 that we earned in fiscal 2012, excluding, of course, the contribution from AndersonBrecon.
Tim will provide the details and our assumptions for next year, but I want to highlight that we continue to have tremendous financial flexibility; we are undertaking initiatives across our entire business to help ensure that we are as efficient and effective as we can possibly be.
The enormous strength and resilience of our business in a year of significant change for AmerisourceBergen and for the healthcare industry more broadly, reinforces my confidence in the long-term prospects for our business.
Demand is strong and growing for the core products we distribute, and we play an essential role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, ensuring the integrity and security of the distribution of life-improving and lifesaving therapies.
Over the last year, we've made important investments in our future while we continue to focus on helping our customers and ourselves take advantage of the unprecedented growth in generics and the many opportunities in specialty.
Our distribution business is not only a cornerstone of AmerisourceBergen, but it's a cornerstone in a stable and growing industry. Our manufacture services businesses help ensure products get to market as efficiently as possible and that patients have access to both traditional medications and the most innovative and complex products.
Lastly, I believe that we have built up an exceptional management team with a diverse background and deep experience that is excited about the opportunities we have in front of us. The knowledge, passion and creativity our associates bring to the market each day set us apart from our peers. I thank them all for the work they do to continue to drive innovative solutions in a dynamic environment. I am proud to be their leader. Here is Tim."

We had a solid finish to what has been a good year. We're pleased with our financial results, and we have momentum entering our new fiscal year. So let's start with our review of fiscal 2012. We w",2395,"Thanks, Steve, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We had a solid finish to what has been a good year. We're pleased with our financial results, and we have momentum entering our new fiscal year. So let's start with our review of fiscal 2012. We will compare our performance against the guidance we gave back in July when we discussed Q3 results.
Our revenue expectation for fiscal 2012 was flat to modest growth. We were off a little bit. We finished down about 0.5%. This was due primarily to sales to our largest customer being lower than what we estimated. This decrease was offset by revenues from our 2 large acquisitions, TheraCom and World Courier.
In fiscal 2012, our operating margin expanded by 10 basis points, which was slightly above our expectation. This is the seventh consecutive year we expanded our operating margins.
Free cash flow. We have $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the year, and this exceeded our expectation of $800 million to $900 million. Finally, our GAAP diluted EPS ended at $2.80, a 10% increase over our GAAP EPS from fiscal 2011. This EPS amount includes $0.04 from AndersonBrecon, which we classified as a discontinued operation. As Steve mentioned, we plan to divest the business within the next 6 months.
You may recall that our guidance assumed $20 million of nonrecurring charges for the fiscal year. Our $2.80 GAAP EPS includes $31 million of nonrecurring charges. That's $11 million higher than we expected and the equivalent of $0.03. Excluding this $0.03 negative impact, our EPS results for the fiscal year would have been $2.83.
One more important item, cash deployment. As Steve mentioned, our board approved a 62% increase in our annual dividend per share to $0.84. Why do we increase our dividend now? Three reasons: 1, the long-term financial outlook for our core distribution business continued to be very positive; 2, we expect growing contributions from our recent acquisitions; and 3, we continue to generate consistent, significant free cash flow.
We were pleased that we can provide added value to shareholders. Looking ahead, we expect to grow our annual dividend approximately in line with our earnings growth. We believe that our business will generate enough excess capital to continue with meaningful share repurchases and at the same time, to have flexibility to complete acquisitions in the strategic areas that we've discussed in the past.
We also announced that we completed an accelerated share repurchase for nearly $650 million, about 17 million shares. Additionally, our board approved a new share repurchase authorization of $750 million. We still have about $97 million remaining on our May 2012 authorization. In total, we have approximately $850 million remaining on share repurchase authorizations.
Now let's move to our fourth quarter results, starting with the top line. Revenues were $19.5 billion, down 4.4% compared to last year's quarter. Drug Company revenues were down about 8% and were partially offset by specialty revenues that were up nearly 6%. Our acquisitions contributed a combined $335 million of new revenues.
Gross profit was approximately $720 million in the quarter, up 19% from last September with a gross margin of 3.70%. Our acquisitions, primarily World Courier, contributed $76 million in the current quarter. We also benefited from a $15 million of antitrust settlements. We consider this income nonrecurring.
Finally, in the quarter, we had a LIFO credit of $11 million. This credit reduced our fiscal year LIFO charge to about $1 million less than we expected. 2 factors contributed to our fourth quarter LIFO credit: 1, our sales of brand inventory were especially high at the end of the quarter due to the purchasing patterns of a few large customers; and 2, our mix of inventory was weighted heavier towards generic inventory at our LIFO calculation date.
Let's move to operating expenses. This quarter, operating expenses were $423 million, up 15%. This amount includes $65 million related to the operating expenses of our acquired companies. Also included is $29 million of nonrecurring charges related to optimizing our field operations and corporate organization. As you've come to expect from ABC, we continue to manage our expenses tightly. Excluding acquisitions and nonrecurring costs, our comparable operating expenses would have decreased about $10 million or 3% compared to the same quarter last year.
Operating income of $296 million in the quarter increased about 25%. Our operating margin was 1.52%, up by 35 basis points compared to last September quarter. When excluding the nonrecurring items from both the fourth quarter 2012 and 2011, our operating income is up $44 million or 16%. This growth demonstrates our strong performance in our core drug business, as well as contributions from our acquisitions.
Moving below the operating income line. Interest expense of approximately $24 million in the September quarter increased 22% compared to last year. This is a result of issuing new Senior Notes back in mid November. As a reminder, we repaid $400 million of debt in September 2012.
Moving to income taxes. We had an increase in our effective income tax rate in the current quarter to 41.6%. This rate is higher than our normal tax rate of 38.6%. The primary reason for the increase is that we recorded a tax valuation allowance against our Canadian drug distribution business due to their operating loss. Going forward, we expect our ABC annualized tax rate to be about 39%.
Our GAAP diluted earnings per share in the quarter is $0.66, increased by $0.12 or 22% over the same quarter last year. In the current quarter, again, the negative impact of nonrecurring items was $0.03. Our EPS benefited from a 9% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. At September 30, 2012, we had 235 million outstanding shares.
Let's spend a few minutes discussing our segment results for the September quarter. Starting with pharmaceutical distribution. Total revenues were $19.1 billion, down just under 6% versus the same quarter last year. Drug Company revenues were down about 8%. The decrease was due to 3 primary drivers: 1, branded generic conversions offset by very strong brand price appreciation; 2, lower sales to our largest customer; and 3, the negative impact from the loss of the former Longs Drugs last year, about $400 million.
Specialty Group's revenues increased 6%, led by strong performance in 3 of its businesses with growth significantly above market rates, especially medical, ASD and ICS. Pharmaceutical distribution gross profit increased about $33 million when comparing the fourth quarter 2012 to the same quarter last year. And our gross profit margin increased 35 basis points to 3.23%. Most of the increase is due to our Drug Company business where we had strong generic revenue percentage growth in the low teens, due in part to 3 meaningful launches in the quarter. This segment also benefited from the LIFO credit.
As expected, we did see gross profit dollars associated with specialty oncology generic drugs decrease substantially, specifically gemcitabine and docetaxel, a negative impact of $0.06. We did have a minimal positive impact from the relaunch of Oxaliplatin, below expectations due to market pricing. This segment managed operating expenses very effectively. Overall, expenses decreased approximately $11 million or 3%. We continue to review spending in our distribution businesses to ensure we're at appropriate levels.
Pharmaceutical distribution operating income grew 16% or nearly $44 million to $308 million in the fourth quarter 2012. The increase was primarily the result of strong performance in our Drug Company business, which offset disappointing results in our Canadian distribution business. Overall, we're very pleased with the operating results for this segment.
Moving to the Other reporting segment. As a reminder, this segment is comprised of Consulting Services and World Courier. TheraCom, our November 2011 acquisition, is included in Consulting Services. As discussed previously, our AndersonBrecon Packaging business has been excluded since this business is reported now as a discontinued operation. Segment revenues increased nearly $350 million to $422 million in the fourth quarter 2012. As mentioned previously, World Courier and TheraCom accounted for nearly $335 million of this increase. The revenues are tracking well against our expectations.
Operating income increased $21 million for the same quarter. About $6.5 million of the increase is related to an intangible impairment expense we incurred in the fourth quarter 2011 in one of our consulting businesses. Our acquisitions contributed about $0.02 to our Q4 2012 EPS. 
Let's switch to our fiscal year performance. I'll highlight a few key points. Back on Investor Day, we discussed the large negative headwind from Oxaliplatin that we'd have this fiscal year, about $100 million of lost gross profit. Our Drug Company business more than offset this headwind. This year, they launched over 30 generic drugs, negotiated a number of sizable contracts, managed expenses tightly and implemented SAP in 16 DCs. On a fiscal year basis, Drug Company, excluding Canada, grew their operating income margin a very strong 18 basis points. And finally, it was a record revenue year for our Specialty business, $16.4 billion of total revenues, a lot to be pleased about.
Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flows. Capital expenditures were $164 million for the year, lower than expectations as a large DC automation project is shifting to fiscal 2013. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion, better than expected. This is our ninth straight year where free cash flow exceeded our net income from continuing operations. The increase was primarily due to improved committed capital at our specialty business where certain manufacturers provide extended payment terms.
Our gross debt to total debt in capital ratio at the end of September was 37%, which is slightly higher than our target range of 30% to 35%. This is due to accelerating our share repurchases. This percentage will gradually decrease during the year. During the fiscal year, we bought back just under $1.2 billion of our shares. This amount far exceeds our original guidance of $400 million for the year. Our philosophy has consistently been to upsize return to shareholders if we haven't otherwise deployed our capital and when market conditions permit. We're pleased that we continued with this practice in fiscal 2012. Our cash balance of about $1.1 billion at September 30 leaves us with financial flexibility as we move forward.
Now let's turn to expectations for 2013. EPS. We expect GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.06 to $3.16. This translates to EPS growth of 11% to 14%. We're using $2.76 as our base EPS. This number excludes the $0.04 from the AndersonBrecon discontinued operations.
Revenues. We expect revenue growth to be in the 6% to 9% range, driven primarily by our new Express Scripts contract. This customer will represent just over 20% of our revenues. As a comparison, the former Medco represented nearly 17% of our revenues in fiscal 2012.
Operating income. As discussed in the past, our Express Scripts business is for brand drugs and is bulk-like in nature, meaning that the business has very low operating income margins. Our operating income margin assumption also includes the loss of a large food/drug combo retail buying group during the year and most importantly, fewer oral solid generic launches.
In terms of operating expenses, excluding nonrecurring expenses, we expect operating expenses to increase 12% to 14% in fiscal 2013. However, most of this increase is related to the full year impact of World Courier. Excluding this impact, growth in OpEx is primarily due to cost to service our large customer and general wage and benefit inflation, offset by cost savings from our network and corporate optimization efforts. Again, our current assumptions do not include any meaningful nonrecurring expenses for fiscal 2013.
The items that I just covered all impact our operating income and margin. For fiscal 2013, we expect our operating income dollars to grow 3% to 5%, while our operating income margin will decrease in the low double-digit basis point range, probably in the low teens.
Free cash flow. We expect that our free cash flow will be in the $750 million to $850 million range. Capital expenditures should be in the $180 million range with less ERP spending but new spending on a number of business initiatives.
Share repurchases. We are assuming at least $200 million in share repurchases. The lower amount is due to ABC completing an ASR in Q4 2012.
Let's transition and cover high-level expectations on our segment. We can start with pharmaceutical distribution. For the Drug Company, we expect revenues to grow in the 6% to 9% range, again, due primarily to the new Express Scripts contract. On the Specialty side, we expect to grow in the 7% to 9% range, which is considerably above market growth. This includes solid growth in our oncology drug business.
Our segment operating income margin will decline in a mid double-digit basis point range. Again, this decrease is due to our new Express Scripts contract that significantly increases our mix of lower margin brand business, the impact of previously discussed customer contract renewals and fewer generics launching year-over-year. It is important to note that after we anniversary the impact of the Express Scripts contract, we expect to return to our normal pace of annual operating income margin expansion.
Moving to the Other segment. Revenues will increase significantly as we have World Courier for the full year versus the 5 months in fiscal year 2012. This should benefit the Other segment by about $300 million. Combined, the Consulting group and World Courier are expected to contribute 8% to 10% of our total operating income in fiscal 2013.
As a reminder, we do not give quarterly guidance, but I will say that directionally, our EPS growth will be higher in quarters 3 and 4. As you know, Q2 is traditionally our strongest EPS quarter, but we will have a tough comparative against Q2 2012 due to the contributions from generic Lipitor and Zyprexa.
I know that our comments today were longer than usual due to all the moving parts, so thanks for your attention. And let me finish by reiterating. We're pleased with our results for the quarter and the year. We expect solid performance in fiscal 2013 in a challenging year for generic launches. And we're working on a number of internal initiatives to streamline and strengthen our business. The future continues to look very bright for AmerisourceBergen.
Now here's Barbara for Q&A."

Of course, I think the priority for both organizations has been really working on implementing the contract. And now we can look forward to broadening and strengthening the relationship over the next couple of quarters. The hybrid model was the second part of your question. And no, I think it's just really taking advantage of a lot of the services that we offer to community oncologists and allowing those services to transition into more of a hospital setting. And I think it's also getting the manufacturers some of the information that they lack on the patient side and the protocol and formerly management side that we've been able to give them in the community settings. So you're seeing us make investments there, but we think that, that will preserve some of the unique financial as well as therapeutic characteristics of our oncology business. So very important for us to continue to move with the markets. And again, a great example of how we're looking at the company very holistically and less hard lines between, say, specialty and drug."

I'm curious if you could help us understand the ultimate revenue impact compared to your -- what your expectations would have been had you retained that. And you did mention that as one of the contributors to the operating margin compression, so should we assume that it's a higher operating margin contract than perhaps your overall book. And then finally, still sticking with that contract. In terms of the phasing of that loss, I know sometimes with GPO contracts, you don't lose all of the business on Day 1. Can you give us some sense on the phasing of the revenue rolling off?"
