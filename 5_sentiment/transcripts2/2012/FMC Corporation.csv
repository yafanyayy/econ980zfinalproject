Our fourth quarter results provided a strong finish to a year of remarkable accomplishments for FMC. We achieved record financial performance in 2011 and made great progress implementing the Vision 2015 stra",946,"Thank you, Brennen. And good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter results provided a strong finish to a year of remarkable accomplishments for FMC. We achieved record financial performance in 2011 and made great progress implementing the Vision 2015 strategy plan. Here is a brief summary of our accomplishments in 2011. Sales and EBIT both increased 13% excluding the prior-year impact of exited businesses. Earnings per diluted share grew by 21%. Free cash flow of $180 million was generated. Return on invested capital increased to 23.9%. Agricultural Products delivered eighth year of record earnings. Specialty Chemicals achieved sixth consecutive years of record earnings led by the seventh consecutive year of record earnings on Biopolymer. Industrial Chemicals realized robust earnings growth, the highest profit growth among our segments on the strength of our soda ash business and continued shift towards Specialty Peroxygens. 
Across our businesses, we completed 4 company or product line acquisition, formed 2 joint ventures and established 2 product development and distribution agreements all designed to strategically broaden our capacity to serve customers and enable us to capitalize from organic market growth opportunities. And along side these external growth initiatives, we returned $206 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchase. 
2011 indeed was a very good year for us and we are confident that we'll deliver another record year in 2012.
Moving to our fourth quarter 2011 results. Sales of $909 million increased by 17% last year excluding the prior-year impact of exited businesses. Adjusted earnings of $1.58 per diluted share increased 44% versus the year quarter ago. This stable adjusted earnings is well above the $1.30 to $1.40 range in the guidance we issued last quarter as we benefited from lower tax rate than projected in our previous guidance. We do expect this lower tax rate to be a sustaining contributor to our highest earning profile going forward. Kim will review the details of this lower tax rate later in our call.
Our gross margin of $294 million increased by 11% versus last year while on a percent basis, our percent gross margin essentially equaled that of last year.
SG&A spend of $115 million was leveled to a year ago despite the significant sales gain. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $145 million increased 24% versus last year. On a regional basis looking at the result, excluding the prior-year impact of exited business, we have clearly demonstrated our continued success in penetrating rapidly developing economies. Asia has the highest sales growth, up 15%, as Specialty Chemicals nearly doubled. Latin America, grew 30%, driven by robust growth in ag product and soda ash while EMEA increased 11%.
Let's take a more detailed look at the performance of operating segments in the quarter. First in Agricultural Products. First quarter sales of $409 million increased 22% versus the year-ago quarter led by robust sales growth in Latin America. The sales gain in Latin America were driven by strong demand in key Brazilian market segments such as cotton and sugar cane, as well as the new product production and sales from a new venture in Argentina. Sales in EMEA increased significantly based on the strength of insecticide and herbicide sales in France and Italy. In North America, sales were lower than a year ago due to a shift into turning of fall application sales, where we reported in the third quarter of this year versus fourth quarter last year. In Asia, sales were essentially leveled to a year ago as higher insecticide volumes in China, Indonesia and Korea were offset by lower herbicide volumes due to less favorable weather conditions in China, Pakistan and India, which impacted the regions with crops.
Segment earnings of $73 million increased 17% versus a year ago, driven by the higher sales, partially offset by higher raw material and manufacturing costs, as well as increased spending on targeted organic and excellent growth initiatives.
Moving now to Specialty Chemicals. Fourth quarter revenues of $223 million increased 9% versus the prior-year quarter driven by higher selling price across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer, especially in food and pharmacy markets as well as in downstream specialties.
Segment earnings of $51 million increased 11% versus the prior year driven by the sales gain and favorable mix, which more than offset higher raw materials and energy costs and increased spending on targeted organic and excellent growth initiatives.
In BioPolymer, we realized volumes gain in all 3 product lines coupled with higher selling price in key market segments. On the demand side, microcrystalline cellulose, or MCC, continued to realize the highest growth rate. In food ingredients, we continue to see robust demand growth in dairy and beverage market in Asia especially in China.
And in pharmaceutical, a strong position service manufacturers in India continue to offer the higher growth.
BioPolymer earnings growth was driven by higher sales and favorable mix, which more than offset higher raw material costs and spending on targeted growth initiatives. Pricing gains realized in the quarter more than offset higher raw material costs. Principally higher wood pulp and seaweed costs.
Moving now to Lithium. Sales gain were driven by higher selling prices in both primaries and specialties and volume gain in energy storage in these markets. The Asian energy storage market continued to be the highest growth driver supplemented by steady growth in butyllithium and other downstream products, which serve polymer and pharmaceuticals in these markets.
So in summary a very strong finish to a record years in both Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals.
To complete our look at segment performance, I'll now turn the call over to Mark Douglas for a review of our Industrial Chemicals segment. Mark?"
28606,146134721,218411,"FMC Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2012",2012-02-09,"Earnings Calls","FMC Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Pierre. Good morning ,everyone.

A pleasure to be with you today on our Industrial Chemicals segment, review our fourth quarter performance and provide you with our 2012 outlook. In that respect, Industrial Chemicals performance in 2011 was a clear reflection of the significant steps taken in 2010 to realign and transform our businesses to deliver higher performance. Higher performance in the form of less sensitivity to economic cycles, sustained higher margins, greater earnings stability, stronger cash generation and superior returning assets.
In my view, 2011 was the first year in which you could see the true strength of our soda ash business and our increasing shift towards Specialty Peroxygens.
In 2011, sales of $1.04 billion increased 11% and earnings of $155 million grew 26%, excluding the prior-year impact of exited businesses.
The result in operating income margin of 14.9% continues to significantly increase and is on track to achieve the 20% operating margin objective in our Vision 2015 plan. In comparison, the operating margin reported in 2009 was 9% and 2010 was 12%.
Moving to the fourth quarter 2011 performance, sales of $277 million increased 14% from the year ago quarter excluding the impact of exited businesses driven by higher selling prices for the soda ash and peroxygens and volume growth in soda ash.
Earnings of $42 million increased 47% versus the year-ago quarter as a result of the broad-based sales gains, greater soda ash volume as our Granger plant came online, the absence of prior-year boiler tube repair costs and the favorable mix shift toward Specialty Peroxygens.
In soda ash, volumes remained firm throughout the fourth quarter.  Export demand through ANSAC remain strong and we benefited from higher ANSAC prices as better than anticipated market conditions for soda ash in Asia created a rising price environment. As we commented on in prior quarters, These tight market conditions were driven primarily by increased China synthetic production costs.
Our domestic volume also held well through the quarter with demand constant in our magic glass chemical and detergent markets.
In Peroxygens, sales and earnings growth was driven by higher selling prices in all product and regions augmented by volume growth in European hydrogen peroxide and in our specialty growth initiatives focused on environmental, energy and antimicrobial markets.
With that summary of the fourth quarter of 2011 completed, I'll now shift to our 2012 outlook for Industrial Chemicals. 
In a sentence, we are anticipating yet another strong year. On a full-year basis, we expect earnings to increase approximately 20% driven by higher volumes and selling prices and our continued portfolio shift towards Specialty Peroxygens.
Before commenting specifically in each businesses, allow me first to summarize at the segment level the impacts of the 3 major drivers of profitability for the segment. Volumes, selling prices and input costs.
First, volume. We are experiencing an increased demand across our businesses particularly in soda ash export markets and in specialty peroxygens serving environmental, food and aseptic packaging applications. Overall across the Industrial Chemicals, we expect aggregate net volumes to positively impact earnings by approximately $22 million in 2012.
Regarding pricing impacts in 2012. As many of you know, the significant majority of this segment's business has tended to be on an annual or semiannual contracts rather than on a spot basis. Though this will remain true for domestic soda ash and global peroxygens in 2012, our export soda ash business, as it did last year, were once again have a large degree of quarterly contracts mainly in Asia.
Overall, we expect aggregate net price tailwinds of approximately $38 million for the segment in 2012.
And finally input costs. In aggregate, raw material, energy, soda ash royalty payments and other input costs for the segment in 2012 will result in headwinds of $30 million when compared to 2011.
The majority of this cost increase is driven by 2 factors. Firstly, the recent reversal of federal soda ash royalty rates, now raised to 6% from the previous 2%. And secondly, the renegotiation of the long term coal supply contract for our soda ash business following the expiry of our previous contract.
I will now review each business in more detail starting with soda ash. 
As we begin 2012, the global soda ash market remains healthy. Global demand is expected to reach an all-time high in 2012, growing 5% over the previous high in 2011 and taking global demand up to 55 million tons. Despite this record, and as it did last year, the world will remain oversupplied with an excess of high-cost synthetic soda ash capacity primarily based in China and Europe. In 2012, we expect the overall global capacity utilization rate to be in the low 80% range. However, given that the U.S. is the base for the world's lowest-cost natural soda ash production, we fully expect to be running at maximum capacity rates throughout 2012.
In the U.S. market, demand continues at a solid pace though lower than other parts of the world, where demand is more robust. We expect U.S. demand in 2012 to grow by 2% to 3% driven by flat glass containers and chemicals. As a point of reference in the domestic market, glass in all forms makes up 47% of market demand. 
Turning to pricing. In North America, increases in soda ash prices for 2012 vary by customer depending on contract provisions. We realized an average increase in the domestic market that was in line with our expectations and comparable to the prior year's increases. In export markets, ANSAC expects to increase average prices in 2012 and at the same time maintain their market share.
During 2011 ANSAC demonstrated its ability to maintain its market share while increasing prices as the cost of synthetic production increased. A very clear reflection of this was the decline of Chinese export volume in 2011 to 1.5 million tons, a low level not seen since 2004.
Given the high utilization rates of U.S. producers, Latin American customers primary comps during the traditional contract negotiations with security of supply. This dynamic has afforded ANSAC the ability to maintain its significant supply position into Latin America, as well as raise price.
In Asia, as expected, we achieved the highest price increases. Given the shorter contractual dynamic in Asia, we are keeping a close watch in Asia demand to ensure ANSAC maintains pricing strength while holding market share.
As we have commented before, over the longer term, we fully expect prices to continue to rise in Asia as the cost of synthetic production from China continues to escalate, driven by higher input costs for energy, such as electricity and coal, raw materials such as salt and ammonia, labor and the strengthening currency.
As with prior years, the rate of price increases in the export market will be materially higher and will result in export and domestic pricing that is almost at parity. The net result of domestic and export pricing actions is an expected $1 per ton increase in global average pricing in the low double digits. These pricing moves was of the global average selling price FOB Wyoming in the low $1.40s per short ton.
Given our world-class, low cost position in natural soda ash and the projections for continuing demand growth, we restarted our Granger facility mid last year. We are now producing at the 500,000 tons per year rate. For comparison, we produced just over 200,000 tons from Granger in 2011.
In addition, we are in the mid- stage of an engineering study to look at the feasibility and timing for bringing on-stream a further 700,000 tons of soda ash capacity at our Granger facility. We will make this decision as we move through 22012.
In summary, our soda ash business will once again deliver significant earnings growth in 2012. Let me remind you, however, that we own 87.5% of the earnings stream of our soda ash business. The balance is owned by our 2 Japanese partners. 
Moving now to Peroxygens. We look for a record year in peroxygens driven primarily by continued growth in specialty markets such as in persulfates and peracetic acid while we primarily compete with technology solutions different than ours. We see robust growth particularly in environmental, food safety, electronics and oill fill markets, were our products offer customers unique quality, performance and technology.
With an incremental benefit of the green in nature and meeting sustainability goals.
As we noted in last quarter's call, we strengthened our portfolio late last year with acquisitions of RheinPerChemie and Adventus, both support our drive into specialties and expand our geographic reach.
Prices in 2012 are expected to be higher across Peroxygens product lines driven by mobile and supply demand dynamics. We expect to benefit further from continued manufacturing cost reductions and realignment projects across our plant network.
Let me conclude this detailed outlook for the businesses that comprise industrial chemicals by summarizing our 2012 aggregate view for the segment.
We expect full-year 2012 revenue to increase approximately 10% driven by higher selling prices in soda ash and peroxygens and volume growth in soda ash export markets.
We expect full-year 2012 earnings to be up approximately 20% driven by the sales gains and the continued mix shift towards specialty peroxygens. And for the first quarter, we expect segment earnings to be up approximately 10% versus last year, lower than our full-year forecast for 20% year-on-year growth. This is mainly due to soda ash mix, increased soda ash royalties based our mining plant and operational expenses that we were carrying in the quarter. Partially offsetting these factors is the increased volume from our Granger plant. Clearly, we expect yet another strong performance from our industrial Chemicals group. With that, I look forward to taking your questions during the Q&A period and we'll now turn the call back to Pierre."

I'd like to now share with you the progress we made in 2011 implementing our Vision 2015 strategic plan. Recall that is something I intend to do twice annually, at the midpoint of each year and at year end. When we announced Vision 2015 in December 2010, we set out a plan with an overriding objective to drive total quartile shareholder return. Our plan included an aggressive growth target aiming to reach $4.2 billion in sales in 2015 solely through organic growth and augmenting the growth with external growth opportunities to drive 2015 sales to $5 billion overall.
As I look at our 2011 results, we are solidly on track to meet these objectives. We delivered robust organic sales growth of 13% in 2011 and more than 1.5x the annual organic growth rate required to reach our $4.2 billion 2015 target.
Further, we continue to see rich opportunities for organic growth across all of our business, which gives us the potential to accelerate our sales to $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in 2015.
And on the bottom line, our 2011 results continued to demonstrate the earnings power investors should expect from the FMC portfolio. Earnings before interest and taxes grew 13% versus 2010, a rate consistent with the average annual growth rate required to deliver our Vision 2015 organic EBIT goal of $1 billion.
During 2011, we took several steps to support the continued delivery of this higher level of organic growth. We established leadership teams in Asia, Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe and Turkey to work across our businesses to drive faster growth in revenues and economies.
We have already seen results with more than 46% of 2011 sales coming from our versus 40% in 2009. We also invested in critical infrastructure including breaking ground for Asia Innovation Center, which will house other cultural product BioPolymer and Lithium and commercial team to accelerate our growth largely tailoring products to group of markets in the region. We expect the center to be operational in early 2013. We continued our organizational evolution to better capture the value of, seeking from a highly centralized organization to balance, centralize de-centralized model to better our sales size and scale. Particularly in disciplines that transcend business and regions such as procurement, strategic planning, M&A communications and most recently operation by acting as we are realizing matters, increase efficiency while maintaining strong in our business unit.
We also made great progress in our Exxon initiative. Though externally derived, sales growth was not a marginal factor in 2011 as nearly all of our initiatives caused during the fourth quarter last year, I'm excited by the potential for the eighth transaction closed in 2011.
In our Agricultural Products Group we acquired the Rovral and Sportak fungicide product line from Bayer CropScience. These established fungicides are highly effective, management technologies that are used worldwide with brands well recognized by leading agricultural customers around the world.
We entered into 2 exclusive agreements covering development and distribution of biological with for agricultural and augmental market and marine bio innovations for bioside in Latin America. We also established, a new Argentinian company agricultural chemical company enabling FMC to accelerate its growth in Argentina as $1.7 billion crop protection market. Similar in Latin America.
In our Specialty Chemicals Group, we acquired BioGroup, a specialty food manufacturer based in Chile. BioGroup provides FMC an entry into the natural market, a rapidly growing market expected to reach more than $1 billion in size by 2015.
And as Mark said his remarks, in our Industrial Chemicals Group, we made 2 acquisitions and formed 1 joint venture. These 8 transactions will present meaningful steps for us in reaching our $5 billion 2015 sales goal. Collectively in 2012, they are expected to add more than $90 million in sales, $15 million in EBIT and to the accretive EPS by $0.07.
Including the related growth organic investments to further the growth of each of these transactions, we are on track to meet our goal for external growth to continue to $800 million or more in 2015 revenues.
I will now turn the call over to Kim Foster for a report on our financial strength and enabling achievement of our Vision 2015 objective. Kim?"

FMC showed strong cash generation in 2011 with free cash flow of $180 million. This is lower than our previous guidance of $200 million to $225 million largely due to a shift in financing of results receivable",602,"Thanks, Pierre, and good morning, everyone. 
FMC showed strong cash generation in 2011 with free cash flow of $180 million. This is lower than our previous guidance of $200 million to $225 million largely due to a shift in financing of results receivables to higher cost local financing to lower cost U.S. financing sources.
Cumulative free cash flow over the planned period reached $236 million, on track to meet our $2 billion cummulative free cash flow goal for 2010 to 2015.
For 2012, free cash flow is projected at $225 million to $250 million. This projection is after capital expenditures of approximately $250 million to support expansion initiatives in BioPolymer, Lithium and Soda Ash.
As I do each quarter, let me remind you that our free cash flow projections do not include funds for acquisitions for share repurchases. Consistent with the Vision 2015 plan, cash deployment in 2011 was balanced across reinvestment in our existing businesses, external growth and returning cash to shareholders.
Capital expenditures of $190 million in 2011 was at a faster pace than originally anticipated in Vision 2015 reflecting a stronger outlook for organic growth that we now see.
We deployed just under $20 million through our internal growth initiatives, which represent an 8.9x forward multiple of 2012 EBITDA for these transactions, a lower multiple than project in our Vision 2015 plan and further evidenced of the discipline and value creating focus of our external building strategy.
And alongside these focused investments, we returned $206 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2011. Cumulative cash returned to shareholders over the planned period reached $378 million, well ahead of the pace required to reach our target of at least $1 billion returned to shareholders cumulatively through 2015.
In December of last year, we announced a $200 million buyback with the intention of completing the repurchases by the end of the first quarter this year. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 55 million shares, which is included in the numbers I just gave you. We fully expect to complete the remaining $145 million by the end of the first quarter. Return on invested capital for 2011 expanded 160 basis points to 23.9% demonstrating clearly the earnings power of the FMC portfolio. With our rich organic growth opportunities, robust external growth pipeline and disciplined cash deployment, we are confident we'll be able to maintain our return invested capital measurably above our mid-teens target while delivering our Vision 2015 growth goals.
And finally let me outline our tax rate for 2011 and provide our projection for 2012. As Pierre mentioned, we benefited in 2011 from the achievement of a 26.3% tax rate, considerably lower than our prior guidance of 29% due to a higher component of foreign sourced earnings, which are taxed at lower rate than the domestic earnings.
To address a recalibration question, you will likely have, if you were to recalibrate our fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $1.58 per diluted share using the prior guidance rate and associated higher duties, our adjusted earnings would've been $1.37 per diluted share.  But this recalibration is largely academic as we continue to increase our presence in rapidly developing economies both in sourcing our products and revenues and our overall tax rate has reduced to this new level. With our plans to continue to invest in these economies, we would expect this lower tax rate to be a sustaining contributor to our higher earnings profile. For 2012, we're projecting a 27% tax rate.
Thank you, and I look forward to taking your questions. I will now turn the call back to you, Pierre?"

As you've seen, 2011 was a year of major progress toward the achievement of our Vision 2015 objectives. I am increasingly confident in our ability to meet or exceed the long-term targets we set for ourselves back in December 2010.
$5 billion or more in sales, $1.2 billion in EBIT with return and capital sustainable to midteens, we are maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet and the disciplined cash inflows.
We believe then as we do now that our Vision 2015 plan was the right plan to deliver these achievements. Moving to our outlook for 2012, we plan to deliver another record year with full-year adjusted earnings of $6.70 to $7.05 per diluted share, a 15% increase versus 2011 at the midpoint of the range.
Our Agricultural Products segment expects to achieve its ninth straight year of recording earnings of approximately 10% versus the prior year, driven by expected strong market condition and growth in new and easily introduced product while increasing spending on growth initiatives.
Our Specialty Chemicals segment plan to deliver its seventh straight year of record earnings, up approximately 10% versus last year reflecting higher sales across all businesses.
In Industrial Chemicals, we expect earnings to increase approximately 20% driven by higher volume and selling price across the segment and the continued mix shift towards Specialty Peroxygens.
Moving to our outlook for the first quarter of 2012, we expect adjusted earnings of $1.70 to $1.90 per diluted share, a 21% increase versus last year at the midpoint of this range.
In Agricultural Products, we look for first quarter earnings to be up approximately 20%, reflecting robust early season demand in North America coupled with the expected shift to some sales in the region from the second quarter, a strong finish to the crops in Brazil and volume gains in Asia and EMEA.
In Specialty Chemicals, we expect first quarter earnings to be level to a year ago as higher selling prices in all BioPolymer and Lithium product lines are offset by higher raw material and energy costs and one-time operating costs related to capacity expansion projects.
In Lithium, we will incur about 6 weeks of downtime across our and lithium plant in Argentina as we complete the tie in enabling the 30% capacity expansion.
As previously communicated, product from the expansion is planned to enter the market by midyear. Meanwhile in BioPolymer, we will take a planned outage associated with the alginates capacity expansion at our facility in Norway. This expansion is largely in support of our pharmaceutical business. The additional capacity will be brought on later in the first quarter.
The impact of the Lithium and BioPolymer outages will be contained through the first quarter. In the absence of this impact, segment earnings would've increased 10% to 13% consistent with the segment plan lined performance.
And as Mark mentioned, in Industrial Chemicals earnings, are expected to be up approximately 10% driven by higher selling prices in soda ash and peroxygen, the benefit of volume growth in soda ash export market and the continued shift towards Specialty Peroxygens.

Since that time, we actually globalized the business. And if you look back in 2011 on a global basis, it was probably close to that 75-25 range on a global basis rather than just North America. But I would say in 2012 going forward, we are much more likely to be closer to a 60-40 mix. So 60% commodity and 40% specialty. I would also like to point out that we value both of these businesses. We need the commodity business to run our plans, we need the volume to plans to get our operating rates. But our focus is clearly aseptic packaging, our environment applications, our electronics business. From a margin perspective, they are fundamentally different in terms of margin production. Commodity businesses are very low double digits in terms of gross margins and then the specialty side is anywhere from 45% to 75% gross margin depending on the application. So you can tell the mix shift plays an important part for us and we're driving that hard. Without driving the mix shift hard, we're driving the geographic expansion hard. We recently put people into China for aseptic packaging and with our GregRheinPerChemie in Germany, that affords us opportunities to improve our environmental business into Central and Eastern Europe.

Our fourth quarter results provided a strong finish to a year of remarkable accomplishments for FMC. We achieved record financial performance in 2011 and made great progress implementing our Vision 2015 strategy plan. 
Here is a brief summary of our accomplishments in 2011. Sales and EBIT both increased 13%, excluding the prior year impact of exited businesses. Earnings per diluted share grew by 21%. Free cash flow of $180 million was generated. Return on invested capital increased to 23.9%. Agricultural Products delivered eighth year of record earnings. Specialty Chemicals achieved sixth consecutive years of record earnings led by the seventh consecutive year of record earnings on BioPolymer. Industrial Chemicals realized robust earnings growth, the highest profit growth among our segments on the strength of our soda ash business and continued shift towards Specialty Peroxygens. 
Across our businesses, we completed 4 company or product line acquisition, formed 2 joint ventures and established 2 product development and distribution agreements, all designed to strategically broaden our capacity to serve customers and enable us to capitalize on organic market growth opportunities. And alongside these external growth initiatives, we returned $206 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchase. 
2011 indeed was a very good year for us and we are confident that we'll deliver another record year in 2012.
Moving to our fourth quarter 2011 results. Sales of $909 million increased by 17% last year excluding the prior year impact of exited businesses. Adjusted earnings of $1.58 per diluted share increased 44% versus the year quarter ago. This stable adjusted earnings is well above the $1.30 to $1.40 range in the guidance we issued last quarter as we benefited from lower tax rate than projected in our previous guidance. We do expect this lower tax rate to be a sustaining contributor to our highest earnings profile going forward. Kim will review the details of this lower tax rate later in our call.
Our gross margin of $294 million increased by 11% versus last year, while on a percent basis our percent gross margin essentially equaled that of last year.
SG&A spend of $115 million was leveled to a year ago despite the significant sales gain. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $145 million increased 24% versus last year. On a regional basis looking at the result, excluding the prior year impact of exited business, we have clearly demonstrated our continued success in penetrating rapidly developing economies. Asia has the highest sales growth, up 15%, as Specialty Chemicals nearly doubled. Latin America, grew 30%, driven by robust growth in ag product and soda ash while EMEA increased 11%.
Let's take a more detailed look at the performance of operating segments in the quarter. First in Agricultural Products. First quarter sales of $409 million increased 22% versus the year ago quarter led by robust sales growth in Latin America. The sales gain in Latin America were driven by strong demand in key Brazilian market segments, such as cotton and sugar cane, as well as the new product in production and sales from a new venture in Argentina. Sales in EMEA increased significantly based on the strength of insecticide and herbicide sales in France and Italy. In North America, sales were lower than a year ago due to a shift into turning of fall application sales, where we recorded in the third quarter of this year versus the fourth quarter of last year. In Asia, sales were essentially leveled to a year ago as higher insecticide volumes in China, Indonesia and Korea were offset by lower lower herbicide volumes due to less favorable weather conditions in China, Pakistan and India, which impacted the regions with crops.
Segment earnings of $73 million increased 17% versus a year ago, driven by the higher sales, partially offset by higher raw material and manufacturing costs, as well as increased spending on targeted organic and excellent growth initiatives.
Moving now to Specialty Chemicals. Fourth quarter revenues of $223 million increased 9% versus the prior year quarter driven by higher selling price across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer, especially in Asian food and pharmaceutical markets, as well as in downstream lithium specialties.
Segment earnings of $51 million increased 11% versus the prior year driven by the sales gain and favorable mix, which more than offset higher raw materials and energy costs and increased spending on targeted organic and excellent growth initiatives.
In BioPolymer, we realized volumes gain in all 3 product lines coupled with higher selling price in key market segments. On the demand side, microcrystalline cellulose, or MCC, continued to realize the highest growth rate. In food ingredients, we continue to see robust demand growth in dairy and beverage market in Asia especially in China.
And in pharmaceutical excipients, a strong position service engineering manufacturers in India continue to offer the higher growth.
BioPolymer earnings growth was driven by the higher sales and favorable mix, which more than offset higher raw material costs and spending on targeted growth initiatives. Pricing gains realized in the quarter more than offset higher raw material costs. Principally higher wood pulp and seaweed costs.
Moving now to Lithium. Sales gain were driven by higher selling prices in both primaries and specialties and volume gain in energy storage and synthesis markets. The Asian energy storage market continue to be the highest growth driver supplemented by steady growth in butyllithium and other downstream products, which serve polymer and pharmaceuticals synthesis markets.
So in summary a very strong finish to a record years in both Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals.
To complete our look at segment performance, I'll now turn the call over to Mark Douglas for a review of our Industrial Chemicals segment. Mark?"
28606,146134721,218812,"FMC Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2012",2012-02-09,"Earnings Calls","FMC Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Pierre. Good morning, everyone.

In many respects, Industrial Chemicals' strong performan",1651,"Thank you, Pierre. Good morning, everyone. A pleasure to be with you today to highlight our Industrial Chemicals segment, review our fourth quarter performance and provide you with our 2012 outlook. In many respects, Industrial Chemicals' strong performance in 2011 was a clear reflection of the significant steps taken in 2010 to realign and transform our businesses to deliver higher performance. Higher performance in the form of less sensitivity to the economic cycles, sustained higher margins, greater earnings stability, stronger cash generation and superior return on assets.
In my view, 2011 was the first year in which you could see the true strength of our soda ash business and our increasing shift towards Specialty Peroxygens.
In 2011, sales of $1.04 billion increased 11% and earnings of $155 million grew 26%, excluding the prior year impact of exited businesses. The result in operating income margin of 14.9% continues to significantly increase and is on track to achieve the 20% operating margin objective in our Vision 2015 plan. For comparison, the operating margin reported in 2009 was 9% and in 2010 was 12%.
Moving to the fourth quarter 2011 performance. Sales of $277 million increased 14% from the year ago quarter excluding the impact of exited businesses driven by higher selling prices for soda ash and peroxygens and volume growth in soda ash.
Earnings of $42 million increased 47% versus the year ago quarter as a result of the broad-based sales gains, greater soda ash volume as our Granger plant came online, the absence of prior year boiler tube repair costs and the favorable mix shift toward Specialty Peroxygens.
In soda ash, volumes remained firm throughout the fourth quarter.  Export demand through ANSAC remain strong and we benefited from higher ANSAC prices as tighter than anticipated market conditions for soda ash in Asia created a rising price environment. As we have commented on in prior quarters, these tight market conditions were driven primarily by increased China synthetic production costs.
Our domestic volume also held up well through the quarter with the demand constant in our magic glass chemical and detergent markets.
In Peroxygens, sales and earnings growth was driven by higher selling prices in all product and regions augmented by volume growth in European hydrogen peroxide and in our specialty growth initiatives focused on environmental, energy and antimicrobial markets.
With that summary of the fourth quarter of 2011 completed, I'll now shift to our 2012 outlook for Industrial Chemicals. 
In a sentence, we are anticipating yet another strong year. On a full-year basis, we expect earnings to increase approximately 20% driven by higher volumes and selling prices and our continued portfolio shift towards Specialty Peroxygens.
Before commenting specifically in each businesses, allow me first to summarize at the segment level the impacts of the 3 major drivers of profitability for the segment. Volumes, selling prices and input costs.
First, volume. We are experiencing an increased demand across our businesses particularly in soda ash export markets and in specialty peroxygens serving environmental, food and aseptic packaging applications. Overall across the Industrial Chemicals, we expect aggregate net volumes to positively impact earnings by approximately $22 million in 2012.
Regarding pricing impacts in 2012. As many of you know, the significant majority of this segment's business has tended to be on an annual or semiannual contracts rather than on a spot basis. Though this will remain true for domestic soda ash and global peroxygens in 2012, our export soda ash business, as it did last year, were once again have a large degree of quarterly contracts mainly in Asia.
Overall, we expect aggregate net price tailwinds of approximately $38 million for the segment in 2012.
And finally, input costs. In aggregate, raw material, energy, soda ash royalty payments and other input costs for the segment in 2012 will result in headwinds of $30 million when compared to 2011.
The majority of this cost increase is driven by 2 factors. Firstly, the recent reversal of federal soda ash royalty rates, now raised to 6% from the previous 2%. And secondly, the renegotiation of the long term coal supply contract for our soda ash business following the expiry of our previous contract.
I will now review each business in more detail starting with soda ash. 
As we begin 2012, the global soda ash market remains healthy. Global demand is expected to reach an all-time high in 2012, growing 5% over the previous high in 2011 and taking global demand up to 55 million tons. Despite this record, and as it did last year, the world will remain oversupplied with an excess of high-cost synthetic soda ash capacity primarily based in China and Europe. In 2012, we expect the overall global capacity utilization rate to be in the low 80% range. However, given that the U.S. is the base for the world's lowest-cost natural soda ash production, we fully expect to be running at maximum capacity rates throughout 2012.
In the U.S. market, demand continues at a solid pace though lower than other parts of the world, where demand is more robust. We expect U.S. demand in 2012 to grow by 2% to 3% driven by flat glass containers and chemicals. As a point of reference in the domestic market, glass in all forms makes up 47% of market demand. 
Turning to pricing. In North America, increases in soda ash prices for 2012 vary by customer depending on contract provisions. We realized an average increase in the domestic market that was in line with our expectations and comparable to the prior year's increases. In export markets, ANSAC expects to increase average prices in 2012 and at the same time maintain their market share.
During 2011 ANSAC demonstrated its ability to maintain its market share while increasing prices as the cost of synthetic production increased. A very clear reflection of this was the decline of Chinese export volume in 2011 to 1.5 million tons, a low level not seen since 2004.
Given the high utilization rates of U.S. producers, Latin American customers' primary concern during the 2012 contract negotiations was security of supply. This dynamic has afforded ANSAC the ability to maintain its significant supply position into Latin America, as well as raise price.
In Asia, as expected, we achieved the highest price increases. Given the shorter contractual dynamic in Asia, we are keeping a close watch in Asia demand to ensure ANSAC maintains pricing strength while holding market share.
As we have commented before, over the longer term, we fully expect prices to continue to rise in Asia as the cost of synthetic production from China continues to escalate, driven by higher input costs for energy, such as electricity and coal, raw materials such as salt and ammonia, labor and the strengthening currency.
As with prior years, the rate of price increases in the export market will be materially higher and will result in export and domestic pricing that is almost at parity. The net result of domestic and export pricing actions is an expected $1 per ton increase in global average pricing in the low double digits. These pricing moves will result in a global average selling price FOB Wyoming in the low $1.40s per short ton.
Given our world-class, low-cost position in natural soda ash and the projections for continuing demand growth, we restarted our Granger facility mid last year. We are now producing at the full 500,000 tons per year rate. For comparison, we produced just over 200,000 tons from Granger in 2011.
In addition, we are in the mid stage of an engineering study to look at the feasibility and timing for bringing on-stream a further 700,000 tons of soda ash capacity at our Granger  facility. We will make this decision as we move through 22012.
In summary, our soda ash business will once again deliver significant earnings growth in 2012. Let me remind you, however, that we own 87.5% of the earnings stream of our soda ash business. The balance is owned by our 2 Japanese partners. 
Moving now to Peroxygens. We look for a record year in peroxygens driven primarily by continued growth in specialty markets such as in persulfates and peracetic acid while we primarily compete with technology solutions different than ours. We see robust growth particularly in environmental, food safety, electronics and oil fill markets, where our products offer customers unique quality, performance and technology, with an incremental benefit of being green in nature and meeting sustainability goals.
As we noted in last quarter's call, we strengthened our portfolio late last year with the acquisitions of RheinPerChemie and Adventus, both support our drive to specialties and extend our geographic reach.
Prices in 2012 are expected to be higher across Peroxygens product lines driven by mobile and supply and demand dynamics. We expect to benefit further from continued manufacturing cost reductions and realignment projects across our plant network.
Let me conclude this detailed outlook for the businesses that comprise industrial chemicals by summarizing our 2012 aggregate view for the segment.
We expect full year 2012 revenue to increase approximately 10% driven by higher selling prices in soda ash and peroxygens and volume growth in soda ash export markets.
We expect full year 2012 earnings to be up approximately 20% driven by the sales gains and the continued mix shift towards specialty peroxygens. And for the first quarter, we expect segment earnings to be up approximately 10% versus last year, lower than our full year forecast for 20% year-on-year growth. This is mainly due to soda ash mix, increased soda ash royalties based on our mining plan and operational expenses that are occurring in the quarter. Partially offsetting these factors is the increased volume from our Granger plant. Clearly, we expect yet another strong performance from our industrial and Chemicals group. With that, I look forward to taking your questions during the Q&A period and we'll now turn the call back to Pierre."

Recall that is something I intend to do twice annually, at the midpoint of each year and at year end. When we announced Vision 2015 i",730,"Thank you, Mark. I'd like to now share with you the progress we made in 2011 implementing our Vision 2015 strategic plan. Recall that is something I intend to do twice annually, at the midpoint of each year and at year end. When we announced Vision 2015 in December 2010, we set out a plan with an overriding objective to drive total quartile shareholder return. Our plan included an aggressive growth target aiming to reach $4.2 billion in sales in 2015 solely through organic growth and augmenting the growth with external growth opportunities to drive 2015 sales to $5 billion overall.
As I look at our 2011 results, we are solidly on track to meet these objectives. We delivered robust organic sales growth of 13% in 2011 and more than 1.5x the annual organic growth rate required to reach our $4.2 billion 2015 target.
Further, we continue to see rich opportunities for organic growth across all of our business, which gives us the potential to accelerate our sales to $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in 2015.
And on the bottom line, our 2011 results continued to demonstrate the earnings power investors should expect from the FMC portfolio. Earnings before interest and taxes grew 13% versus 2010, a rate consistent with the average annual growth rate required to deliver our Vision 2015 organic EBIT goal of $1 billion.
During 2011, we took several steps to support the continued delivery of this higher level of organic growth. We established leadership teams in Asia, Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe and Turkey to work across our businesses to drive faster growth in revenue-moving economies.
We have already seen results with more than 46% of 2011 sales coming from our versus 40% in 2009. We also invested in critical infrastructure, including breaking ground for Asia Innovation Center, which will house other cultural product BioPolymer and Lithium and commercial team to accelerate our growth largely tailoring products to group of markets in the region. We expect the center to be operational in early 2013. We continued our organizational evolution to better capture the value of [indiscernible] seeking from a highly decentralized organization to balance centralize, de-centralized model to better leverage our sales -- size and scale. Particularly in disciplines that transcend businesses and regions such as procurement, strategic planning, M&A communication and most recently operations by acting as one FMC-wide matters [ph] we are realizing increased efficiency while maintaining strong accountability in our business units.
We also made great progress in our external initiative. Though externally derived, sales growth was not a marginal factor in 2011 as nearly all of our initiatives grossed during the fourth quarter last year, I'm excited about the potential for the eighth transaction closed in 2011.
In our Agricultural Products Group we acquired the Rovral and Sportak fungicide product line from Bayer CropScience. These established fungicides are highly effective, resistance management technologies that are used worldwide with brands well recognized by leading agricultural customers around the world.
We entered into 2 exclusive agreements covering development and distribution of biological with Chr. Hansen for agricultural and ornamental market and Marrone Bio Innovations for biofungicide in Latin America. We also established Ruralco, a new Argentinian agricultural chemical distribution company, enabling FMC to accelerate its growth in Argentina as $1.7 billion crop protection market, the second largest in Latin America.
In our Specialty Chemicals Group, we acquired South Pole BioGroup, a specialty food ingredient manufacturer based in Chile. BioGroup provides FMC an entry into the natural colors market, a rapidly growing market expected to reach more than $1 billion in size by 2015.
And as Mark said in his remarks, in our Industrial Chemicals Group, we made 2 acquisitions and formed 1 joint venture. These 8 transactions will present meaningful steps for us in reaching our $5 billion 2015 sales goal. Collectively in 2012, they are expected to add more than $90 million in sales, $15 billion in EBIT and to be accretive EPS by $0.07.
Including the related growth organic investments to further the growth of each of these transactions, we are on track to meet our goal for external growth to continue to $800 million or more in 2015 revenues.
I will now turn the call over to Kim Foster for a report on our financial strength and its role in enabling the achievement of our Vision 2015 objective. Kim?"

FMC showed strong cash generation in 2011 with free cash flow of $180 million. This is lower than our previous guidance of $200 million to $225 million largely due to a shift in financing of Brazil's receivabl",603,"Thanks, Pierre, and good morning, everyone. 
FMC showed strong cash generation in 2011 with free cash flow of $180 million. This is lower than our previous guidance of $200 million to $225 million largely due to a shift in financing of Brazil's receivables from a higher cost local financing to lower cost U.S. financing sources.
Cumulative free cash flow over the planned period reached $436 million, on track to meet our $2 billion cumulative free cash flow goal for 2010 to 2015.
For 2012, free cash flow is projected at $225 million to $250 million. This projection is after capital expenditures of approximately $250 million to support expansion initiatives in BioPolymer, Lithium and Soda Ash.
As I do each quarter, let me remind you that our free cash flow projections do not include funds for acquisitions or share repurchases. Consistent with the Vision 2015 plan, cash deployment in 2011 was balanced across reinvestment in our existing businesses, external growth and returning cash to shareholders.
Capital expenditures of $190 million in 2011 was at a faster pace than originally anticipated in Vision 2015, reflecting the stronger outlook for organic growth that we now see.
We deployed just under $200 million through our external growth initiatives, which represent an 8.9x forward multiple of 2012 EBITDA for these transactions, a lower multiple than projected in our Vision 2015 plan and further evidence of the discipline and value creating-focus of our external growth strategy.
And alongside these focused investments, we returned $206 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2011. Cumulative cash returned to shareholders over the planned period reached $378 million, well ahead of the pace required to reach our target of at least $1 billion returned to shareholders cumulatively through 2015.
In December of last year, we announced a $200 million buyback with the intention of completing the repurchases by the end of the first quarter this year. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 55 million shares, which is included in the numbers I just gave you. We fully expect to complete the remaining $145 million by the end of the first quarter. Return on invested capital for 2011 expanded 160 basis points to 23.9%, demonstrating clearly the earnings power of the FMC portfolio. With our rich organic growth opportunities, robust external growth pipeline and disciplined cash deployment, we are confident we'll be able to maintain our return in invested capital measurably above our mid-teens target while delivering our Vision 2015 growth goals.
And finally let me outline our tax rate for 2011 and provide our projection for 2012. As Pierre mentioned, we benefited in 2011 from the achievement of a 26.3% tax rate, considerably lower than our prior guidance of 29% due to a higher component of foreign sourced earnings, which are taxed at lower rates than the domestic earnings.
To address a recalibration question, you will likely have, if we were to recalibrate our fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $1.58 per diluted share using the prior guidance rate and associated higher duties, our adjusted earnings would've been $1.37 per diluted share.  But this recalibration is largely academic as we continue to increase our presence in rapidly developing economies both in sourcing our products and revenues and our overall tax rate has reduced to this new level. With our plans to continue to invest in these economies, we would expect this lower tax rate to be a sustaining contributor to our higher earnings profile. For 2012, we're projecting a 27% tax rate.
Thank you, and I look forward to taking your questions. I will now turn the call back to you, Pierre?"

As you've seen, 2011 was a year of major progress toward the achievement of our Vision 2015 objectives. I am increasingly confident in our ability to meet or exceed the long-term targets we set for ourselves back in December 2010.
$5 billion or more in sales, $1.2 billion in EBIT with return on capital sustained above the midteens, we are maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet and disciplined cash inflows.
We believe then, as we do now, that our Vision 2015 plan was the right plan to deliver these objectives. Moving to our outlook for 2012, we plan to deliver another record year with full year adjusted earnings of $6.70 to $7.05 per diluted share, a 15% increase versus 2011 at the midpoint of the range.
Our Agricultural Products segment expects to achieve its ninth straight year of record earnings up approximately 10% versus the prior year, driven by expected strong market condition and growth in new and recently introduced product, while increasing spending on growth initiatives.
Our Specialty Chemicals segment plan to deliver its seventh straight year of record earnings, up approximately 10% versus last year reflecting higher sales across all businesses.
In Industrial Chemicals, we expect earnings to increase approximately 20% driven by higher volume and selling price across the segment and the continued mix shift towards Specialty Peroxygens.
Moving to our outlook for the first quarter of 2012. We expect adjusted earnings of $1.70 to $1.90 per diluted share, a 21% increase versus last year at the midpoint of this range.
In Agricultural Products, we look for first quarter earnings to be up approximately 20%, reflecting robust early season demand in North America, coupled with the expected shift to some sales in the region from the second quarter, a strong finish to the crops season in Brazil and volume gains in Asia and EMEA.
In Specialty Chemicals, we expect first quarter earnings to be level to a year ago as higher selling prices in all BioPolymer and lithium product lines are offset by higher raw material and energy costs and onetime operating costs related to capacity expansion projects.
In lithium, we will incur about 6 weeks of downtime across our brand and lithium carbonate plant in Argentina as we complete the tie-in, enabling the 30% capacity expansion.
As previously communicated, product from the expansion is planned to enter the market by midyear. Meanwhile in BioPolymer, we will take a planned outage associated with the alginates capacity expansion at our facility in Norway. This expansion is largely in support of our pharmaceutical business. The additional capacity will be brought on later in the first quarter.
The impact of the Lithium and BioPolymer outages will be contained to the first quarter. In the absence of this impact, segment earnings would've increased 10% to 13% consistent with the segments' planned line performance.
And as Mark mentioned, in Industrial Chemicals, earnings are expected to be up approximately 10% driven by higher selling prices in soda ash and peroxygen, the benefit of volume growth in soda ash export market and the continued shift towards Specialty Peroxygens.
With that, I thank you for your time and attention. I'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

But it goes along the line of this Bayer acquisition and these 2 products we have acquired goes along the line of all of the 8 transactions we are doing. And what we have been doing is we're proving that our approach to acquire potentially growing companies or additional product line, or new product lines, new segments for us in white space at low price, low multiple, giving us a product to grow, denies the need for any type of medium or large acquisition. I think we want to get to this $800 million of externally generated growth as we have in 2015 with this type of move. Now the Bayer move is excellent to us, it's a very good multiple, when I say good, I mean low, it is accretive on the first year. It increases our participation in the fungicide market, which we are trying to do. And certainly, Bayer is a great company for which we do have a lot of respect. It's a great partner, but I have to say we tend to have a, maybe, a stronger focus on this type of product and formulation capability and we do expect we should be able to take the growth rate of this product beyond what Bayer was doing with our participation in different geographies. So all in all it's an acquisition which will grow our ag portfolio very nicely. But I would expect more like that. I think that the story we would like to show in the future for all of FMC is 8 transaction this year and maybe it include a number or unless we're going to do 4, 5 or 8 but small transaction like that, which are contributing to the growth of the company without a lot of spending."

As you said, we just expanded 30%, but we do plan to grow 1 step beyond. I think we only had in the midterm, maybe 10,000 tons, maybe another 10,000 ton in the future. The question is we do have facilities, people and structure in Argentina. And we are very well established there. And how much would we have to pay to go to Chile, to diversify our source.

Basically what I said was we had the pricing in the low double digits dollars per ton. Obviously that indicates the spread -- the lowest amount of increase was in the domestic market and I would say that was in the single digits, mid to high. And then in ANSAC, the highest increases were in Asia, a significant double digit increases followed by Latin America. So quite a spread actually depending on local conditions. And as you know, both Latin America and Asia are important for ANSAC and very important for FMC. On the contract side, there has not been significant changes in terms of contract length. Obviously, domestic in North America, we have most, if not nearly all, on year or multi-year contracts. Latin America is predominantly year or multi-year contract. And Asia has anywhere from 30% to 50% on quarterly contracts, so that really hasn't changed much. So if that came across in the script, it was given a wrong impression. So Asia, more quarterly. And the rest of the world that we deal with, especially Latin America and domestic, more annual and multi-year."

I'll take the mix shift first. If you think back to what we presented at our Investor Day way back in 2010, we had a North American business that was essentially 75% what we would call commodity business, which is pulp and paper mining, and 25% specialty, which is all our persulfates and our peracetic acids and hydrogen peroxide and to other specialty application such as electronics. Since that time, we've actually globalized the business. And if you look back in 2011 on a global basis, it was probably close to that 75-25 range on a global basis rather than just North America. But I would say in 2012 going forward, we are much more likely to be closer to a 60-40 mix. So 60% commodity and 40% specialty. I would also like to point out that we value both of these businesses. We need the commodity business to run our plants. We need the volume through the plants to get our operating rates. But our focus is clearly on aseptic packaging, our environmental applications, the electronics business. From a margin perspective, they are fundamentally different in terms of margin production. Commodity businesses are very low double digits in terms of gross margins and then the specialty side is anywhere from 45% to 75% gross margin depending on the application. So you can tell the mix shift plays an important part for us and we're driving that hard. We're not only driving the mix shift hard, we're driving the geographic expansion hard. We recently put people into China for aseptic packaging and with our RheinPerChemie acquisition in Germany, that affords us opportunities to improve our environmental business into Central and Eastern Europe. I hope that helps."

Our fourth quarter results provided a strong finish to a year of remarkable accomplishments for FMC. We achieved record financial performance in 2011 and made great progress implementing our Vision 2015 stra",960,"Thank you, Brennen. And good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter results provided a strong finish to a year of remarkable accomplishments for FMC. We achieved record financial performance in 2011 and made great progress implementing our Vision 2015 strategy plan. 
Here is a brief summary of our accomplishments in 2011. Sales and EBIT both increased 13%, excluding the prior year impact of exited businesses. Earnings per diluted share grew by 21%. Free cash flow of $180 million was generated. Return on invested capital increased to 23.9%. Agricultural Products delivered its eighth year of record earnings. Specialty Chemicals achieved sixth consecutive years of record earnings led by the seventh consecutive year of record earnings on BioPolymer. Industrial Chemicals realized robust earning growth, the highest profit growth among our segments, on the strength of our soda ash business and continued shift towards Specialty Peroxygens. 
Across our businesses, we completed 4 company or product line acquisition, formed 2 joint ventures and established 2 product developments and distribution agreements, all designed to strategically broaden our capacity to serve customers and enable us to capitalize on organic market growth opportunities. And alongside these external growth initiatives, we returned $206 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchase. 
2011 indeed was a very good year for us and we are confident that we'll deliver another record year in 2012.
Moving to our fourth quarter 2011 results. Sales of $909 million increased by 17% last year excluding the prior year impact of exited businesses. Adjusted earnings of $1.58 per diluted share increased 44% versus the year quarter ago. This stable adjusted earnings is well above the $1.30 to $1.40 range in the guidance we issued last quarter as we benefited from a lower tax rate than projected in our previous guidance. We do expect this lower tax rate to be a sustaining contributor to our highest earnings profile going forward. Kim will review the details of this lower tax rate later in our call.
Our gross margin of $294 million increased by 11% versus last year, while on a percent basis our percent gross margin essentially equaled that of last year.
SG&A spend of $115 million was leveled to a year ago despite the significant sales gain. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $145 million increased 24% versus last year. On a regional basis looking at the result, excluding the prior year impact of exited business, we have clearly demonstrated our continued success in penetrating rapidly developing economies. Asia had the highest sales growth, up 15%, as Specialty Chemicals nearly doubled. Latin America, grew 30%, driven by robust growth in ag product and soda ash, while EMEA increased 11%.
Let's take a more detailed look at the performance of operating segments in the quarter. First in Agricultural Products. First quarter sales of $409 million increased 22% versus the year ago quarter led by robust sales growth in Latin America. The sales gain in Latin America were driven by strong demand in key Brazilian market segments, such as cotton and sugar cane, as well as by new product in production and sales from a new venture in Argentina. Sales in EMEA increased significantly based on the strength of insecticide and herbicide sales in France and Italy. In North America, sales were lower than a year ago due to a shift in the turning of fall application sales, where we recorded in the third quarter of this year versus the fourth quarter of last year. In Asia, sales were essentially leveled to a year ago as higher insecticide volumes in China, Indonesia and Korea were offset by lower herbicide volumes due to less favorable weather conditions in China, Pakistan and India, which impacted the regions with crops.
Segment earnings of $73 million increased 17% versus a year ago, driven by the higher sales, partially offset by higher raw material and manufacturing costs, as well as increased spending on targeted organic and external growth initiatives.
Moving now to Specialty Chemicals. Fourth quarter revenues of $223 million increased 9% versus the prior year quarter driven by higher selling price across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer, especially in Asian food and pharmaceutical markets, as well as in downstream lithium specialties.
Segment earnings of $51 million increased 11% versus the prior year driven by the sales gain and favorable mix, which more than offset higher raw materials and energy costs and increased spending on targeted organic and external growth initiatives.
In BioPolymer, we realized volumes gain in all 3 product lines coupled with higher selling price in key market segments. On the demand side, microcrystalline cellulose, or MCC, continued to realize the highest growth rate. In food ingredients, we continue to see robust demand growth in dairy and beverage market in Asia, especially in China.
And in pharmaceutical excipients, a strong position service generic manufacturers in India continue to offer the higher growth.
BioPolymer earnings growth was driven by the higher sales and favorable mix, which more than offset higher raw material costs and spending on targeted growth initiatives. Pricing gains realized in the quarter more than offset higher raw material costs, principally higher wood pulp and seaweed costs.
Moving now to Lithium. Sales gain were driven by higher selling prices in both primaries and specialties and volume gain in energy storage and synthesis markets. The Asian energy storage market continued to be the highest growth driver, supplemented by steady growth in butyllithium and other downstream products, which serve polymer and pharmaceuticals synthesis markets.
So in summary, a very strong finish to a record year in both Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals.
To complete our look at segment performance, I'll now turn the call over to Mark Douglas for a review of our Industrial Chemicals segment. Mark?"

In many respects, Industrial Chemicals' strong performa",1653,"Thank you, Pierre. Good morning, everyone. A pleasure to be with you today to highlight our Industrial Chemicals segment, review our fourth quarter performance, and provide you with our 2012 outlook. In many respects, Industrial Chemicals' strong performance in 2011 was a clear reflection of the significant steps taken in 2010 to realign and transform our businesses to deliver higher performance. Higher performance in the form of less sensitivity to the economic cycles, sustained higher margins, greater earnings stability, stronger cash generation and superior return on assets.
In my view, 2011 was the first year in which you could see the true strength of our soda ash business and our increasing shift towards Specialty Peroxygens.
In 2011, sales of $1.04 billion increased 11% and earnings of $155 million grew 26%, excluding the prior year impact of exited businesses. The result in operating income margin of 14.9% continues to significantly increase and is on track to achieve the 20% operating margin objective in our Vision 2015 plan. For comparison, the operating margin reported in 2009 was 9% and in 2010 was 12%.
Moving to the fourth quarter 2011 performance. Sales of $277 million increased 14% from the year ago quarter, excluding the impact of exited businesses, driven by higher selling prices for soda ash and peroxygens and volume growth in soda ash.
Earnings of $42 million increased 47% versus the year ago quarter as a result of the broad-based sales gains, greater soda ash volume as our Granger plant came online, the absence of prior year boiler tube repair costs, and the continued favorable mix shift toward Specialty Peroxygens.
In soda ash, volumes remained firm throughout the fourth quarter.  Export demand through ANSAC remained strong, and we benefited from higher ANSAC prices as tighter than anticipated market conditions for soda ash in Asia created a rising price environment. As we have commented on in prior quarters, these tight market conditions were driven primarily by increased China synthetic production costs.
Our domestic volume also held up well through the quarter with the demand constant in our magic glass chemical and detergent markets.
In Peroxygens, sales and earnings growth was driven by higher selling prices in all product and regions augmented by volume growth in European hydrogen peroxide and in our specialty growth initiatives focused on environmental, energy and antimicrobial markets.
With that summary of the fourth quarter of 2011 completed, I'll now shift to our 2012 outlook for Industrial Chemicals. 
In a sentence, we are anticipating yet another strong year. On a full-year basis, we expect earnings to increase approximately 20% driven by higher volumes and selling prices and our continued portfolio shift towards Specialty Peroxygens.
Before commenting specifically in each businesses, allow me first to summarize at the segment level the impacts of the 3 major drivers of profitability for the segment. Volumes, selling prices and input costs.
First, volume. We are experiencing an increased demand across our businesses, particularly in soda ash export markets and in specialty peroxygens serving environmental, food and aseptic packaging applications. Overall across the Industrial Chemicals, we expect aggregate net volumes to positively impact earnings by approximately $22 million in 2012.
Regarding pricing impacts in 2012. As many of you know, the significant majority of this segment's business has tended to be on an annual or semiannual contracts rather than on a spot basis. Though this will remain true for domestic soda ash and global peroxygens in 2012, our export soda ash business, as it did last year, will once again have a large degree of quarterly contracts, mainly in Asia.
Overall, we expect aggregate net price tailwinds of approximately $38 million for the segment in 2012.
And finally, input costs. In aggregate, raw material, energy, soda ash royalty payments and other input costs for the segment in 2012 will result in headwinds of $30 million when compared to 2011.
The majority of this cost increase is driven by 2 factors. Firstly, the recent reversal of federal soda ash royalty rates, now raised to 6% from the previous 2%. And secondly, the renegotiation of the long term coal supply contract for our soda ash business following the expiry of our previous contract.
I will now review each business in more detail starting with soda ash. 
As we begin 2012, the global soda ash market remains healthy. Global demand is expected to reach an all-time high in 2012, growing 5% over the previous high in 2011 and taking global demand up to 55 million tons. Despite this record, and as it did last year, the world will remain oversupplied with an excess of high-cost synthetic soda ash capacity primarily based in China and Europe. In 2012, we expect the overall global capacity utilization rate to be in the low 80% range. However, given that the U.S. is the base for the world's lowest-cost natural soda ash production, we fully expect to be running at maximum capacity rates throughout 2012.
In the U.S. market, demand continues at a solid pace, though lower than other parts of the world where demand is more robust. We expect U.S. demand in 2012 to grow by 2% to 3% driven by flat glass, glass containers and chemicals. As a point of reference in the domestic market, glass in all forms makes up 47% of market demand. 
Turning to pricing. In North America, increases in soda ash prices for 2012 vary by customer depending on contract provisions. We realized an average increase in the domestic market that was in line with our expectations and comparable to the prior year's increases. In export markets, ANSAC expects to increase average prices in 2012 and at the same time maintain their market share.
During 2011, ANSAC demonstrated its ability to maintain its market share while increasing prices as the cost of synthetic production increased. A very clear reflection of this was the decline of Chinese export volume in 2011 to 1.5 million tons, a low level not seen since 2004.
Given the high utilization rates of U.S. producers, Latin American customers' primary concern during the 2012 contract negotiations was security of supply. This dynamic has afforded ANSAC the ability to maintain its significant supply position into Latin America, as well as raise price.
In Asia, as expected, we achieved the highest price increases. Given the shorter contractual dynamic in Asia, we are keeping a close watch on Asia demand to ensure ANSAC maintains pricing strength while holding market share.
As we have commented before, over the longer term, we fully expect prices to continue to rise in Asia as the cost of synthetic production from China continues to escalate, driven by higher input costs for energy such as electricity and coal, raw materials such as salt and ammonia, labor, and the strengthening currency.
As with prior years, the rate of price increases in the export market will be materially higher and will result in export and domestic pricing that is almost at parity. The net result of domestic and export pricing actions is an expected $1 per ton increase in global average pricing in the low double digits. These pricing moves will result in a global average selling price FOB Wyoming in the low $1.40s per short ton.
Given our world-class, low-cost position in natural soda ash and the projections for continuing demand growth, we restarted our Granger facility mid last year. We are now producing at the full 500,000 tons per year rate. For comparison, we produced just over 200,000 tons from Granger in 2011.
In addition, we are in the mid stage of an engineering study to look at the feasibility and timing for bringing on-stream a further 700,000 tons of soda ash capacity at our Granger facility. We will make this decision as we move through 22012.
In summary, our soda ash business will once again deliver significant earnings growth in 2012. Let me remind you, however, that we own 87.5% of the earnings stream of our soda ash business. The balance is owned by our 2 Japanese partners. 
Moving now to Peroxygens. We look for a record year in Peroxygens driven primarily by continued growth in specialty markets such as in persulfates and peracetic acid while we primarily compete with technology solutions different than ours. We see robust growth, particularly in environmental, food safety, electronics and oil field markets, where our products offer customers unique quality, performance and technology, with an incremental benefit of being green in nature and meeting sustainability goals.
As we noted in last quarter's call, we strengthened our portfolio late last year with the acquisitions of RheinPerChemie and Adventus, both support our drive to specialties and extend our geographic reach.
Prices in 2012 are expected to be higher across Peroxygens product lines driven by mobile and supply and demand dynamics. We expect to benefit further from continued manufacturing cost reductions and realignment projects across our plant network.
Let me conclude this detailed outlook for the businesses that comprise industrial chemicals by summarizing our 2012 aggregate view for the segment.
We expect full year 2012 revenue to increase approximately 10%, driven by higher selling prices in soda ash and peroxygens and volume growth in soda ash export markets.
We expect full year 2012 earnings to be up approximately 20%, driven by the sales gains and the continued mix shift towards specialty peroxygens. And for the first quarter, we expect segment earnings to be up approximately 10% versus last year, lower than our full year forecast for 20% year-on-year growth. This is mainly due to soda ash mix, increased soda ash royalties based on our mining plan, and operational expenses that are occurring in the quarter. Partially offsetting these factors is the increased volume from our Granger plant. Clearly, we expect yet another strong performance from our industrial and Chemicals group. 
With that, I look forward to taking your questions during the Q&A period, and will now turn the call back to Pierre."

I'd like to now share with you the progress we made in 2011 implementing our Vision 2015 strategic plan.

I'd like to now share with you the progress we made in 2011 implementing our Vision 2015 strategic plan. Recall that is something I intend to do twice annually, at the midpoint of each year and at year end. When we announced Vision 2015 in December 2010, we set out a plan with an overriding objective to drive total quartile shareholder return. Our plan included an aggressive growth target aiming to reach $4.2 billion in sales in 2015 solely through organic growth and augmenting the growth with external growth opportunities to drive 2015 sales to $5 billion overall.
As I look at our 2011 results, we are solidly on track to meet these objectives. We delivered robust organic sales growth of 13% in 2011 and more than 1.5x the annual organic growth rate required to reach our $4.2 billion 2015 target.
Further, we continue to see rich opportunities for organic growth across all of our business, which gives us the potential to accelerate our sales to $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in 2015.
And on the bottom line, our 2011 results continued to demonstrate the earnings power investors should expect from the FMC portfolio. Earnings before interest and taxes grew 13% versus 2010, a rate consistent with the average annual growth rate required to deliver our Vision 2015 organic EBIT goal of $1 billion.
During 2011, we took several steps to support the continued delivery of this higher level of organic growth. We established regional leadership teams in Asia, Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe and Turkey to work across our businesses to drive faster growth in revenue-moving economies. We have already seen results with more than 46% of 2011 sales coming from all these versus 40% in 2009. 
We also invested in critical infrastructure, including breaking ground for Asia Innovation Center, which will house agricultural product BioPolymer and Lithium technical and commercial teams to accelerate our growth largely by tailoring products to local markets in the region. We expect the center to be operational in early 2013. We continued our organizational evolution to better capture the value of co-ownership shifting from a highly decentralized organization to balance centralize -- de-centralized model, to better leverage our sales -- size and scale. Particularly in disciplines that transcend businesses and regions such as procurement, strategic planning, M&A communication and most recently operations, by acting as one FMC where it matters, we are realizing increased efficiency while maintaining strong accountability in our business units.
We also made great progress in our external initiative. Though externally derived, sales growth was not a marginal factor in 2011 as nearly all of our initiatives closed during the fourth quarter last year, I'm excited about the potential for the eighth transaction closed in 2011.
In our Agricultural Products Group we acquired the Rovral and Sportak fungicide product line from Bayer CropScience. These established fungicides are highly effective, registrant management technologies that are used worldwide with brands well recognized by leading agricultural customers around the world.
We entered into 2 exclusive agreements covering development and distribution of biological with Chr. Hansen for agricultural and ornamental market and Marrone Bio Innovations for biofungicide in Latin America. We also established Ruralco, a new Argentinian agricultural chemical distribution company, enabling FMC to accelerate its growth in Argentina as $1.7 billion crop protection market, the second largest in Latin America.
In our Specialty Chemicals Group, we acquired South Pole BioGroup, a specialty food ingredient manufacturer based in Chile. BioGroup provides FMC an entry into the natural colors market, a rapidly growing market expected to reach more than $1 billion in size by 2015.
And as Mark said in his remarks, in our Industrial Chemicals Group, we made 2 acquisitions and formed 1 joint venture. These 8 transactions will present meaningful steps for us in reaching our $5 billion 2015 sales goal. Collectively in 2012, they are expected to add more than $90 million in sales, $15 billion in EBIT and to be accretive EPS by $0.07.
Including the related growth organic investments to further the growth of each of these transactions, we are on track to meet our goal for external growth to continue to $800 million or more in 2015 revenues.
I will now turn the call over to Kim Foster for a report on our financial strength and its role in enabling the achievement of our Vision 2015 objective. Kim?"

FMC showed strong cash generation in 2011 with free cash flow of $180 million. This is lower than our previous guidance of $200 million to $225 million largely due to a shift in financing of Brazil's receivables",603,"Thanks, Pierre. And good morning, everyone. FMC showed strong cash generation in 2011 with free cash flow of $180 million. This is lower than our previous guidance of $200 million to $225 million largely due to a shift in financing of Brazil's receivables from a higher cost local financing to lower cost U.S. financing sources.
Cumulative free cash flow over the planned period reached $436 million, on track to meet our $2 billion cumulative free cash flow goal for 2010 to 2015.
For 2012, free cash flow is projected at $225 million to $250 million. This projection is after capital expenditures of approximately $250 million to support expansion initiatives in BioPolymer, Lithium and Soda Ash.
As I do each quarter, let me remind you that our free cash flow projections do not include funds for acquisitions or share repurchases. Consistent with the Vision 2015 plan, cash deployment in 2011 was balanced across reinvestment in our existing businesses, external growth and returning cash to shareholders.
Capital expenditures of $190 million in 2011 was at a faster pace than originally anticipated in Vision 2015, reflecting the stronger outlook for organic growth that we now see.
We deployed just under $200 million through our external growth initiatives, which represent an 8.9x forward multiple of 2012 EBITDA for these transactions, a lower multiple than projected in our Vision 2015 plan and further evidence of the discipline and value creating-focus of our external growth strategy.
And alongside these focused investments, we returned $206 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2011. Cumulative cash returned to shareholders over the planned period reached $378 million, well ahead of the pace required to reach our target of at least $1 billion returned to shareholders cumulatively through 2015.
In December of last year, we announced a $200 million buyback with the intention of completing the repurchases by the end of the first quarter this year. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 55 million shares, which is included in the numbers I just gave you. We fully expect to complete the remaining $145 million by the end of the first quarter. Return on invested capital for 2011 expanded 160 basis points to 23.9%, demonstrating clearly the earnings power of the FMC portfolio. With our rich organic growth opportunities, robust external growth pipeline and disciplined cash deployment, we are confident we'll be able to maintain our return in invested capital measurably above our mid-teens target while delivering our Vision 2015 growth goals.
And finally let me outline our tax rate for 2011 and provide our projection for 2012. As Pierre mentioned, we benefited in 2011 from the achievement of a 26.3% tax rate, considerably lower than our prior guidance of 29% due to a higher component of foreign sourced earnings, which are taxed at lower rates than the domestic earnings.
To address a recalibration question, you will likely have, if we were to recalibrate our fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $1.58 per diluted share using the prior guidance rate and associated higher duties, our adjusted earnings would've been $1.37 per diluted share.  But this recalibration is largely academic as we continue to increase our presence in rapidly developing economies both in sourcing our products and revenues and our overall tax rate has reduced to this new level. With our plans to continue to invest in these economies, we would expect this lower tax rate to be a sustaining contributor to our higher earnings profile. For 2012, we're projecting a 27% tax rate.
Thank you, and I look forward to taking your questions. I will now turn the call back to you, Pierre?"

As you've seen, 2011 was a year of major progress toward the achievement of our Vision 2015 objectives. I am increasingly confident in our ability to meet or exceed the long-term targets we set for ourselves back in December 2010.$5 billion",535,"Thanks, Kim. As you've seen, 2011 was a year of major progress toward the achievement of our Vision 2015 objectives. I am increasingly confident in our ability to meet or exceed the long-term targets we set for ourselves back in December 2010.
$5 billion or more in sales, $1.2 billion in EBIT with return on capital sustained above the midteens, we are maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet and disciplined cash inflows.
We believe then, as we do now, that our Vision 2015 plan was the right plan to deliver these objectives. Moving to our outlook for 2012, we plan to deliver another record year with full year adjusted earnings of $6.70 to $7.05 per diluted share, a 15% increase versus 2011 at the midpoint of the range.
Our Agricultural Products segment expects to achieve its ninth straight year of record earnings, up approximately 10% versus the prior year, driven by expected strong market condition and growth in new and recently introduced product, while increasing spending on growth initiatives.
Our Specialty Chemicals segment plan to deliver its seventh straight year of record earnings, up approximately 10% versus last year, reflecting higher sales across all businesses.
In Industrial Chemicals, we expect earnings to increase approximately 20%, driven by higher volume and selling price across the segment, and the continued mix shift towards Specialty Peroxygens.
Moving to our outlook for the first quarter of 2012. We expect adjusted earnings of $1.70 to $1.90 per diluted share, a 21% increase versus last year at the midpoint of this range.
In Agricultural Products, we look for first quarter earnings to be up approximately 20%, reflecting robust early season demand in North America, coupled with the expected shift to some sales in the region from the second quarter, a strong finish to the crops season in Brazil and volume gains in Asia and EMEA.
In Specialty Chemicals, we expect first quarter earnings to be level to a year ago, as higher selling prices in all BioPolymer and lithium product lines are offset by higher raw material and energy costs and onetime operating costs related to capacity expansion projects.
In Lithium, we will incur about 6 weeks of downtime across our brand and lithium carbonate plant in Argentina as we complete the tie-in, enabling the 30% capacity expansion.
As previously communicated, product from the expansion is planned to enter the market by midyear. Meanwhile in BioPolymer, we will take a planned outage associated with the alginates capacity expansion at our facility in Norway. This expansion is largely in support of our pharmaceutical business. The additional capacity will be brought on later in the first quarter.
The impact of the Lithium and BioPolymer outages will be contained to the first quarter. In the absence of this impact, segment earnings would've increased 10% to 13% consistent with the segments' planned line performance.
And as Mark mentioned, in Industrial Chemicals, earnings are expected to be up approximately 10% driven by higher selling prices in soda ash and peroxygen, the benefit of volume growth in soda ash export market and the continued shift towards Specialty Peroxygens.
With that, I thank you for your time and attention. I'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

I think we want to get to this $800 million of external originated growth as we have in 2015 with this type of move. Now the Bayer move is excellent to us, it's a very good multiple. When I say ""good,"" I mean low. It is accretive on the first year. It increases our participation in the fungicide market, which we are trying to do. And certainly, Bayer is a great company for which we do have a lot of respect. It's a great partner. But I have to say we tend to have a, maybe, a stronger focus on this type of product and formulation capability, and we do expect we should be able to take the growth rate of this product beyond what Bayer was doing with our participation in different geographies. So all in all, it's an acquisition which will grow our ag portfolio very nicely. But I would expect more like that. I think that the story we would like to show in the future for all of FMC is 8 transaction this year, and maybe an incremental number, or one less or going to be 4, 5 or 8, but small transaction like that, which are contributing to the growth of the company without a lot of spending."

Basically what I said was we had the pricing in the low double digits dollars per ton. Obviously, that indicates a spread -- the lowest amount of increase was in the domestic market, and I would say that was in the single digits, mid to high. And then in ANSAC, the highest increases were in Asia, significant double digit increases, followed by Latin America. So quite a spread actually depending on local conditions. And as you know, both Latin America and Asia are important for ANSAC and very important for FMC. On the contract side, there has not been significant changes in terms of contract length. Obviously, domestic in North America, we have most, if not nearly all, on year or multi-year contracts. Latin America is predominantly year or multi-year contract. And Asia has anywhere from 30% to 50% on quarterly contracts, and that really hasn't changed much. So if that came across in the script, it was given a wrong impression. So Asia, more quarterly. And the rest of the world that we deal with, especially Latin America and domestic, more annual and multi-year."

I'll take the mix shift first. If you think back to what we presented at our Investor Day way back in 2010, we had a North American business that was essentially 75% what we would call commodity business, which is pulp and paper mining, and 25% specialty, which is all our persulfates and our peracetic acids and hydrogen peroxide into other specialty application such as electronics. Since that time, we've actually globalized the business. And if you look back in 2011 on a global basis, it was probably close to that 75-25 range on a global basis rather than just North America. But I would say in 2012 going forward, we are much more likely to be closer to a 60-40 mix. So 60% commodity and 40% specialty. I would also like to point out that we value both of these businesses. We need the commodity business to run our plants. We need the volume through the plants to get our operating rates. But our focus is clearly on aseptic packaging, our environmental applications, the electronics business. From a margin perspective, they are fundamentally different in terms of margin production. Commodity businesses are very low double digits in terms of gross margins, and then the specialty side is anywhere from 45% to 75% gross margin depending on the application. So you can tell, the mix shift plays an important part for us and we're driving that hard. We're not only driving the mix shift hard, we're driving the geographic expansion hard. We recently put people into China for aseptic packaging. And with our RheinPerChemie acquisition in Germany, that affords us opportunities to improve our environmental business into Central and Eastern Europe. I hope that helps."

As you saw in our earnings release, our first quarter results provided a very strong start to what we expect will be another record year for FMC. 
Summarizing our first quarter 2012 performance, sales of $951 million increased 18% above last year's first quarter and adjusted earnings of $1.94 per diluted share grew 30% versus year ago quarter. Agricultural Products delivered a robust performance in the quarter. Sales of $454 million increased 32%, driven by broad-based growth across Latin America, North America and Asia. Segment earnings of $130 million increased 29% versus the year ago quarter, driven by the sales gain partially offset by higher spending on several growth initiatives 
In Specialty Chemicals, the performance met our expectations. Sales of $216 million were up 3% as higher selling prices were achieved in all businesses, particularly in food, pharmaceuticals and lithium primary markets. Partially offsetting these pricing gains were lower volumes related to downtimes associated with capacity expansion and plant times at our Argentina lithium facility and, to a lesser degree, a BioPolymers alginate facility in Norway. Segment earnings of $44 million were down 1% as the sales gain were more than offset by higher weather-related operating costs in lithium, plant downtime effects, higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. 
In Industrial Chemicals, sales of $273 million increased 12%, driven by higher selling prices, especially in soda ash, and volume growth in soda ash and Specialty Peroxygens. Segment earnings of $48.1 million increased 19% as the results of the sales gains, favorable export mix in soda ash and the continued mix shift in peroxygens towards specialties markets. 
Taking a look at total company sales on a regional basis in the first quarter, sales in Latin America demonstrated the highest growth rate, up 38%, driven by Agricultural Products as a result of the strong finish through the crop season in Brazil and sales from a new market access venture in Argentina. We also increased soda ash exports to the region and realized healthy sales growth in BioPolymer. 
Sales growth in North America was strong, up 14%. Sales in Agricultural Products benefited from healthy demand for pre-emergent herbicide, new product introduction and the shift of some sales from the second quarter due to an early start of the 2012 season. Industrial Chemicals benefited from higher selling prices across all businesses in the region. 
Sales in Asia were also up 14% in the quarter. Drivers of this growth were broad-based with gains in Agricultural Products, soda ash exports and in food and pharmaceuticals businesses in BioPolymer. 
Sales in EMEA were up 8% as greater penetration in peroxygens market, sales gains in BioPolymer's pharmaceuticals business and higher sales of herbicide and fungicide in Agricultural Products all contributed to the increase. 
As you know, we are focusing on increasing our presence in the rapidly developing economies of the world, RDEs, as we refer to them internally. Looking at sales growth in these economies by region shows good progress being made. Sales in Latin America grew 38%; sales in Asia and RDEs grew 13%; sales in Middle East & Africa grew 14%; and sales in Central and Eastern Europe and Turkey grew more modestly at 5%, mainly due to timing effects in the quarter. 
Moving now to corporate items. Corporate expense was $14.2 million versus $16.8 million last year. Interest expense was $11.3 million as compared to $9.9 million last year. On March 31, 2011, gross consolidated debt was $947 million, and debt, net of cash, was $876 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $32.2 million and capital expenditures were at $38.8 million. 
On a GAAP basis, the company reported net income of $119 million or $1.71 per diluted share versus net income of $94 million or $1.30 per diluted share in last year's first quarter. Net income in the current quarter included charges of $16 million after-tax or $0.23 per diluted share versus charges of $14 million after-tax or $0.19 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. 
With that reconciliation, our non-GAAP earnings were $1.94 per diluted share in the current quarter, up 30% versus $1.49 per diluted share in last year's first quarter. 
Now let's take a more detailed look at the performance of each of our operating segments in the quarter, starting in Agricultural Products. First quarter sales of $454 million increased 32%, driven by broad-based volume growth across Latin America, North America and Asia, augmented by targeted price increases. Latin America delivered the highest sales gain, driven by  a strong finish to the crop season in Brazil, particularly in sugarcane and cotton segments and sales from a new market access joint venture in Argentina. 
North America also delivered a significant sales gain resulting, from strong demand for pre-emergent herbicide, growth from new product introduction and the shift in some sales from the second quarter, driven by an early start to the 2012 season, due to favorable weather conditions and high crop prices. 
In Asia, sales gain reflected continued strong demand across the region, particularly China, Indonesia and Pakistan, and growth from new product introductions. 
In EMEA, the sales increase was driven by higher herbicide and fungicide's volumes. Segment earnings of $130 million increased 29% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by the broad-based sales growth, partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives. 
Agricultural Products continues to deliver sustained premium performance as we successfully execute on our differentiated strategy. The first elements of the strategy, innovation by continuously aggregating technologies and applying them to key focus markets, has been a key factor. While we continue to deliver the superior performance quarter after quarter, we are also thoughtfully investing in the future growth of Agricultural Products. 
We have a rich pipeline of organic growth initiatives in the group that will deliver profitable growth, not only in the near term, but well beyond our Vision 2015 time frame. We have been carefully including spending in both R&D and in selling and technical service. 
In a very short period of time, Agricultural Products has also established a strong track record in pursuing external growth initiatives. Last year, our first full year of implementing this initiative, the group successfully made accretive pipeline and technology acquisition, signing licensing agreements from development alliances and move into agencies basis. Clearly, Agricultural Products is well on its way to meeting all surpassing its Vision 2015 objective. 
And now moving on to Specialty Chemicals, sales of $216 million were up 3% as higher selling price were achieved across all businesses, particularly in food, pharmaceutical and lithium primaries markets. Lower volumes resulting from downtime associated with capacity expansion and plant tie-ins in our Argentina lithium facility and, to a lesser degree, at BioPolymer's alginate specialty Norway, limited top line growth in the quarter. 
Segment earnings of $44 million declined 1%, essentially in line with our outlook given to you last quarter. The sales gain was offset by higher weather-related operating costs and plant downtime effects associated with the capacity expansion projects, higher raw material costs and increased spending of targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. 
Looking at each business for more detail, in BioPolymer, sales increased solidly as a result of higher sales price across the business. Sales growth in pharmaceutical and the integrins were especially strong in the quarter and higher selling prices and continued steady volume growth. 
In food, we benefited from higher selling prices and favorable mix. We anticipate continued premium growth in our microcrystalline product line or MCC, serving beverage and dairy markets, especially in Asia. We're making a series of capacity expansion to serve this growth. Last year, we expanded our Cork, Ireland facility which increased our global capacity by 25% for food and pharmaceutical grade MCC. We are currently expanding our Newark, Delaware facility by 25% and expect additional capacity to be in production by the end of the year. And in addition, we are evaluating the setting of a greenfield MCC plant in Asia. 
BioPolymer delivered strong earnings growth in the quarter as a result of the pricing gain a favorable mix, partially offset by lower volume and higher specialty wood costs. 
Moving to lithium, sales grew modestly, driven by pricing gain, especially in lithium primaries which were more than offset lower volume resulting from products and downtime associated with our capacity expansion levels in Argentina. The plant tie-ins in Argentina was completed despite heavy rain in January and February, which are seasonally very unusual for the region. The rains impacted production volumes  and costs by diluted peroxygen operation for our inventories. Lithium earnings were lower than expected due to these adverse weather impacts. We're seeing higher processing cost and a slightly lower ramping production volume as a result of the dilution. The impacts will be largely behind us by the end of the second quarter. Therefore, sequentially, we anticipate a significant pickup in lithium sales earnings in the second half of this year compared to the first half. 
Moving now to Industrial Chemicals, revenue of $273 million increased 12%, driven by higher selling prices across the segments, particularly in soda ash, augmented by volume growth in soda ash and Specialty Peroxygens. Segment earnings of $48 million increased 19% as a result of the sales gain, favorable export mix in soda ash and a continued success in shifting peroxygens' mix towards specialties market. 
Now let's look at drivers of performance for each of the businesses. In soda ash, we realized strong sales and earnings as we benefited from higher selling prices in 2012 contracts and volume growth from food production at our Granger facility, which came online in the middle of last year. Granger product serves expert demand growth which continues to outpace domestic growth. Export demand for remained healthy. We benefited from higher transactional selling price in both Latin America and Asia. For perspective, in 2012, we expect to ship just over 50% of the total volume to the export markets. Within the export market, about half of the volume goes to Latin America and the other half to the rest of the world, to Asia and the rest of the world. 
The contract nature varies by region. Nearly all North American and Latin American contracts have annual fixed price provision. In Asia, the majority of contract terms are 3 to 6 months in duration. So at domestic and Latin America contracts essentially fixed for the year. The only area for pricing change is in Asia. 
In Asia, ANSAC configures our trainings for users. In recent quarters, trainings for users have benefited from historically higher margins despite rising input costs. We have seen Asian pricing suffering as we went through the first quarter due to lower demand and pricing for domestic Chinese soda ash, which impacted export prices from China. 
In our outlook for the year, we continue to make conservative and prudent view that ANSAC export prices will decline modestly as competition deteriorates. Nonetheless, we are very confident that the average export price for 2012 will remain materially higher than the average in 2011. This higher export price, coupled with higher domestic pricing, gives rise to our outlook for significant profit growth from our soda ash business in 2012. As a result, we are also very confident that the Industrial Chemicals segment will deliver the 20% earnings growth that is in our full year guidance. 
Moving to peroxygens, in peroxygen, we also realized strong share in earnings growth. The sales increase was driven by higher volume and selling prices in Specialty Peroxygens, augmented by higher selling prices in European Hydrogen Peroxide. Earnings benefited from the sales gain and the continued several shift mix towards specialties. 
As we have been running the specialty strategy for a couple of years now, the split between specialties and commodities in North America is almost 50-50, which is far more balanced than the rest of the world. We are focusing our efforts on driving globalization of the specialties business to continue on the path to achieving our Vision 2015 goal. 
During the quarter, we took another significant step toward realizing one of our Industrial Chemicals Vision 2015. That is the building of the environmental solutions platform. Today, we are announcing the launch of FMC Environmental Solutions, a new business that illuminates and formalizes our company's commitment to the growing pollution prevention and remediation market. This business integrates our existing portfolio of products, processes and application that sustainably address complex pollution challenges in air, soil and water. We are committed to building our already strong foundation and to expand our technology portfolio of products offerings and people resources in this high-growth specialty market. Our expectations are to grow FMC Environmental Solutions over the next several years into a business with sales in the $100 million to $200 million range by 2015. 
To ensure we bring appropriate focus and resource to air, soil and water markets, we have structured FMC Environment Solutions platforms with 3 Platform of business units. The first one, air pollution control, we are targeting power utility and manufacturing industries with low-cost capital solutions to help meet current and pending regulations for air quality standards. We are focused on the removal of acid gases such as socks and HCM, the use of toner and sodium bicarbonate as reagents in dry sorbent injection, or DSI, through joint venture in Natronx and hydrogen peroxide for the removal of NOx in conjunction with conventional scrubbers through our new Environmental Solutions business. 
Soil and running water remediation. These business unit develops end markets unique for chemistries that treat a wide range of contaminants in soil and groundwater. With the recent acquisition of the assets of Adventus Intellectual Property, we are the global leader in chemical remediation technologies that are used underground. 
Our chemistries are focused on the remediation of normal and halogenated organics and minerals in the reduction and oxidation. Our portfolio of technologies is unique. From a phosphate closure products to the carbon-based projects we acquired from Adventus, we can now address the full spectrum of site issues, namely source and groundwater. 
And now water treatment. We are returning a number of chemistries from our peroxygens business and municipal water facilities that are more environmentally benign than traditional flow in chemistry. This business unit will also market various proprietary green chemistries for enhancing water treatment in the oil and gas exploration field by neutralizing shorter-reducing bacteria. 
With that review of our business, I will turn the call over to Kim Foster Fay for a review of our financial position. Kim?"

Regarding the outlook for the full year 2012, we have raised the midpoint of our previous outlook and now expect adjusted earnings of $6.80 to $7.05 per diluted share, a 16% increase above last year at the midpoint of this range. 
Our Agricultural Products segment expect to achieve its ninth straight year of record earnings, up 10% to 15% over last year. Sales gain is the result of volume growth in all regions, particularly in Latin America, North America and Asia, due to strong market conditions and growth from new and acquired products, partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives. 
In our Specialty Chemicals segment, expect achieve its seventh straight year of record earnings, led by the eighth straight year of record earnings in BioPolymer. Segment earnings are expected to be up approximately 5%, reflecting higher selling prices across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer and lithium specialties. Partially offsetting this growth are higher lithium operating costs in the first half of the year, higher raw material costs and increased spending on several growth initiatives in BioPolymer. 
As I mentioned, earlier, in our lithium business, we expect a significant sequential pickup in sales and earnings in the second half of the year compared to the first half. 
In our Industrial Chemicals segment, we expect earnings to be up 20%, driven by higher volumes and selling price in soda ash and Specialty Peroxygens, augmented by the continued mix shift towards Specialty Peroxygens. 
Moving to our outlook for the second quarter of 2012, we expect adjusted earnings of $1.65 to $1.85 per diluted share, a 14% increase in the midpoint of this range. In Agricultural Products, we expect earnings to be up about 5%, reflecting growth in all regions, partially offset by the shift of some sales in North America to the first quarter and higher spending on targeted growth initiatives. 
To get a better read on trend line earnings growth, without the shift in some North American sales in the first quarter, the second quarter percent earnings increased would've been in the low teens. Specialty Chemicals segment earnings are projected to be up 5% or to be 5% lower as higher selling prices across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer are offset by higher operating cost in lithium, higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. 
And in Industrial Chemicals, we expect second quarter segment earnings to be up approximately 30%, driven by higher selling prices in soda ash and Specialty Peroxygens, volume growth in soda ash, the absence of Granger's soda ash facility start up costs incurred in the prior quarter and the continued mix shift towards Specialty Peroxygenss. Again, for a better read on trend line earning growth, startup costs out incurred in last year's second quarter, the percent earnings increased for the second quarter 2012 would've been in the low teens.

I think we will have a full year recovery from all of that and the lithium business will be at full performance in the fourth quarter. So you will see sequential improvement from first quarter to the fourth quarter with the start of the ramp-up, the most visible start of the ramp-up be in the third quarter."

The answers we have are, clearly, you know that it is a place which is opening up the company's, now we would have to start a grassroots plan. So we would not any longer be talking about major expansion 2014. I would most likely push that to 2016-plus. We also have possibilities in Australia and possibilities in China. So we are right now looking at all of the options we might be able to use, but Argentina remains our priority. Argentina, by far, is the cheapest and the fastest way to bring additional capacity."

The question is only the timing. As you know, we do have 3 major projects to be undertaken. We will be building the large MCC plant in Asia. We do have the doubling of the capacity in Argentina potentially for lithium and we do have the Granger 2 expansion. So we have to prioritize and decide what is the best timing for all of this. I would say that we will be, as Frank said before, maybe by the end of December, we'll have a better idea where we're going with the lithium timing, and I would say that by the end of the year, we'll have a better idea of where we're going with the Granger. So all of those are most likely to happen. It is just a timing of one versus the other. I would say the one which the most likely to take off first and be quickly undertaken is the MCC plant in Asia. Regarding the mix, we believe the mix is going to be -- the export mix is going to be the same year-on-year. The only difference is more of a quarter. We had left shipment towards Russia or eastern Europe or some other countries which are more difficult and less favorable from a mix standpoint, but we're going to see more towards those in the second quarter.

And seeing the growth potential of the company, the earnings potential of the company, we have decided that we can deliver beyond expectations, but still invest more in the future of the company and in the past. So what we call growth initiatives are mostly strengthening our research globally by more resource in North America and also other places like Asia or Latin America, more sales, more tech service in order to bring more work on registrations in Ag, so more spending to bring new technology to the market faster. And we've been thinking about, should we do that for a couple of years when I joined, but I believe for a while we're going to want to take opportunities of what are in front of us because we do have lots of positive things which are happening in the company which will allow us growth for many years."

It is multimillion dollars, more than single digits, which we're going to see to the bottom line in between the first quarter and the fourth quarter this year, in terms of amelioration of the financial performance of that business. So what we really have to focus on today is keep on operating all of our businesses as strongly as they have been performing and turn around the lithium business.

I hope that during today's call, we have demonstrated again our ability to deliver strong performance quarter after quarter while at the same time continue to make well-placed organic and external investments to ensure our future profitable growth. We delivered 2 superb years in 2010 and 2011 and are off a strong start in 2012. We are confident that we will continue to realize the earnings power investors should expect from the FMC portfolio. A year and half ago, we shared with you our plan with our overwriting objective to drive top quartile total shareholder return. It has an aggressive organic growth component which would be augmented by a focused excellent growth component. As we say, we were to realize this aggressive growth, we have made targeted increases in our build the line costs. We have increased development spending especially in Agricultural Products and BioPolymer. We increased selling and technical service expenses and we have invested in critical infrastructure to deliver this growth where it is needed. The vast majority of this spend is in the business and regions where it should be, close to our customers. We are fortunate that today, we have a rich organic growth pipeline that we leverage our strong new product and technological expertise. Equally, we have a rich pipeline that offers us the opportunity to make focused equity and acquisitions. 
Our success here is evident. In 2012, we will derive $90 million in sales and $15 million in EBIT and EPS of $0.07 from the 8 transaction we completed in 2011. Including the related organic growth investments to fund the growth of each of these transactions, we are on track to meet our goal for external growth to contribute $800 million or more in 2015 revenues. 
So in summary, I can say that now, more than ever, we are confident that 2012 will be another record year for FMC, that we are solidly on track to achieve our Vision 2015 objective and, equally importantly, that we are building a company that will deliver premium growth and value well beyond 2015. I look forward to providing you an update on the Vision 2015 progress during next quarter's call and I look forward to presenting an in-depth review of our Vision 2015 strategy at Investor Day to be held on Tuesday, December 11, 2012, in New York City.

As you saw in our earnings release, our first quarter results provided a very strong start to what we expect will be another record year for FMC. Summarizing our first quarter 2012 performance. Sales of $9",2439,"Thank you, Brennen, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings release, our first quarter results provided a very strong start to what we expect will be another record year for FMC. 
Summarizing our first quarter 2012 performance. Sales of $951 million increased 18% above last year's first quarter, and adjusted earnings of $1.94 per diluted share grew 30% versus a year-ago quarter. Agricultural Products delivered a robust performance in the quarter. Sales of $454 million increased 32%, driven by broad-based growth across Latin America, North America and Asia. Segment earnings of $130 million increased 29% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by the sales gain, partially offset by higher spending on several growth initiatives.
In Specialty Chemicals, the performance met our expectations. Sales of $216 million were up 3% as higher selling prices were achieved in all businesses, particularly in food, pharmaceuticals and lithium primary markets. Partially offsetting these pricing gains were lower volumes related to downtimes associated with capacity expansions and plant tie-ins at our Argentina lithium facility, and to a lesser degree, at BioPolymer's alginates facility in Norway. Segment earnings of $44 million were down 1% as the sales gain were more than offset by higher weather-related operating costs in lithium, plant downtime effects, higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. 
In Industrial Chemicals, sales of $273 million increased 12%, driven by higher selling prices, especially in soda ash, and volume growth in soda ash and specialty peroxygens. Segment earnings of $48.1 million increased 19% as the result of the sales gains, favorable export mix in soda ash and the continued mix shift in peroxygens towards specialties markets. 
Taking a look at total company sales on a regional basis in the first quarter. Sales in Latin America demonstrated the highest growth rate, up 38%, driven by Agricultural Products as a result of the strong finish through the crop season in Brazil and sales from a new market access joint venture in Argentina. We also increased soda ash exports to the region and realized healthy sales growth in BioPolymer. 
Sales growth in North America was strong, about [ph] 14%. Sales in Agricultural Products benefited from healthy demand for pre-emergent herbicide, new product introduction and the shift of some sales from the second quarter due to an early start of the 2012 season. Industrial Chemicals benefited from higher selling prices across all businesses in the region. 
Sales in Asia were also up 14% in the quarter. Drivers of this growth were broad-based, with gains in Agricultural Products, soda ash exports and in food and pharmaceuticals businesses in BioPolymer. 
Sales in EMEA were up 8% as greater penetration in peroxygens market, sales gains in BioPolymer's pharmaceuticals business and higher sales of herbicide and fungicide in Agricultural Products all contributed to the increase. 
As you know, we are focusing on increasing our presence in the rapidly developing economies of the world, RDEs, as we refer to them internally. Looking at sales growth in these economies by region shows good progress being made. Sales in Latin America grew 38%; sales in Asian RDEs grew 13%; sales in Middle East & Africa grew 14%; and sales in Central and Eastern Europe and Turkey grew more modestly at 5%, mainly due to timing effects in the quarter. 
Moving now to corporate items. Corporate expense was $14.2 million versus $16.8 million last year. Interest expense was $11.3 million as compared to $9.9 million last year. On March 31, 2011, gross consolidated debt was $947 million; and debt, net of cash, was $876 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $32.2 million, and capital expenditures were $38.8 million. 
On a GAAP basis, the company reported net income of $119 million or $1.71 per diluted share versus net income of $94 million or $1.30 per diluted share in last year's first quarter. Net income in the current quarter included charges of $16 million after-tax or $0.23 per diluted share versus charges of $14 million after-tax or $0.19 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. With that reconciliation, our non-GAAP earnings were $1.94 per diluted share in the current quarter, up 30% versus $1.49 per diluted share in last year's first quarter. 
Now let's take a more detailed look at the performance of each of our operating segments in the quarter, starting in Agricultural Products. First quarter sales of $454 million increased 32%, driven by broad-based volume growth across Latin America, North America and Asia, augmented by targeted price increases. Latin America delivered the highest sales gain, driven by a strong finish to the crop season in Brazil, particularly in sugarcane and cotton segments, and sales from a new market access joint venture in Argentina. North America also delivered a significant sales gain, resulting from strong demand for pre-emergent herbicide, growth from new product introductions and the shift in some sales from the second quarter, driven by an early start to the 2012 season due to favorable weather conditions and high crop prices. In Asia, sales gain reflected continued strong demand across the region, particularly China, Indonesia and Pakistan, and growth from new product introductions. In EMEA, the sales increase was driven by higher herbicide and fungicide's volumes. Segment earnings of $130 million increased 29% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by the broad-based sales growth, partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives. 
Agricultural Products continues to deliver sustained premium performance as we successfully execute on our differentiated strategy. The first elements of our strategy, innovation by continuously aggregating technologies and applying them to key focus market has been a key factor. While we continue to deliver the superior performance quarter-after-quarter, we are also thoughtfully investing in the future growth of Agricultural Products. We have a rich pipeline of organic growth initiatives in the group that will deliver profitable growth, not only in the near term, but well beyond our Vision 2015 time frame. We have been carefully including spending in both R&D and in selling and technical service.
In a very short period of time, Agricultural Products has also established a strong track record in pursuing external growth initiatives. Last year, our first full year of implementing this initiative, the group successfully made accretive product line and technology acquisition, signing licensing agreements from development alliances and move into agency spaces [ph]. Clearly, Agricultural Products is well on its way to meeting or surpassing its Vision 2015 objectives. 
And now moving on to Specialty Chemicals. Sales of $216 million were up 3% as higher selling price were achieved across all businesses, particularly in food, pharmaceutical and lithium primaries markets. Lower volumes resulting from downtime associated with capacity expansion and plant tie-ins at our Argentina lithium facility and to a lesser degree, at BioPolymer's alginates facility in Norway, with limited top line growth in the quarter. Segment earnings of $44 million declined 1%, essentially in line with our outlook given to you last quarter. The sales gain was offset by higher weather-related operating costs and plant downtime effects associated with the capacity expansion projects, higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. 
Looking at each business for more detail. In BioPolymer, sales increased solidly as a result of higher sales price across the business. Sales growth in pharmaceutical buyers and these integrals was especially strong in the quarter on higher selling prices and continued steady volume growth. In food ingredients, we benefited from higher selling prices and favorable mix. We anticipate continued premium growth in our microcrystalline cellulose product line, or MCC, serving beverage and dairy markets, especially in Asia. We're making a series of capacity expansion to serve this growth. Last year, we expanded our Cork, Ireland facility, which increased our global capacity by 25% for food and pharmaceutical grade MCC. We are currently expanding our Newark, Delaware facility by 25%, and expect this additional capacity to be in production by the end of the year. And in addition, we are evaluating the setting of a greenfield MCC plant in Asia. BioPolymer delivered strong earnings growth in the quarter as a result of the pricing gain and favorable mix, partially offset by lower volume and higher specialty wood pulp costs. 
Moving to Lithium. Sales grew modestly, driven by pricing gains, especially in lithium primaries, which were more than offset -- which more than offset lower volume resulting from production downtime associated with our capacity expansion in Argentina. The plant tie-in in Argentina was completed despite heavy rain in January and February, which are seasonally very unusual for the region. The rains impacted production volumes and costs by diluting peroxygen [ph] operation for our inventories. Lithium earnings were lower than expected due to these adverse weather impacts. We are seeing higher processing cost and a slightly lower ramping production volume as a result of the dilution. The impacts will be largely behind us by the end of the second quarter. Therefore, sequentially, we anticipate a significant pickup in lithium sales and earnings in the second half of this year compared to the first half. 
Moving now to Industrial Chemicals. Revenue of $273 million increased 12%, driven by higher selling prices across the segments, particularly in soda ash, augmented by volume growth in soda ash and specialty peroxygens. Segment earnings of $48 million increased 19% as a result of the sales gain, favorable export mix in soda ash and a continued success in shifting peroxygens' mix towards specialties market. 
Now let's look at drivers of performance for each of the businesses. In soda ash, we realized strong sales and earnings as we benefited from higher selling prices in 2012 contracts and volume growth from food production at our Granger facility, which came online in the middle of last year. Granger product serves export demand growth, which continues to outpace domestic growth. Export demand for ANSAC remained healthy. We benefited from higher ANSAC selling price in both Latin America and Asia. For perspective, in 2012, we expect to ship just over 50% of the total volume to the export markets. Within the export market, about half of the volume goes to Latin America and the other half to the rest of the world -- to Asia and the rest of the world. 
The contract nature varies by region. Nearly all North American and Latin American contracts have annual fixed price provision. In Asia, the majority of contract terms are 3 to 6 months in duration. So with domestic and Latin America contracts essentially fixed for the year, the only area for pricing change is in Asia. In Asia, ANSAC configures our trainings intended for users. In recent quarters, trainings for users have benefited from historically high margins despite rising input costs. We have seen Asian pricing suffering as we went through the first quarter due to lower demand and pricing for domestic Chinese soda ash, which impacted export prices from China. 
In our outlook for the year, we continue to make a conservative and prudent view that ANSAC Asian export prices will decline modestly as competition deteriorates. Nonetheless, we are very confident that the average export price for 2012 will remain materially higher than the average in 2011. This higher export price, coupled with higher domestic pricing, give rise to our outlook for significant profit growth from our soda ash business in 2012. As a result, we are also very confident that the Industrial Chemicals segment will deliver the 20% earnings growth that is in our full year guidance. 
Moving to peroxygens. In peroxygen, we also realized strong sales and earning growth. The sales increase was driven by higher volume and selling prices in specialty peroxygen, augmented by higher selling prices in European hydrogen peroxide. Earnings benefited from the sales gain and the continued several shift mix towards specialties. 
As we have been running the specialty strategy for a couple of years now, the split between specialties and commodities in North America is almost 50-50, which is far more balanced than the rest of the world. We are focusing our efforts on driving globalization of the specialties business to continue on the path to achieving our Vision 2015 goal. 
During the quarter, we took another significant step toward realizing one of Industrial Chemicals' Vision 2015, that is the building of the environmental solutions platform. Today, we are announcing the launch of FMC Environmental Solutions, a new business that elevates and formalizes our company's commitment to the growing pollution prevention and remediation market. This business integrates our existing portfolio of products, processes and application that sustainably address complex pollution challenges in air, soil and water. We are committed to building in our already strong foundation and to expand our technology portfolio of products, offerings and people resources in this high-growth specialty market. Our expectations are to grow FMC Environmental Solutions over the next several few years into a business with sales in the $100 million to $200 million range by 2015. 
To ensure we bring appropriate focus and resources to air, soil and water markets, we have structured FMC Environment Solutions with 3 platforms or business units. The first one, Air Pollution Control, we are targeting power utility and manufacturing industries with low-cost capital solutions to help meet current and pending regulations for air quality standards. We are focused on the removal of acid gases, such as SOx and HCl, re-use of trona and sodium bicarbonates as reagents in dry sorbent injection, or DSI, through our joint venture with Natronx; and hydrogen peroxide for the removal of NOx in conjunction with conventional scrubbers through our new Environmental Solutions business. 
soil and Running Water Remediation, this business unit develops and markets unique fast-acting chemistries that treat a wide range of contaminants in soil and groundwater. With our recent acquisition of the assets of Adventus Intellectual Property, we are the global leader in chemical remediation technologies that are used underground. Our chemistries are focused on the remediation of normal and halogenated organics and minerals via reduction and oxidation. Our portfolio of technologies is unique. From a persulfate-based Klozur products to the carbon-based products we acquired from Adventus, we can now address the full spectrum of site issues, namely soils [ph] and groundwater. 
And now Water Treatment. We are utilizing a number of chemistries from our Peroxygens business in municipal wastewater facilities that are more environmentally benign than traditional chlorine chemistry. This business unit will also market various proprietary green chemistries for enhancing water treatment in the oil and gas exploration field by neutralizing sulfur-reducing bacteria. 
With that review of our business, I will turn the call over to Kim Foster for a review of our financial position. Kim?"

And I'm pleased to report that in the first quarter, we completed the $200 million program with the repurchase of approximately $145 million of shares. At the start of the second quarter, we have $245 million of repurchased capacity remaining under an existing board authorization. 
Going forward, we will continue to govern and balance the pace of execution of our share repurchases with our capital needs to drive organic growth in the investment and targeted external opportunities. 
Moving to our recent announcement of a 2-for-1 stock split. Following our shareholders' approval of an amendment to increase the number of authorized shares, last week, our Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split of our common stock. The split will be affected in the form of a distribution payable on May 24, 2012, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 11, 2012. Trading in the common stock will begin on a post-split adjusted basis on May 25, 2012. 
I'll close by reaffirming guidance for certain financial items, which we gave you during last quarter's conference call. Free cash flow for 2012 is reconfirmed at $200 million to $225 million for the year. Our capital expenditure forecast is reaffirmed at $250 million, and our tax rate for the year is reaffirmed at 27%.

Our",511,"Thank you, Kim. Regarding the outlook for the full year of 2012, we have raised the midpoint of our previous outlook and now expect adjusted earnings of $6.80 to $7.05 per diluted share, a 16% increase above last year at the midpoint of this range. 
Our Agricultural Products segment expect to achieve its ninth straight year of record earnings, up 10% to 15% over last year. Sales gain is the result of volume growth in all regions, particularly in Latin America, North America and Asia, due to strong market condition and growth from new and acquired products, partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives. 
And our Specialty Chemicals segment expect to achieve its seventh straight year of record earnings, led by the eighth straight year of record earnings in BioPolymer. Segment earnings are expected to be up approximately 5%, reflecting higher selling prices across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer and lithium specialties. Partially offsetting this growth are higher lithium operating costs in the first half of the year, higher raw material costs and increased spending on several growth initiatives in BioPolymer. 
As I mentioned earlier, in our Lithium business, we expect a significant sequential pickup in sales and earnings in the second half of the year compared to the first half. 
In our Industrial Chemicals segment, we expect earnings to be up 20%, driven by higher volumes and selling price in soda ash and specialty peroxygen, augmented by the continued mix shift towards specialty peroxygens. 
Moving to our outlook for the second quarter of 2012. We expect adjusted earnings of $1.65 to $1.85 per diluted share, a 14% increase in the midpoint of this range. In Agricultural Products, we expect earnings to be up about 5%, reflecting growth in all regions, partially offset by the shift of some sales in North America to the first quarter and higher spending on targeted growth initiatives. To get a better read on trend line earnings growth, without the shift in some North American sales in the first quarter, the second quarter percent earnings increased would've been in the low teens. 
Specialty Chemicals segment earnings are projected to be up 5% -- or to be 5% lower as higher selling prices across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer are offset by higher operating costs in lithium, higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. 
And in Industrial Chemicals, we expect second quarter segment earnings to be up approximately 30%, driven by higher selling prices in soda ash and specialty peroxygens, volume growth in soda ash, the absence of Granger's soda ash facility start-up costs incurred in the prior quarter and the continued mix shift towards specialty peroxygen. Again, for a better read on trend line earning growth, where Granger's start-up costs not incurred in last year's second quarter, the percent earnings increase for the second quarter 2012 would have been in the low teens.

We had issues in bringing some of the equipment we need because of the weather on the road. But the length of the downtime was about the same. The problem is the downtime, combined with the weather, created some issues to operate the plant. Even the pod was working the way it was working at full capacity. We also had dilutions, very significant dilutions of the ponds, which is forcing us to work with brine which is more diluted. So we had -- it's much more a combination of 2 negative effects together, which have created a situation where in the first quarter, the performance was low compared to -- significantly below what we had a year ago. We will still see that effect in the second quarter because even if the tie-ins of the plants are done, we're going to be having diluted ponds, and we're going to be operating with the brine which is less concentrated, which will create less product from the plant in a high operating cost. Things are starting to get better in the third quarter. So third quarter, you will see sequential and year-on-year improvement in the EBIT, not yet at full capacity. I think we will have fully recovered from all of that, and the lithium business will be at full performance in the fourth quarter. So you will see sequential improvement from first quarter to the fourth quarter with the start of the ramp-up, the most visible start of the ramp-up being in the third quarter."

Regarding the mix, we believe the mix is going to be -- the export mix is going to be the same year-on-year. The only difference is more of a quarter. We had left shipment towards Russia or Eastern Europe or some other countries which are more difficult and less favorable from a mix standpoint, but we're going to ship more toward those in the second quarter. So it's more of a quarter balance than it is of a year balance."

I hope that during today's call, we have demonstrated again our ability to deliver strong performance quarter-after-quarter, while at the same time continue to make well-placed organic and external investments to ensure our future profitable growth. We delivered 2 superb years in 2010 and 2011 and are off a strong start in 2012. We are confident that we will continue to realize the earnings power investors should expect from the FMC portfolio. 1.5 years ago, we shared with you a plan with our overriding objective to drive top quartile total shareholder return. It has an aggressive organic growth component, which would be augmented by a focused excellent growth component. As we say, we were to realize this aggressive growth, we have made targeted increases in our build-the-line costs. We have increased research and development spending, especially in Agricultural Products and BioPolymer. We had increased selling and technical service expenses, and we had invested in critical infrastructure to deliver this growth where it is needed. The vast majority of this spend is out in the business and regions where it should be, close to our customers. We are fortunate that today, we have a rich organic growth pipeline that will leverage our strong new product and technology innovation expertise. Equally, we have a rich external pipeline that offers us the opportunity to make focused equity and acquisitions. Our success here is evident. In 2012, we will derive $90 million in sales and $15 million in EBIT and EPS of $0.07 from the 8 transactions we completed in 2011. Including the related organic growth investments to fund the growth of each of these transactions, we are on track to meet our goal for external growth to contribute $800 million or more in 2015 revenues. 
So in summary, I can say that now, more than ever, we are confident that 2012 will be another record year for FMC, that we are solidly on track to achieve our Vision 2015 objective, and equally importantly, that we are building a company that will deliver premium growth and value well beyond 2015. I look forward to providing you an update on the Vision 2015 progress during next quarter's call, and I look forward to presenting an in-depth review of our Vision 2015 strategy at an Investor Day to be held on Tuesday, December 11, 2012, in New York City.

As you saw in our earnings release, our first quarter results provided a very strong start to what we expect will be another record year for FMC. Summarizing our first quarter 2012 performance. Sales of $9",2438,"Thank you, Brennen, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings release, our first quarter results provided a very strong start to what we expect will be another record year for FMC. 
Summarizing our first quarter 2012 performance. Sales of $951 million increased 18% above last year's first quarter, and adjusted earnings of $1.94 per diluted share grew 30% versus a year-ago quarter. Agricultural Products delivered a robust performance in the quarter. Sales of $454 million increased 32%, driven by broad-based growth across Latin America, North America and Asia. Segment earnings of $130 million increased 29% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by the sales gain, partially offset by higher spending on several growth initiatives.
In Specialty Chemicals, the performance met our expectations. Sales of $216 million were up 3% as higher selling prices were achieved in all businesses, particularly in food, pharmaceuticals and lithium primary markets. Partially offsetting these pricing gains were lower volumes related to downtimes associated with capacity expansions and plant tie-ins at our Argentina lithium facility, and to a lesser degree, at BioPolymer's alginates facility in Norway. Segment earnings of $44 million were down 1% as the sales gain were more than offset by higher weather-related operating costs in lithium, plant downtime effects, higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. 
In Industrial Chemicals, sales of $273 million increased 12%, driven by higher selling prices, especially in soda ash, and volume growth in soda ash and specialty peroxygens. Segment earnings of $48.1 million increased 19% as the result of the sales gains, favorable export mix in soda ash and the continued mix shift in peroxygens towards specialties markets. 
Taking a look at total company sales on a regional basis in the first quarter. Sales in Latin America demonstrated the highest growth rate, up 38%, driven by Agricultural Products as a result of the strong finish through the crop season in Brazil and sales from a new market access joint venture in Argentina. We also increased soda ash exports to the region and realized healthy sales growth in BioPolymer. 
Sales growth in North America was strong, of 14%. Sales in Agricultural Products benefited from healthy demand for pre-emergent herbicide, new product introduction and the shift of some sales from the second quarter due to an early start of the 2012 season. Industrial Chemicals benefited from higher selling prices across all businesses in the region. 
Sales in Asia were also up 14% in the quarter. Drivers of this growth were broad-based, with gains in Agricultural Products, soda ash exports and in food and pharmaceuticals businesses in BioPolymer. 
Sales in EMEA were up 8% as greater penetration in peroxygens market, sales gains in BioPolymer's pharmaceuticals business and higher sales of herbicide and fungicide in Agricultural Products all contributed to the increase. 
As you know, we are focusing on increasing our presence in the rapidly developing economies of the world, RDEs, as we refer to them internally. Looking at sales growth in these economies by region shows good progress being made. Sales in Latin America grew 38%; sales in Asian RDEs grew 13%; sales in Middle East & Africa grew 14%; and sales in Central and Eastern Europe and Turkey grew more modestly at 5%, mainly due to timing effects in the quarter. 
Moving now to corporate items. Corporate expense was $14.2 million versus $16.8 million last year. Interest expense was $11.3 million as compared to $9.9 million last year. On March 31, 2011, gross consolidated debt was $947 million; and debt, net of cash, was $876 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $32.2 million, and capital expenditures were $38.8 million. 
On a GAAP basis, the company reported net income of $119 million or $1.71 per diluted share versus net income of $94 million or $1.30 per diluted share in last year's first quarter. Net income in the current quarter included charges of $16 million after-tax or $0.23 per diluted share versus charges of $14 million after-tax or $0.19 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. With that reconciliation, our non-GAAP earnings were $1.94 per diluted share in the current quarter, up 30% versus $1.49 per diluted share in last year's first quarter. 
Now let's take a more detailed look at the performance of each of our operating segments in the quarter, starting in Agricultural Products. First quarter sales of $454 million increased 32%, driven by broad-based volume growth across Latin America, North America and Asia, augmented by targeted price increases. Latin America delivered the highest sales gain, driven by a strong finish to the crop season in Brazil, particularly in sugarcane and cotton segments, and sales from a new market access joint venture in Argentina. North America also delivered a significant sales gain, resulting from strong demand for pre-emergent herbicide, growth from new product introductions and the shift in some sales from the second quarter, driven by an early start to the 2012 season due to favorable weather conditions and high crop prices. In Asia, sales gain reflected continued strong demand across the region, particularly China, Indonesia and Pakistan, and growth from new product introductions. In EMEA, the sales increase was driven by higher herbicide and fungicide's volumes. Segment earnings of $130 million increased 29% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by the broad-based sales growth, partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives. 
Agricultural Products continues to deliver sustained premium performance as we successfully execute on our differentiated strategy. The first elements of our strategy, innovation by continuously aggregating technologies and applying them to key focus market has been a key factor. While we continue to deliver the superior performance quarter-after-quarter, we are also thoughtfully investing in the future growth of Agricultural Products. We have a rich pipeline of organic growth initiatives in the group that will deliver profitable growth, not only in the near term, but well beyond our Vision 2015 time frame. We have been carefully including spending in both R&D and in selling and technical service.
In a very short period of time, Agricultural Products has also established a strong track record in pursuing external growth initiatives. Last year, our first full year of implementing this initiative, the group successfully made accretive product line and technology acquisition, signing licensing agreements from development alliances and move into adjacent spaces. Clearly, Agricultural Products is well on its way to meeting or surpassing its Vision 2015 objectives. 
And now moving on to Specialty Chemicals. Sales of $216 million were up 3% as higher selling price were achieved across all businesses, particularly in food, pharmaceutical and lithium primaries markets. Lower volumes resulting from downtime associated with capacity expansion and plant tie-ins at our Argentina lithium facility and to a lesser degree, at BioPolymer's alginates facility in Norway, with limited top line growth in the quarter. Segment earnings of $44 million declined 1%, essentially in line with our outlook given to you last quarter. The sales gain was offset by higher weather-related operating costs and plant downtime effects associated with the capacity expansion projects, higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. 
Looking at each business for more detail. In BioPolymer, sales increased solidly as a result of higher sales price across the business. Sales growth in pharmaceutical buyers and these integrants was especially strong in the quarter on higher selling prices and continued steady volume growth. In food ingredients, we benefited from higher selling prices and favorable mix. We anticipate continued premium growth in our microcrystalline cellulose product line, or MCC, serving beverage and dairy markets, especially in Asia. We're making a series of capacity expansion to serve this growth. Last year, we expanded our Cork, Ireland facility, which increased our global capacity by 25% for food and pharmaceutical grade MCC. We are currently expanding our Newark, Delaware facility by 25%, and expect this additional capacity to be in production by the end of the year. And in addition, we are evaluating the setting of a greenfield MCC plant in Asia. BioPolymer delivered strong earnings growth in the quarter as a result of the pricing gain and favorable mix, partially offset by lower volume and higher specialty wood pulp costs. 
Moving to lithium. Sales grew modestly, driven by pricing gains, especially in lithium primaries, which were more than offset -- which more than offset lower volume resulting from production downtime associated with our capacity expansion in Argentina. The plant tie-in in Argentina was completed despite heavy rain in January and February, which are seasonally very unusual for the region. The rains impacted production volumes and costs by diluting peroxygen [ph] operation pond inventories. Lithium earnings were lower than expected due to these adverse weather impacts. We are seeing higher processing cost and a slightly lower ramping production volume as a result of the dilution. The impacts will be largely behind us by the end of the second quarter. Therefore, sequentially, we anticipate a significant pickup in lithium sales and earnings in the second half of this year compared to the first half. 
Moving now to Industrial Chemicals. Revenue of $273 million increased 12%, driven by higher selling prices across the segments, particularly in soda ash, augmented by volume growth in soda ash and specialty peroxygens. Segment earnings of $48 million increased 19% as a result of the sales gain, favorable export mix in soda ash and a continued success in shifting peroxygens mix towards specialties market. 
Now let's look at drivers of performance for each of the businesses. In soda ash, we realized strong sales and earnings as we benefited from higher selling prices in 2012 contracts and volume growth from food production at our Granger facility, which came online in the middle of last year. Granger product serves export demand growth, which continues to outpace domestic growth. Export demand through ANSAC remained healthy. We benefited from higher ANSAC selling price in both Latin America and Asia. For perspective, in 2012, we expect to ship just over 50% of the total volume to the export markets. Within the export market, about half of the volume goes to Latin America and the other half to the rest of the world -- to Asia and the rest of the world. 
The contract nature varies by region. Nearly all North American and Latin American contracts have annual fixed price provision. In Asia, the majority of contract terms are 3 to 6 months in duration. So with domestic and Latin America contracts essentially fixed for the year, the only area for pricing change is in Asia. In Asia, ANSAC configures our trainings intended for users. In recent quarters, trainings for users have benefited from historically high margins despite rising input costs. We have seen Asian pricing suffering as we went through the first quarter due to lower demand and pricing for domestic Chinese soda ash, which impacted export prices from China. 
In our outlook for the year, we continue to make a conservative and prudent view that ANSAC Asian export prices will decline modestly as competition accelerates. Nonetheless, we are very confident that the average export price for 2012 will remain materially higher than the average in 2011. This higher export price, coupled with higher domestic pricing, give rise to our outlook for significant profit growth from our soda ash business in 2012. As a result, we are also very confident that the Industrial Chemicals segment will deliver the 20% earnings growth that is in our full year guidance. 
Moving to peroxygens. In peroxygen, we also realized strong sales and earning growth. The sales increase was driven by higher volume and selling prices in specialty peroxygen, augmented by higher selling prices in European hydrogen peroxide. Earnings benefited from the sales gain and the continued several shift mix towards specialties. 
As we have been running the specialty strategy for a couple of years now, the split between specialties and commodities in North America is almost 50-50, which is far more balanced than the rest of the world. We are focusing our efforts on driving globalization of the specialties business to continue on the path to achieving our Vision 2015 goal. 
During the quarter, we took another significant step toward realizing one of Industrial Chemicals' Vision 2015, that is the building of the environmental solutions platform. Today, we are announcing the launch of FMC Environmental Solutions, a new business that elevates and formalizes our company's commitment to the growing pollution prevention and remediation market. This business integrates our existing portfolio of products, processes and application that sustainably address complex pollution challenges in air, soil and water. We are committed to building in our already strong foundation and to expand our technology portfolio of products, offerings and people resources in this high-growth specialty market. Our expectations are to grow FMC Environmental Solutions over the next several few years into a business with sales in the $100 million to $200 million range by 2015. 
To ensure we bring appropriate focus and resources to air, soil and water markets, we have structured FMC Environment Solutions with 3 platforms or business units. The first one, Air Pollution Control, we are targeting power utility and manufacturing industries with low-cost capital solutions to help meet current and pending regulations for air quality standards. We are focused on the removal of acid gases, such as SOx and HCl, via the use of trona and sodium bicarbonates as reagents in dry sorbent injection, or DSI, through our joint venture with Natronx; and hydrogen peroxide for the removal of NOx in conjunction with conventional scrubbers through our new Environmental Solutions business. 
Soil & Groundwater Water Remediation, this business unit develops and markets unique fast-acting chemistries that treat a wide range of contaminants in soil and groundwater. With our recent acquisition of the assets of Adventus Intellectual Property, we are the global leader in chemical remediation technologies that are used underground. Our chemistries are focused on the remediation of normal and halogenated organics and minerals via reduction and oxidation. Our portfolio of technologies is unique. From a persulfate-based Klozur products to the carbon-based products we acquired from Adventus, we can now address the full spectrum of site issues, namely soils, plume and groundwater. 
And now Water Treatment. We are utilizing a number of chemistries from our peroxygens business in municipal wastewater facilities that are more environmentally benign than traditional chlorine chemistry. This business unit will also market various proprietary green chemistries for enhancing water treatment in the oil and gas exploration field by neutralizing sulfur-reducing bacteria. 
With that review of our business, I will turn the call over to Kim Foster for a review of our financial position. Kim?"

Recall that in November of last year, we committed to repurchase $200 million of shares by the end of the first quarter of 2012. Following that commitment, we repurchased $55 million of shares in the fourth quarter of last year. And I'm pleased to report that in the first quarter, we completed the $200 million program with the repurchase of approximately $145 million of shares. At the start of the second quarter, we have $245 million of repurchased capacity remaining under an existing board authorization. 
Going forward, we will continue to govern and balance the pace of execution of our share repurchases with our capital needs to drive organic growth in the investment and targeted external opportunities. 
Moving to our recent announcement of a 2-for-1 stock split. Following our shareholders' approval of an amendment to increase the number of authorized shares, last week, our Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split of our common stock. The split will be affected in the form of a distribution payable on May 24, 2012, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 11, 2012. Trading in the common stock will begin on a post-split adjusted basis on May 25, 2012. 
I'll close by reaffirming guidance for certain financial items, which we gave you during last quarter's conference call. Free cash flow for 2012 is reconfirmed at $200 million to $225 million for the year. Our capital expenditure forecast is reaffirmed at $250 million, and our tax rate for the year is reaffirmed at 27%. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to you, Pierre."
28606,183647336,294104,"FMC Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 01, 2012",2012-05-01,"Earnings Calls","FMC Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kim. Regarding the outlook for the full year of 2012, we have raised the midpoint of our previous outlook and now expect adjusted earnings of $6.80 to $7.05 per diluted share, a 16% increase above last year at the midpoint of this range. Our",511,"Thank you, Kim. Regarding the outlook for the full year of 2012, we have raised the midpoint of our previous outlook and now expect adjusted earnings of $6.80 to $7.05 per diluted share, a 16% increase above last year at the midpoint of this range. 
Our Agricultural Products segment expect to achieve its ninth straight year of record earnings, up 10% to 15% over last year. Sales gain is the result of volume growth in all regions, particularly in Latin America, North America and Asia, due to strong market condition and growth from new and acquired products, partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives. 
And our Specialty Chemicals segment expect to achieve its seventh straight year of record earnings, led by the eighth straight year of record earnings in BioPolymer. Segment earnings are expected to be up approximately 5%, reflecting higher selling prices across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer and lithium specialties. Partially offsetting this growth are higher lithium operating costs in the first half of the year, higher raw material costs and increased spending on several growth initiatives in BioPolymer. 
As I mentioned earlier, in our Lithium business, we expect a significant sequential pickup in sales and earnings in the second half of the year compared to the first half. 
In our Industrial Chemicals segment, we expect earnings to be up 20%, driven by higher volumes and selling price in soda ash and specialty peroxygen, augmented by the continued mix shift towards specialty peroxygens. 
Moving to our outlook for the second quarter of 2012. We expect adjusted earnings of $1.65 to $1.85 per diluted share, a 14% increase in the midpoint of this range. In Agricultural Products, we expect earnings to be up about 5%, reflecting growth in all regions, partially offset by the shift of some sales in North America to the first quarter and higher spending on targeted growth initiatives. To get a better read on trend line earnings growth, without the shift in some North American sales in the first quarter, the second quarter percent earnings increase would've been in the low teens. 
Specialty Chemicals segment earnings are projected to be up 5% -- or to be 5% lower as higher selling prices across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer are offset by higher operating costs in lithium, higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. 
And in Industrial Chemicals, we expect second quarter segment earnings to be up approximately 30%, driven by higher selling prices in soda ash and specialty peroxygens, volume growth in soda ash, the absence of Granger's soda ash facility start-up costs incurred in the prior quarter and the continued mix shift towards specialty peroxygen. Again, for a better read on trend line earning growth, where Granger's start-up costs not incurred in last year's second quarter, the percent earnings increase for the second quarter 2012 would have been in the low teens. 
With that, I thank you for your time and attention, and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator, please?"

We had issues in bringing some of the equipment we need because of the weather on the road. But the length of the downtime was about the same. The problem is the downtime, combined with the weather, created some issues to operate the plant. Even the pod was working the way it was working at full capacity. We also had dilutions, very significant dilutions of the ponds, which is forcing us to work with brine which is more diluted. So we had -- it's much more a combination of 2 negative effects together, which have created a situation where in the first quarter, the performance was low compared to -- significantly below what we had a year ago. We will still see that effect in the second quarter because even if the tie-ins of the plants are done, we're going to be having diluted ponds, and we're going to be operating with the brine which is less concentrated, which will create less product from the plant in a high operating cost. Things are starting to get better in the third quarter. So third quarter, you will see sequential and year-on-year improvement in the EBIT, not yet at full capacity. I think we will have fully recovered from all of that, and the lithium business will be at full performance in the fourth quarter. So you will see sequential improvement from first quarter to the fourth quarter with the start of the ramp-up, the most visible start of the ramp-up being in the third quarter."

And I would say that by the end of the year, we'll have a better idea of where we are going with the Granger timing. So all of those are most likely to happen. It is just a timing of one versus the other. I would say the one which is the most likely to take off first and be quickly undertaken is the MCC plant in Asia. Regarding the mix, we believe the mix is going to be -- the export mix is going to be the same year-on-year. The only difference is more of a quarter. We had left shipment towards Russia or Eastern Europe or some other countries which are more difficult and less favorable from a mix standpoint, but we're going to ship more toward those in the second quarter.

And seeing the growth potential of the company, the earnings potential of the company, we have decided that we can deliver beyond expectations, but still invest more in the future of the company and in the past. So what we called growth initiatives are mostly strengthening our research globally by more resource in North America, but also in other places like Asia or Latin America, more sales, more tech service in order to bring more work on registrations in Ag, so more spending to bring new technology to the market faster. And we've been thinking about should we do that for a couple of years when I joined, but I believe, for a little while, we're going to want to take opportunities or what we have in front of us because we do have lots of positive things which are happening in the company, which will allow us growth for many years."

I hope that during today's call, we have demonstrated again our ability to deliver strong performance quarter-after-quarter, while at the same time continue to make well-placed organic and external investments to ensure our future profitable growth. We delivered 2 superb years in 2010 and 2011 and are off a strong start in 2012. We are confident that we will continue to realize the earnings power investors should expect from the FMC portfolio. 1.5 years ago, we shared with you a plan with our overriding objective to drive top quartile total shareholder return. It has an aggressive organic growth component, which would be augmented by a focused external growth component. As we say, we were to realize this aggressive growth, we have made targeted increases in our below-the-line costs. We have increased research and development spending, especially in Agricultural Products and BioPolymer. We had increased selling and technical service expenses, and we had invested in critical infrastructure to deliver this growth where it is needed. The vast majority of this spend is out in the business and regions where it should be, close to our customers. We are fortunate that today, we have a rich organic growth pipeline that will leverage our strong new product and technology innovation expertise. Equally, we have a rich external pipeline that offers us the opportunity to make focused equity and acquisitions. Our success here is evident. In 2012, we will derive $90 million in sales and $15 million in EBIT and EPS of $0.07 from the 8 transactions we completed in 2011. Including the related organic growth investments to fund the growth of each of these transactions, we are on track to meet our goal for external growth to contribute $800 million or more in 2015 revenues. 
So in summary, I can say that now, more than ever, we are confident that 2012 will be another record year for FMC, that we are solidly on track to achieve our Vision 2015 objective, and equally importantly, that we are building a company that will deliver premium growth and value well beyond 2015. I look forward to providing you an update on the Vision 2015 progress during next quarter's call, and I look forward to presenting an in-depth review of our Vision 2015 strategy at an Investor Day to be held on Tuesday, December 11, 2012, in New York City.

As you saw in our earnings release, our first quarter results provided a very strong start to what we expect will be another record year for FMC. Summarizing our first quarter 2012 performance. Sales of $9",2437,"Thank you, Brennen, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings release, our first quarter results provided a very strong start to what we expect will be another record year for FMC. 
Summarizing our first quarter 2012 performance. Sales of $951 million increased 18% above last year's first quarter, and adjusted earnings of $1.94 per diluted share grew 30% versus a year-ago quarter. Agricultural Products delivered a robust performance in the quarter. Sales of $454 million increased 32%, driven by broad-based growth across Latin America, North America and Asia. Segment earnings of $130 million increased 29% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by the sales gain, partially offset by higher spending on several growth initiatives.
In Specialty Chemicals, the performance met our expectations. Sales of $216 million were up 3% as higher selling prices were achieved in all businesses, particularly in food, pharmaceuticals and lithium primary markets. Partially offsetting these pricing gains were lower volumes related to downtimes associated with capacity expansions and plant tie-ins at our Argentina lithium facility, and to a lesser degree, at BioPolymer's alginates facility in Norway. Segment earnings of $44 million were down 1% as the sales gain were more than offset by higher weather-related operating costs in lithium, plant downtime effects, higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. 
In Industrial Chemicals, sales of $273 million increased 12%, driven by higher selling prices, especially in soda ash, and volume growth in soda ash and specialty peroxygens. Segment earnings of $48.1 million increased 19% as the result of the sales gains, favorable export mix in soda ash and the continued mix shift in peroxygens towards specialties markets. 
Taking a look at total company sales on a regional basis in the first quarter. Sales in Latin America demonstrated the highest growth rate, up 38%, driven by Agricultural Products as a result of the strong finish through the crop season in Brazil and sales from a new market access joint venture in Argentina. We also increased soda ash exports to the region and realized healthy sales growth in BioPolymer. 
Sales growth in North America was strong, of 14%. Sales in Agricultural Products benefited from healthy demand for pre-emergent herbicide, new product introduction and the shift of some sales from the second quarter due to an early start of the 2012 season. Industrial Chemicals benefited from higher selling prices across all businesses in the region. 
Sales in Asia were also up 14% in the quarter. Drivers of this growth were broad-based, with gains in Agricultural Products, soda ash exports and in food and pharmaceuticals businesses in BioPolymer. 
Sales in EMEA were up 8% as greater penetration in peroxygens market, sales gains in BioPolymer's pharmaceuticals business and higher sales of herbicide and fungicide in Agricultural Products all contributed to the increase. 
As you know, we are focusing on increasing our presence in the rapidly developing economies of the world, RDEs, as we refer to them internally. Looking at sales growth in these economies by region shows good progress being made. Sales in Latin America grew 38%; sales in Asian RDEs grew 13%; sales in Middle East & Africa grew 14%; and sales in Central and Eastern Europe and Turkey grew more modestly at 5%, mainly due to timing effects in the quarter. 
Moving now to corporate items. Corporate expense was $14.2 million versus $16.8 million last year. Interest expense was $11.3 million as compared to $9.9 million last year. On March 31, 2011, gross consolidated debt was $947 million; and debt, net of cash, was $876 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $32.2 million, and capital expenditures were $38.8 million. 
On a GAAP basis, the company reported net income of $119 million or $1.71 per diluted share versus net income of $94 million or $1.30 per diluted share in last year's first quarter. Net income in the current quarter included charges of $16 million after-tax or $0.23 per diluted share versus charges of $14 million after-tax or $0.19 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. With that reconciliation, our non-GAAP earnings were $1.94 per diluted share in the current quarter, up 30% versus $1.49 per diluted share in last year's first quarter. 
Now let's take a more detailed look at the performance of each of our operating segments in the quarter, starting in Agricultural Products. First quarter sales of $454 million increased 32%, driven by broad-based volume growth across Latin America, North America and Asia, augmented by targeted price increases. Latin America delivered the highest sales gain, driven by a strong finish to the crop season in Brazil, particularly in sugarcane and cotton segments, and sales from a new market access joint venture in Argentina. North America also delivered a significant sales gain, resulting from strong demand for pre-emergent herbicide, growth from new product introductions and the shift in some sales from the second quarter, driven by an early start to the 2012 season due to favorable weather conditions and high crop prices. In Asia, sales gain reflected continued strong demand across the region, particularly China, Indonesia and Pakistan, and growth from new product introductions. In EMEA, the sales increase was driven by higher herbicide and fungicide's volumes. Segment earnings of $130 million increased 29% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by the broad-based sales growth, partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives. 
Agricultural Products continues to deliver sustained premium performance as we successfully execute on our differentiated strategy. The first elements of our strategy, innovation by continuously aggregating technologies and applying them to key focus market has been a key factor. While we continue to deliver the superior performance quarter-after-quarter, we are also thoughtfully investing in the future growth of Agricultural Products. We have a rich pipeline of organic growth initiatives in the group that will deliver profitable growth, not only in the near term, but well beyond our Vision 2015 time frame. We have been carefully including spending in both R&D and in selling and technical service.
In a very short period of time, Agricultural Products has also established a strong track record in pursuing external growth initiatives. Last year, our first full year of implementing this initiative, the group successfully made accretive product line and technology acquisition, signing licensing agreements from development alliances and move into adjacent spaces. Clearly, Agricultural Products is well on its way to meeting or surpassing its Vision 2015 objectives. 
And now moving on to Specialty Chemicals. Sales of $216 million were up 3% as higher selling price were achieved across all businesses, particularly in food, pharmaceutical and lithium primaries markets. Lower volumes resulting from downtime associated with capacity expansion and plant tie-ins at our Argentina lithium facility and to a lesser degree, at BioPolymer's alginates facility in Norway, with limited top line growth in the quarter. Segment earnings of $44 million declined 1%, essentially in line with our outlook given to you last quarter. The sales gain was offset by higher weather-related operating costs and plant downtime effects associated with the capacity expansion projects, higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. 
Looking at each business for more detail. In BioPolymer, sales increased solidly as a result of higher sales price across the business. Sales growth in pharmaceutical buyers and these integrants was especially strong in the quarter on higher selling prices and continued steady volume growth. In food ingredients, we benefited from higher selling prices and favorable mix. We anticipate continued premium growth in our microcrystalline cellulose product line, or MCC, serving beverage and dairy markets, especially in Asia. We're making a series of capacity expansion to serve this growth. Last year, we expanded our Cork, Ireland facility, which increased our global capacity by 25% for food and pharmaceutical grade MCC. We are currently expanding our Newark, Delaware facility by 25%, and expect this additional capacity to be in production by the end of the year. And in addition, we are evaluating the setting of a greenfield MCC plant in Asia. BioPolymer delivered strong earnings growth in the quarter as a result of the pricing gain and favorable mix, partially offset by lower volume and higher specialty wood pulp costs. 
Moving to lithium. Sales grew modestly, driven by pricing gains, especially in lithium primaries, which were more than offset -- which more than offset lower volume resulting from production downtime associated with our capacity expansion in Argentina. The plant tie-in in Argentina was completed despite heavy rain in January and February, which are seasonally very unusual for the region. The rains impacted production volumes and costs by diluting peroxygen [ph] operation pond inventories. Lithium earnings were lower than expected due to these adverse weather impacts. We are seeing higher processing cost and a slightly lower ramping production volume as a result of the dilution. The impacts will be largely behind us by the end of the second quarter. Therefore, sequentially, we anticipate a significant pickup in lithium sales and earnings in the second half of this year compared to the first half. 
Moving now to Industrial Chemicals. Revenue of $273 million increased 12%, driven by higher selling prices across the segments, particularly in soda ash, augmented by volume growth in soda ash and specialty peroxygens. Segment earnings of $48 million increased 19% as a result of the sales gain, favorable export mix in soda ash and a continued success in shifting peroxygens mix towards specialties market. 
Now let's look at drivers of performance for each of the businesses. In soda ash, we realized strong sales and earnings as we benefited from higher selling prices in 2012 contracts and volume growth from food production at our Granger facility, which came online in the middle of last year. Granger product serves export demand growth, which continues to outpace domestic growth. Export demand for ANSAC remained healthy. We benefited from higher ANSAC selling price in both Latin America and Asia. For perspective, in 2012, we expect to ship just over 50% of the total volume to the export markets. Within the export market, about half of the volume goes to Latin America and the other half to the rest of the world -- to Asia and the rest of the world. 
The contract nature varies by region. Nearly all North American and Latin American contracts have annual fixed price provision. In Asia, the majority of contract terms are 3 to 6 months in duration. So with domestic and Latin America contracts essentially fixed for the year, the only area for pricing change is in Asia. In Asia, ANSAC configures our trainings intended for users. In recent quarters, trainings for users have benefited from historically high margins despite rising input costs. We have seen Asian pricing suffering as we went through the first quarter due to lower demand and pricing for domestic Chinese soda ash, which impacted export prices from China. 
In our outlook for the year, we continue to make a conservative and prudent view that ANSAC Asian export prices will decline modestly as competition accelerates. Nonetheless, we are very confident that the average export price for 2012 will remain materially higher than the average in 2011. This higher export price, coupled with higher domestic pricing, give rise to our outlook for significant profit growth from our soda ash business in 2012. As a result, we are also very confident that the Industrial Chemicals segment will deliver the 20% earnings growth that is in our full year guidance. 
Moving to peroxygens. In peroxygen, we also realized strong sales and earning growth. The sales increase was driven by higher volume and selling prices in specialty peroxygen, augmented by higher selling prices in European hydrogen peroxide. Earnings benefited from the sales gain and the continued several shift mix towards specialties. 
As we have been running the specialty strategy for a couple of years now, the split between specialties and commodities in North America is almost 50-50, which is far more balanced than the rest of the world. We are focusing our efforts on driving globalization of the specialties business to continue on the path to achieving our Vision 2015 goal. 
During the quarter, we took another significant step toward realizing one of Industrial Chemicals' Vision 2015, that is the building of the environmental solutions platform. Today, we are announcing the launch of FMC Environmental Solutions, a new business that elevates and formalizes our company's commitment to the growing pollution prevention and remediation market. This business integrates our existing portfolio of products, processes and application that sustainably address complex pollution challenges in air, soil and water. We are committed to building in our already strong foundation and to expand our technology portfolio of products, offerings and people resources in this high-growth specialty market. Our expectations are to grow FMC Environmental Solutions over the next several few years into a business with sales in the $100 million to $200 million range by 2015. 
To ensure we bring appropriate focus and resources to air, soil and water markets, we have structured FMC Environment Solutions with 3 platforms or business units. The first one, Air Pollution Control, we are targeting power utility and manufacturing industries with low-cost capital solutions to help meet current and pending regulations for air quality standards. We are focused on the removal of acid gases, such as SOx and HCl, via the use of trona and sodium bicarbonates as reagents in dry sorbent injection, or DSI, through our joint venture with Natronx; and hydrogen peroxide for the removal of NOx in conjunction with conventional scrubbers through our new Environmental Solutions business. 
Soil & Groundwater Remediation, this business unit develops and markets unique fast-acting chemistries that treat a wide range of contaminants in soil and groundwater. With our recent acquisition of the assets of Adventus Intellectual Property, we are the global leader in chemical remediation technologies that are used underground. Our chemistries are focused on the remediation of normal and halogenated organics and minerals via reduction and oxidation. Our portfolio of technologies is unique. From a persulfate-based Klozur products to the carbon-based products we acquired from Adventus, we can now address the full spectrum of site issues, namely soils, plume and groundwater. 
And now Water Treatment. We are utilizing a number of chemistries from our peroxygens business in municipal wastewater facilities that are more environmentally benign than traditional chlorine chemistry. This business unit will also market various proprietary green chemistries for enhancing water treatment in the oil and gas exploration field by neutralizing sulfur-reducing bacteria. 
With that review of our business, I will turn the call over to Kim Foster for a review of our financial position. Kim?"

Recall that in November of last year, we committed to repurchase $200 million of shares by the end of the first quarter of 2012. Following that commitment, we repurchased $55 million of shares in the fourth quarter of last year. And I'm pleased to report that in the first quarter, we completed the $200 million program with the repurchase of approximately $145 million of shares. At the start of the second quarter, we have $245 million of repurchased capacity remaining under an existing board authorization. 
Going forward, we will continue to govern and balance the pace of execution of our share repurchases with our capital needs to drive organic growth in the investment and targeted external opportunities. 
Moving to our recent announcement of a 2-for-1 stock split. Following our shareholders' approval of an amendment to increase the number of authorized shares, last week, our Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split of our common stock. The split will be affected in the form of a distribution payable on May 24, 2012, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 11, 2012. Trading in the common stock will begin on a post-split adjusted basis on May 25, 2012. 
I'll close by reaffirming guidance for certain financial items, which we gave you during last quarter's conference call. Free cash flow for 2012 is reconfirmed at $200 million to $225 million for the year. Our capital expenditure forecast is reaffirmed at $250 million, and our tax rate for the year is reaffirmed at 27%. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to you, Pierre."
28606,183647336,294251,"FMC Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 01, 2012",2012-05-01,"Earnings Calls","FMC Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kim. Regarding the outlook for the full year of 2012, we have raised the midpoint of our previous outlook and now expect adjusted earnings of $6.80 to $7.05 per diluted share, a 16% increase above last year at the midpoint of this range. Our",511,"Thank you, Kim. Regarding the outlook for the full year of 2012, we have raised the midpoint of our previous outlook and now expect adjusted earnings of $6.80 to $7.05 per diluted share, a 16% increase above last year at the midpoint of this range. 
Our Agricultural Products segment expect to achieve its ninth straight year of record earnings, up 10% to 15% over last year. Sales gain is the result of volume growth in all regions, particularly in Latin America, North America and Asia, due to strong market condition and growth from new and acquired products, partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives. 
And our Specialty Chemicals segment expect to achieve its seventh straight year of record earnings, led by the eighth straight year of record earnings in BioPolymer. Segment earnings are expected to be up approximately 5%, reflecting higher selling prices across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer and lithium specialties. Partially offsetting this growth are higher lithium operating costs in the first half of the year, higher raw material costs and increased spending on several growth initiatives in BioPolymer. 
As I mentioned earlier, in our Lithium business, we expect a significant sequential pickup in sales and earnings in the second half of the year compared to the first half. 
In our Industrial Chemicals segment, we expect earnings to be up 20%, driven by higher volumes and selling price in soda ash and specialty peroxygen, augmented by the continued mix shift towards specialty peroxygens. 
Moving to our outlook for the second quarter of 2012. We expect adjusted earnings of $1.65 to $1.85 per diluted share, a 14% increase in the midpoint of this range. In Agricultural Products, we expect earnings to be up about 5%, reflecting growth in all regions, partially offset by the shift of some sales in North America to the first quarter and higher spending on targeted growth initiatives. To get a better read on trend line earnings growth, without the shift in some North American sales in the first quarter, the second quarter percent earnings increase would've been in the low teens. 
Specialty Chemicals segment earnings are projected to be up 5% -- or to be 5% lower as higher selling prices across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer are offset by higher operating costs in lithium, higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. 
And in Industrial Chemicals, we expect second quarter segment earnings to be up approximately 30%, driven by higher selling prices in soda ash and specialty peroxygens, volume growth in soda ash, the absence of Granger's soda ash facility start-up costs incurred in the prior quarter and the continued mix shift towards specialty peroxygen. Again, for a better read on trend line earning growth, where Granger's start-up costs not incurred in last year's second quarter, the percent earnings increase for the second quarter 2012 would have been in the low teens. 
With that, I thank you for your time and attention, and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator, please?"

We had issues in bringing some of the equipment we need because of the weather on the road. But the length of the downtime was about the same. The problem is the downtime, combined with the weather, created some issues to operate the plant. Even the pod was working the way it was working at full capacity. We also had dilutions, very significant dilutions of the ponds, which is forcing us to work with brine which is more diluted. So we had -- it's much more a combination of 2 negative effects together, which have created a situation where in the first quarter, the performance was low compared to -- significantly below what we had a year ago. We will still see that effect in the second quarter because even if the tie-ins of the plants are done, we're going to be having diluted ponds, and we're going to be operating with the brine which is less concentrated, which will create less product from the plant in a high operating cost. Things are starting to get better in the third quarter. So third quarter, you will see sequential and year-on-year improvement in the EBIT, not yet at full capacity. I think we will have fully recovered from all of that, and the lithium business will be at full performance in the fourth quarter. So you will see sequential improvement from first quarter to the fourth quarter with the start of the ramp-up, the most visible start of the ramp-up being in the third quarter."

It is just a timing of one versus the other. I would say the one which is the most likely to take off first and be quickly undertaken is the MCC plant in Asia. Regarding the mix, we believe the mix is going to be -- the export mix is going to be the same year-on-year. The only difference is more of a quarter. We had left shipment towards Russia or Eastern Europe or some other countries which are more difficult and less favorable from a mix standpoint, but we're going to ship more toward those in the second quarter.

And we believed, after looking into our portfolio of technology pipeline, that we were limited, not by the ideas, not by the portfolio of what we could bring to the market, just by the resource and money. And seeing the growth potential of the company, the earnings potential of the company, we have decided that we can deliver beyond expectations, but still invest more in the future of the company and in the past. So what we called growth initiatives are mostly strengthening our research globally by more resource in North America, but also in other places like Asia or Latin America, more sales, more tech service in order to bring more work on registrations in Ag, so more spending to bring new technology to the market faster. And we've been thinking about should we do that for a couple of years when I joined, but I believe, for a little while, we're going to want to take opportunities or what we have in front of us because we do have lots of positive things which are happening in the company, which will allow us growth for many years."

I hope that during today's call, we have demonstrated again our ability to deliver strong performance quarter-after-quarter, while at the same time continue to make well-placed organic and external investments to ensure our future profitable growth. We delivered 2 superb years in 2010 and 2011 and are off a strong start in 2012. We are confident that we will continue to realize the earnings power investors should expect from the FMC portfolio. 1.5 years ago, we shared with you a plan with our overriding objective to drive top quartile total shareholder return. It has an aggressive organic growth component, which would be augmented by a focused external growth component. As we say, we were to realize this aggressive growth, we have made targeted increases in our below-the-line costs. We have increased research and development spending, especially in Agricultural Products and BioPolymer. We had increased selling and technical service expenses, and we had invested in critical infrastructure to deliver this growth where it is needed. The vast majority of this spend is out in the business and regions where it should be, close to our customers. We are fortunate that today, we have a rich organic growth pipeline that will leverage our strong new product and technology innovation expertise. Equally, we have a rich external pipeline that offers us the opportunity to make focused equity and acquisitions. Our success here is evident. In 2012, we will derive $90 million in sales and $15 million in EBIT and EPS of $0.07 from the 8 transactions we completed in 2011. Including the related organic growth investments to fund the growth of each of these transactions, we are on track to meet our goal for external growth to contribute $800 million or more in 2015 revenues. 
So in summary, I can say that now, more than ever, we are confident that 2012 will be another record year for FMC, that we are solidly on track to achieve our Vision 2015 objective, and equally importantly, that we are building a company that will deliver premium growth and value well beyond 2015. I look forward to providing you an update on the Vision 2015 progress during next quarter's call, and I look forward to presenting an in-depth review of our Vision 2015 strategy at an Investor Day to be held on Tuesday, December 11, 2012, in New York City.

As you saw in our earnings release last night, we delivered another strong quarter with earnings per share up 20% versus the prior year period, continuing a trajectory to deliver another record year for FMC.",1018,"Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings release last night, we delivered another strong quarter with earnings per share up 20% versus the prior year period, continuing a trajectory to deliver another record year for FMC. Let me walk you through the company's overall results for the quarter. We delivered adjusted earnings of $0.92 per diluted share, an increase of 20% versus the year-ago quarter. Total company sales of $905 million increased $93 million or 11% versus last year. The strong performance was led by continued robust performance in our Agricultural Products segment and with sales growth in all businesses. Sales grew most rapidly in Latin America, up 32%; followed by Asia, up 13%; and North America, up 9%. Sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa or EMEA decreased slightly less than 4%, reflecting principally the impact of weaker euro. Gross margin of $341 million increased by $42 million or 14% versus last year. 
Gross margin percent of 37.7% improved by 88 basis points over last year, driven by higher selling prices, higher volumes and improved mix, only partially offset by higher costs. SG&A and R&D of $148 million increased $18 million or 14%, largely due to increased spending for targeted growth initiatives. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $127 million increased $16 million or 15% compared to last year. 
Let's now take a more detailed look at the performance of each of our operating segment in the quarter.  First, Agricultural Products. Second quarter sales of $394 million increased 19% versus the prior year quarter, with substantial sales gain in Latin America and North America. Latin America sales growth was driven by continued strength in sugarcane, growth in soybeans and sales from a new market venture in Argentina. North America showed strong demand for proprietary herbicides and higher insecticide sales due to strong test pressure and growth in the corn segment. Asia and EMEA sales were marginally down versus the prior year period. Segment earnings for Agricultural Products of $111 million increased 18% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by strong volume growth, partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiative.
Another development of note for Agricultural Products Group in the quarter was the reapproval of bifenthrin for use in the European Union by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. Bifenthrin has long been recognized as valuable and effective crop protection product by growers around the world. It is unique, versatile insecticide that works quickly on a range of destructive insects. It will once again be available to growers in the EU, where it will be registered for all , vegetables or and other users. FMC will also continue to develop new and innovative formulations for this product, which should lead to increased sales and market shares in key EU markets. Though we are very excited about the news, due to the time line to reduce bifenthrin across target countries in the EU, we do not expect any sales or EBIT impact until 2014.
Moving now the Industrial Chemicals. Revenue in the Industrial Chemicals increased 9% to $277 million, driven by higher selling prices across the segment, especially in soda ash and volume growth in soda ash and specialty peroxygens. Segment earnings of $43 million increased 18% as a result of the sales gains and the continued favorable mix shift in peroxygen towards specialty applications, partially offset by an anticipated production downtime in soda ash. 
In soda ash, we continue to see higher overall selling prices versus the prior year. Domestic prices showed continued year-on-year improvements and as you saw, we announced in July a $10 per ton increase in our list soda ash prices. As is the case every year, this increase will have very low impact on 2012 results since the vast majority of domestic contracts have prices fixed for the calendar year.  These price increase announcements does, however, form the basis for 2013 contract negotiation, which typically occur in November and December. Export prices overall were also up year-over-year in the second quarter. 
In Asia, soda ash prices declined sequentially in the second quarter as anticipated in the first quarter call following the slowdown in soda ash demand growth in China that impacted export prices in Asia. Soda ash prices in Asia were, however, still up high-single-digit percent compared to the prior year period. As sales through Asia represent less than 1/3 of our total soda ash exports, sustained priced increase in Latin America and other export markets helped maintain the upward trajectory of overall soda ash export prices. Soda ash prices within China and Chinese export markets are both now at or below Chinese producers' cash cost. In the mid-term, we are confident that prices in Asia will rebound due to a combination of recovery and a continued cost pressures related to energy, raw materials, labor and currency appreciation. Let's say we expect to see continuing pressure on Asian soda ash prices as we enter the third quarter.
In light of these changes in domestic and export pricing, we now expect a global average selling price for the year to be up in the high-single digits on a dollar-per-ton basis. Soda ash volume was also up in the quarter, but growth was limited by unplanned production downtime at our Green River site. The issues were one-off in nature and have been resolved. Overall, a very positive quarter for soda ash business. 
Moving to Peroxygens business. Peroxygens delivered sales growth in the quarter with somewhat higher volumes, higher prices and improved mix. We continue to be pleased with the transformation of the Peroxygens business with steady growth in our targeted specialty applications in the quarter. The new environmental solutions business, formally launched in May, is well underway. With a focused growing team now on the ground, we're excited about the future contribution of this business to Industrial Chemicals' overall growth goals.
Let's now move to our Specialty Chemicals segment for an in-depth review of our BioPolymer and Lithium business both for Specialty Chemicals. I'll turn the call now over to Michael Wilson. Michael?"

I'm pleased to review we've you the current outlook for Specialty Chemicals Group. After updating you on our second quarter performance and near-term outlook, I will share some insights on the terrific progress we're making in the strategic evolution of our BioPolymer business. I'll also address some of the mid-term issues facing our Lithium business as we continue in our path to delivering Specialty Chemicals' portion of the FMC's Vision 2015 strategic plan. 
First, a review of second quarter performance. Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $235 million, up 3% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by higher selling prices in all businesses and strong volume growth in specialty food ingredients. The revenue gain was partially offset by unfavorable exchange rate impacts from the weakening euro on the BioPolymer business. On a constant-currency basis, Specialty Chemicals sales were up 5% versus the prior year period. Segment earnings of $53 million were down 6% from the prior year quarter as anticipated, with higher prices across the segment offset by higher manufacturing cost in Lithium, higher raw material costs in BioPolymer, increased investment to support growth initiatives such as the natural colors effort in BioPolymer and unfavorable exchange rate impacts. BioPolymer delivered another solid quarter, achieving record EBIT. Sales grew in the low-single digits driven by price increases in stronger volumes particularly in food ingredients, which were partially offset by the effects of a weaker euro affecting mainly pharmaceutical ingredients. Lithium sales growth was driven by continued price increases as the lingering effects of the operational issues we faced in the first quarter kept volumes flat and continued to affect costs and efficiencies in the quarter. Combined with a sustained high inflation in Argentina, this led to weaker profitability in Lithium as compared to the prior year period. Sequentially, Lithium profitability improved versus the first quarter of 2012, but continues to be well below our expectations. I will address our expectations for improvement in Lithium in a few moments.
Looking ahead to the third quarter and the remainder of the year for Specialty Chemicals, we expect third quarter segment earnings to be down approximately 5%. In BioPolymer, higher selling prices and volume growth will be offset by higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives. In Lithium, poor evaporative conditions during the Argentine winter have not allowed concentrations to recover from the impacts of the heavy rainfall and flooding in the first quarter as we previously expected. This has limited our ability to exploit the capacity expansion brought online in the first quarter and will result in continuing capacity constraints and higher manufacturing costs through the third quarter. 
For the full year, we expect revenue to be up approximately 5%, driven by higher selling prices across the segments and volume growth in BioPolymer. We anticipate full year segment earnings to be flat with sales gain offset by production constraints and continuing cost increases in Argentina and Lithium, as well as higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. I should note that while we expect considerable improvement in Lithium earnings in the second half of 2012, with earnings essentially doubling versus the first half, we will not see significant benefits from the recent expansion until the fourth quarter. 
Let me now share with you an overview of the significant progress we are making in the strategic evolution of our BioPolymer business, particularly in the area of specialty food ingredients. When we launched FMC's Vision 2015 strategic plan in 2010, we established several strategic imperatives for our BioPolymer business including 4 specific imperatives for our food ingredients business: invest in core products to strengthen our leadership position, leverage customer relationships by broadening our portfolio, increased participation in higher-growth high-value added ingredients and expand our RDE position by investing in growth markets. I'm pleased to report that we've made substantial progress on each of these imperatives. We have reinforced our leadership position in colloidal microcrystalline cellulose, or MCC, and alginate to do a series of capacity expansions in our Cork, Ireland, Par , Norway and Newark, Delaware facilities. And last week, we announced that FMC's Board of Directors has approved $100 million plus investment to build a new MCC plant in Thailand to serve the rapid demand growth for this highly differentiated food ingredients in Asia. 
In addition, earlier today, we announced yet another major new development, FMC's entry into the pectin market through the acquisition of Pectine Italia. We have for many years explored opportunities to add pectin into our portfolio of as a complement our existing product line well particularly for low pH applications. Our technical team already regularly works with Pectine in solving specific customer problems. Pectine has a sizable global market, roughly $650 million in 2012 and is growing at a high-single digit annually, substantially faster than the overall food ingredients market. We're confident we can leverage our global market knowledge and deep customer relationships to grow this business into a meaningful product lines for FMC approaching $100 million in the 5-year time horizon. while our initial entry into pectin is small as with many of our external growth investments, Pectine Italia is rich in technology and know-how. It will provide the basis for future organic and inorganic investments as we build out this product line. Pectine Italia is also strategically located near important raw material resources. We expect to close this acquisition by the end of the third quarter, and we'll certainly share more about our plans in Pectine at our December Investor Day.
We are equally excited about our substantial progress in natural colors. Natural colors is an even faster growing market than pectin. Roughly $750 million in size today, the natural colors market is growing at least 12% per year or 3x the rate of the overall food ingredients segment. This growth is driven predominantly by the strong consumer pull from more natural ingredients in food products, which is driving a worldwide conversion from synthetic to natural colors. natural colors market is currently fragmented, with only 2 truly global pillars and a large number of local and regional companies who lack the customer access and global reach to fully capitalize on growth opportunities. FMC first entered the natural colors market in late 2011 with the acquisition of BioColor business of South Pole BioGroup, a Chilean-based the company that was an emerging technology leader in natural colors. In June of this year, we acquired Limited, a more established natural colors company based in the U.K., which was led by 2 technical and commercial pioneers in the natural colors industry. With both BioColor and , the previous owners have remained with FMC as an advisory capacities as we build our technical depth. 
We see tremendous potential for natural colors is part of BioPolymer's food ingredients franchise. As with pectin, we plan to build this into $100 million plus product line for FMC over the next 5 years through a mix of continued acquisitions and focused organic investments and additional manufacturing, commercial and technical capacity. 
And finally, as I hope it's clear to the various actions I've highlighted thus far, through acquisitions of new plant investments, we are greatly increasing our participation in rapidly developing economies. This is a very exciting time in BioPolymer's food ingredients business, and we have great expectations for the business to continue to be a key franchise for FMC going forward. 
However, I would be remiss to focus exclusively on the food ingredients portion of BioPolymer in my comments today. The FMC BioPolymer pharmaceutical ingredients business continues to be an anchor franchise for FMC as well. The MCC capacity expansions on the new Thailand plant that I mentioned earlier will also support continued growth of our pharmaceutical ingredients franchise, particularly our leading line Of brand MCC tablet binders. We continue to build our RDE D presence in pharmaceutical ingredients, especially in India where we will open a new customer technical support lab later this quarter. 
Turning now to FMC Lithium. We continue to have high expectations for growth and profit improvement in this business. The global market for Lithium, at roughly $1 billion today, is sizable and growing rapidly. We continue to expect robust growth in global demand for Lithium from roughly 100,000 tons of Lithium carbonate equivalent or LCE in 2010 to above 260,000 tons of LCE by 2020, an overall compound annual growth rate of approximately 10%. This growth comes from a combination of sustained low-single-digit growth in traditional industrial and polymer applications, coupled with high-teens growth in demand for energy applications broadly including electronic devices, transportation and other emerging applications.
So the demand side looks very promising for Lithium, both in the near and long term. On the supply side, we continue to believe existing industry leaders are best positioned to supply the growing needs of the markets. Though there's much attention paid for early stage development projects in lithium around the world, no new source has been successfully commercialized in over a decade as technical and logistical challenges in exploiting Lithium reserve are formidable. The existing industry leaders are situated on the best resources in the world and will continue to have a substantial cost advantage over new entrants. Further, the existing industry leaders have deep technical expertise in the extraction and purification of Lithium that new entrants cannot readily develop. And while Lithium pricing continues to increase, the likely cost position of many new entrants is such that even with strong price increases, they will be challenged to make a reasonable return on investment. 
That said, FMC's current lithium base in Argentina does face some challenges. Putting aside the recent operational issues, which are well understood and being addressed, the biggest obstacle to continued long-term supply growth for FMC is the current political and economic situation in Argentina. While the stand-alone project economics of reinvesting at a proven existing reserve are compelling, the current high inflation and challenging political economic environment make it difficult to commit to a significant investment decision in Argentina at this time. Consequently, as we shared with you in last quarter's call, we have delayed any decision on future expansion in Argentina through the end of the year as we continue to monitor the situation there. Meanwhile, we're evaluating other capacity alternatives outside of Argentina. Let me be clear, FMC is committed to the Lithium business for the long term. We have deep technical expertise in both operations and applications and strong customer relationships to support a long-term successful position, and we have multiple options for future expansion including in Argentina if the situation there improves. We will update you as we advance our future capacity plans, and I expect to be able to provide clear direction in our path forward in the near future. In the meantime, we will continue to work with customers to maintain our leading positions, particularly in the energy applications. 
So in summary for Specialty Chemicals, I'm very pleased with our progress in driving strategic evolution of our businesses. We're greatly strengthening our BioPolymer franchise, positioning it for continued strong performance over the long term, and we will maintain our leadership position in the global lithium industry. The outlook for Specialty Chemicals Group is bright, and I'm honored to lead the talented group of FMC employees driving our efforts. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Foster, and we'll be happy to answer any questions during the Q&A."
28606,212273163,336429,"FMC Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2012",2012-08-01,"Earnings Calls","FMC Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll report in our free cash flow, our recent stock split and finally comment on our tax rate. First, as a reminder, free cash flow is defined as after all uses except acquisitions, dividends and share re",474,"Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll report in our free cash flow, our recent stock split and finally comment on our tax rate. First, as a reminder, free cash flow is defined as after all uses except acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. We are reaffirming our previous forecast of $200 million to $225 million for the year. As previously stated, the full year free cash flow guidance included -- includes forecasted capital expenditures of $250 million. Through the first 6 months of 2012, cumulative free cash flow has been $153 million, which includes capital spending of $81 million. Clearly, the pace of capital spending in the second half of the year will be significantly in excess of the pace during the first half. This will include the first phases of the Asia MCC plant project that Michael described to you a few moments ago, completion of the Newark, Delaware MCC expansion as well as other smaller expansion projects and maintenance projects across all of our businesses. 
As I mentioned during the first quarter conference call, our Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split of our common stock at the April board meeting. This split was effected in the form of the new distribution paid on May 24, 2012, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 11, 2012, trading in the common stock on a post-split basis beyond on May 25, 2012. Consequently, we all need to adjust our key metrics by 2. For example, our previous full year guidance of $6.80 to $7.05 per diluted share translates to $3.40 to $3.52 per diluted share, and our shares outstanding are revised from 69 million shares to 138 million shares. And of course, our 3-digit stock price is now on its way back to the 3-digit level. 
Regarding share repurchases, our strategy of returning cash to shareholders continues to balance prudent financial policy with the competing demands of investments to support organic growth and the capital to support selected external investments. While we have 245 million of repurchase capacity remaining under our existing board authorization, we made no additional share repurchases in the second quarter as we prepare to fund heavy capital spending in the second half of this year.
Moving to taxes. Let me note that we are now forecasting a full year tax rate of 27.5%, 50 basis points higher than our previous forecast. This increase is driven by significantly higher profits in the United States, largely due to higher sales of ag products in the first half of 2012. The tax rate in the second quarter was 28% and the tax rate for the last 2 quarters is projected to be 27.5%, which will result in a full year tax rate of 27.5%. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to you, Pierre."

Well deserved, Kim. Before we get to the outlook for the third quarter and a full year, I'd like to",1069,"Thank you, Kim, and I must say, we are fortunate to have one of the best CFOs in America in our ranks as commented yesterday by The Wall Street Journal. Well deserved, Kim. 
Before we get to the outlook for the third quarter and a full year, I'd like to give you a brief update on Vision 2015 progress. As we begin the second half of 2012, I am pleased to report that we continue to be well on plan towards realizing our Vision 2015 objectives. First, relative to our key P&L objectives, 2015 sales in excess of $5 billion and EBIT of $1.2 billion. We continue to deliver results at or above the trend line required to reach these targets. 
In terms of return on capital, we are delivering results. We're leveraging invested capital on our commitment of [indiscernible] . In fact, our return on average invested capital in 2011 was 23.9%, a strong performance, well above our minimum commitment. We continue to show improvement earnings stability especially in the Industrial Chemicals Group, reflecting the strength of a portfolio and impact of actions we took in 2010 and 2011 to exit the underperforming and highly volatile phosphate and sodium percarbonate business side. 
As Kim highlighted, we remain disciplined of cash with a balanced deployment and organics and additional growth investments and return to cash to shareholders -- of cash to shareholders. In fact, not quite halfway through a Vision 2015 plan cycle, we have already returned or have committed to return $750 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. This is more than half of the minimum commitments of returning $1 billion of cash to shareholders that we announced at the launch of the plan. So from a commitment perspective, we are making great progress. 
Beyond the metrics, we also delivered against our overall Vision 2015 strategic imperatives in the first half of 2012. First, growing our leadership position. As Michael described, we broadened our specialty food ingredients platform with the acquisition of Limited in the natural space and the announced signing of a definitive agreement to purchase Pectine Italia. 
Increasing our reach. We continue to increase our participation in rapidly developing economies with sales in RDEs at 25% in the first half of 2012 and sales in RDEs representing nearly 47% of the total company sales for the last 12 months. 
Capturing the value of common ownership. We continue to shift from a highly centralized organization to a balanced centralized, de centralized model that better leverages our size and scale and to act as one FMC where it matters, realizing efficiencies while maintaining strong  through business unit. Our global procurement team is making great progress and we're on schedule to deliver projected cost savings. 
Our operations group is also making great strides in building excellence in operations, supply chains and environments health and safety across FMC. We are beginning several exciting initiatives on the operations area, particularly around manufacturing efficiency improvements. I will share more on this effort in the future. 
Proactively managing our portfolio. Industrial Chemicals portfolio has been a real focus. we addressed businesses that we are competitively disadvantaged and underperforming for next period of time. [ph] In 2010, we exited the phosphate and sulfate derivatives business. In mid-2011, we announced our exit of the sodium percarbonate business line, which was completed in early 2012. With these moves, Industrial Chemicals have been transformed into a segment with sustained higher margin, greater earnings stability and significantly higher return on assets. 
Finally, disciplined cash deployment, which a few moments ago. In short, we're making exceptional progress towards delivering Vision 2015 line, and I and the FMC management team look forward to sharing much more detail context about Vision 2015 progress and long-range plans at our institutional investors concerns to be held on December 11, 2012 in New York.
Moving on to our outlook for the full year 2012. We raised slightly the midpoint of our previous outlook for the full year 2012 and now expect adjusted earnings for $3.42 to $3.52 per diluted share, a 16% increase above last year at the midpoint of the range. At Agricultural Products segment expects to achieve its ninth consecutive year of record earnings with year-over-year earnings up in the high teens, reflecting increased volumes especially in Latin America, North America and Asia due to strong market conditions and growth from new and acquired product, but partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives. 
As Michael described earlier, segment earnings in Specialty Chemicals are expected to be flat for the year. We are forecasting the eighth straight year of record earnings in BioPolymer with higher selling price and volume growth, partially offset by the impacts of higher raw materials costs, increased spending on targeted growth initiative and unfavorable actions rate impact. 
However, segment earnings will be dampened by weak performance from the Lithium business with the operational issues Michael highlighted, as well as continuing cost increase in Argentina offsetting higher selling prices. 
And now in industrial chemicals segment. We expect earnings to be up in the high teens percent due to higher volumes and selling prices in soda ash and the third consecutive year of record earnings from the Peroxygens business, reflecting the continued mix shift of that business toward specialty applications. 
Now moving to our outlook for the third quarter 2012. We expect adjusted earnings of $0.70 to $0.80 per diluted share for the third quarter, a 9% increase at the midpoint of this range. Agricultural Products, we expect third quarter segment earnings to be up approximately 10%, reflecting strong growth in Latin America especially Brazil, partially offset by continued investment in target growth initiative. Specialty Chemicals third quarter segment earnings are projected to be down approximately 5%, as higher selling prices across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer are offset by higher operating costs in Lithium as well as higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. In Industrial Chemicals, we expect third quarter segment earnings to be up in the mid-teens percent, driven by higher selling prices in soda ash and specialty peroxygens, volume growth in soda ash and the continued mix shift towards specialty peroxygens, partially offset by a planned maintenance outage in our Tonawanda, New York peroxygens specialty .

As you recall from the discussion last quarter, what had happened is we have very unusual rains in December to February period. So what the impact of that was diluted brine that we have both in pre-evaporation ponds, which is prior to processing, and also our final solar brine. So as we move into the second quarter, we began to produce more lithium. But because the concentration of lithium in the brine was lower than ideal, that creates a manufacturing inefficiency. You think about the energy that you have to consume, et cetera, I mean you're processing twice as much water, evaporating twice as much as water if your concentration is half of what you would ideally like it to be. So we have sort of suffered through that situation with manufacturing at below optimal conditions and brine concentration for some period of time. And we finally, got -- and what we had hope is that we would see evaporative conditions that would then improved that situation over the course of the second quarter. But the reality, as it turned out, was that during the Argentine winter, we didn't have very favorable evaporative conditions, so the brine concentrations haven't improved all that much. So rather than continue to process both brines of low concentrations, we sort of taken the difficult but necessary decisions to scale back production to give the brine time to concentrate. So then when we do produce, it will be in an optimal condition and we'll have a much better cost position for the product that we produce."

But directionally, what we believe is capital spending will be higher through the period that what we were expecting initially when we brought Vision 2015 in place for 2 reasons. One is that our business is growing faster than what we're expecting, leading most likely to higher contribution for organic growth to our target than we initially thought and the fact that we had significant capacity limitations. So yes, we should be looking at stronger capital spending. I think this year, we're contemplating $250 million of capital spending, which is higher than what has been done in the past. So it could be and we are looking to that at a different balance of cash utilization between capital spending and M&A versus where we were originally planning to spend the money.

I would say secondly from a demand standpoint, as Pierre just said, we're sold-out mode and had been for some time now. So we're very confident being the world's lowest cost producer of natural soda ash that we'd be able to place our volume at premiums around the world. I would say other thing you've got to remember is North American demand is still some 10% below its peak of 2008.

As you saw in our earnings release last night, we delivered another strong quarter, with earnings per share up 20% versus the prior year period, continuing a trajectory to deliver another record year for FMC.",1026,"Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings release last night, we delivered another strong quarter, with earnings per share up 20% versus the prior year period, continuing a trajectory to deliver another record year for FMC.
Let me walk you through the company's overall results for the quarter. We delivered adjusted earnings of $0.92 per diluted share, an increase of 20% versus the year-ago quarter. Total company sales of $905 million increased $93 million, or 11%, versus last year. The strong performance was led by continued robust performance in our Agricultural Products segment and with sales growth in all businesses. Sales grew most rapidly in Latin America, up 32%; followed by Asia, up 13%; and North America, up 9%.
Sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, decreased slightly less than 4%, reflecting principally the impact of a weaker euro. Gross margin of $341 million increased by $42 million or 14% versus last year.
Gross margin percent of 37.7% improved by 88 basis points over last year, driven by higher selling prices, higher volumes and improved mix, only partially offset by higher cost. SG&A and R&D of $148 million increased $18 million, or 14%, largely due to increased spending on targeted growth initiatives. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $127 million increased $16 million, or 15%, compared to last year.
Let's now take a more detailed look at the performance of each of our operating segments in the quarter. First, in Agricultural Products. Second quarter sales of $394 million increased 19% versus the prior year quarter, with substantial sales gain in Latin America and North America. Latin America sales growth was driven by continued strength in sugarcane, growth in soybeans and sales from a new market access joint venture in Argentina.
North America showed strong demand for proprietary herbicides and higher insecticide sales due to strong test pressure and growth in the corn segment. Asia and EMEA sales were marginally down versus the prior year period.
Segment earnings for Agricultural Products of $111 million increased 18% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by strong volume growth, partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives.  Another development of note for Agricultural Products Group in the quarter was the reapproval of bifenthrin for use in the European Union by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. Bifenthrin has long been recognized as a valuable and effective crop protection product by growers around the world. It is a unique, versatile insecticide that works quickly on a range of destructive insects. It will once again be available to growers in the EU, where it will be registered for oilseed rape, cereals, vegetables, ornamental and other uses. FMC will also continue to develop new and innovative formulations for this product, which should lead to increased sales and market shares in key EU markets. Though we are very excited about this news, due to the time line to register bifenthrin across target countries in the EU, we do not expect any sales or EBIT impact until 2014.
Moving now to Industrial Chemicals. Revenue in Industrial Chemicals increased 9% to $277 million, driven by higher selling prices across the segment, especially in soda ash and volume growth in soda ash and specialty peroxygens. Segment earnings of $43 million increased 18% as a result of the sales gains and the continued favorable mix shift in peroxygens towards specialty applications, partially offset by an anticipated production downtime in soda ash.
In soda ash, we continue to see higher overall selling prices versus the prior year. Domestic prices showed continued year-on-year improvements and, as you saw, we announced in July a $10 per ton increase in off-list soda ash prices. As is the case every year, this increase will have very low impact on 2012 results since the vast majority of domestic contracts have prices fixed for the calendar year.
These price increase announcements does, however, form the basis for 2013 contract negotiation, which typically occur in November and December. Export prices overall were also up year-over-year in the second quarter.
In Asia, soda ash prices declined sequentially in the second quarter as anticipated in the first quarter call, following the slowdown in soda ash demand growth in China that impacted export prices in Asia. Soda ash prices in Asia were, however, still up high-single-digit percent compared to the prior year period.
As sales to Asia represent less than 1/3 of our total soda ash exports, sustained price increases in Latin America and other export markets helped maintain the upward trajectory of overall soda ash export prices. Soda ash prices within China and Chinese export markets are both now at or below Chinese producers' cash cost. In the mid-term, we are confident that prices in Asia will rebound due to a combination of demand recovery and the continued cost pressures related to energy, raw materials, labor and currency appreciation. That said, we expect to see continuing pressure on Asian soda ash prices as we enter the third quarter.
In light of these changes in domestic and export pricing, we now expect our global average selling price for the year to be up in the high-single digits on a dollar-per-ton basis. Soda ash volume was also up in the quarter, but growth was limited by unplanned production downtime at our Green River site. The issues were one-off in nature and have been resolved. Overall, a very positive quarter for our soda ash business.
Moving to our Peroxygen business. Peroxygens delivered sales growth in the quarter with somewhat higher volumes, higher prices and improved mix. We continue to be pleased with the transformation of the Peroxygens business with steady growth in a targeted specialty application in the quarter.
The new Environmental Solutions business, formally launched in May, is well underway. With a focused growing team now on the ground, we're excited about the future contribution of this business to Industrial Chemicals' overall growth goals.
Let's now move to our Specialty Chemicals segment for an in-depth review of our BioPolymer and Lithium business. But for Specialty Chemicals, I'll turn the call now over to Michael Wilson. Michael?"

I'm pleased to review with you the current performance and outlook for our Specialty Chemicals Group. After updating you on our second quarter performance and near-term outlook, I will share some insights on the terrific progress we're making in the strategic evolution of our BioPolymer business. I will also address some of the mid-term issues facing our Lithium business as we continue on our path to delivering Specialty Chemicals' portion of FMC's Vision 2015 strategic plan.
First, a review of second quarter performance. Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $235 million, up 3% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by higher selling prices in all businesses and strong volume growth in specialty food ingredients. The revenue gain was partially offset by unfavorable exchange rate impacts from the weakening euro on the BioPolymer business. On a constant-currency basis, Specialty Chemicals sales were up 5% versus the prior year period.
Segment earnings of $53 million were down 6% from the prior year quarter as anticipated, with higher prices across the segment offset by higher manufacturing costs in Lithium, higher raw material costs in BioPolymer, increased investment to support growth initiatives such as the natural colors effort in BioPolymer and unfavorable exchange rate impacts.
BioPolymer delivered another solid quarter, achieving record EBIT. Sales grew in the low-single digits, driven by price increases and stronger volumes, particularly in food ingredients, which were partially offset by the impacts of a weaker euro, affecting mainly pharmaceutical ingredients.
Lithium sales growth was driven by continued price increases as the lingering impacts of the operational issues we faced in the first quarter kept volumes flat and continued to affect costs and efficiencies in the quarter. Combined with the sustained high inflation in Argentina, this led to weaker profitability in Lithium as compared to the prior year period. Sequentially, Lithium profitability improved versus the first quarter of 2012, but continues to be well below our expectations. I will address our expectations for improvement in Lithium in a few moments.
Looking ahead to the third quarter and the remainder of the year for Specialty Chemicals, we expect third quarter segment earnings to be down approximately 5%. In BioPolymer, higher selling prices and volume growth will be offset by higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives. In Lithium, poor evaporative conditions during the Argentine winter have not allowed brine concentrations to recover from the impacts of the heavy rainfall and flooding in the first quarter as we previously expected. This has limited our ability to exploit the capacity expansion brought online in the first quarter and will result in continuing capacity constraints and higher manufacturing costs through the third quarter.
For the full year, we expect revenue to be up approximately 5%, driven by higher selling prices across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer. We anticipate full year segment earnings to be flat, with sales gains offset by production constraints and continuing cost increases in Argentina and Lithium, as well as higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer.
I should note that while we expect considerable improvement in Lithium earnings in the second half of 2012, with earnings essentially doubling versus the first half, we will not see significant benefit from the recent expansion until the fourth quarter.
Let me now share with you an overview of the significant progress we are making in the strategic evolution of our BioPolymer business, particularly the area of specialty food ingredients. When we launched FMC's Vision 2015 strategic plan in 2010, we established several strategic imperatives for our BioPolymer business, including 4 specific imperatives for our food ingredients business: invest in core products to strengthen our leadership position, leverage customer relationships by broadening our texturant portfolio, increased participation in higher-growth, high-value added ingredients and expand our RDE position by investing in growth markets.
I'm pleased to report that we've made substantial progress on each of these imperatives. We have reinforced our leadership position in colloidal microcrystalline cellulose, or MCC, and alginates through a series of capacity expansions in our Cork, Ireland; Haugesund, Norway; and Newark, Delaware facilities. And last week, we announced that FMC's Board of Directors has approved a $100-million-plus investment to build a new MCC plant in Thailand to serve the rapid demand growth for this highly differentiated food ingredient in Asia.
In addition, earlier today, we announced yet another major new development: FMC's entry into the pectin market through the acquisition of Pectine Italia. We have, for many years, explored opportunities to add pectin to our portfolio of texturants as it complements our existing product line well, particularly for low-pH applications. Our technical team already regularly works with pectin in solving specific customer problems. Pectin is a sizable global market, roughly $650 million in 2012 and is growing into high-single digits annually, substantially faster than the overall food ingredients market.
We're confident we can leverage our global market knowledge and deep customer relationships to grow this business into a meaningful product line for FMC, approaching $100 million in the 5-year time horizon. While our initial entry into pectin is small, as with many of our external growth investments, Pectine Italia is rich in technology and know-how. It will provide the basis for future organic and inorganic investments as we build out this product line. Pectine Italia is also strategically located near important raw material sources. We expect to close this acquisition by the end of the third quarter, and we'll certainly share more about our plans in pectin at our December Investor Day.
We are equally as excited about our substantial progress in natural colors. Natural colors is an even faster growing market than pectin. Roughly $750 million in size today, the natural colors market is growing at least 12% per year, or 3x the rate of the overall food ingredients segment. This growth is driven predominantly by the strong consumer pull for more natural ingredients in food products, which is driving a worldwide conversion from synthetic to natural colors.
The natural colors market is currently fragmented, with only 2 truly global players and a large number of local and regional companies who lack the customer access and global reach to fully capitalize on growth opportunities. FMC first entered the natural colors market in late 2011 with the acquisition of BioColor business of South Pole BioGroup, a Chilean-based company that was an emerging technology leader in natural colors. In June of this year, we acquired Phytone, Ltd., a more established natural colors company based in the U.K., which was led by 2 technical and commercial pioneers in the natural colors industry. With both BioColor and Phytone, the previous owners have remained with FMC in advisory capacities as we build our technical depth.
We see tremendous potential for natural colors as a part of BioPolymer's food ingredients franchise. As with pectin, we plan to build this into a $100-million-plus product line for FMC over the next 5 years through a mix of continued acquisitions and focused organic investments in additional manufacturing, commercial and technical capacity.
And finally, as I hope is clear through the various actions I've highlighted thus far, through acquisitions and new plant investments, we are greatly increasing our participation in rapidly developing economies. This is a very exciting time in BioPolymer's food ingredients business, and we have great expectations for this business to continue to be a key franchise for FMC going forward.
However, I would be remiss to focus exclusively on the food ingredients portion of BioPolymer in my comments today. The FMC BioPolymer pharmaceutical ingredients business continues to be an anchor franchise for FMC as well. The MCC capacity expansions and the new Thailand plant that I mentioned earlier will also support continued growth of our pharmaceutical ingredients franchise, particularly our leading line of Avicel brand MCC tablet binders. We continue to build our RDE presence in pharmaceutical ingredients, especially in India, where we will open a new customer technical support lab later this quarter.
Turning now to FMC Lithium. We continue to have high expectations for growth and profit improvement in this business. The global market for lithium, at roughly $1 billion today, is sizable and growing rapidly. We continue to expect robust growth in global demand for lithium from roughly 100,000 tons of lithium carbonate equivalent, or LCE, in 2010 to above 260,000 tons of LCE by 2020, an overall compound annual growth rate of approximately 10%. This growth comes from a combination of sustained low-single digit growth in traditional, industrial and polymer applications, coupled with high-teens growth in demand for energy applications broadly, including electronic devices, transportation and other emerging applications. So the demand side looks very promising for lithium, both in the near and the long term.
On the supply side, we continue to believe the existing industry leaders are best positioned to supply the growing needs of the market. While there's much attention paid to early-stage development projects in lithium around the world, no new source has been successfully commercialized in over a decade as the technical and logistical challenges in exploiting lithium reserves are formidable. The existing industry leaders are situated on the best resources in the world and will continue to have a substantial cost advantage over new entrants. Further, the existing industry leaders have deep technical expertise in the extraction and purification of lithium that new entrants cannot readily develop. And while lithium pricing continues to increase, the likely cost position of many new entrants is such that even with strong price increases, they will be challenged to make a reasonable return on investment.
That said, FMC's current lithium base in Argentina does face some challenges. Putting aside the recent operational issues, which are well understood and being addressed, the biggest obstacle to continued long-term supply growth for FMC is the current political and economic situation in Argentina. While the stand-alone project economics of reinvesting at a proven, existing reserve are compelling, the current high inflation and challenging political/economic environment make it difficult to commit to a significant investment decision in Argentina at this time.
Consequently, as we shared with you in last quarter's call, we have delayed any decision on future expansion in Argentina through the end of the year as we continue to monitor the situation there. Meanwhile, we're evaluating other capacity alternatives outside of Argentina.
Let me be clear, FMC is committed to the Lithium business for the long term. We have deep technical expertise in both operations and applications and strong customer relationships that support a long-term successful position. And we have multiple options for future expansion, including in Argentina if the situation there improves. We will update you as we advance our future capacity plans, and I expect to be able to provide clear direction on our path forward in the near future. In the meantime, we will continue to work with customers to maintain our leading positions, particularly in energy applications.
So in summary, for Specialty Chemicals, I'm very pleased with our progress in driving strategic evolution of our businesses. We are greatly strengthening our BioPolymer franchise, positioning it for continued strong performance over the long term, and we will maintain our leadership position in the global lithium industry. The outlook for Specialty Chemicals Group is bright, and I'm honored to lead the talented group of FMC employees driving our efforts.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Foster, who will be happy to answer any questions during the Q&A."
28606,212273163,336734,"FMC Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2012",2012-08-01,"Earnings Calls","FMC Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll report on our free cash flow, the recent stock split and finally comment on our tax rate.First, as a reminder, free cash flow is defined as after all uses, except acquisitions, dividends and share",473,"Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll report on our free cash flow, the recent stock split and finally comment on our tax rate.
First, as a reminder, free cash flow is defined as after all uses, except acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. We are reaffirming our previous forecast of $200 million to $225 million for the year. As previously stated, the full year free cash flow guidance included -- includes forecasted capital expenditures of $250 million. Through the first 6 months of 2012, cumulative free cash flow has been $153 million, which includes capital spending of $81 million.
Clearly, the pace of capital spending in the second half of the year will be significantly in excess of the pace during the first half. This will include the first phases of the Asia MCC plant project that Michael described to you a few moments ago; completion of the Newark, Delaware MCC expansion; as well as other smaller expansion projects and maintenance projects across all of our businesses.
As I mentioned during the first quarter conference call, our Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split of our common stock at the April board meeting. The split was effected in the form of a distribution paid on May 24, 2012, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 11, 2012. Trading in the common stock on a post-split basis began on May 25, 2012. Consequently, we all need to adjust our key metrics by 2. For example, our previous full year guidance of $6.80 to $7.05 per diluted share translates to $3.40 to $3.52 per diluted share. And our shares outstanding are revised from 69 million shares to 138 million shares. And, of course, our 3-digit stock price is now on its way back to the 3-digit level.
Regarding share repurchases, our strategy of returning cash to shareholders continues to balance prudent financial policy with the competing demands of investments to support organic growth and the capital to support selected external investments. While we have $245 million of repurchase capacity remaining under our existing board authorization, we made no additional share repurchases in the second quarter as we prepare to fund heavy capital spending in the second half of this year.
Moving to taxes. Let me note that we are now forecasting a full year tax rate of 27.5%, 50 basis points higher than our previous forecast. This increase is driven by significantly higher profits in the United States, largely due to higher sales of ag products in the first half of 2012. The tax rate in the second quarter was 28%, and the tax rate for the last 2 quarters is projected to be 27.5%, which will result in a full year tax rate of 27.5%.
With that, I will now turn the call back to you, Pierre."

Well deserved, Kim.Before we get into outlook for the third quarter and the full year, I'd like to",1076,"Thank you, Kim. And I must say, we are fortunate to have one of the best CFOs in America in our ranks, as recognized yesterday by The Wall Street Journal. Well deserved, Kim.
Before we get into outlook for the third quarter and the full year, I'd like to give you a brief update on Vision 2015 progress. As we begin the second half of 2012, I am pleased to report that we continue to be well on plan toward realizing our Vision 2015 objectives.
First, relative to our key P&L objectives, 2015 sales in excess of $5 billion and EBIT of $1.2 billion. We continue to deliver results at or above the trend line required to reach these targets.
In terms of return on capital, we are delivering results on average invested capital, well above our commitment of sustained mid-teens. In fact, return on average invested capital in 2011 was 23.9%, a strong performance, well above our minimum commitment. We continue to show improved earnings stability, especially in Industrial Chemicals Group, reflecting the strength of our portfolio and impact of actions we took in 2010 and 2011 to exit the underperforming and highly volatile phosphate and sodium percarbonate business lines.
As Kim has highlighted, we remain disciplined stewards of cash with a balanced deployment among organic and external growth investments and return to cash to -- of cash to shareholders. In fact, not quite halfway through our Vision 2015 plan cycle, we have already returned or have committed to return $750 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. This is more than half of the minimum commitments of returning $1 billion of cash to shareholder that we announced at the launch of the plan. So from a cumulative perspective, we are making great progress.
Beyond the metrics, we also delivered against our overall Vision 2015 strategic imperatives in the first half of 2012. First, growing our leadership position. As Michael described, we broadened our specialty food ingredients platform with the acquisition of Phytone, Ltd. in the natural colors space and the announced signing of a definitive agreement to purchase Pectine Italia.
Increasing our reach. We continue to increase our participation in rapidly developing economies with sales in RDEs at 25% in the first half of 2012 and sales in RDEs representing nearly 47% of the total company sales for the last 12 months.
Capturing the value of common ownership. We continue to shift from a highly centralized organization to a balanced centralized/de-centralized model that better leverages our size and scale and to act as one FMC where it matters, realizing efficiencies while maintaining stronger [indiscernible] to our business units. Our global procurement team is making great progress, and we are on schedule to deliver projected cost savings.
Our operations group is also making great strides in building excellence in operations, supply chains and environments, health and safety across FMC. We are beginning several exciting initiatives on the operations area, particularly around manufacturing efficiency improvements. I will share more on this effort in the future.
Proactively managing our portfolio. Industrial Chemicals' portfolio has been a real focus. We've addressed businesses that were competitively disadvantaged and underperforming for an extended period of time. In 2010, we exited the phosphate and sulfate derivatives business. In mid-2011, we announced our exit of the sodium percarbonate business line, which was completed in early 2012. With these moves, Industrial Chemicals has been transformed into a segment with sustained higher margin, greater earnings stability and significantly higher return on assets.
Finally, disciplined cash deployment, which I updated you a few moments ago. In short, we are making exceptional progress towards delivering our Vision 2015 strategy plan, and I and the FMC management team look forward to sharing much more detail and context of our Vision 2015 progress and long-range plans at our Institutional Investors Conference to be held on December 11, 2012, in New York.
Moving on to our outlook for the full year 2012. We raised slightly the midpoint of our previous outlook for the full year 2012 and now expect adjusted earnings of $3.42 to $3.52 per diluted share, a 16% increase above last year at the midpoint of the range. Our Agricultural Products segment expects to achieve its ninth consecutive year of record earnings, with year-over-year earnings up in the high teens, reflecting increased volumes, especially in Latin America, North America and Asia, due to strong market conditions and growth from new and acquired product, but partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives.
As Michael described earlier, segment earnings in Specialty Chemicals are expected to be flat for the year. We are forecasting the eighth straight year of record earnings in BioPolymer, with higher selling price and volume growth, partially offset by the impact of higher raw materials costs, increased spending on targeted growth initiatives and unfavorable exchange rate impacts.
However, segment earnings will be dampened by weak performance from the Lithium business with the operational issues Michael highlighted, as well as continuing cost increase in Argentina offsetting higher selling prices.
And now, Industrial Chemicals segment. We expect earnings to be up in the high-teens percent due to higher volumes and selling prices in soda ash and the third consecutive year of record earnings from the Peroxygens business, reflecting the continued mix shift of that business toward specialty applications.
Now moving to our outlook for the third quarter 2012. We expect adjusted earnings of $0.70 to $0.80 per diluted share for the third quarter, a 9% increase at the midpoint of this range. In Agricultural Products, we expect third quarter segment earnings to be up approximately 10% reflecting strong growth in Latin America, especially Brazil, partially offset by continued investment in targeted growth initiative. Specialty Chemicals' third quarter segment earnings are projected to be down approximately 5%, as higher selling prices across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer are offset by higher operating costs in Lithium, as well as higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. And Industrial Chemicals, we expect third quarter segment earnings to be up in the mid-teens percent, driven by higher selling prices in soda ash and specialty peroxygen, volume growth in soda ash and the continued mix shift towards specialty peroxygens, partially offset by a planned maintenance outage in our Tonawanda, New York peroxygens facility.

As you recall from the discussion at the end of the first quarter, what had happened is we had very unusual rains, December to February period. So what the impact of that was, was it diluted brine that we have both in pre-evaporation ponds, which is prior to processing, and also our final solar brine. So as we moved into the second quarter, we began to produce more lithium. But because the concentration of lithium in the brine was lower than ideal, that creates a manufacturing inefficiency. You think about the energy that you have to consume, et cetera, I mean, you're processing twice as much water, evaporating twice as much water if your concentration is half of what you would ideally like it to be. So we have sort of suffered through that situation with manufacturing at below optimal conditions and brine concentration for some period of time. And we finally got -- and what we had hoped was that we would see evaporative conditions that would improved that situation over the course of the second quarter. But the reality, as it turned out, was that during the Argentine winter, we didn't have very favorable evaporative conditions, so the brine concentrations haven't improved all that much. So rather than continue to process those brines at low concentrations, we've sort of taken the difficult but necessary decision to scale back production to give the brines time to concentrate so then when we do produce, it will be at an optimal condition, and we'll have a much better cost position for the product that we produce."

I would say, secondly, from a demand standpoint, as Pierre just said, we're in a sold-out mode, and we have been for some time now. So we're very confident being the world's lowest-cost producer of natural soda ash that we'll be able to place our volume at premiums around the world. I would say, the other thing you've got to remember is North American demand is still some 10% below its peak of 2008. So any signs that these markets come back further from where they are today, it's going to get tighter. So we're very confident moving into the 2013 season that we have pricing leverage."

As you saw in our earnings release last night, we delivered another strong quarter, with earnings per share up 20% versus the prior year period, continuing a trajectory to deliver another record year for FMC.",1027,"Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings release last night, we delivered another strong quarter, with earnings per share up 20% versus the prior year period, continuing a trajectory to deliver another record year for FMC.
Let me walk you through the company's overall results for the quarter. We delivered adjusted earnings of $0.92 per diluted share, an increase of 20% versus the year-ago quarter. Total company sales of $905 million increased $93 million, or 11%, versus last year. The strong performance was led by continued robust performance in our Agricultural Products segment and with sales growth in all businesses. Sales grew most rapidly in Latin America, up 32%; followed by Asia, up 13%; and North America, up 9%.
Sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, decreased slightly less than 4%, reflecting principally the impact of a weaker euro. Gross margin of $341 million increased by $42 million or 14% versus last year.
Gross margin percent of 37.7% improved by 88 basis points over last year, driven by higher selling prices, higher volumes and improved mix, only partially offset by higher cost. SG&A and R&D of $148 million increased $18 million, or 14%, largely due to increased spending on targeted growth initiatives. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $127 million increased $16 million, or 15%, compared to last year.
Let's now take a more detailed look at the performance of each of our operating segments in the quarter. First, in Agricultural Products. Second quarter sales of $394 million increased 19% versus the prior year quarter, with substantial sales gain in Latin America and North America. Latin America sales growth was driven by continued strength in sugarcane, growth in soybeans and sales from a new market access joint venture in Argentina.
North America showed strong demand for proprietary herbicides and higher insecticide sales due to strong pest pressure and growth in the corn segment. Asia and EMEA sales were marginally down versus the prior year period.
Segment earnings for Agricultural Products of $111 million increased 18% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by strong volume growth, partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives.  Another development of note for our Agricultural Products Group in the quarter was the reapproval of bifenthrin for use in the European Union by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. Bifenthrin has long been recognized as a valuable and effective crop protection product by growers around the world. It is a unique, versatile insecticide that works quickly on a range of destructive insects. It will once again be available to growers in the EU, where it will be registered for oilseed rape, cereals, vegetables, ornamental and other uses. FMC will also continue to develop new and innovative formulations for this product, which should lead to increased sales and market shares in key EU markets. Though we are very excited about this news, due to the time line to register bifenthrin across target countries in the EU, we do not expect any sales or EBIT impact until 2014.
Moving now to Industrial Chemicals. Revenue in Industrial Chemicals increased 9% to $277 million, driven by higher selling prices across the segment, especially in soda ash and volume growth in soda ash and specialty peroxygens. Segment earnings of $43 million increased 18% as a result of the sales gains and the continued favorable mix shift in peroxygens towards specialty applications, partially offset by an anticipated production downtime in soda ash.
In soda ash, we continue to see higher overall selling prices versus the prior year. Domestic prices showed continued year-on-year improvements and, as you saw, we announced in July a $10 per ton increase in off-list soda ash prices. As is the case every year, this increase will have very low impact on 2012 results since the vast majority of domestic contracts have prices fixed for the calendar year.
These price increase announcements does, however, form the basis for 2013 contract negotiation, which typically occur in November and December. Export prices overall were also up year-over-year in the second quarter.
In Asia, soda ash prices declined sequentially in the second quarter as anticipated in the first quarter call, following the slowdown in soda ash demand growth in China that impacted export prices in Asia. Soda ash prices in Asia were, however, still up high-single-digit percent compared to the prior year period.
As sales to Asia represent less than 1/3 of our total soda ash exports, sustained price increases in Latin America and other export markets helped maintain the upward trajectory of overall soda ash export prices. Soda ash prices within China and Chinese export markets are both now at or below Chinese producers' cash cost. In the mid-term, we are confident that prices in Asia will rebound due to a combination of demand recovery and the continued cost pressures related to energy, raw materials, labor and currency appreciation. That said, we expect to see continuing pressure on Asian soda ash prices as we enter the third quarter.
In light of these changes in domestic and export pricing, we now expect our global average selling price for the year to be up in the high-single digits on a dollar-per-ton basis. Soda ash volume was also up in the quarter, but growth was limited by unplanned production downtime at our Green River site. The issues were one-off in nature and have been resolved. Overall, a very positive quarter for our soda ash business.
Moving to our Peroxygen business. Peroxygens delivered sales growth in the quarter with somewhat higher volumes, higher prices and improved mix. We continue to be pleased with the transformation of the Peroxygens business with steady growth in a targeted specialty application in the quarter.
The new Environmental Solutions business, formally launched in May, is well underway. With a focused growing team now on the ground, we're excited about the future contribution of this business to Industrial Chemicals' overall growth goals.
Let's now move to our Specialty Chemicals segment for an in-depth review of our BioPolymer and Lithium business. But for Specialty Chemicals, I'll turn the call now over to Michael Wilson. Michael?"

I'm pleased to review with you the current performance and outlook for our Specialty Chemicals Group. After updating you on our second quarter performance and near-term outlook, I will share some insights on the terrific progress we're making in the strategic evolution of our BioPolymer business. I will also address some of the mid-term issues facing our Lithium business as we continue on our path to delivering Specialty Chemicals' portion of FMC's Vision 2015 strategic plan.
First, a review of second quarter performance. Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $235 million, up 3% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by higher selling prices in all businesses and strong volume growth in specialty food ingredients. The revenue gain was partially offset by unfavorable exchange rate impacts from the weakening euro on the BioPolymer business. On a constant-currency basis, Specialty Chemicals sales were up 5% versus the prior year period.
Segment earnings of $53 million were down 6% from the prior year quarter as anticipated, with higher prices across the segment offset by higher manufacturing costs in Lithium, higher raw material costs in BioPolymer, increased investment to support growth initiatives such as the natural colors effort in BioPolymer and unfavorable exchange rate impacts.
BioPolymer delivered another solid quarter, achieving record EBIT. Sales grew in the low-single digits, driven by price increases and stronger volumes, particularly in food ingredients, which were partially offset by the impacts of a weaker euro, affecting mainly pharmaceutical ingredients.
Lithium sales growth was driven by continued price increases as the lingering impacts of the operational issues we faced in the first quarter kept volumes flat and continued to affect costs and efficiencies in the quarter. Combined with the sustained high inflation in Argentina, this led to weaker profitability in Lithium as compared to the prior year period. Sequentially, Lithium profitability improved versus the first quarter of 2012, but continues to be well below our expectations. I will address our expectations for improvement in Lithium in a few moments.
Looking ahead to the third quarter and the remainder of the year for Specialty Chemicals, we expect third quarter segment earnings to be down approximately 5%. In BioPolymer, higher selling prices and volume growth will be offset by higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives. In Lithium, poor evaporative conditions during the Argentine winter have not allowed brine concentrations to recover from the impacts of the heavy rainfall and flooding in the first quarter as we previously expected. This has limited our ability to exploit the capacity expansion brought online in the first quarter and will result in continuing capacity constraints and higher manufacturing costs through the third quarter.
For the full year, we expect revenue to be up approximately 5%, driven by higher selling prices across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer. We anticipate full year segment earnings to be flat, with sales gains offset by production constraints and continuing cost increases in Argentina and Lithium, as well as higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer.
I should note that while we expect considerable improvement in Lithium earnings in the second half of 2012, with earnings essentially doubling versus the first half, we will not see significant benefit from the recent expansion until the fourth quarter.
Let me now share with you an overview of the significant progress we are making in the strategic evolution of our BioPolymer business, particularly in the area of specialty food ingredients. When we launched FMC's Vision 2015 strategic plan in 2010, we established several strategic imperatives for our BioPolymer business, including 4 specific imperatives for our food ingredients business: invest in core products to strengthen our leadership position, leverage customer relationships by broadening our texturant portfolio, increased participation in higher-growth, high-value added ingredients and expand our RDE position by investing in growth markets.
I'm pleased to report that we've made substantial progress on each of these imperatives. We have reinforced our leadership position in colloidal microcrystalline cellulose, or MCC, and alginates through a series of capacity expansions in our Cork, Ireland; Haugesund, Norway; and Newark, Delaware facilities. And last week, we announced that FMC's Board of Directors has approved a $100-million-plus investment to build a new MCC plant in Thailand to serve the rapid demand growth for this highly differentiated food ingredient in Asia.
In addition, earlier today, we announced yet another major new development: FMC's entry into the pectin market through the acquisition of Pectine Italia. We have, for many years, explored opportunities to add pectin to our portfolio of texturants as it complements our existing product line well, particularly for low-pH applications. Our technical team already regularly works with pectin in solving specific customer problems. Pectin is a sizable global market, roughly $650 million in 2012 and is growing into high-single digits annually, substantially faster than the overall food ingredients market.
We're confident we can leverage our global market knowledge and deep customer relationships to grow this business into a meaningful product line for FMC, approaching $100 million in the 5-year time horizon. While our initial entry into pectin is small, as with many of our external growth investments, Pectine Italia is rich in technology and know-how. It will provide the basis for future organic and inorganic investments as we build out this product line. Pectine Italia is also strategically located near important raw material sources. We expect to close this acquisition by the end of the third quarter, and we'll certainly share more about our plans in pectin at our December Investor Day.
We are equally as excited about our substantial progress in natural colors. Natural colors is an even faster growing market than pectin. Roughly $750 million in size today, the natural colors market is growing at least 12% per year, or 3x the rate of the overall food ingredients segment. This growth is driven predominantly by the strong consumer pull for more natural ingredients in food products, which is driving a worldwide conversion from synthetic to natural colors.
The natural colors market is currently fragmented, with only 2 truly global players and a large number of local and regional companies who lack the customer access and global reach to fully capitalize on growth opportunities. FMC first entered the natural colors market in late 2011 with the acquisition of BioColor business of South Pole BioGroup, a Chilean-based company that was an emerging technology leader in natural colors. In June of this year, we acquired Phytone, Ltd., a more established natural colors company based in the U.K., which was led by 2 technical and commercial pioneers in the natural colors industry. With both BioColor and Phytone, the previous owners have remained with FMC in advisory capacities as we build our technical depth.
We see tremendous potential for natural colors as a part of BioPolymer's food ingredients franchise. As with pectin, we plan to build this into a $100-million-plus product line for FMC over the next 5 years through a mix of continued acquisitions and focused organic investments in additional manufacturing, commercial and technical capacity.
And finally, as I hope is clear through the various actions I've highlighted thus far, through acquisitions and new plant investments, we are greatly increasing our participation in rapidly developing economies. This is a very exciting time in BioPolymer's food ingredients business, and we have great expectations for this business to continue to be a key franchise for FMC going forward.
However, I would be remiss to focus exclusively on the food ingredients portion of BioPolymer in my comments today. The FMC BioPolymer pharmaceutical ingredients business continues to be an anchor franchise for FMC as well. The MCC capacity expansions and the new Thailand plant that I mentioned earlier will also support continued growth of our pharmaceutical ingredients franchise, particularly our leading line of Avicel brand MCC tablet binders. We continue to build our RDE presence in pharmaceutical ingredients, especially in India, where we will open a new customer technical support lab later this quarter.
Turning now to FMC Lithium. We continue to have high expectations for growth and profit improvement in this business. The global market for lithium, at roughly $1 billion today, is sizable and growing rapidly. We continue to expect robust growth in global demand for lithium from roughly 100,000 tons of lithium carbonate equivalent, or LCE, in 2010 to above 260,000 tons of LCE by 2020, an overall compound annual growth rate of approximately 10%. This growth comes from a combination of sustained low-single digit growth in traditional, industrial and polymer applications, coupled with high-teens growth in demand for energy applications broadly, including electronic devices, transportation and other emerging applications. So the demand side looks very promising for lithium, both in the near and the long term.
On the supply side, we continue to believe the existing industry leaders are best positioned to supply the growing needs of the market. While there's much attention paid to early-stage development projects in lithium around the world, no new source has been successfully commercialized in over a decade as the technical and logistical challenges in exploiting lithium reserves are formidable. The existing industry leaders are situated on the best resources in the world and will continue to have a substantial cost advantage over new entrants. Further, the existing industry leaders have deep technical expertise in the extraction and purification of lithium that new entrants cannot readily develop. And while lithium pricing continues to increase, the likely cost position of many new entrants is such that even with strong price increases, they will be challenged to make a reasonable return on investment.
That said, FMC's current lithium base in Argentina does face some challenges. Putting aside the recent operational issues, which are well understood and being addressed, the biggest obstacle to continued long-term supply growth for FMC is the current political and economic situation in Argentina. While the stand-alone project economics of reinvesting at a proven, existing reserve are compelling, the current high inflation and challenging political/economic environment make it difficult to commit to a significant investment decision in Argentina at this time.
Consequently, as we shared with you in last quarter's call, we have delayed any decision on future expansion in Argentina through the end of the year as we continue to monitor the situation there. Meanwhile, we're evaluating other capacity alternatives outside of Argentina.
Let me be clear, FMC is committed to the Lithium business for the long term. We have deep technical expertise in both operations and applications and strong customer relationships that support a long-term successful position. And we have multiple options for future expansion, including in Argentina if the situation there improves. We will update you as we advance our future capacity plans, and I expect to be able to provide clear direction on our path forward in the near future. In the meantime, we will continue to work with customers to maintain our leading positions, particularly in energy applications.
So in summary, for Specialty Chemicals, I'm very pleased with our progress in driving strategic evolution of our businesses. We are greatly strengthening our BioPolymer franchise, positioning it for continued strong performance over the long term, and we will maintain our leadership position in the global lithium industry. The outlook for Specialty Chemicals Group is bright, and I'm honored to lead the talented group of FMC employees driving our efforts.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Foster, who will be happy to answer any questions during the Q&A."
28606,212273163,337207,"FMC Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2012",2012-08-01,"Earnings Calls","FMC Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll report on our free cash flow, the recent stock split and finally comment on our tax rate.First, as a reminder, free cash flow is defined as after all uses, except acquisitions, dividends and share",473,"Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll report on our free cash flow, the recent stock split and finally comment on our tax rate.
First, as a reminder, free cash flow is defined as after all uses, except acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. We are reaffirming our previous forecast of $200 million to $225 million for the year. As previously stated, the full year free cash flow guidance included -- includes forecasted capital expenditures of $250 million. Through the first 6 months of 2012, cumulative free cash flow has been $153 million, which includes capital spending of $81 million.
Clearly, the pace of capital spending in the second half of the year will be significantly in excess of the pace during the first half. This will include the first phases of the Asia MCC plant project that Michael described to you a few moments ago; completion of the Newark, Delaware MCC expansion; as well as other smaller expansion projects and maintenance projects across all of our businesses.
As I mentioned during the first quarter conference call, our Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split of our common stock at the April board meeting. The split was effected in the form of a distribution paid on May 24, 2012, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 11, 2012. Trading in the common stock on a post-split basis began on May 25, 2012. Consequently, we all need to adjust our key metrics by 2. For example, our previous full year guidance of $6.80 to $7.05 per diluted share translates to $3.40 to $3.52 per diluted share. And our shares outstanding are revised from 69 million shares to 138 million shares. And, of course, our 3-digit stock price is now on its way back to the 3-digit level.
Regarding share repurchases, our strategy of returning cash to shareholders continues to balance prudent financial policy with the competing demands of investments to support organic growth and the capital to support selected external investments. While we have $245 million of repurchase capacity remaining under our existing board authorization, we made no additional share repurchases in the second quarter as we prepare to fund heavy capital spending in the second half of this year.
Moving to taxes. Let me note that we are now forecasting a full year tax rate of 27.5%, 50 basis points higher than our previous forecast. This increase is driven by significantly higher profits in the United States, largely due to higher sales of ag products in the first half of 2012. The tax rate in the second quarter was 28%, and the tax rate for the last 2 quarters is projected to be 27.5%, which will result in a full year tax rate of 27.5%.
With that, I will now turn the call back to you, Pierre."

And I must say, we are fortunate to have one of the best CFOs in America in our ranks, as recognized yesterday by The Wall Street Journal. Well deserved, Kim.Before we get into outlook for the third quarter and the full year, I'd like to",1078,"Thank you, Kim. And I must say, we are fortunate to have one of the best CFOs in America in our ranks, as recognized yesterday by The Wall Street Journal. Well deserved, Kim.
Before we get into outlook for the third quarter and the full year, I'd like to give you a brief update on Vision 2015 progress. As we begin the second half of 2012, I am pleased to report that we continue to be well on plan toward realizing our Vision 2015 objectives.
First, relative to our key P&L objectives, 2015 sales in excess of $5 billion and EBIT of $1.2 billion. We continue to deliver results at or above the trend line required to reach these targets.
In terms of return on capital, we are delivering results on average invested capital well above our commitment of sustained mid-teens. In fact, return on average invested capital in 2011 was 23.9%, a strong performance, well above our minimum commitment. We continue to show improved earnings stability, especially in our Industrial Chemicals Group, reflecting the strength of our portfolio and impact of actions we took in 2010 and 2011 to exit the underperforming and highly volatile phosphate and sodium percarbonate business lines.
As Kim has highlighted, we remain disciplined stewards of cash with a balanced deployment among organic and external growth investments and return to cash to -- of cash to shareholders. In fact, not quite halfway through our Vision 2015 plan cycle, we have already returned or have committed to return $750 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. This is more than half of the minimum commitments of returning $1 billion of cash to shareholder that we announced at the launch of the plan. So from a cumulative perspective, we are making great progress.
Beyond the metrics, we also delivered against our overall Vision 2015 strategic imperatives in the first half of 2012. First, growing our leadership position. As Michael described, we broadened our specialty food ingredients platform with the acquisition of Phytone, Ltd. in the natural colors space and the announced signing of a definitive agreement to purchase Pectine Italia.
Increasing our reach. We continue to increase our participation in rapidly developing economies with sales in RDEs at 25% in the first half of 2012 and sales in RDEs representing nearly 47% of the total company sales for the last 12 months.
Capturing the value of common ownership. We continue to shift from a highly centralized organization to a balanced centralized/decentralized model that better leverages our size and scale and to act as one FMC where it matters, realizing efficiencies while maintaining stronger contact with our business units. Our global procurement team is making great progress, and we're on schedule to deliver projected cost savings.
Our operations group is also making great strides in building excellence in operations, supply chains and environments, health and safety across FMC. We are beginning several exciting initiatives on the operations area, particularly around manufacturing efficiency improvements. I will share more on this effort in the future.
Proactively managing our portfolio. Industrial Chemicals' portfolio has been an area of focus. We've addressed businesses that were competitively disadvantaged and underperforming for an extended period of time. In 2010, we exited the phosphate and sulfate derivatives business. In mid-2011, we announced our exit of the sodium percarbonate business line, which was completed in early 2012. With these moves, Industrial Chemicals has been transformed into a segment with sustained higher margin, greater earnings stability and significantly higher return on assets.
Finally, disciplined cash deployment, which I updated you on a few moments ago. In short, we are making exceptional progress towards delivering our Vision 2015 strategy plan, and I and the FMC management team look forward to sharing much more detail and context of our Vision 2015 progress and long-range plans at our Institutional Investors Conference to be held on December 11, 2012, in New York.
Moving on to our outlook for the full year 2012. We raised slightly the midpoint of our previous outlook for the full year 2012 and now expect adjusted earnings of $3.42 to $3.52 per diluted share, a 16% increase above last year at the midpoint of the range. Our Agricultural Products segment expects to achieve its ninth consecutive year of record earnings, with year-over-year earnings up in the high teens, reflecting increased volumes, especially in Latin America, North America and Asia, due to strong market conditions and growth from new and acquired product, but partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives.
As Michael described earlier, segment earnings in Specialty Chemicals are expected to be flat for the year. We are forecasting the eighth straight year of record earnings in BioPolymer, with higher selling price and volume growth, partially offset by the impact of higher raw materials costs, increased spending on targeted growth initiatives and unfavorable exchange rate impact.
However, segment earnings will be dampened by weak performance from the Lithium business with the operational issues Michael highlighted, as well as continuing cost increase in Argentina offsetting higher selling prices.
And now, Industrial Chemicals segment. We expect earnings to be up in the high-teens percent due to higher volumes and selling prices in soda ash and the third consecutive year of record earnings from the Peroxygens business, reflecting the continued mix shift of that business toward specialty applications.
Now moving to our outlook for the third quarter 2012. We expect adjusted earnings of $0.70 to $0.80 per diluted share for the third quarter, a 9% increase at the midpoint of this range. In Agricultural Products, we expect third quarter segment earnings to be up approximately 10% reflecting strong growth in Latin America, especially Brazil, partially offset by continued investment in targeted growth initiative. Specialty Chemicals' third quarter segment earnings are projected to be down approximately 5%, as higher selling prices across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer are offset by higher operating cost in Lithium, as well as higher raw material cost and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. And Industrial Chemicals, we expect third quarter segment earnings to be up in the mid-teens percent, driven by higher selling prices in soda ash and specialty peroxygen, volume growth in soda ash and the continued mix shift towards specialty peroxygens, partially offset by a planned maintenance outage in our Tonawanda, New York peroxygens facility.

So we can keep on looking at the same time of performance year-after-year we've been having in BioPolymer. Now the big upside for us is obviously Lithium. We do expect to have turned around the performance of the Lithium business during the fourth quarter and not only benefit from better operation, replenished inventory, but also benefit from the capacity expansion. So there should be a significant driving performance going forward, but not in the BioPolymer, which has been stable growth, but by the turnaround of the Lithium business."

As you recall from the discussion at the end of the first quarter, what had happened is we had very unusual rains in the December through February period.

As you recall from the discussion at the end of the first quarter, what had happened is we had very unusual rains in the December through February period. So what the impact of that was, was it diluted brine that we have both in pre-evaporation ponds, which is prior to processing, and also our final solar brine. So as we moved into the second quarter, we began to produce more lithium. But because the concentration of lithium in the brine was lower than ideal, that creates a manufacturing inefficiency. You think about the energy that you have to consume, et cetera, I mean, you're processing twice as much water, evaporating twice as much water if your concentration is half of what you would ideally like it to be. So we have sort of suffered through that situation with manufacturing at below optimal conditions and brine concentration for some period of time. And we finally got -- and what we had hoped was that we would see evaporative conditions that would improved that situation over the course of the second quarter. But the reality, as it turned out, was that during the Argentine winter, we didn't have very favorable evaporative conditions, so the brine concentrations haven't improved all that much. So rather than continue to process those brines at low concentrations, we've sort of taken the difficult but necessary decision to scale back production to give the brines time to concentrate so then when we do produce, it will be at an optimal condition, and we'll have a much better cost position for the product that we produce."

So the fact that we've only made one announcement at this point, I wouldn't read anything into that at this time. I would say, secondly, from a demand standpoint, as Pierre just said, we're in sold-out mode, and we have been for some time now. So we're very confident being the world's lowest-cost producer of natural soda ash that we'll be able to place our volume at premiums around the world. I would say, the other thing you've got to remember is North American demand is still some 10% below its peak of 2008. So any signs that these markets come back further from where they are today, it's going to get tighter. So we're very confident moving into the 2013 season that we have pricing leverage."

On the working capital inventory, if you sort of look at the inventory turns, working capital as a percentage of sales, both of those metrics have gotten worse year-over-year. I would assume that working capital would get better, as well as inventory, as raw material pricing declines, but you're not as exposed to raw materials as some of the other chemical companies. So sort of what's behind the inventory and working capital inflation we've seen? And do you have any plans? I mean, is this a concern at all? Or is it a part of the strategy?

As you saw in our earnings release last night, we delivered another strong quarter, with earnings per share up 20% versus the prior year period, continuing a trajectory to deliver another record year for FMC.",1027,"Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings release last night, we delivered another strong quarter, with earnings per share up 20% versus the prior year period, continuing a trajectory to deliver another record year for FMC.
Let me walk you through the company's overall results for the quarter. We delivered adjusted earnings of $0.92 per diluted share, an increase of 20% versus the year-ago quarter. Total company sales of $905 million increased $93 million, or 11%, versus last year. The strong performance was led by continued robust performance in our Agricultural Products segment and with sales growth in all businesses. Sales grew most rapidly in Latin America, up 32%; followed by Asia, up 13%; and North America, up 9%.
Sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, decreased slightly less than 4%, reflecting principally the impact of a weaker euro. Gross margin of $341 million increased by $42 million or 14% versus last year.
Gross margin percent of 37.7% improved by 88 basis points over last year, driven by higher selling prices, higher volumes and improved mix, only partially offset by higher cost. SG&A and R&D of $148 million increased $18 million, or 14%, largely due to increased spending on targeted growth initiatives. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $127 million increased $16 million, or 15%, compared to last year.
Let's now take a more detailed look at the performance of each of our operating segments in the quarter. First, in Agricultural Products. Second quarter sales of $394 million increased 19% versus the prior year quarter, with substantial sales gain in Latin America and North America. Latin America sales growth was driven by continued strength in sugarcane, growth in soybeans and sales from a new market access joint venture in Argentina.
North America showed strong demand for proprietary herbicides and higher insecticide sales due to strong pest pressure and growth in the corn segment. Asia and EMEA sales were marginally down versus the prior year period.
Segment earnings for Agricultural Products of $111 million increased 18% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by strong volume growth, partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives. Another development of note for our Agricultural Products Group in the quarter was the reapproval of bifenthrin for use in the European Union by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. Bifenthrin has long been recognized as a valuable and effective crop protection product by growers around the world. It is a unique, versatile insecticide that works quickly on a range of destructive insects. It will once again be available to growers in the EU, where it will be registered for oilseed rape, cereals, vegetables, ornamental and other uses. FMC will also continue to develop new and innovative formulations for this product, which should lead to increased sales and market shares in key EU markets. Though we are very excited about this news, due to the time line to register bifenthrin across target countries in the EU, we do not expect any sales or EBIT impact until 2014.
Moving now to Industrial Chemicals. Revenue in Industrial Chemicals increased 9% to $277 million, driven by higher selling prices across the segment, especially in soda ash and volume growth in soda ash and specialty peroxygens. Segment earnings of $43 million increased 18% as a result of the sales gains and the continued favorable mix shift in peroxygens towards specialty applications, partially offset by an anticipated production downtime in soda ash.
In soda ash, we continue to see higher overall selling prices versus the prior year. Domestic prices showed continued year-on-year improvements and, as you saw, we announced in July a $10 per ton increase in off-list soda ash prices. As is the case every year, this increase will have very low impact on 2012 results since the vast majority of domestic contracts have prices fixed for the calendar year.
These price increase announcements does, however, form the basis for 2013 contract negotiation, which typically occur in November and December. Export prices overall were also up year-over-year in the second quarter.
In Asia, soda ash prices declined sequentially in the second quarter as anticipated in the first quarter call, following the slowdown in soda ash demand growth in China that impacted export prices in Asia. Soda ash prices in Asia were, however, still up high-single-digit percent compared to the prior year period.
As sales to Asia represent less than 1/3 of our total soda ash exports, sustained price increases in Latin America and other export markets helped maintain the upward trajectory of overall soda ash export prices. Soda ash prices within China and Chinese export markets are both now at or below Chinese producers' cash cost. In the mid-term, we are confident that prices in Asia will rebound due to a combination of demand recovery and the continued cost pressures related to energy, raw materials, labor and currency appreciation. That said, we expect to see continuing pressure on Asian soda ash prices as we enter the third quarter.
In light of these changes in domestic and export pricing, we now expect our global average selling price for the year to be up in the high-single digits on a dollar-per-ton basis. Soda ash volume was also up in the quarter, but growth was limited by unplanned production downtime at our Green River site. The issues were one-off in nature and have been resolved. Overall, a very positive quarter for our soda ash business.
Moving to our Peroxygen business. Peroxygens delivered sales growth in the quarter with somewhat higher volumes, higher prices and improved mix. We continue to be pleased with the transformation of the Peroxygens business with steady growth in a targeted specialty application in the quarter.
The new Environmental Solutions business, formally launched in May, is well underway. With a focused growing team now on the ground, we're excited about the future contribution of this business to Industrial Chemicals' overall growth goals.
Let's now move to our Specialty Chemicals segment for an in-depth review of our BioPolymer and Lithium business. But for Specialty Chemicals, I'll turn the call now over to Michael Wilson. Michael?"

I'm pleased to review with you the current performance and outlook for our Specialty Chemicals Group. After updating you on our second quarter performance and near-term outlook, I will share some insights on the terrific progress we're making in the strategic evolution of our BioPolymer business. I will also address some of the mid-term issues facing our Lithium business as we continue on our path to delivering Specialty Chemicals' portion of FMC's Vision 2015 strategic plan.
First, a review of second quarter performance. Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $235 million, up 3% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by higher selling prices in all businesses and strong volume growth in specialty food ingredients. The revenue gain was partially offset by unfavorable exchange rate impacts from the weakening euro on the BioPolymer business. On a constant-currency basis, Specialty Chemicals sales were up 5% versus the prior year period.
Segment earnings of $53 million were down 6% from the prior year quarter as anticipated, with higher prices across the segment offset by higher manufacturing costs in Lithium, higher raw material costs in BioPolymer, increased investment to support growth initiatives such as the natural colors effort in BioPolymer and unfavorable exchange rate impacts.
BioPolymer delivered another solid quarter, achieving record EBIT. Sales grew in the low-single digits, driven by price increases and stronger volumes, particularly in food ingredients, which were partially offset by the impacts of a weaker euro, affecting mainly pharmaceutical ingredients.
Lithium sales growth was driven by continued price increases as the lingering impacts of the operational issues we faced in the first quarter kept volumes flat and continued to affect costs and efficiencies in the quarter. Combined with the sustained high inflation in Argentina, this led to weaker profitability in Lithium as compared to the prior year period. Sequentially, Lithium profitability improved versus the first quarter of 2012, but continues to be well below our expectations. I will address our expectations for improvement in Lithium in a few moments.
Looking ahead to the third quarter and the remainder of the year for Specialty Chemicals, we expect third quarter segment earnings to be down approximately 5%. In BioPolymer, higher selling prices and volume growth will be offset by higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives. In Lithium, poor evaporative conditions during the Argentine winter have not allowed brine concentrations to recover from the impacts of the heavy rainfall and flooding in the first quarter as we previously expected. This has limited our ability to exploit the capacity expansion brought online in the first quarter and will result in continuing capacity constraints and higher manufacturing costs through the third quarter.
For the full year, we expect revenue to be up approximately 5%, driven by higher selling prices across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer. We anticipate full year segment earnings to be flat, with sales gains offset by production constraints and continuing cost increases in Argentina and Lithium, as well as higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer.
I should note that while we expect considerable improvement in Lithium earnings in the second half of 2012, with earnings essentially doubling versus the first half, we will not see significant benefit from the recent expansion until the fourth quarter.
Let me now share with you an overview of the significant progress we are making in the strategic evolution of our BioPolymer business, particularly in the area of specialty food ingredients. When we launched FMC's Vision 2015 strategic plan in 2010, we established several strategic imperatives for our BioPolymer business, including 4 specific imperatives for our food ingredients business: invest in core products to strengthen our leadership position, leverage customer relationships by broadening our texturant portfolio, increased participation in higher-growth, high-value added ingredients and expand our RDE position by investing in growth markets.
I'm pleased to report that we've made substantial progress on each of these imperatives. We have reinforced our leadership position in colloidal microcrystalline cellulose, or MCC, and alginates through a series of capacity expansions in our Cork, Ireland; Haugesund, Norway; and Newark, Delaware facilities. And last week, we announced that FMC's Board of Directors has approved a $100-million-plus investment to build a new MCC plant in Thailand to serve the rapid demand growth for this highly differentiated food ingredient in Asia.
In addition, earlier today, we announced yet another major new development: FMC's entry into the pectin market through the acquisition of Pectine Italia. We have, for many years, explored opportunities to add pectin to our portfolio of texturants as it complements our existing product line well, particularly for low-pH applications. Our technical team already regularly works with pectin in solving specific customer problems. Pectin is a sizable global market, roughly $650 million in 2012 and is growing into high-single digits annually, substantially faster than the overall food ingredients market.
We're confident we can leverage our global market knowledge and deep customer relationships to grow this business into a meaningful product line for FMC, approaching $100 million in the 5-year time horizon. While our initial entry into pectin is small, as with many of our external growth investments, Pectine Italia is rich in technology and know-how. It will provide the basis for future organic and inorganic investments as we build out this product line. Pectine Italia is also strategically located near important raw material sources. We expect to close this acquisition by the end of the third quarter, and we'll certainly share more about our plans in pectin at our December Investor Day.
We are equally as excited about our substantial progress in natural colors. Natural colors is an even faster growing market than pectin. Roughly $750 million in size today, the natural colors market is growing at least 12% per year, or 3x the rate of the overall food ingredients segment. This growth is driven predominantly by the strong consumer pull for more natural ingredients in food products, which is driving a worldwide conversion from synthetic to natural colors.
The natural colors market is currently fragmented, with only 2 truly global players and a large number of local and regional companies who lack the customer access and global reach to fully capitalize on growth opportunities. FMC first entered the natural colors market in late 2011 with the acquisition of BioColor business of South Pole BioGroup, a Chilean-based company that was an emerging technology leader in natural colors. In June of this year, we acquired Phytone, Ltd., a more established natural colors company based in the U.K., which was led by 2 technical and commercial pioneers in the natural colors industry. With both BioColor and Phytone, the previous owners have remained with FMC in advisory capacities as we build our technical depth.
We see tremendous potential for natural colors as a part of BioPolymer's food ingredients franchise. As with pectin, we plan to build this into a $100-million-plus product line for FMC over the next 5 years through a mix of continued acquisitions and focused organic investments in additional manufacturing, commercial and technical capacity.
And finally, as I hope is clear through the various actions I've highlighted thus far, through acquisitions and new plant investments, we are greatly increasing our participation in rapidly developing economies. This is a very exciting time in BioPolymer's food ingredients business, and we have great expectations for this business to continue to be a key franchise for FMC going forward.
However, I would be remiss to focus exclusively on the food ingredients portion of BioPolymer in my comments today. The FMC BioPolymer pharmaceutical ingredients business continues to be an anchor franchise for FMC as well. The MCC capacity expansions and the new Thailand plant that I mentioned earlier will also support continued growth of our pharmaceutical ingredients franchise, particularly our leading line of Avicel brand MCC tablet binders. We continue to build our RDE presence in pharmaceutical ingredients, especially in India, where we will open a new customer technical support lab later this quarter.
Turning now to FMC Lithium. We continue to have high expectations for growth and profit improvement in this business. The global market for lithium, at roughly $1 billion today, is sizable and growing rapidly. We continue to expect robust growth in global demand for lithium from roughly 100,000 tons of lithium carbonate equivalent, or LCE, in 2010 to above 260,000 tons of LCE by 2020, an overall compound annual growth rate of approximately 10%. This growth comes from a combination of sustained low-single digit growth in traditional, industrial and polymer applications, coupled with high-teens growth in demand for energy applications broadly, including electronic devices, transportation and other emerging applications. So the demand side looks very promising for lithium, both in the near and the long term.
On the supply side, we continue to believe the existing industry leaders are best positioned to supply the growing needs of the market. While there's much attention paid to early-stage development projects in lithium around the world, no new source has been successfully commercialized in over a decade as the technical and logistical challenges in exploiting lithium reserves are formidable. The existing industry leaders are situated on the best resources in the world and will continue to have a substantial cost advantage over new entrants. Further, the existing industry leaders have deep technical expertise in the extraction and purification of lithium that new entrants cannot readily develop. And while lithium pricing continues to increase, the likely cost position of many new entrants is such that even with strong price increases, they will be challenged to make a reasonable return on investment.
That said, FMC's current lithium base in Argentina does face some challenges. Putting aside the recent operational issues, which are well understood and being addressed, the biggest obstacle to continued long-term supply growth for FMC is the current political and economic situation in Argentina. While the stand-alone project economics of reinvesting at a proven, existing reserve are compelling, the current high inflation and challenging political/economic environment make it difficult to commit to a significant investment decision in Argentina at this time.
Consequently, as we shared with you in last quarter's call, we have delayed any decision on future expansion in Argentina through the end of the year as we continue to monitor the situation there. Meanwhile, we're evaluating other capacity alternatives outside of Argentina.
Let me be clear, FMC is committed to the Lithium business for the long term. We have deep technical expertise in both operations and applications and strong customer relationships that support a long-term successful position. And we have multiple options for future expansion, including in Argentina if the situation there improves. We will update you as we advance our future capacity plans, and I expect to be able to provide clear direction on our path forward in the near future. In the meantime, we will continue to work with customers to maintain our leading positions, particularly in energy applications.
So in summary, for Specialty Chemicals, I'm very pleased with our progress in driving strategic evolution of our businesses. We are greatly strengthening our BioPolymer franchise, positioning it for continued strong performance over the long term, and we will maintain our leadership position in the global lithium industry. The outlook for Specialty Chemicals Group is bright, and I'm honored to lead the talented group of FMC employees driving our efforts.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Foster, who will be happy to answer any questions during the Q&A."
28606,212273163,338855,"FMC Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2012",2012-08-01,"Earnings Calls","FMC Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll report on our free cash flow, the recent stock split and finally comment on our tax rate.First, as a reminder, free cash flow is defined as after all uses, except acquisitions, dividends and share",473,"Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll report on our free cash flow, the recent stock split and finally comment on our tax rate.
First, as a reminder, free cash flow is defined as after all uses, except acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. We are reaffirming our previous forecast of $200 million to $225 million for the year. As previously stated, the full year free cash flow guidance included -- includes forecasted capital expenditures of $250 million. Through the first 6 months of 2012, cumulative free cash flow has been $153 million, which includes capital spending of $81 million.
Clearly, the pace of capital spending in the second half of the year will be significantly in excess of the pace during the first half. This will include the first phases of the Asia MCC plant project that Michael described to you a few moments ago; completion of the Newark, Delaware MCC expansion; as well as other smaller expansion projects and maintenance projects across all of our businesses.
As I mentioned during the first quarter conference call, our Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split of our common stock at the April board meeting. The split was affected in the form of a distribution paid on May 24, 2012, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 11, 2012. Trading in the common stock on a post-split basis began on May 25, 2012. Consequently, we all need to adjust our key metrics by 2. For example, our previous full year guidance of $6.80 to $7.05 per diluted share translates to $3.40 to $3.52 per diluted share. And our shares outstanding are revised from 69 million shares to 138 million shares. And, of course, our 3-digit stock price is now on its way back to the 3-digit level.
Regarding share repurchases, our strategy of returning cash to shareholders continues to balance prudent financial policy with the competing demands of investments to support organic growth and the capital to support selected external investments. While we have $245 million of repurchase capacity remaining under our existing board authorization, we made no additional share repurchases in the second quarter as we prepare to fund heavy capital spending in the second half of this year.
Moving to taxes. Let me note that we are now forecasting a full year tax rate of 27.5%, 50 basis points higher than our previous forecast. This increase is driven by significantly higher profits in the United States, largely due to higher sales of ag products in the first half of 2012. The tax rate in the second quarter was 28%, and the tax rate for the last 2 quarters is projected to be 27.5%, which will result in a full year tax rate of 27.5%.
With that, I will now turn the call back to you, Pierre."

Before we get into outlook for the third quarter and the full year, I'd like to give you a brief update on Vision 2015 progress. As we begin the second half of 2012, I am pleased to report that we continue to be well on plan toward realizing our Vision 2015 objectives.
First, relative to our key P&L objectives, 2015 sales in excess of $5 billion and EBIT of $1.2 billion. We continue to deliver results at or above the trend line required to reach these targets.
In terms of return on capital, we are delivering results on average invested capital well above our commitment of sustained mid-teens. In fact, return on average invested capital in 2011 was 23.9%, a strong performance, well above our minimum commitment. We continue to show improved earnings stability, especially in our Industrial Chemicals Group, reflecting the strength of our portfolio and impact of actions we took in 2010 and 2011 to exit the underperforming and highly volatile phosphate and sodium percarbonate business lines.
As Kim has highlighted, we remain disciplined stewards of cash with a balanced deployment among organic and external growth investments and return to cash to -- of cash to shareholders. In fact, not quite halfway through our Vision 2015 plan cycle, we have already returned or have committed to return $750 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. This is more than half of the minimum commitments of returning $1 billion of cash to shareholder that we announced at the launch of the plan. So from a cumulative perspective, we are making great progress.
Beyond the metrics, we also delivered against our overall Vision 2015 strategic imperatives in the first half of 2012. First, growing our leadership position. As Michael described, we broadened our specialty food ingredients platform with the acquisition of Phytone, Ltd. in the natural colors space and the announced signing of a definitive agreement to purchase Pectine Italia.
Increasing our reach. We continue to increase our participation in rapidly developing economies with sales in RDEs at 25% in the first half of 2012 and sales in RDEs representing nearly 47% of the total company sales for the last 12 months.
Capturing the value of common ownership. We continue to shift from a highly centralized organization to a balanced centralized/decentralized model that better leverages our size and scale and to act as one FMC where it matters, realizing efficiencies while maintaining stronger contact with our business units. Our global procurement team is making great progress, and we're on schedule to deliver projected cost savings.
Our operations group is also making great strides in building excellence in operations, supply chains and environments, health and safety across FMC. We are beginning several exciting initiatives on the operations area, particularly around manufacturing efficiency improvements. I will share more on this effort in the future.
Proactively managing our portfolio. Industrial Chemicals' portfolio has been an area of focus. We've addressed businesses that were competitively disadvantaged and underperforming for an extended period of time. In 2010, we exited the phosphate and sulfate derivatives business. In mid-2011, we announced our exit of the sodium percarbonate business line, which was completed in early 2012. With these moves, Industrial Chemicals has been transformed into a segment with sustained higher margin, greater earnings stability and significantly higher return on assets.
Finally, disciplined cash deployment, which I updated you on a few moments ago. In short, we are making exceptional progress towards delivering our Vision 2015 strategy plan, and I and the FMC management team look forward to sharing much more detail and context of our Vision 2015 progress and long-range plans at our Institutional Investors Conference to be held on December 11, 2012, in New York.
Moving on to our outlook for the full year 2012. We raised slightly the midpoint of our previous outlook for the full year 2012 and now expect adjusted earnings of $3.42 to $3.52 per diluted share, a 16% increase above last year at the midpoint of the range. Our Agricultural Products segment expects to achieve its ninth consecutive year of record earnings, with year-over-year earnings up in the high teens, reflecting increased volumes, especially in Latin America, North America and Asia, due to strong market conditions and growth from new and acquired product, but partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives.
As Michael described earlier, segment earnings in Specialty Chemicals are expected to be flat for the year. We are forecasting the eighth straight year of record earnings in BioPolymer, with higher selling price and volume growth, partially offset by the impact of higher raw materials costs, increased spending on targeted growth initiatives and unfavorable exchange rate impact.
However, segment earnings will be dampened by weak performance from the Lithium business with the operational issues Michael highlighted, as well as continuing cost increase in Argentina offsetting higher selling prices.
And now, Industrial Chemicals segment. We expect earnings to be up in the high-teens percent due to higher volumes and selling prices in soda ash and the third consecutive year of record earnings from the Peroxygens business, reflecting the continued mix shift of that business toward specialty applications.
Now moving to our outlook for the third quarter 2012. We expect adjusted earnings of $0.70 to $0.80 per diluted share for the third quarter, a 9% increase at the midpoint of this range. In Agricultural Products, we expect third quarter segment earnings to be up approximately 10% reflecting strong growth in Latin America, especially Brazil, partially offset by continued investment in targeted growth initiative. Specialty Chemicals' third quarter segment earnings are projected to be down approximately 5%, as higher selling prices across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer are offset by higher operating cost in Lithium, as well as higher raw material cost and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. And Industrial Chemicals, we expect third quarter segment earnings to be up in the mid-teens percent, driven by higher selling prices in soda ash and specialty peroxygen, volume growth in soda ash and the continued mix shift towards specialty peroxygens, partially offset by a planned maintenance outage in our Tonawanda, New York peroxygens facility.

As you recall from the discussion at the end of the first quarter, what had happened is we had very unusual rains in the December through February period. So what the impact of that was, was it diluted brine that we have both in pre-evaporation ponds, which is prior to processing, and also our final solar brine. So as we moved into the second quarter, we began to produce more lithium. But because the concentration of lithium in the brine was lower than ideal, that creates a manufacturing inefficiency. You think about the energy that you have to consume, et cetera, I mean, you're processing twice as much water, evaporating twice as much water if your concentration is half of what you would ideally like it to be. So we have sort of suffered through that situation with manufacturing at below optimal conditions and brine concentration for some period of time. And we finally got -- and what we had hoped was that we would see evaporative conditions that would improved that situation over the course of the second quarter. But the reality, as it turned out, was that during the Argentine winter, we didn't have very favorable evaporative conditions, so the brine concentrations haven't improved all that much. So rather than continue to process those brines at low concentrations, we've sort of taken the difficult but necessary decision to scale back production to give the brines time to concentrate so then when we do produce, it will be at an optimal condition, and we'll have a much better cost position for the product that we produce."

Pierre, I think you talked about -- or you just mentioned, an answer to your previous call, that the soda ash businesses is pretty solid as you enter the negotiating season for 2013. But you only had one price increase announcement this year, which, typically, if you read between the tea leaves, indicates that the business is not that strong in terms of pricing realization for next year.

I would say, secondly, from a demand standpoint, as Pierre just said, we're in sold-out mode, and we have been for some time now. So we're very confident being the world's lowest-cost producer of natural soda ash that we'll be able to place our volume at premiums around the world. I would say, the other thing you've got to remember is North American demand is still some 10% below its peak of 2008. So any signs that these markets come back further from where they are today, it's going to get tighter. So we're very confident moving into the 2013 season that we have pricing leverage."
