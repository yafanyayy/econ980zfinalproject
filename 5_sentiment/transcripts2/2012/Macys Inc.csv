Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
2011 was another record year for Macy's, Inc. We are very proud of our team and the momentum we have built up. Our sales grew approximately 5% in comp store for the second year in a row, while increasing the profitability of the company. This results from the combination of great strategy and terrific execution, which has helped us to gain market share. Our EBITDA as a percent of sales increased 80 basis points in 2011, on top of last year's 100 basis-point increase. And, we have strategies to increase it further to the 14% to 15% targeted level, while continuing to invest in driving top line sales.
We also increased our return on invested capital by 230 basis points in 2011, almost reaching 20%. And our return to investment grade ratings in all agencies speaks to the strength of our balance sheet, our performance and the sustainability of our strategy. It is great to be entering the new year with so much positive energy throughout our organization.
I will outline the key aspects of our fourth quarter and full-year 2011 performance and then discuss some of our key assumptions for 2012. 
Sales in the fourth quarter were $8,724,000,000, up 5.5% over last year. And on a comp store basis, our sales in the quarter grew 5.2%. Sales in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations reflecting a very strong holiday performance. Our sales performance continue to be balanced. We were pleased with our performance at Macy's as well as at Bloomingdale's, online and in stores. In fact, all regions across the country produced sales growth this year for both the quarter and the full year. All year long, our Southern regions across the country performed best, and that continued in the fourth quarter. And in Northeast, also had strong sales growth in the fourth quarter.
business, we saw strength during the quarter in so many categories, including cosmetics and fragrances, shoes, handbags, watches, men's, textiles, housewares and furniture. And the areas with the most notable weakness in the quarter were the cold weather merchandise areas, junior's and traditional casual women's apparel. Averaging retail in the quarter was up 9%, while transactions were up approximately 1%, and units per transaction down approximately 4%.
For the second half of the year, our average unit retail was up approximately 7%, which is at the high end of the 5% to 7% that we had anticipated. All in all, we did a great job anticipating and planning for the merchandise cost increases that we had experienced. 
Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 41%, down 30 basis points from last year. Merchandise margins were flat in the quarter, while we were negatively impacted by the free shipping as expected. Inventory at year-end was up 7.5% over a year ago. This is a little higher than the 6% to 7% we had expected due to the decision to keep cold weather merchandise in the stores longer than usual so it would be available for the customer when the store coldest. While you may not know it on the East Coast, winter isn't over yet. And by the end of the first quarter, this merchandise will be gone and our cross store inventory will be again below expected sales growth.
Also, remember the year-end inventory continues to be impacted by the higher in transit discussed this quarter in 2011. We have now year rounded on the chain so it will no longer be a factor as we enter 2012. 
In the fourth quarter, SG&A in dollars was $2,314,000,000 or 3% over last year. As a percent of sales, it was 26.6%, down 60 basis points from a year ago. This is better than expected due to various year-end adjustments and depreciation relating to decline in capital expenditures. Credit profitability in the quarter increased by $59 million over a year ago, which is within the range of what we had expected at the beginning of the quarter. We clearly continue to benefit from the stronger portfolio performance.
At the end of the quarter, we sold 4 store leases to Lord & Taylor that they have been subleasing for us from us since the 2006 divestiture. We booked a $54 million gain on the sale. Also in the quarter, we booked $29 million in costs, primarily associated with the announced store closings, of which $22 million was non-cash asset impairment charges. The net of these 2 items is the $25 million of income that you see on the P&L. 
Interest expense in the quarter was $108 million as expected. The tax rate was 36.6% in the fourth quarter. You'll recall that last year in the fourth quarter our tax rate was 35%, so the year-over-year comparison in the fourth quarter earnings is negatively impacted by the higher tax rate.
Average diluted share count in the quarter was 427.3 million shares. During the quarter, we bought back approximately 8.2 million shares. So since we've resumed our stock buyback program during the third quarter, we bought back a total of 16.4 million shares for approximately $500 million at an average price of $30.57. EPS in the fourth quarter on a diluted basis, excluding store closing costs and the gain on the sale to Lord & Taylor was $1.70, well above expectations and last year. 
Our cash flow was also very strong throughout the year in 2011. During the year, operating activities generated $2.1 billion of cash as compared to $1.5 billion last year. Our pension contribution this year was $375 million versus $825 million a year ago. And CapEx was $764 million this year, below the budgeted $800 million dollars due to the timing of the cash outlay. Cash flow before financing activities was $1.476 billion, up $435 million over a year ago. 
In the financing section of the cash flow, you will note $800 million of debt that we issued in January. Given market conditions, we access the market in advance of this approximately $790 million of debt maturing during the first half of 2012, $617 million in March and $173 million in July. At the end of the year, we had $2.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet or $2 billion excluding the debt issuance, which we used to pay down debt. This compares to $1.46 billion at the end of last year.
Our return on invested capital in 2011 was 19.7%, up to 200 basis points over last year that I referred to earlier. And our credit ratios excluding the impact of the January debt issuance were well within our targets, with debt to EBITDA at 2.6 relative to our target levels of 2.4 to 2.7 and our EBITDA to interest of 7.1 relative to the range in our target of 6.4 to 6.6. Maintaining credit ratios at least in the target range is very important to us, and you can check our website to the specific calculations.
Let's now move on to 2012. As stated earlier, we expect the momentum to continue. For planning purposes, we are assuming a comp store increase of approximately 3.5% on a 52-week basis. Remember, our retail calendar includes an extra week in January in 2012. So for the full year, our total sales including this extra week are expected to be up approximately 1 point over comp store sales increase. Now obviously in the fourth quarter, given that extra week, we're expecting a much bigger gap, in fact 3.5 points higher total store growth in comp. However, in the first 3 quarters of the year, total sales growth is expected to be slightly below our comp store growth due to the locations that we closed at the end of 2011.
We are planning to open 2 new stores in 2012, both in fact next month, 1 in Milwaukee and 1 in Salt Lake City. We're also opening 5 new Bloomingdale's outlets during 2012, bringing the total number to 12.
We are assuming a flattish growth margin rate for the year, although we could have continued pressure from free shipping given the sales growth expected in the omnichannel business. And by the way, this may not be the case in every quarter, but over the course of the year we do expect the gross margin rate to be flattish. 
On the SG&A front, we expect to be able to continue to improve our expense rate as a percent of sales. We expect our income from the credit portfolio to increase approximately $15 million to $20 million during 2012. But we are expecting big variances when we look at the comparison to last year and each quarter. As we start this year, we're expecting a year of strong credit portfolio performance, and therefore, the earnings will be more evenly distributed through the year. This is obviously very different from 2011 when the good news ended up being much more backend loaded, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2011.
For the year, we're expecting retirement expense pension plus to increase by approximately $65 million, while depreciation is expected to decline approximately $25 million for the year. For interest expense, we're assuming approximately $435 million to $444 million -- for hundred $440 million for the year, and we're assuming an effective tax rate of 36.95% for 2012, although it will vary by quarter. And our CapEx budget for 2012 is $850 million.
In terms of uses of cash, we are now planning to contribute $150 million to the pension plan during the year, and we will pay off the $1.1 billion of debt at maturity. Remember that we, in essence, pre- funded the March and July maturities with the issuance in January, and we have an additional $298 million of debt maturing in January of 2013. With our excess cash, we expect to buy back stock on a regular basis throughout the year, depending on market conditions. We have approximately $1.3 billion of authorization remaining.
So net net, we are assuming earnings per share on a diluted basis of $3.25 to $3.30 for 2012. This represents an increase of 13% to 15% over 2011's diluted EPS excluding store closing costs and the gain on the sale to Lord & Taylor.  This does not include any store closing-related costs that we could incur in 2012. 
The real headline from today's announcement is the significant back-to-back-to-back improvement in our results over the past 3 years. When we first announced our new strategic direction in 2008 and 2009, we talked about the opportunity we saw to accelerate rate sales growth and improve overall financial performance, and that is exactly what happened in 2009, 2010, and again in 2011, as our organization has executed superbly and captured market share from our competitors. But as you have heard us say many times, we are not even close to being done. We haven't placed a whole new set of activities beginning this spring to continue to refine our localization approach within My Macy's and empower our organization to meet the specific needs of customers by location.  We are also forging ahead with experiments and innovation within our omnichannel strategy to serve customer needs in-store, online and via mobile. Not only is this driving sales, but it is also beginning to help us improve the management and velocity of our inventory., we are strengthening the coaching process among sales managers and associates on the selling floor, so our customer engagement is consistent and leads to more items in their shopping bag. And you will be hearing more about our initiatives to engage millennial customers in more comprehensive and powerful ways as we sharpen our focus on what is now America's largest and most diverse generation.
We feel very good about our prospects in 2012 to strengthen our business at both Macy's and at Bloomingdale's. We also feel very good about the groundwork we are laying now for continued growth beyond 2012. The results we are generating are very real and the momentum in our business has our organization ready to take the company to the next level of success. And so now, what questions can I answer?"

I mean the key thing as you think about My Macy's, 3 things are happening. One is that people in jobs have been there longer and so they're getting better and better at not only understanding the opportunities in their markets, but also communicating with the central merchants to make them happen. So I think the more time in job the district people has had, the better the 2-way communication is happening. The second thing is that we continue to find new opportunities as we study markets in a more refined ways, whether it be differences in the tourists customer in different markets, whether it be new strategies. For example, the need for cold summer assortments in places like the Pacific Northwest or Southern living strategies sort of across Atlanta and the Southeast. So the second point is that we're continuing to find new opportunities, strategically, as we look at market by market. And then the third point I would make is that we took a lot of time this summer and went back and surveyed all the store managers like we had done back in '06, which was the beginning of the My Macy's, to try to understand how we could improve it further. And we have I think it's roughly 13 initiatives that our teams are busily working on to even make it work better.

I think also as our market share is growing, we've got a lot more customers in our stores who don't yet have a Macy's card, we have to change that, but to some degree it also relates to the new account approval process. It also appears that some of our customers are deleveraging and using debit cards more than their Macy's credit cards. And then obviously, the strength in the tourist business that we've been seeing, where customers cannot -- especially the international tourists, cannot have our credit card, impacts us in some of the big tourist locations like Herald Square, Union Square, Florida, et cetera.

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
2011 was another record year for Macy's, Inc. We are very proud of our team and the momentum we have built up. Our sales grew approximately 5% in comp stores for the second year in a row while increasing the profitability of the company. This results from the combination of great strategies and terrific execution, which has helped us to gain market share.
Our EBITDA rate as a percent of sales increased 80 basis points in 2011, on top of last year's 100-basis-point increase. And we have strategies to increase it further to the 14% to 15% targeted level while continuing to invest in driving top line sales.
We also increased our return on invested capital by 230 basis points in 2011, almost reaching 20%. And our return to investment grade ratings in all agencies speaks to the strength of our balance sheet, our performance, and the sustainability of our strategy. It is great to be entering the new year with so much positive energy throughout our organization.
I will outline the key aspects of our fourth quarter and the full year 2011 performance and then discuss some of our key assumptions for 2012. Sales in the fourth quarter were $8,724,000,000, up 5.5% over last year. And on a comp store basis, our sales in the quarter grew 5.2%.
Sales in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations, reflecting a very strong holiday performance. Our sales performance continue to be balanced. We were pleased with our performance at Macy's, as well as at Bloomingdale's, online and in stores. In fact, all regions across the country produced sales growth this year for both the quarter and the full year. All year long, our southern regions across the country performed best, and that continued in the fourth quarter. And the northeast also had strong sales growth in the fourth quarter.
By family of business, we saw strength during the quarter in so many categories, including cosmetics and fragrances, shoes, handbags, watches, men's, textiles, housewares and furniture. And the areas with the most notable weakness in the quarter were the cold weather merchandise areas, junior's and traditional casual women's apparel. Average unit retail in the quarter was up 9%, while transactions were up approximately 1%, and units per transaction down approximately 4%.
For the second half of the year, our average unit retail was up approximately 7%, which is at the high end of the 5% to 7% that we had anticipated. All in all, we did a great job anticipating and planning for the merchandise cost increases that we had experienced.
Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 41%, down 30 basis points from last year. Merchandise margins were flat in the quarter, while we were negatively impacted by the free shipping as expected. Inventory at year end was up 7.5% over a year ago. This is a little higher than the 6% to 7% we had expected due to the decision to keep cold weather merchandise in the stores longer than usual so it would be available for the customer when the weather has historically turned coldest. While you might not know it on the East Coast, winter isn't over yet. And by the end of the first quarter, this merchandise will be gone, and our cost store inventory will be again below expected sales growth.
Also, remember the year-end inventory continued to be impacted by the higher in-transit discussed each quarter in 2011. We've now year-rounded on the change so it will no longer be a factor as we enter 2012.
In the fourth quarter, SG&A in dollars was $2,314,000,000, or 3% over last year. As a percent of sales, it was 26.6%, down 60 basis points from a year ago. This is better than expected due to various year-end adjustments and lower depreciation relating to the timing of capital expenditures.
Credit profitability in the quarter increased by $59 million over a year ago, which is within the range of what we had expected at the beginning of the quarter. We clearly continue to benefit from the stronger portfolio performance.
At the end of the quarter, we sold 4 store leases to Lord & Taylor that they had been subleasing from us since the 2006 divestiture. We booked a $54 million gain on this sale. Also, in the quarter, we booked $29 million in costs, primarily associated with the announced store closings, of which $22 million was non-cash asset impairment charges. The net of these 2 items is the $25 million of income that you see on the P&L.
Interest expense in the quarter was $108 million as expected. The tax rate was 36.6% in the fourth quarter. You'll recall that last year, in the fourth quarter, our tax rate was 35% so the year-over-year comparison in fourth quarter earnings is negatively impacted by the higher tax rate.
Average diluted share count in the quarter was 427.3 million shares. During the quarter, we bought back approximately 8.2 million shares. So since we resumed our stock buyback program during the third quarter, we have bought back a total of 16.4 million shares for approximately $500 million at an average price of $30.57. EPS in the fourth quarter on a diluted basis, excluding store closing costs and the gain on the sale to Lord & Taylor, was $1.70, well above both expectations and last year.
Our cash flow was also very strong throughout the year in 2011. During the year, operating activities generated $2.1 billion of cash as compared to $1.5 billion last year. Our pension contribution this year was $375 million versus $825 million a year ago. And CapEx was $764 million this year, below the budgeted $800 million dollars, due to the timing of the cash outlay. Cash flow before financing activities was $1.476 billion, up $435 million over a year ago.
In the financing section of the cash flow, you will note the $800 million of debt that we issued in January. Given market conditions, we accessed the market in advance of the approximately $790 million of debt maturing during the first half of 2012, $617 million in March and $173 million in July.
At the end of the year, we had $2.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet, or $2 billion excluding the debt issuance which we used to pay down debt. This compares to $1.46 billion at the end of last year.
Our return on invested capital in 2011 was 19.7%, up the 230 basis points over last year that I referred to earlier. And our credit ratios, excluding the impact of the January debt issuance, were well within our targets, with debt to EBITDA at 2.6 relative to our target levels of 2.4 to 2.7 and our EBITDA to interest of 7.1 relative to the range in our target of 6.4 to 6.6. Maintaining credit ratios at least in the target range is very important to us, and you can check our website to the specific calculations.
Let's now move on to 2012. As stated earlier, we expect the momentum to continue. For planning purposes, we are assuming a comp store increase of approximately 3.5% on a 52-week basis. Remember, our retail calendar includes an extra week in January in 2012. So for the full year, our total sales including this extra week are expected to be up approximately 1 point over our comp store sales increase.
Now obviously, in the fourth quarter, given that extra week, we're expecting a much bigger gap, in fact 3.5 points higher total store growth in comp. However, in the first 3 quarters of the year, total sales growth is expected to be slightly below our comp store growth due to the locations that we closed at the end of 2011.
We are planning to open 2 new stores in 2012, both in fact next month. One in Milwaukee and one in Salt Lake City. We are also opening 5 new Bloomingdale's outlets during 2012, bringing the total number to 12.
We are assuming a flattish growth margin rate for the year, although we could have continued pressure from free shipping given the sales growth expected in the omnichannel business. And by the way, this may not be the case in every quarter, but over the course of the year, we do expect the gross margin rate to be flattish.
On the SG&A front, we expect to be able to continue to improve our expense rate as a percent of sales. We expect our income from the credit portfolio to increase approximately $15 million to $20 million during 2012, but we are expecting big variances when we look at the comparison to last year and each quarter. As we start this year, we're expecting a year of strong credit portfolio performance and, therefore, the earnings will be more evenly distributed through the year. This is obviously very different from 2011 when the good news ended up being much more back-end loaded, particularly in the third quarter of 2011.
For the year, we're expecting retirement expense, pension plus SERP, to increase by approximately $65 million, while depreciation is expected to decline approximately $25 million for the year. For interest expense, we're assuming approximately $435 million to $444 million -- I'm sorry, $440 million for the year. And we're assuming an effective tax rate of 36.95% for 2012, although it will vary by quarter. And our CapEx budget for 2012 is $850 million.
In terms of uses of cash, we are now planning to contribute $150 million to the pension plan during the year, and we will pay off the $1.1 billion of debt at maturity. Remember that we, in essence, pre-funded the March and July maturities with the issuance in January, and we have an additional $298 million of debt maturing in January of 2013. With our excess cash, we expect to buy back stock on a regular basis throughout the year, depending on market conditions. We have approximately $1.3 billion of authorization remaining.
So net net, we are assuming earnings per share on a diluted basis of $3.25 to $3.30 for 2012. This represents an increase of 13% to 15% over 2011's diluted EPS, excluding store closing costs and the gain on the sale to Lord & Taylor. This does not include any store closing-related cost that we could incur in 2012.
The real headline from today's announcement is the significant back-to-back-to-back improvement in our results over the past 3 years. When we first announced our new strategic direction in 2008 and 2009, we talked about the opportunity we saw to accelerate sales growth and improve overall financial performance. And that is exactly what happened in 2009, 2010, and again in 2011, as our organization has executed superbly and captured market share from our competitors. But as you have heard us say many times, we're not even close to being done. We have in place a whole new set of activities beginning this spring to continue to refine our localization approach within My Macy's and empower our organization to meet the specific needs of customers by location.
We are also forging ahead with experiments and innovations within our omnichannel strategy to serve customer needs in-store, online and via mobile. Not only is this driving sales, but it is also beginning to help us improve the management and velocity of our inventory.
In MAGIC Selling, we are strengthening the coaching process among sales managers and associates on the selling floor so our customer engagement is consistent and leads to more items in their shopping bag. And you will be hearing more about our initiatives to engage millennial customers in more comprehensive and powerful ways as we sharpen our focus on what is now America's largest and most diverse generation.
We feel very good about our prospects in 2012 to strengthen our business at both Macy's and at Bloomingdale's. We also feel very good about the groundwork we are laying now for continued growth beyond 2012. The results we are generating are very real, and the momentum in our business has our organization ready to take the company to the next level of success.
And so now, what questions can I answer?"

I mean, the key thing as you think about My Macy's, 3 things are happening. One is the people in jobs have been there longer, and so they're getting better and better at not only understanding the opportunities in their markets, but also communicating with the central merchants to make them happen. So I think the more time in job the district people have had, the better the 2-way communication is happening. The second thing is that we continue to find new opportunities as we study markets in a more refined way, whether it be differences in the tourist customer in different markets, whether it be new strategies. For example, the need for cold summer assortments in places like the Pacific Northwest or Southern living strategies sort of across Atlanta and the Southeast. So the second point is that we're continuing to find new opportunities strategically as we look at market-by-market. And then the third point I would make is that we took a lot of time this summer and went back and surveyed all the store managers like we had done back in '06, which was the beginning of My Macy's, to try to understand how we could improve it further. And we have -- I think it's roughly 13 initiatives that our teams are busily working on to even make it work better.

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
2011 was another record year for Macy's, Inc. We are very proud of our team and the momentum we have built up. Our sales grew approximately 5% in comp stores for the second year in a row while increasing the profitability of the company. This results from the combination of great strategies and terrific execution, which has helped us to gain market share.
Our EBITDA rate as a percent of sales increased 80 basis points in 2011, on top of last year's 100-basis-point increase. And we have strategies to increase it further to the 14% to 15% targeted level while continuing to invest in driving top line sales.
We also increased our return on invested capital by 230 basis points in 2011, almost reaching 20%. And our return to investment grade ratings in all agencies speaks to the strength of our balance sheet, our performance, and the sustainability of our strategy. It is great to be entering the new year with so much positive energy throughout our organization.
I will outline the key aspects of our fourth quarter and the full year 2011 performance and then discuss some of our key assumptions for 2012. Sales in the fourth quarter were $8,724,000,000, up 5.5% over last year. And on a comp store basis, our sales in the quarter grew 5.2%.
Sales in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations, reflecting a very strong holiday performance. Our sales performance continued to be balanced. We were pleased with our performance at Macy's, as well as at Bloomingdale's, online and in stores. In fact, all regions across the country produced sales growth this year for both the quarter and the full year. All year long, our southern regions across the country performed best, and that continued in the fourth quarter. And the northeast also had strong sales growth in the fourth quarter.
By family of business, we saw strength during the quarter in so many categories, including cosmetics and fragrances, shoes, handbags, watches, men's, textiles, housewares and furniture. And the areas with the most notable weakness in the quarter were the cold weather merchandise areas, junior's and traditional casual women's apparel. Average unit retail in the quarter was up 9%, while transactions were up approximately 1%, and units per transaction down approximately 4%.
For the second half of the year, our average unit retail was up approximately 7%, which is at the high end of the 5% to 7% that we had anticipated. All in all, we did a great job anticipating and planning for the merchandise cost increases that we had experienced.
Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 41%, down 30 basis points from last year. Merchandise margins were flat in the quarter, while we were negatively impacted by the free shipping as expected. Inventory at year end was up 7.5% over a year ago. This is a little higher than the 6% to 7% we had expected due to the decision to keep cold weather merchandise in the stores longer than usual so it would be available for the customer when the weather has historically turned coldest. While you might not know it on the East Coast, winter isn't over yet. And by the end of the first quarter, this merchandise will be gone, and our cost store inventory will be again below expected sales growth.
Also, remember the year-end inventory continued to be impacted by the higher in-transit discussed each quarter in 2011. We've now year-rounded on the change, so it will no longer be a factor as we enter 2012.
In the fourth quarter, SG&A in dollars was $2,314,000,000, or 3% over last year. As a percent of sales, it was 26.6%, down 60 basis points from a year ago. This is better than expected due to various year-end adjustments and lower depreciation relating to the timing of capital expenditures.
Credit profitability in the quarter increased by $59 million over a year ago, which is within the range of what we had expected at the beginning of the quarter. We clearly continue to benefit from the stronger portfolio performance.
At the end of the quarter, we sold 4 store leases to Lord & Taylor that they had been subleasing from us since the 2006 divestiture. We booked a $54 million gain on this sale. Also, in the quarter, we booked $29 million in costs, primarily associated with the announced store closings, of which $22 million was noncash asset impairment charges. The net of these 2 items is the $25 million of income that you see on the P&L.
Interest expense in the quarter was $108 million as expected. The tax rate was 36.6% in the fourth quarter. You'll recall that last year, in the fourth quarter, our tax rate was 35% so the year-over-year comparison in fourth quarter earnings is negatively impacted by the higher tax rate.
Average diluted share count in the quarter was 427.3 million shares. During the quarter, we bought back approximately 8.2 million shares. So since we resumed our stock buyback program during the third quarter, we have bought back a total of 16.4 million shares for approximately $500 million at an average price of $30.57. EPS in the fourth quarter on a diluted basis, excluding store closing costs and the gain on the sale to Lord & Taylor, was $1.70, well above both expectations and last year.
Our cash flow was also very strong throughout the year in 2011. During the year, operating activities generated $2.1 billion of cash as compared to $1.5 billion last year. Our pension contribution this year was $375 million versus $825 million a year ago. And CapEx was $764 million this year, below the budgeted $800 million dollars, due to the timing of the cash outlay. Cash flow before financing activities was $1.476 billion, up $435 million over a year ago.
In the financing section of the cash flow, you will note the $800 million of debt that we issued in January. Given market conditions, we accessed the market in advance of the approximately $790 million of debt maturing during the first half of 2012, $617 million in March and $173 million in July.
At the end of the year, we had $2.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet, or $2 billion excluding the debt issuance which we used to pay down debt. This compares to $1.46 billion at the end of last year.
Our return on invested capital in 2011 was 19.7%, up the 230 basis points over last year that I referred to earlier. And our credit ratios, excluding the impact of the January debt issuance, were well within our targets, with debt to EBITDA at 2.6 relative to our target levels of 2.4 to 2.7 and our EBITDA to interest of 7.1 relative to the range in our target of 6.4 to 6.6. Maintaining credit ratios at least in the target range is very important to us, and you can check our website to the specific calculations.
Let's now move on to 2012. As stated earlier, we expect the momentum to continue. For planning purposes, we are assuming a comp store increase of approximately 3.5% on a 52-week basis. Remember, our retail calendar includes an extra week in January in 2012. So for the full year, our total sales including this extra week are expected to be up approximately 1 point over our comp store sales increase.
Now obviously, in the fourth quarter, given that extra week, we're expecting a much bigger gap, in fact 3.5 points higher total store growth in comp. However, in the first 3 quarters of the year, total sales growth is expected to be slightly below our comp store growth due to the locations that we closed at the end of 2011.
We are planning to open 2 new stores in 2012, both in fact next month. One in Milwaukee and one in Salt Lake City. We are also opening 5 new Bloomingdale's outlets during 2012, bringing the total number to 12.
We are assuming a flattish growth margin rate for the year, although we could have continued pressure from free shipping given the sales growth expected in the omnichannel business. And by the way, this may not be the case in every quarter, but over the course of the year, we do expect the gross margin rate to be flattish.
On the SG&A front, we expect to be able to continue to improve our expense rate as a percent of sales. We expect our income from the credit portfolio to increase approximately $15 million to $20 million during 2012, but we are expecting big variances when we look at the comparison to last year and each quarter. As we start this year, we're expecting a year of strong credit portfolio performance and, therefore, the earnings will be more evenly distributed through the year. This is obviously very different from 2011 when the good news ended up being much more back-end loaded, particularly in the third quarter of 2011.
For the year, we're expecting retirement expense, pension plus SERP, to increase by approximately $65 million, while depreciation is expected to decline approximately $25 million for the year. For interest expense, we're assuming approximately $435 million to $444 million -- I'm sorry, $440 million for the year. And we're assuming an effective tax rate of 36.95% for 2012, although it will vary by quarter. And our CapEx budget for 2012 is $850 million.
In terms of uses of cash, we are now planning to contribute $150 million to the pension plan during the year, and we will pay off the $1.1 billion of debt at maturity. Remember that we, in essence, pre-funded the March and July maturities with the issuance in January, and we have an additional $298 million of debt maturing in January of 2013. With our excess cash, we expect to buy back stock on a regular basis throughout the year, depending on market conditions. We have approximately $1.3 billion of authorization remaining.
So net-net, we are assuming earnings per share on a diluted basis of $3.25 to $3.30 for 2012. This represents an increase of 13% to 15% over 2011's diluted EPS, excluding store closing costs and the gain on the sale to Lord & Taylor. This does not include any store closing-related costs that we could incur in 2012.
The real headline from today's announcement is the significant back-to-back-to-back improvement in our results over the past 3 years. When we first announced our new strategic direction in 2008 and 2009, we talked about the opportunity we saw to accelerate sales growth and improve overall financial performance. And that is exactly what happened in 2009, 2010, and again in 2011, as our organization has executed superbly and captured market share from our competitors. But as you have heard us say many times, we're not even close to being done. We have in place a whole new set of activities beginning this spring to continue to refine our localization approach within My Macy's and empower our organization to meet the specific needs of customers by location.
We are also forging ahead with experiments and innovations within our omnichannel strategy to serve customer needs in-store, online and via mobile. Not only is this driving sales, but it is also beginning to help us improve the management and velocity of our inventory.
In MAGIC Selling, we are strengthening the coaching process among sales managers and associates on the selling floor so our customer engagement is consistent and leads to more items in her shopping bag. And you will be hearing more about our initiatives to engage millennial customers in more comprehensive and powerful ways as we sharpen our focus on what is now America's largest and most diverse generation.
We feel very good about our prospects in 2012 to strengthen our business at both Macy's and at Bloomingdale's. We also feel very good about the groundwork we are laying now for continued growth beyond 2012. The results we are generating are very real, and the momentum in our business has our organization ready to take the company to the next level of success.
And so now, what questions can I answer?"

I mean, the key thing as you think about My Macy's, 3 things are happening. One is the people in jobs have been there longer, and so they're getting better and better at not only understanding the opportunities in their markets, but also communicating with the central merchants to make them happen. So I think the more time in job the district people have had, the better the 2-way communication is happening. The second thing is that we continue to find new opportunities as we study markets in a more refined way, whether it be differences in the tourist customer in different markets, whether it be new strategies. For example, the need for cold summer assortments in places like the Pacific Northwest or Southern living strategies sort of across Atlanta and the Southeast. So the second point is that we're continuing to find new opportunities strategically as we look at market-by-market. And then the third point I would make is that we took a lot of time this summer and went back and surveyed all the store managers like we had done back in '06, which was the beginning of My Macy's, to try to understand how we could improve it further. And we have -- I think it's roughly 13 initiatives that our teams are busily working on to even make it work better. So a combination of those 3 factors, Matt, makes me feel really good that there's still a lot more to come from My Macy's."

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
2011 was another record year for Macy's, Inc. We are very proud of our team and the momentum we have built up. Our sales grew approximately 5% in comp stores for the second year in a row while increasing the profitability of the company. This results from the combination of great strategies and terrific execution, which has helped us to gain market share.
Our EBITDA rate as a percent of sales increased 80 basis points in 2011, on top of last year's 100-basis-point increase. And we have strategies to increase it further to the 14% to 15% targeted level while continuing to invest in driving top line sales.
We also increased our return on invested capital by 230 basis points in 2011, almost reaching 20%. And our return to investment grade ratings in all agencies speaks to the strength of our balance sheet, our performance, and the sustainability of our strategy. It is great to be entering the new year with so much positive energy throughout our organization.
I will outline the key aspects of our fourth quarter and the full year 2011 performance and then discuss some of our key assumptions for 2012. Sales in the fourth quarter were $8,724,000,000, up 5.5% over last year. And on a comp store basis, our sales in the quarter grew 5.2%.
Sales in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations, reflecting a very strong holiday performance. Our sales performance continued to be balanced. We were pleased with our performance at Macy's, as well as at Bloomingdale's, online and in stores. In fact, all regions across the country produced sales growth this year for both the quarter and the full year. All year long, our southern regions across the country performed best, and that continued in the fourth quarter. And the northeast also had strong sales growth in the fourth quarter.
By family of business, we saw strength during the quarter in so many categories, including cosmetics and fragrances, shoes, handbags, watches, men's, textiles, housewares and furniture. And the areas with the most notable weakness in the quarter were the cold weather merchandise areas, junior's and traditional casual women's apparel. Average unit retail in the quarter was up 9%, while transactions were up approximately 1%, and units per transaction down approximately 4%.
For the second half of the year, our average unit retail was up approximately 7%, which is at the high end of the 5% to 7% that we had anticipated. All in all, we did a great job anticipating and planning for the merchandise cost increases that we had experienced.
Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 41%, down 30 basis points from last year. Merchandise margins were flat in the quarter, while we were negatively impacted by the free shipping as expected. Inventory at year end was up 7.5% over a year ago. This is a little higher than the 6% to 7% we had expected due to the decision to keep cold weather merchandise in the stores longer than usual so it would be available for the customer when the weather has historically turned coldest. While you might not know it on the East Coast, winter isn't over yet. And by the end of the first quarter, this merchandise will be gone, and our cost store inventory will be again below expected sales growth.
Also, remember the year-end inventory continued to be impacted by the higher in-transit discussed each quarter in 2011. We've now year-rounded on the change, so it will no longer be a factor as we enter 2012.
In the fourth quarter, SG&A in dollars was $2,314,000,000, or 3% over last year. As a percent of sales, it was 26.6%, down 60 basis points from a year ago. This is better than expected due to various year-end adjustments and lower depreciation relating to the timing of capital expenditures.
Credit profitability in the quarter increased by $59 million over a year ago, which is within the range of what we had expected at the beginning of the quarter. We clearly continue to benefit from the stronger portfolio performance.
At the end of the quarter, we sold 4 store leases to Lord & Taylor that they had been subleasing from us since the 2006 divestiture. We booked a $54 million gain on this sale. Also, in the quarter, we booked $29 million in costs, primarily associated with the announced store closings, of which $22 million was noncash asset impairment charges. The net of these 2 items is the $25 million of income that you see on the P&L.
Interest expense in the quarter was $108 million as expected. The tax rate was 36.6% in the fourth quarter. You'll recall that last year, in the fourth quarter, our tax rate was 35% so the year-over-year comparison in fourth quarter earnings is negatively impacted by the higher tax rate.
Average diluted share count in the quarter was 427.3 million shares. During the quarter, we bought back approximately 8.2 million shares. So since we resumed our stock buyback program during the third quarter, we have bought back a total of 16.4 million shares for approximately $500 million at an average price of $30.57. EPS in the fourth quarter on a diluted basis, excluding store closing costs and the gain on the sale to Lord & Taylor, was $1.70, well above both expectations and last year.
Our cash flow was also very strong throughout the year in 2011. During the year, operating activities generated $2.1 billion of cash as compared to $1.5 billion last year. Our pension contribution this year was $375 million versus $825 million a year ago. And CapEx was $764 million this year, below the budgeted $800 million dollars, due to the timing of the cash outlay. Cash flow before financing activities was $1.476 billion, up $435 million over a year ago.
In the financing section of the cash flow, you will note the $800 million of debt that we issued in January. Given market conditions, we accessed the market in advance of the approximately $790 million of debt maturing during the first half of 2012, $617 million in March and $173 million in July.
At the end of the year, we had $2.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet, or $2 billion excluding the debt issuance which we used to pay down debt. This compares to $1.46 billion at the end of last year.
Our return on invested capital in 2011 was 19.7%, up the 230 basis points over last year that I referred to earlier. And our credit ratios, excluding the impact of the January debt issuance, were well within our targets, with debt to EBITDA at 2.6 relative to our target levels of 2.4 to 2.7 and our EBITDA to interest of 7.1 relative to the range in our target of 6.4 to 6.6. Maintaining credit ratios at least in the target range is very important to us, and you can check our website to the specific calculations.
Let's now move on to 2012. As stated earlier, we expect the momentum to continue. For planning purposes, we are assuming a comp store increase of approximately 3.5% on a 52-week basis. Remember, our retail calendar includes an extra week in January in 2012. So for the full year, our total sales including this extra week are expected to be up approximately 1 point over our comp store sales increase.
Now obviously, in the fourth quarter, given that extra week, we're expecting a much bigger gap, in fact 3.5 points higher total store growth in comp. However, in the first 3 quarters of the year, total sales growth is expected to be slightly below our comp store growth due to the locations that we closed at the end of 2011.
We are planning to open 2 new stores in 2012, both in fact next month. One in Milwaukee and one in Salt Lake City. We are also opening 5 new Bloomingdale's outlets during 2012, bringing the total number to 12.
We are assuming a flattish growth margin rate for the year, although we could have continued pressure from free shipping given the sales growth expected in the omnichannel business. And by the way, this may not be the case in every quarter, but over the course of the year, we do expect the gross margin rate to be flattish.
On the SG&A front, we expect to be able to continue to improve our expense rate as a percent of sales. We expect our income from the credit portfolio to increase approximately $15 million to $20 million during 2012, but we are expecting big variances when we look at the comparison to last year and each quarter. As we start this year, we're expecting a year of strong credit portfolio performance and, therefore, the earnings will be more evenly distributed through the year. This is obviously very different from 2011 when the good news ended up being much more back-end loaded, particularly in the third quarter of 2011.
For the year, we're expecting retirement expense, pension plus SERP, to increase by approximately $65 million, while depreciation is expected to decline approximately $25 million for the year. For interest expense, we're assuming approximately $435 million to $444 million -- I'm sorry, $440 million for the year. And we're assuming an effective tax rate of 36.95% for 2012, although it will vary by quarter. And our CapEx budget for 2012 is $850 million.
In terms of uses of cash, we are now planning to contribute $150 million to the pension plan during the year, and we will pay off the $1.1 billion of debt at maturity. Remember that we, in essence, pre-funded the March and July maturities with the issuance in January, and we have an additional $298 million of debt maturing in January of 2013. With our excess cash, we expect to buy back stock on a regular basis throughout the year, depending on market conditions. We have approximately $1.3 billion of authorization remaining.
So net-net, we are assuming earnings per share on a diluted basis of $3.25 to $3.30 for 2012. This represents an increase of 13% to 15% over 2011's diluted EPS, excluding store closing costs and the gain on the sale to Lord & Taylor. This does not include any store closing-related costs that we could incur in 2012.
The real headline from today's announcement is the significant back-to-back-to-back improvement in our results over the past 3 years. When we first announced our new strategic direction in 2008 and 2009, we talked about the opportunity we saw to accelerate sales growth and improve overall financial performance. And that is exactly what happened in 2009, 2010, and again in 2011, as our organization has executed superbly and captured market share from our competitors. But as you have heard us say many times, we're not even close to being done. We have in place a whole new set of activities beginning this spring to continue to refine our localization approach within My Macy's and empower our organization to meet the specific needs of customers by location.
We are also forging ahead with experiments and innovations within our omnichannel strategy to serve customer needs in-store, online and via mobile. Not only is this driving sales, but it is also beginning to help us improve the management and velocity of our inventory.
In MAGIC Selling, we are strengthening the coaching process among sales managers and associates on the selling floor so our customer engagement is consistent and leads to more items in her shopping bag. And you will be hearing more about our initiatives to engage millennial customers in more comprehensive and powerful ways as we sharpen our focus on what is now America's largest and most diverse generation.
We feel very good about our prospects in 2012 to strengthen our business at both Macy's and at Bloomingdale's. We also feel very good about the groundwork we are laying now for continued growth beyond 2012. The results we are generating are very real, and the momentum in our business has our organization ready to take the company to the next level of success.
And so now, what questions can I answer?"

I mean, the key thing as you think about My Macy's, 3 things are happening. One is the people in jobs have been there longer, and so they're getting better and better at not only understanding the opportunities in their markets, but also communicating with the central merchants to make them happen. So I think the more time in job the district people have had, the better the 2-way communication is happening. The second thing is that we continue to find new opportunities as we study markets in a more refined way, whether it be differences in the tourist customer in different markets, whether it be new strategies. For example, the need for cold summer assortments in places like the Pacific Northwest or Southern living strategies sort of across Atlanta and the Southeast. So the second point is that we're continuing to find new opportunities strategically as we look at market-by-market. And then the third point I would make is that we took a lot of time this summer and went back and surveyed all the store managers like we had done back in '06, which was the beginning of My Macy's, to try to understand how we could improve it further. And we have -- I think it's roughly 13 initiatives that our teams are busily working on to even make it work better. So a combination of those 3 factors, Matt, makes me feel really good that there's still a lot more to come from My Macy's."

But to some degree, it also relates to the new account approval process. It also appears as if some of our customers are deleveraging and using debit cards more than their Macy's credit card.

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
2011 was another record year for Macy's, Inc. We are very proud of our team and the momentum we have built up. Our sales grew approximately 5% in comp stores for the second year in a row while increasing the profitability of the company. This results from the combination of great strategies and terrific execution, which has helped us to gain market share.
Our EBITDA rate as a percent of sales increased 80 basis points in 2011, on top of last year's 100-basis-point increase. And we have strategies to increase it further to the 14% to 15% targeted level while continuing to invest in driving top line sales.
We also increased our return on invested capital by 230 basis points in 2011, almost reaching 20%. And our return to investment grade ratings in all agencies speaks to the strength of our balance sheet, our performance, and the sustainability of our strategy. It is great to be entering the new year with so much positive energy throughout our organization.
I will outline the key aspects of our fourth quarter and the full year 2011 performance and then discuss some of our key assumptions for 2012. Sales in the fourth quarter were $8,724,000,000, up 5.5% over last year. And on a comp store basis, our sales in the quarter grew 5.2%.
Sales in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations, reflecting a very strong holiday performance. Our sales performance continued to be balanced. We were pleased with our performance at Macy's, as well as at Bloomingdale's, online and in stores. In fact, all regions across the country produced sales growth this year for both the quarter and the full year. All year long, our southern regions across the country performed best, and that continued in the fourth quarter. And the northeast also had strong sales growth in the fourth quarter.
By family of business, we saw strength during the quarter in so many categories, including cosmetics and fragrances, shoes, handbags, watches, men's, textiles, housewares and furniture. And the areas with the most notable weakness in the quarter were the cold weather merchandise areas, junior's and traditional casual women's apparel. Average unit retail in the quarter was up 9%, while transactions were up approximately 1%, and units per transaction down approximately 4%.
For the second half of the year, our average unit retail was up approximately 7%, which is at the high end of the 5% to 7% that we had anticipated. All in all, we did a great job anticipating and planning for the merchandise cost increases that we had experienced.
Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 41%, down 30 basis points from last year. Merchandise margins were flat in the quarter, while we were negatively impacted by the free shipping as expected. Inventory at year end was up 7.5% over a year ago. This is a little higher than the 6% to 7% we had expected due to the decision to keep cold weather merchandise in the stores longer than usual so it would be available for the customer when the weather has historically turned coldest. While you might not know it on the East Coast, winter isn't over yet. And by the end of the first quarter, this merchandise will be gone, and our cost store inventory will be again below expected sales growth.
Also, remember the year-end inventory continued to be impacted by the higher in-transit discussed each quarter in 2011. We've now year-rounded on the change, so it will no longer be a factor as we enter 2012.
In the fourth quarter, SG&A in dollars was $2,314,000,000, or 3% over last year. As a percent of sales, it was 26.6%, down 60 basis points from a year ago. This is better than expected due to various year-end adjustments and lower depreciation relating to the timing of capital expenditures.
Credit profitability in the quarter increased by $59 million over a year ago, which is within the range of what we had expected at the beginning of the quarter. We clearly continue to benefit from the stronger portfolio performance.
At the end of the quarter, we sold 4 store leases to Lord & Taylor that they had been subleasing from us since the 2006 divestiture. We booked a $54 million gain on this sale. Also, in the quarter, we booked $29 million in costs, primarily associated with the announced store closings, of which $22 million was noncash asset impairment charges. The net of these 2 items is the $25 million of income that you see on the P&L.
Interest expense in the quarter was $108 million as expected. The tax rate was 36.6% in the fourth quarter. You'll recall that last year, in the fourth quarter, our tax rate was 35% so the year-over-year comparison in fourth quarter earnings is negatively impacted by the higher tax rate.
Average diluted share count in the quarter was 427.3 million shares. During the quarter, we bought back approximately 8.2 million shares. So since we resumed our stock buyback program during the third quarter, we have bought back a total of 16.4 million shares for approximately $500 million at an average price of $30.57. EPS in the fourth quarter on a diluted basis, excluding store closing costs and the gain on the sale to Lord & Taylor, was $1.70, well above both expectations and last year.
Our cash flow was also very strong throughout the year in 2011. During the year, operating activities generated $2.1 billion of cash as compared to $1.5 billion last year. Our pension contribution this year was $375 million versus $825 million a year ago. And CapEx was $764 million this year, below the budgeted $800 million dollars, due to the timing of the cash outlay. Cash flow before financing activities was $1.476 billion, up $435 million over a year ago.
In the financing section of the cash flow, you will note the $800 million of debt that we issued in January. Given market conditions, we accessed the market in advance of the approximately $790 million of debt maturing during the first half of 2012, $617 million in March and $173 million in July.
At the end of the year, we had $2.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet, or $2 billion excluding the debt issuance which we used to pay down debt. This compares to $1.46 billion at the end of last year.
Our return on invested capital in 2011 was 19.7%, up the 230 basis points over last year that I referred to earlier. And our credit ratios, excluding the impact of the January debt issuance, were well within our targets, with debt to EBITDA at 2.6 relative to our target levels of 2.4 to 2.7 and our EBITDA to interest of 7.1 relative to the range in our target of 6.4 to 6.6. Maintaining credit ratios at least in the target range is very important to us, and you can check our website to the specific calculations.
Let's now move on to 2012. As stated earlier, we expect the momentum to continue. For planning purposes, we are assuming a comp store increase of approximately 3.5% on a 52-week basis. Remember, our retail calendar includes an extra week in January in 2012. So for the full year, our total sales including this extra week are expected to be up approximately 1 point over our comp store sales increase.
Now obviously, in the fourth quarter, given that extra week, we're expecting a much bigger gap, in fact 3.5 points higher total store growth in comp. However, in the first 3 quarters of the year, total sales growth is expected to be slightly below our comp store growth due to the locations that we closed at the end of 2011.
We are planning to open 2 new stores in 2012, both in fact next month. One in Milwaukee and one in Salt Lake City. We are also opening 5 new Bloomingdale's outlets during 2012, bringing the total number to 12.
We are assuming a flattish growth margin rate for the year, although we could have continued pressure from free shipping given the sales growth expected in the omnichannel business. And by the way, this may not be the case in every quarter, but over the course of the year, we do expect the gross margin rate to be flattish.
On the SG&A front, we expect to be able to continue to improve our expense rate as a percent of sales. We expect our income from the credit portfolio to increase approximately $15 million to $20 million during 2012, but we are expecting big variances when we look at the comparison to last year and each quarter. As we start this year, we're expecting a year of strong credit portfolio performance and, therefore, the earnings will be more evenly distributed through the year. This is obviously very different from 2011 when the good news ended up being much more back-end loaded, particularly in the third quarter of 2011.
For the year, we're expecting retirement expense, pension plus SERP, to increase by approximately $65 million, while depreciation is expected to decline approximately $25 million for the year. For interest expense, we're assuming approximately $435 million to $444 million -- I'm sorry, $440 million for the year. And we're assuming an effective tax rate of 36.95% for 2012, although it will vary by quarter. And our CapEx budget for 2012 is $850 million.
In terms of uses of cash, we are now planning to contribute $150 million to the pension plan during the year, and we will pay off the $1.1 billion of debt at maturity. Remember that we, in essence, pre-funded the March and July maturities with the issuance in January, and we have an additional $298 million of debt maturing in January of 2013. With our excess cash, we expect to buy back stock on a regular basis throughout the year, depending on market conditions. We have approximately $1.3 billion of authorization remaining.
So net-net,  we are assuming earnings per share on a diluted basis of $3.25 to $3.30 for 2012. This represents an increase of 13% to 15% over 2011's diluted EPS, excluding store closing costs and the gain on the sale to Lord & Taylor. This does not include any store closing-related costs that we could incur in 2012.
The real headline from today's announcement is the significant back-to-back-to-back improvement in our results over the past 3 years. When we first announced our new strategic direction in 2008 and 2009, we talked about the opportunity we saw to accelerate sales growth and improve overall financial performance. And that is exactly what happened in 2009, 2010, and again in 2011, as our organization has executed superbly and captured market share from our competitors. But as you have heard us say many times, we're not even close to being done. We have in place a whole new set of activities beginning this spring to continue to refine our localization approach within My Macy's and empower our organization to meet the specific needs of customers by location.
We are also forging ahead with experiments and innovations within our omnichannel strategy to serve customer needs in-store, online and via mobile. Not only is this driving sales, but it is also beginning to help us improve the management and velocity of our inventory.
In MAGIC Selling, we are strengthening the coaching process among sales managers and associates on the selling floor so our customer engagement is consistent and leads to more items in her shopping bag. And you will be hearing more about our initiatives to engage millennial customers in more comprehensive and powerful ways as we sharpen our focus on what is now America's largest and most diverse generation.
We feel very good about our prospects in 2012 to strengthen our business at both Macy's and at Bloomingdale's. We also feel very good about the groundwork we are laying now for continued growth beyond 2012. The results we are generating are very real, and the momentum in our business has our organization ready to take the company to the next level of success.
And so now, what questions can I answer?"

I mean, the key thing as you think about My Macy's, 3 things are happening. One is the people in jobs have been there longer, and so they're getting better and better at not only understanding the opportunities in their markets, but also communicating with the central merchants to make them happen. So I think the more time in job the district people have had, the better the 2-way communication is happening. The second thing is that we continue to find new opportunities as we study markets in a more refined way, whether it be differences in the tourist customer in different markets, whether it be new strategies. For example, the need for cold summer assortments in places like the Pacific Northwest or Southern living strategies sort of across Atlanta and the Southeast. So the second point is that we're continuing to find new opportunities strategically as we look at market-by-market. And then the third point I would make is that we took a lot of time this summer and went back and surveyed all the store managers like we had done back in '06, which was the beginning of My Macy's, to try to understand how we could improve it further. And we have -- I think it's roughly 13 initiatives that our teams are busily working on to even make it work better.

But the compelling part of the logic, the key driving factor, will be where the goods are selling through the slowest to pull it from those stores."

A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.
Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K.
The team at Macy's continues to produce great results in the first quarter. We are very proud of our performance and the consistency in our results. The strategic investments we are making are working, and we continue to find new strategies to grow. We achieved a comp store sales increase of 4.4% in the first quarter, well above our expectation at the start of the year. Our operating income grew 18% above last year, an 80-basis point as a percent of sales. And our earnings per share grew 43%.
I will take you through some of those details behind these numbers and give our current view of the second quarter and the rest of the year. And then I'll open the call for your questions. 
Sales of $6.1 billion in the quarter continue to be strong in both of our brands, at Macy's and at Bloomingdale's, and also, in-store, as well as online. We are seeing more and more opportunities to satisfy demand from customers when they're in the store with inventory that comes from other locations and from our direct-to-customer distribution centers. We are also beginning to be able to satisfy online demand with store inventory when the distribution center runs out of a particular item. It is really, very exciting to watch. We now have over 80 stores to fulfill orders from other stores or from online demand. And by the holiday season, we'll have over 290 store fulfillment locations. We think the sales potential from this omnichannel approach is enormous.  In addition, over time, it should enable us to also improve the productivity of our inventory, as well as our store square footage. We have barely scratched the surface here, and we are very optimistic about the possibilities.
Our strong sales performance in the quarter was also very broad-based in terms of merchandise categories. Sales continue to be strong in Men's, core, meaning categories like watches, jewelry, handbags, cosmetics, shoes, et cetera, and also in home. The feminine apparel business was stronger in February and March than in April, but we are feeling better about these categories, particularly the classic parts of the business. We saw strength during the quarter in what we call the impulse apparel area, which is geared at the older millennial customer, women aged roughly 22 to 30. Although the Junior business, which is aimed at the younger millennial customer, continued to be weak. Private brands continue to perform well throughout the store, providing newness, exclusivity and value. Amongst our strongest private brands have been Hotel, Charter Club and Bar III, which as you recall just launched last year. Our new Ideology brand, which is geared to the active customer, was recently launched and is doing very well. 
Geographically, sales were also strong across the country, although the Southern markets in general continue to outperform, including markets in Florida, Texas and Hawaii. But it is important to know that we also saw strength in markets not in the South like Cleveland, Ohio, Columbus and Long Island. This demonstrates to us the power of My Macy's. We are working hard to figure out how best to tailor our offering locally, and the results are paying off market by market.
Average unit retail in the quarter was up 8%, with units down about 4%. Gross margin in the quarter was 38.8% or 30 basis points below last year. Merchandise margin was flattish with last year. We had year-rounded on the impact of free shipping, but the growth of the omnichannel business continued to put some pressure on gross margin in the quarter. But keep in mind, that's great news. The more business we can do omnichannel and on macy's and bloomingdales.com, the better for the bottom line and in fact you saw that with the increase in the EBIT rate, which we'll talk about in a minute. 
Inventory at the end of the quarter was up 6%, driven by an increase in in-transit merchandise. Inventory net of payables, which adjusts for the in-transit, was up 3%, below expected sales to the second quarter.
Expense in the quarter was $1,995,000,000 or 32.4% of sales. This is 1.1% above last year in dollars and 110 basis points lower than last year as a percent of sales. Relative to last year, credit was the biggest factor favorably impacting expense, with a $43 million benefit this year versus last. As we explained at the start of this year, we expect credit profitability to increase by $15 million to $20 million for the full year and that it would vary greatly by quarter. I'll talk more about this later, but the first quarter was consistent with the higher end of our annual guidance.
We also benefited in the quarter from $12 million in lower depreciation and amortization expense. Offsetting some of the favorable variances relative to last year was higher expense related to our investments in our Internet and omnichannel businesses, higher selling expense due to the higher sales, $16 million in higher pension expense and the year-rounding on last year's $12 million gains on the sale of our share of The Knot. Operating income in the quarter was $391 million, 18% above last year. And as a percent of sales, operating income was 6.4%, up 80 basis points over a year ago.
Interest expense in the quarter was $112 million, slightly below last year. Both tax expense was $95 million or 35% of pretax income. This was below the annual expected tax rate of roughly 37% due to settlements during the quarter. These settlements were expected to occur sometime during 2012, and therefore our expectations for the annual effective tax rate has not changed. Net income in the quarter was $181 million and the average share count on a diluted basis was 423.7 million shares. During the first quarter, we utilized $214 million in excess cash to buy back 5.4 million shares. We currently have $1.1 billion of authorization remaining.  Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.43, up 43% over last year. 
Moving onto cash flow. Our cash flow from operating activities was $265 million versus $67 million last year. Our 5 major variances between the years that together make up the almost $200 million increase in cash flow from operating activities. They are one, the higher net income; two, last year we made a pension contribution of $225 million in the quarter; three, tax payments in the reduction in deferred taxes together for approximately $246 million unfavorable to last year, this is a result primarily from the big increase in profitability in 2011 and result in higher extension payments; four, inventory net of merchandise payables with $118 million favorable this year versus last year; and fifth, the reduction in prepaid expenses was due to the use of the Lord & Taylor proceeds, which we had put in escrow at year end to purchase 2 key parcels of our flagship location in Union Square in San Francisco. The leases on these 2 parcels, which face Street based and Union Square itself, were close to expiring, and we felt that controlling them was critical. As a result, our capital budget will go up by approximately $100 million, but the expected cash flow should not go down. This is purchase was funded through the escrow fund as well as proceeds from the sales of closed stores.
That purchase explains why CapEx in the quarter was so much higher than the year-ago. Largely due to this, the cash flow from investing activities was $138 million unfavorable to last year. The cash flow from operating activities net of investing activity is still $60 million over last year. During the first quarter, we repaid $795 million of debt and utilized $214 million of excess cash to repurchase the 5.4 million shares. And at the end of the quarter, we have $1.9 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which is $739 million more than we did at the end of the first quarter a year ago.
So all in all, it was another great quarter. We demonstrated again the sustainability of our good results, as well as the earnings and cash flow potential that flows from strong sales performance. 
As to our outlook for the rest of the year, we are staying with our earlier guidance of approximately 3.5% comp store sales growth for the remainder of the year or 3.7% for the full year when you include the first quarter's actual sales results. As a result, our annual earnings guidance also remains at the 3.25 to 3.30. We feel great about the quarter. But remember, it is only the first quarter. 
Also as previously mentioned, CapEx is now expected to be approximately $950 million, although next year it will return to this $900 million level that we had previously discussed for 2013 and beyond. For the second quarter in specific, we're assuming sales growth to be consistent with the 3.5% guidance, with May expected to be a little higher and June and July a little lower due to the shift of Mother's Day. Gross margin rate in the quarter is expected to be flattish even with the pressure from higher net delivery expense. SG&A is expected to increase more in the second quarter relative to last year than it did in the first quarter. This is primarily because the credit profitability is only expected to be up slightly versus last year, unlike in the first quarter. Remember that we are year-rounding big increases in credit profitability last year, in the second quarter, and even more so in the third quarter. In fact, in the third quarter, product profitability is expected to be lower than last year by approximately $40 million to $45 million. Again, for the year as a whole, we are still expecting a $15 million to $20 million increase in credit profitability.
We feel great about our performance and the outlook for the company. As Terry said in the press release, ""We are as excited about the future as we have been about the significant progress we've made over the past few years."" We continue to see such potential to increase sales and profitability from our 3 key strategies: One, My Macy's, we continue to offers so many ongoing opportunities to better tailor our assortments to local needs. Two, omnichannel. This is really changing the face of retail, providing us with so many interesting ways to better satisfy customer demand. And three, MAGIC Selling, which is allowing us to increasingly differentiate ourselves amongst our direct competitors. Having sales associates with stronger selling skills and product knowledge, combined with managers who are learning to be better coaches, is clearly paying off. Our team is working together in unprecedented ways, and we are investing in growing the business strategically. I've heard so many sports analogies in our meetings lately, talking about our progress. Whether these analogies come from rowing, soccer, baseball, football, fris and basketball. but regardless of the sport, the key is that we are winning, and we are all committed to continuing to build on our strong performance. And with that, I'll open the call up for your questions."

And so as you know, we're spending a lot of time rethinking how we get that product selected to the stores, how fast we can accelerate our whole process to take out the inventory and find the fashion. As you know, we also launched for a 3 last year as a way of using the private brand market to help us well. And as I said earlier, that's doing very well. Again, that's geared towards the older impulse customer. The first priority is product. But we are also reviewing all of our marketing to make sure we're reaching this customer through the appropriate way. Obviously, digital and the whole social space is a big part of that. And we're also reviewing a lot of the store environment, trying to make it more friendly to that customer given the research we've done on his and her needs. The reason I think the Junior's business or the younger millennial business is doing less well is in part the market overall, perhaps competition, but also I think we just needed to sort of reload that strategy and start over. So I think a year from now we are going to feel a whole lot better about the Junior business, but it may take a while to redo that."

A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.
Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today, due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K.
The team at Macy's continues to produce great results in the first quarter. We are very proud of our performance and the consistency in our results. The strategic investments we are making are working, and we continue to find new strategies to grow. We achieved a comp store sales increase of 4.4% in the first quarter, well above our expectation at the start of the year. Our operating income grew 18% above last year and 80 basis points as a percent of sales. And our earnings per share grew 43%.
I will take you through some of those details behind these numbers and give our current view of the second quarter and the rest of the year. And then I'll open the call for your questions.
Sales of $6.1 billion in the quarter continue to be strong in both of our brands, at Macy's and at Bloomingdale's; and also, in-store, as well as online. We are seeing more and more opportunity to satisfy demand from customers when they're in the store with inventory that comes from other locations and from our direct-to-customer distribution centers.
We are also beginning to be able to satisfy online demand with store inventory when the distribution center runs out of a particular item. It is really very exciting to watch. We now have over 80 stores equipped to fulfill orders from other stores or from online demand. And by the holiday season, we'll have over 290 store fulfillment locations.
We think the sales potential from this omnichannel approach is enormous. In addition, over time, it should enable us to also improve the productivity of our inventory, as well as our store square footage. We have barely scratched the surface here, and we are very optimistic about the possibilities.
Our strong sales performance in the quarter was also very broad-based in terms of merchandise categories. Sales continue to be strong in Men's, Center Core, meaning categories like watches, jewelry, handbags, cosmetics, shoes, et cetera, and also in home. The feminine apparel business was stronger in February/March than in April, but we are feeling better about these categories, particularly the classic parts of the business.
We saw strength during the quarter in what we call the impulse apparel area, which is geared at the older millennial customer, women aged roughly 22 to 30. Although the junior business, which is aimed at the younger millennial customer, continued to be weak.
Private brands continue to perform well throughout the store, providing newness, exclusivity and value. Amongst our strongest private brands have been Hotel, Charter Club and Bar III, which, as you'll recall, just launched last year. Our new Ideology brand, which is geared to the active customer, was recently launched and is doing very well.
Geographically, sales were also strong across the country, although the southern markets in general continued to outperform, including markets in Florida, Texas and Hawaii. But it is important to note that we also saw strength in markets not in the south like Cleveland, Ohio, Columbus and Long Island. This demonstrates to us the power of My Macy's. We are working hard to figure out how best to tailor our offering locally, and the results are paying off market-by-market.
Average unit retail in the quarter was up 8%, with units down about 4%. Gross margin in the quarter was 38.8% or 30 basis points below last year. Merchandise margin was flattish with last year. We have year-rounded on the impact of free shipping, but the growth of the omnichannel business continued to put some pressure on gross margin in the quarter. But keep in mind, that's great news. The more business we can do, omnichannel and on macy's and bloomingdales.com, the better for the bottom line. And in fact, you saw that with the increase in the EBIT rate, which we'll talk about in a minute.
Inventory at the end of the quarter was up 6%, driven by an increase in in-transit merchandise. Inventory net of payables, which adjusts for the in-transit, was up 3%, below expected sales to the second quarter.
Expense in the quarter was $1,995,000,000 or 32.4% of sales. This is 1.1% above last year in dollars but 110 basis points lower than last year as a percent of sales. Relative to last year, credit was the biggest factor favorably impacting expense, with a $43 million benefit this year versus last. As we explained at the start of this year, we expect credit profitability to increase by $15 million to $20 million for the full year and that it would vary greatly by quarter. I'll talk more about this later, but the first quarter was consistent with the higher end of our annual guidance.
We also benefited in the quarter from $12 million in lower depreciation and amortization expense. Offsetting some of the favorable variances relative to last year was higher expense related to our investments in our Internet and omnichannel businesses, higher selling expense due to the higher sales, $16 million in higher pension expense and the year-rounding on last year's $12 million gains on the sale of our share of The Knot.
Operating income in the quarter was $391 million, 18% above last year. And as a percent of sales, operating income was 6.4%, up 80 basis points over a year ago.
Interest expense in the quarter was $112 million, slightly below last year. Book tax expense was $98 million or 35% of pretax income. This was below the annual expected tax rate of roughly 37% due to settlements during the quarter. These settlements were expected to occur sometime during 2012, and therefore, our expectations for the annual effective tax rate has not changed.
Net income in the quarter was $181 million, and the average share count on a diluted basis was 423.7 million shares. During the first quarter, we utilized $214 million in excess cash to buy back 5.4 million shares. We currently have $1.1 billion of authorization remaining. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.43, up 43% over last year.
Moving onto cash flow. Our cash flow from operating activities was $265 million versus $67 million last year. There are 5 major variances between the years that together make up the almost $200 million increase in cash flow from operating activities. They are, one, the higher net income; two, last year we made a pension contribution of $225 million in the quarter; three, tax payments and the reduction in deferred taxes together were approximately $246 million unfavorable to last year. This is a result primarily from the big increase in profitability in 2011 and result in higher extension payments. Four, inventory net of merchandise payables was $118 million favorable this year versus last year; and fifth, the reduction in prepaid expenses was due to the use of the Lord & Taylor proceeds, which we had put in escrow at year end to purchase 2 key parcels of our flagship location on Union Square in San Francisco. The leases on these 2 parcels, which face Geary Street and Union Square itself, were close to expiring, and we felt that controlling them was critical. As a result, our capital budget will go up by approximately $100 million, but the expected cash flow should not go down since this purchase was funded through the escrow fund, as well as proceeds from the sales of closed stores.
That purchase explains why CapEx in the quarter was so much higher than a year ago. Largely due to this, the cash flow from investing activities was $138 million unfavorable to last year. But cash flow from operating activities net of investing activity was still $60 million over last year.
During the first quarter, we repaid $795 million of debt and utilized $214 million of excess cash to repurchase the 5.4 million shares. And at the end of the quarter, we have $1.9 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which is $739 million more than we did at the end of the first quarter a year ago.
So all in all, it was another great quarter. We demonstrated again the sustainability of our good results, as well as the earnings and cash flow potential that flows from strong sales performance.
As to our outlook for the rest of the year, we are staying with our earlier guidance of approximately 3.5% comp store sales growth for the remainder of the year, or 3.7% for the full year when you include the first quarter's actual sales results. As a result, our annual earnings guidance also remains at the $3.25 to $3.30. We feel great about the quarter. But remember, it is only the first quarter.
Also, as previously mentioned, CapEx is now expected to be approximately $950 million, although next year, it will return to this $900 million level that we had previously discussed for 2013 and beyond. For the second quarter in specific, we're assuming sales growth to be consistent with the 3.5% guidance, with May expected to be a little higher and June and July a little lower due to the shift of Mother's Day.
The gross margin rate in the quarter is expected to be flattish even with the pressure from higher net delivery expense. SG&A is expected to increase more in the second quarter relative to last year than it did in the first quarter. This is primarily because the credit profitability is only expected to be up slightly versus last year, unlike in the first quarter. Remember that we are year-rounding big increases in credit profitability last year, in the second quarter, and even more so in the third quarter. In fact, in the third quarter, credit profitability is expected to be lower than last year by approximately $40 million to $45 million. But again, for the year as a whole, we're still expecting a $15 million to $20 million increase in credit profitability.
We feel great about our performance and the outlook for the company. As Terry said in the press release, ""We are as excited about the future as we have been about the significant progress we've made over the past few years."" We continue to see such potential to increase sales and profitability from our 3 key strategies: One, My Macy's, which continues to offer so many ongoing opportunities to better tailor our assortments to local needs; two, omnichannel. This is really changing the face of retail, providing us with so many interesting ways to better satisfy customer demand; and three, MAGIC Selling, which is allowing us to increasingly differentiate ourselves amongst our direct competitors.
Having sales associates with stronger selling skills and product knowledge combined with managers who are learning to be better coaches is clearly paying off. Our team is working together in unprecedented ways, and we are investing in growing the business strategically.
I've heard so many sports analogies in our meetings lately, talking about our progress, whether these analogies come from rowing, soccer, baseball, football, or even basketball. But regardless of the sport, the key is that we are winning, and we are all committed to continuing to build on our strong performance.
And with that, I'll open the call up for your questions."

A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.
Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K.
The team at Macy's continued to produce great results in the first quarter. We are very proud of our performance and the consistency in our results. The strategic investments we are making are working, and we continue to find new strategies to grow. We achieved a comp store sales increase of 4.4% in the first quarter, well above our expectation at the start of the year. Our operating income grew 18% above last year and 80 basis points as a percent of sales. And our earnings per share grew 43%.
I will take you through some of the details behind these numbers and give our current view of the second quarter and the rest of the year. And then I'll open the call for your questions.
Sales of $6.1 billion in the quarter continued to be strong in both of our brands, at Macy's and at Bloomingdale's and also in-store, as well as online. We are seeing more and more opportunity to satisfy demand from customers when they're in the store with inventory that comes from other locations and from our direct-to-customer distribution centers.
We are also beginning to be able to satisfy online demand with store inventory when the distribution center runs out of a particular item. It is really very exciting to watch. We now have over 80 stores equipped to fulfill orders from other stores or from online demand and by the holiday season, we'll have over 290 store fulfillment locations.
We think the sales potential from this omnichannel approach is enormous. In addition, over time, it should enable us to also improve the productivity of our inventory, as well as our store square footage. We have barely scratched the surface here, and we are very optimistic about the possibilities.
Our strong sales performance in the quarter was also very broad-based in terms of merchandise categories. Sales continued to be strong in Men's, Center Core, meaning categories like watches, jewelry, handbags, cosmetics, shoes, et cetera, and also in home. The feminine apparel business was stronger in February/March than in April, but we are feeling better about these categories, particularly the classic parts of the business.
We saw strength during the quarter in what we call the impulse apparel area, which is geared at the older millennial customer, women aged roughly 22 to 30, although the junior business, which is aimed at the younger millennial customer, continued to be weak.
Private brands continue to perform well throughout the store, providing newness, exclusivity and value. Amongst our strongest private brands have been Hotel, Charter Club and Bar III which, as you'll recall, just launched last year. Our new Ideology brand, which is geared to the active customer, was recently launched and is doing very well.
Geographically, sales were also strong across the country, although the southern markets in general continued to outperform, including markets in Florida, Texas and Hawaii. But it is important to note that we also saw strength in markets not in the south like Cleveland, Ohio, Columbus and Long Island. This demonstrates to us the power of My Macy's. We are working hard to figure out how best to tailor our offering locally, and the results are paying off market-by-market.
Average unit retail in the quarter was up 8%, with units down about 4%. Gross margin in the quarter was 38.8% or 30 basis points below last year. Merchandise margin was flattish with last year. We have year-rounded on the impact of free shipping, but the growth of the omnichannel business continued to put some pressure on gross margin in the quarter. But keep in mind, that's great news. The more business we can do, omnichannel and on macy's and bloomingdales.com, the better for the bottom line. And in fact, you saw that with the increase in the EBIT rate, which we'll talk about in a minute.
Inventory at the end of the quarter was up 6%, driven by an increase in in-transit merchandise. Inventory net of payables, which adjusts for the in-transit, was up 3%, below expected sales to the second quarter.
Expense in the quarter was $1,995,000,000 or 32.4% of sales. This is 1.1% above last year in dollars, but 110 basis points lower than last year as a percent of sales. Relative to last year, credit was the biggest factor favorably impacting expense, with a $43 million benefit this year versus last. As we explained at the start of this year, we expect credit profitability to increase by $15 million to $20 million for the full year and that it would vary greatly by quarter. I'll talk more about this later, but the first quarter was consistent with the higher end of our annual guidance.
We also benefited in the quarter from $12 million in lower depreciation and amortization expense. Offsetting some of the favorable variances relative to last year was higher expense related to our investments in our Internet and omnichannel businesses, higher selling expense due to the higher sales, $16 million in higher pension expense and the year-rounding on last year's $12 million gains on the sale of our share of The Knot.
Operating income in the quarter was $391 million, 18% above last year. And as a percent of sales, operating income was 6.4%, up 80 basis points over a year ago.
Interest expense in the quarter was $112 million, slightly below last year. Book tax expense was $98 million or 35% of pretax income. This was below the annual expected tax rate of roughly 37% due to settlements during the quarter. These settlements were expected to occur sometime during 2012 and therefore, our expectations for the annual effective tax rate has not changed.
Net income in the quarter was $181 million, and the average share count on a diluted basis was 423.7 million shares. During the first quarter, we utilized $214 million in excess cash to buy back 5.4 million shares. We currently have $1.1 billion of authorization remaining. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.43, up 43% over last year.
Moving on to cash flow. Our cash flow from operating activities was $265 million versus $67 million last year. There are 5 major variances between the years that together make up the almost $200 million increase in cash flow from operating activities. They are one, the higher net income; two, last year we made a pension contribution of $225 million in the quarter; three, tax payments and the reduction in deferred taxes together were approximately $246 million unfavorable to last year. This is a result primarily from the big increase in profitability in 2011 and resultant higher extension payments. Four, inventory net of merchandise payables was $118 million favorable this year versus last year; and fifth, the reduction in prepaid expenses was due to the use of the Lord & Taylor proceeds which we had put in escrow at year end to purchase 2 key parcels of our flagship location on Union Square in San Francisco. The leases on these 2 parcels, which face Geary Street and Union Square itself, were close to expiring and we felt that controlling them was critical. As a result, our capital budget will go up by approximately $100 million, but the expected cash flow should not go down since this purchase was funded through the escrow fund, as well as proceeds from the sales of closed stores.
That purchase explains why CapEx in the quarter was so much higher than a year ago. Largely due to this, the cash flow from investing activities was $138 million unfavorable to last year. But cash flow from operating activities net of investing activity was still $60 million over last year.
During the first quarter, we repaid $795 million of debt and utilized $214 million of excess cash to repurchase the 5.4 million shares. And at the end of the quarter, we had $1.9 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which is $739 million more than we did at the end of the first quarter a year ago.
So all in all, it was another great quarter. We demonstrated again the sustainability of our good results, as well as the earnings and cash flow potential that flows from strong sales performance.
As to our outlook for the rest of the year, we are staying with our earlier guidance of approximately 3.5% comp store sales growth for the remainder of the year, or 3.7% for the full year when you include the first quarter's actual sales results. As a result, our annual earnings guidance also remains at the $3.25 to $3.30. We feel great about the quarter. But remember, it is only the first quarter.
Also as previously mentioned, CapEx is now expected to be approximately $950 million, although next year it will return to this $900 million level that we had previously discussed for 2013 and beyond. For the second quarter in specific, we're assuming sales growth to be consistent with the 3.5% guidance, with May expected to be a little higher and June and July a little lower due to the shift of Mother's Day.
The gross margin rate in the quarter is expected to be flattish, even with the pressure from higher net delivery expense. SG&A is expected to increase more in the second quarter relative to last year than it did in the first quarter. This is primarily because the credit profitability is only expected to be up slightly versus last year, unlike in the first quarter. Remember that we are year-rounding big increases in credit profitability last year in the second quarter, and even more so in the third quarter. In fact, in the third quarter, credit profitability is expected to be lower than last year by approximately $40 million to $45 million. But again, for the year as a whole, we're still expecting a $15 million to $20 million increase in credit profitability.
We feel great about our performance and the outlook for the company. As Terry said in the press release, ""We are as excited about the future as we have been about the significant progress we've made over the past few years."" We continue to see such potential to increase sales and profitability from our 3 key strategies: One, My Macy's, which continues to offer so many ongoing opportunities to better tailor our assortments to local needs; two, omnichannel. This is really changing the face of retail, providing us with so many interesting ways to better satisfy customer demand; and three, MAGIC Selling, which is allowing us to increasingly differentiate ourselves amongst our direct competitors.
Having sales associates with stronger selling skills and product knowledge combined with managers who are learning to be better coaches is clearly paying off. Our team is working together in unprecedented ways, and we are investing in growing the business strategically.
I've heard so many sports analogies in our meetings lately talking about our progress, whether these analogies come from rowing, soccer, baseball, football, or even basketball. But regardless of the sport, the key is that we are winning, and we are all committed to continuing to build on our strong performance.
And with that, I'll open the call up for your questions."

But what we're going to start experimenting with is putting merchandise up on macys.com that you can buy that will be 100% fulfilled from the store, which I think is going to be hugely successful. When I talk about the store spacing more productive, that's, in many cases, taking advantage of an opportunity to perhaps take some inventory off the floor, use the direct warehouses and broaden the assortment that you're offering the customer on the store as opposed to using that space for inventory. There's lots of things we're thinking about category-by-category of how can we use the square footage better, where should we have inventory, how much inventory. It's really very, very exciting."

The piece that we haven't done yet and we're going to start to test hopefully this fall is for goods that macys.com never even bought but that are in the store. That's a little trickier, but I think there's huge demand that can come from that. So we would never have those goods in the D2C warehouses.

We are pleased with our second quarter results. While our sales trend was challenging in June, our business rebounded in July, and our profitability for the quarter was strong. As we head into the important back half of the year, we feel great about our merchandise and marketing strategies, our store execution and our increased omnichannel capability. We are positioned very well to continue to grow our market share while improving profitability. 
Our second quarter sales were $6.1 billion, up 3% over last year on the comp basis. While below the first quarter trend, the trend in the 2 quarters was almost identical on a 2-year basis. And for the spring season in total, our comp store sales were up 3.7%, slightly above our original guidance of 3.5%. 
Our sales in the second quarter were very strong and watches handbags, cosmetics, textile, furniture and mattresses. Men's in general had a tougher second quarter than first but was still very strong on a 2-year basis. Women's apparel was weaker overall in the second quarter, although we were happy to see some positive momentum in the juniors business. We hope this bodes well for our Millennial strategy. Geographically, our business in the second quarter was generally stronger in the salesman in the North, but in addition to southern markets like Florida, Hawaii and Houston, we saw good sales performance in non-Southern markets as well like Oregon, Cleveland and Colorado. 
As we had anticipated, Charles Square was a drag on our sales growth because of the disruptions from the remodeling work. Part of the new shoe floor is the expected to open up this weekend, with the entire shoe floor plus a few key areas of the main floor, including fine jewelry, to open in stages over the next 90 days. It really looks spectacular and it's going to do so much to take the store and a whole Macy's brand to a whole new level. Our team which includes our merchants, our store associates and our design and construction organization, is doing an absolutely fabulous job managing this very large and complicated project. 
Bloomingdale's had a tougher second quarter than first quarter, but as with Macy's, July was stronger than June. Both macys.com and bloomingdales.com had great quarters and we continue to be very excited about all the omnichannel initiatives. Through technology and the Internet, we have opportunities to accelerate our growth by linking all the various places and ways customers can shop today. This enables us to deepen our relationships with our customers which is key for building loyalty. 
Macy's currently have 280 stores fulfilling orders, either from other stores and or from macys.com. We will be a 290 stores by the end of the month, and that's where we will stay for the remainder of the year. This 292 though compares to just 23 locations at this time last year. 
We are also now utilizing the Fulfillment Logic which is directing our orders more intelligently. The logic is based primarily in filling orders from stores or warehouses with the lowest sell-through of a particular item, as well as the distance to the customer's home. 
Gross margin rate in the second quarter was 41.9%, up 10 basis points over last year. Our merchandise margin was up a bit more than that, but the impact of more delivery expense with the omnichannel growth, as you know, is negatively impacting our gross margin. We ended the quarter with inventory up 1.8%, although on a comp basis, it was up 3.6%. 
SG&A in the quarter was just over $2 billion, up 1.7% versus last year. As a percent of sales, SG&A was 32.8%, down 50 basis points versus last year. We benefited in the quarter from $60 million increased income from credit, $11 million in lower stock-based compensation costs and $11 million lower depreciation and amortization relative to a year ago. These positive variances were offset by $19 million higher pension expense as well as the continued investment in our Internet growth and omnichannel capabilities. 
Operating income in the quarter was $554 million, up 9.5% over last year and as a percent of sales, operating income increased 60 basis points. 
Interest expense in the quarter was $105 million and booked taxes were $170 million or approximately 30%. For the first half of the year, the tax rate was approximately 37% which is consistent with our annual guidance. 
Net income was $279 million, up 16% over last year. During the quarter, we utilized $374 million in excess cash to buy back 10.6 million shares. This resulted in an average diluted share count in the quarter of 470 million shares. Year-to-date, we've utilized $588 million to buy back approximately 16 million shares. 
EPS on a diluted basis in the second quarter was $0.67, up 22% over last year. Cash flow from operating, net of investing activities, was $245 million, which is $120 million lower than last year. On the positive side, we produced higher net income, lower inventory net of payables, and last year, we have made a pension contribution. Those positives though were more than offset by a $167 million higher CapEx, which was driven in large part by the purchase in the first quarter of the portion of our Union Square flagship store in San Francisco, as well as higher cash taxes due in part to our increased profitability. 
In the first half of the year, we also utilized close to $1.5 billion of our excess cash in large part to the stock buybacks that I already mentioned, $797 million for debt repayment and $165 million in dividend. At the end of the quarter, though, we still have $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalent, which is $109 million more than we did a year ago. 
As I said earlier, we feel very good about our performance over the past 6 months, and we are as ready as ever for the fall season. We are expecting comp sales to increase by about the same amount in the fall season as it did in the first half of the year, approximately 3.7%. Given the Christmas calendar which has 2 extra days relative to last year between Thanksgiving and Christmas, combined with our optimism and our fourth quarter strategies, we are assuming a higher comp increase in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. This guidance of 3.7% comp store sales for the full year hasn't changed since our last conference call in May. However, as you saw this morning, we did increase our earnings per share guidance for the year to $3.30 to $3.35. Part of that increase in guidance is due to stronger credit performance. And remember, they're consistent with prior years, our guidance includes any costs associated with the miscellaneous store closings that could happen at year end. Remember, these costs are primarily noncash. 
Now as you are modeling the third and the fourth quarter, please do remember 2 items in addition to our assumptions for the lower sales growth in the third quarter relative to the fourth. The first relates to credit. Remember that last year in the third quarter, we had a $108 million increase in credit income over 2010. This related to the true-up in the profit share formula. However, this year, we and we are anticipating credit income to be roughly $35 million to $40 million below last year in the third quarter. We do expect the credit income in the fourth quarter to exceed last year but for the fall season in total, we are expecting credit to be a drag. For the year end total, however, we expect credit income to exceed last year by more than a $15 million to $20 million increase that we had projected earlier in the year. 
The second factor to keep in mind is tax rate. Last year, you'll recall that our tax rate in the third quarter was 24% due to favorable tax settlement that happened -- occurred during the quarter. We do not expect to have settlements anywhere close to that magnitude this year in the third quarter. And keep in mind that our annual guidance for the effective tax rate remains at 37%. However, because of these factors, we believe we are likely to have a third quarter that is down relative to last year in earnings per share, but this is expected to be more than made up in the fourth quarter. We are expecting a flattish growth margin rate in the back half of the year, although with the growth in our omnichannel business and the free delivery, it may be down slightly. 
We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to decline in the fall. But in dollars, the percent increase is expected to be higher than it was in the spring. Part of this relates to credit which I just talked about, and part also relates to the 53rd week this year. 
We are expecting depreciation and amortization to be approximately $542 million this fall or $1,055,000,000 for the full year. We are still expecting CapEx of approximately $950 million this year. As noted by our assumed 3.7% comp sales and our increase in the earnings guidance, we are confident in our strategies and as importantly, in our team's ability to execute them. 
Clearly, we are not operating in an ideal macroeconomic environment. Issues like unemployment and housing prices continue to be in the minds of our customers. But we believe that Macy's and Bloomingdale's still have the opportunity to grow sales and earnings by listening closely to our customer and delivering exactly what they need when and where they need it. That is the underlying principle behind our core strategies. There are some things we cannot control, but many that we can; and that is where we are concentrating our energy and resources. So through the back half of this year, you will hear us talk about the fresh and unique merchandise we have to offer; the great value we are delivering to customers; the fun and creative marketing that will drive interest and traffic; the scale of our associates in engaging shoppers; and across general initiatives that will help us to grow sales and improve that turn in our inventories. These are the factors that give us confidence in our business, and that we believe will help us to continue to capture market share. As you know, we had terrific success in sales and earnings growth in both 2010 and 2011. We think we are on track for significant incremental improvement again in 2012 as well as in the years ahead. Thank you as always for your interest in Macy's. And now, what questions do you have?"

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K.
We are pleased with our second quarter results. While our sales trend was challenging in June, our business rebounded in July, and our profitability for the quarter was strong. As we head into the important back half of the year, we feel great about our merchandise and marketing strategy, our store execution and our increased omnichannel capability. We are positioned very well to continue to grow our market share while improving profitability.
Our second quarter sales were $6.1 billion, up 3% over last year on a comp basis. While below the first quarter trend, the trend in the 2 quarters was almost identical on a 2-year basis. And for the spring season in total, our comp store sales were up 3.7%, slightly above our original guidance of 3.5%. Our sales in the second quarter were very strong in watches, handbags, cosmetics, textile, furniture and mattresses. Men's in general had a tougher second quarter than first but was still very strong on a 2-year basis. Women's apparel was weaker overall in the second quarter, although we were happy to see some positive momentum in the juniors business. We hope this bodes well for our Millennial strategy.
Geographically, our business in the second quarter was generally stronger in the south than in the north. But in addition to southern markets like Florida, Hawaii and Houston, we saw good sales performance in non-southern markets as well, like Oregon, Cleveland and Colorado. 
As we had anticipated, Herald Square was a drag on our sales growth because of the disruption from the remodeling work. Part of the new shoe floor is expected to open up this weekend, with the entire shoe floor plus a few key areas of the main floor, including fine jewelry, to open in stages over the next 90 days. It really looks spectacular and it's going to do so much to take the store and the whole Macy's brand to a whole new level. Our team, which includes our merchants, our store associates and our design and construction organization, is doing an absolutely fabulous job managing this very large and complicated project. 
Bloomingdale's had a tougher second quarter than first quarter, but as with Macy's, July was stronger than June. Both macys.com and bloomingdales.com had great quarters, and we continue to be very excited about all the omnichannel initiatives. Through technology and the Internet, we have opportunities to accelerate our growth by linking all the various places and ways customers can shop today. This enables us to deepen our relationship with our customers, which is key for building loyalty. 
Macy's currently have 280 stores fulfilling orders, either from other stores and/or from macys.com. We will be at 290 stores by the end of the month, and that's where we will stay for the remainder of the year. This 292 though compares to just 23 locations at this time last year. 
We are also now utilizing the fulfillment logic, which is directing our orders more intelligently. The logic is based primarily in filling orders from stores or warehouses with the lowest sell-through of a particular item, as well as the distance to the customer's home. 
Gross margin rate in the second quarter was 41.9%, up 10 basis points over last year. Our merchandise margin was up a bit more than that, but the impact of more delivery expense with the omnichannel growth, as you know, is negatively impacting our gross margin. We ended the quarter with inventory up 1.8%, although on a comp basis, it was up 3.6%. 
SG&A in the quarter was just over $2 billion, up 1.7% versus last year. As a percent of sales, SG&A was 32.8%, down 50 basis points versus last year. We benefited in the quarter from $60 million increased income from credit, $11 million in lower stock-based compensation cost and $11 million lower depreciation and amortization relative to a year ago. These positive variances were offset by $19 million higher pension expense as well as the continued investment in our Internet growth and omnichannel capabilities. 
Operating income in the quarter was $554 million, up 9.5% over last year. And as a percent of sales, operating income increased 60 basis points. Interest expense in the quarter was $105 million, and book taxes were $170 million or approximately 30%. For the first half of the year, the tax rate was approximately 37%, which is consistent with our annual guidance. Net income was $279 million, up 16% over last year.
During the quarter, we utilized $374 million in excess cash to buy back 10.6 million shares. This resulted in an average diluted share count in the quarter of 470 million shares. Year-to-date, we've utilized $588 million to buy back approximately 16 million shares. 
EPS on a diluted basis in the second quarter was $0.67, up 22% over last year. Cash flow from operating, net of investing, activities, was $245 million, which is $120 million lower than last year. On the positive side, we produced higher net income, lower inventory net of payables and last year, we had made a pension contribution. Those positives though were more than offset by $167 million higher CapEx, which was driven in large part by the purchase in the first quarter of the portion of our Union Square flagship store in San Francisco, as well as higher cash taxes due in part to our increased profitability. 
In the first half of the year, we also utilized close to $1.5 billion of our excess cash in large part to the stock buybacks that I already mentioned, $797 million for debt repayment and $165 million in dividend. At the end of the quarter though, we still have $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalent, which is $109 million more than we did a year ago. 
As I said earlier, we feel very good about our performance over the past 6 months, and we are as ready as ever for the fall season. We are expecting comp sales to increase by about the same amount in the fall season as it did in the first half of the year, approximately 3.7%. Given the Christmas calendar, which has 2 extra days relative to last year between Thanksgiving and Christmas, combined with our optimism and our fourth quarter strategy, we are assuming a higher comp increase in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. This guidance of 3.7% comp store sales for the full year hasn't changed since our last conference call in May. However, as you saw this morning, we did increase our earnings per share guidance for the year to $3.30 to $3.35. Part of that increase in guidance is due to stronger credit performance. And remember that consistent with prior years, our guidance excludes any costs associated with the miscellaneous store closings that could happen at year end. Remember, these costs are primarily noncash.
Now as you are modeling the third and the fourth quarters, please do remember 2 items in addition to our assumptions for the lower sales growth in the third quarter relative to the fourth. The first relates to credit. Remember that last year in the third quarter, we had a $108 million increase in credit income over 2010. This related to the true-up in our profit share formula. However, this year, we are anticipating credit income to be roughly $35 million to $40 million below last year in the third quarter. We do expect the credit income in the fourth quarter to exceed last year. But for the fall season in total, we are expecting credit to be a drag. For the year end total, however, we expect credit income to exceed last year by more than the $15 million to $20 million increase that we had projected earlier in the year. The second factor to keep in mind is tax rate. Last year, you'll recall that our tax rate in the third quarter was 24% due to favorable tax settlement that happened -- occurred during the quarter. We do not expect to have settlement anywhere close to that magnitude this year in the third quarter. And keep in mind that our annual guidance for the effective tax rate remains at 37%. However, because of these factors, we believe we are likely to have a third quarter that is down relative to last year in earnings per share, but this is expected to be more than made up in the fourth quarter.
We are expecting a flattish growth margin rate in the back half of the year. Although with the growth in our omnichannel business and the free delivery, it may be down slightly. We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to decline in the fall. But in dollars, the percent increase is expected to be higher than it was in the spring. Part of this relates to credit, which I've just talked about, and part also relates to the 53rd week this year. We are expecting depreciation and amortization to be approximately $542 million this fall or $1,055,000,000 for the full year. We are still expecting CapEx of approximately $950 million this year.
As noted by our assumed 3.7% comp sales and our increase in the earnings guidance, we are confident in our strategy and, as importantly, in our team's ability to execute them. Clearly, we are not operating in an ideal macroeconomic environment. Issues like unemployment and housing prices continue to be on the minds of our customers. But we believe that Macy's and Bloomingdale's still have the opportunity to grow sales and earnings by listening closely to our customer and delivering exactly what they need, when and where they need it. That is the underlying principle behind our core strategy.
There are some things we cannot control but many that we can, and that is where we are concentrating our energy and resources. So through the back of this -- back half of this year, you will hear us talk about the fresh and unique merchandise we have to offer, the great value we are delivering to customers, the fun and creative marketing that will drive interest and traffic, the skill of our associates in engaging shoppers and the cross-channel initiatives that will help us to grow sales and improve the turn in our inventories. These are the factors that give us confidence in our business and that we believe will help us to continue to capture market share. As you know, we had terrific success in sales and earnings growth in both 2010 and 2011. We think we are on track for significant incremental improvement again in 2012 as well as in the years ahead.
Thank you as always for your interest in Macy's. And now, what questions do you have?"

We are pleased with our second quarter results. While our sales trend was challenging in June, our business rebounded in July, and our profitability for the quarter was strong. As we head into the important back half of the year, we feel great about our merchandise and marketing strategy, our store execution and our increased omnichannel capability. We are positioned very well to continue to grow our market share while improving profitability.
Our second quarter sales were $6.1 billion, up 3% over last year on a comp basis. While below the first quarter trend, the trend in the 2 quarters was almost identical on a 2-year basis. And for the spring season in total, our comp store sales were up 3.7%, slightly above our original guidance of 3.5%. Our sales in the second quarter were very strong in watches, handbags, cosmetics, textile, furniture and mattresses. Men's in general had a tougher second quarter than first but was still very strong on a 2-year basis. Women's apparel was weaker overall in the second quarter, although we were happy to see some positive momentum in the juniors business. We hope this bodes well for our Millennial strategy.
Geographically, our business in the second quarter was generally stronger in the south than in the north. But in addition to southern markets like Florida, Hawaii and Houston, we saw good sales performance in non-southern markets as well, like Oregon, Cleveland and Colorado. 
As we had anticipated, Herald Square was a drag on our sales growth because of the disruption from the remodeling work. Part of the new shoe floor is expected to open up this weekend, with the entire shoe floor plus a few key areas of the main floor, including fine jewelry, to open in stages over the next 90 days. It really looks spectacular and it's going to do so much to take the store and the whole Macy's brand to a whole new level. Our team, which includes our merchants, our store associates and our design and construction organization, is doing an absolutely fabulous job managing this very large and complicated project. 
Bloomingdale's had a tougher second quarter than first quarter, but as with Macy's, July was stronger than June. Both macys.com and bloomingdales.com had great quarters, and we continue to be very excited about all the omnichannel initiatives. Through technology and the Internet, we have opportunities to accelerate our growth by linking all the various places and ways customers can shop today. This enables us to deepen our relationship with our customers, which is key for building loyalty. 
Macy's currently have 280 stores fulfilling orders, either from other stores and/or from macys.com. We will be at 290 stores by the end of the month, and that's where we will stay for the remainder of the year. This 292 though compares to just 23 locations at this time last year. 
We are also now utilizing the fulfillment logic, which is directing our orders more intelligently. The logic is based primarily on filling orders from stores or warehouses with the lowest sell-through of a particular item, as well as the distance to the customer's home. 
Gross margin rate in the second quarter was 41.9%, up 10 basis points over last year. Our merchandise margin was up a bit more than that, but the impact of more delivery expense with the omnichannel growth, as you know, is negatively impacting our gross margin. We ended the quarter with inventory up 1.8%, although on a comp basis, it was up 3.6%. 
SG&A in the quarter was just over $2 billion, up 1.7% versus last year. As a percent of sales, SG&A was 32.8%, down 50 basis points versus last year. We benefited in the quarter from $16 million increased income from credit, $11 million in lower stock-based compensation cost and $11 million lower depreciation and amortization relative to a year ago. These positive variances were offset by $19 million higher pension expense as well as the continued investment in our Internet growth and omnichannel capabilities. 
Operating income in the quarter was $554 million, up 9.5% over last year. And as a percent of sales, operating income increased 60 basis points. Interest expense in the quarter was $105 million, and book taxes were $170 million or approximately 38%. For the first half of the year, the tax rate was approximately 37%, which is consistent with our annual guidance. Net income was $279 million, up 16% over last year.
During the quarter, we utilized $374 million in excess cash to buy back 10.6 million shares. This resulted in an average diluted share count in the quarter of 470 million shares. Year-to-date, we've utilized $588 million to buy back approximately 16 million shares. 
EPS on a diluted basis in the second quarter was $0.67, up 22% over last year. Cash flow from operating, net of investing activities, was $245 million, which is $120 million lower than last year. On the positive side, we produced higher net income, lower inventory net of payables and last year, we had made a pension contribution. Those positives though were more than offset by $167 million higher CapEx, which was driven in large part by the purchase in the first quarter of the portion of our Union Square flagship store in San Francisco, as well as higher cash taxes due in part to our increased profitability. 
In the first half of the year, we also utilized close to $1.5 billion of our excess cash in large part to the stock buybacks that I already mentioned, $797 million for debt repayment and $165 million in dividend. At the end of the quarter though, we still have $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalent, which is $109 million more than we did a year ago. 
As I said earlier, we feel very good about our performance over the past 6 months, and we are as ready as ever for the fall season. We are expecting comp sales to increase by about the same amount in the fall season as it did in the first half of the year, approximately 3.7%. Given the Christmas calendar, which has 2 extra days relative to last year between Thanksgiving and Christmas, combined with our optimism and our fourth quarter strategy, we are assuming a higher comp increase in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. This guidance of 3.7% comp store sales for the full year hasn't changed since our last conference call in May. However, as you saw this morning, we did increase our earnings per share guidance for the year to $3.30 to $3.35. Part of that increase in guidance is due to stronger credit performance. And remember that consistent with prior years, our guidance excludes any costs associated with the miscellaneous store closings that could happen at year end. Remember, these costs are primarily noncash.
Now as you are modeling the third and the fourth quarters, please do remember 2 items in addition to our assumptions for the lower sales growth in the third quarter relative to the fourth. The first relates to credit. Remember that last year in the third quarter, we had a $108 million increase in credit income over 2010. This related to the true-up in our profit share formula. However, this year, we are anticipating credit income to be roughly $35 million to $40 million below last year in the third quarter. We do expect the credit income in the fourth quarter to exceed last year. But for the fall season in total, we are expecting credit to be a drag. For the year end total, however, we expect credit income to exceed last year by more than the $15 million to $20 million increase that we had projected earlier in the year. The second factor to keep in mind is tax rate. Last year, you'll recall that our tax rate in the third quarter was 24% due to favorable tax settlement that happened to occurred during the quarter. We do not expect to have settlement anywhere close to that magnitude this year in the third quarter. And keep in mind that our annual guidance for the effective tax rate remains at 37%. However, because of these factors, we believe we are likely to have a third quarter that is down relative to last year in earnings per share, but this is expected to be more than made up in the fourth quarter.
We are expecting a flattish growth margin rate in the back half of the year. Although with the growth in our omnichannel business and the free delivery, it may be down slightly. We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to decline in the fall. But in dollars, the percent increase is expected to be higher than it was in the spring. Part of this relates to credit, which I've just talked about, and part also relates to the 53rd week this year. We are expecting depreciation and amortization to be approximately $542 million this fall or $1,055,000,000 for the full year. We are still expecting CapEx of approximately $950 million this year.
As noted by our assumed 3.7% comp sales and our increase in the earnings guidance, we are confident in our strategy and, as importantly, in our team's ability to execute them. Clearly, we are not operating in an ideal macroeconomic environment. Issues like unemployment and housing prices continue to be on the minds of our customers. But we believe that Macy's and Bloomingdale's still have the opportunity to grow sales and earnings by listening closely to our customer and delivering exactly what they need, when and where they need it. That is the underlying principle behind our core strategy.
There are some things we cannot control but many that we can, and that is where we are concentrating our energy and resources. So through the back of this -- back half of this year, you will hear us talk about the fresh and unique merchandise we have to offer, the great value we are delivering to customers, the fun and creative marketing that will drive interest and traffic, the skill of our associates in engaging shoppers and the cross-channel initiatives that will help us to grow sales and improve the turn in our inventories. These are the factors that give us confidence in our business and that we believe will help us to continue to capture market share. As you know, we had terrific success in sales and earnings growth in both 2010 and 2011. We think we are on track for significant incremental improvement again in 2012 as well as in the years ahead.
Thank you as always for your interest in Macy's. And now, what questions do you have?"

And in omnichannel, we've been talking about some of the changes in terms of getting -- making sure that a customer has availability of inventory across the company, whether she be shopping online or in-store.

Before beginning my commentary, I want to take just a moment to express our sympathy, empathy and gratitude to so many people whose lives were impacted by Hurricane Sandy. Our sincere sympathy goes to the families of the 100-plus people who died as a result of the storm and the countless others who were injured. Our hearts also go out to the millions of people who suffered significant property damage including those who lost homes, cars and many of their possessions, not to mention electricity, telephone and self-service as well as excess to transportation. I know that a number of people on this call were among them. 
And lastly, thanks to the Macy's and Bloomingdale's teams in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions who have shown such incredible resiliency in preparing our facilities for the storm, helping to get them up and running so quickly after the storm and for taking good care of our customers in the process, all while dealing with the disruptions in their own personal lives. Our associates did a phenomenal job getting our stores reopened. Our logistics team has been able to get merchandise delivered to our stores and to our customers with little delay. And our New York-based teams overcame numerous obstacles to get their jobs done. I have to express particular thanks to the finance organization that worked together in new ways to make sure that we could get the quarter closed on schedule. That said, let's move on to the business at hand. 
The third quarter was another good one for the company. Not only did our sales performance continue strong, but we were also able to significantly exceed our earnings expectations and beat last year's $0.32 per share by 12.5%. As you know, we had expected a down quarter, so we are very pleased with these results. As you will recall, we have spoken in each of our conference call for this year about the challenges of year rounding on last year's $108 million increase in credit income and the 24% tax rate in the third quarter. But we were able to more than offset these with a combination of better-than-expected sales, gross margin rate and SG&A. I'll discuss each of these factors as well as our cash flow and then I'll talk about our key planning assumptions for the fourth quarter. 
Sales in the third quarter were $6,075,000,000, up 3.8% over last year or 3.7% on a comp basis. We continued to see strength during the quarter in Center Core, men's and home categories with some encouraging trends in parts of women's apparel. Amongst the strongest performers were watches, handbags, fragrances, women's suits, men's shoes, men's tailored clothing, home textiles, luggage, mattresses and furniture. The weaker performers included juniors, tabletop and housewares. Within women's apparel, we saw trend improvement in the classic parts of our assortment. The cold weather categories experienced great sell-throughs in the quarter when the weather was cold, but we didn't see enough of that weather during the quarter. 
Geographically, the business trends were very similar across our Macy's regions, with the exception of our Houston-based south-central region, which had particularly strong quarter. 
Our macys.com business continued to be very strong. We are getting more and more traction from our omnichannel initiative, which are enabling us to utilize inventory in our direct-to-customer warehouses and in 292 store locations to satisfy customer demand, both online and also in stores. I have to say that it is getting harder and harder to define Internet versus store sales, given all the ways customers are now researching products as well as shopping and purchasing. But what is so great about our performance is that we're doing better than we anticipated, both in store and online. Each channel is driving sales in its own channel, as well as helping to drive sales in the other channel. 
Bloomingdale's performance in the third quarter was consistent with their recent trend. As with Macy's, Center Core, men's and parts of home showed the most strength. The women's apparel area was the toughest for Bloomingdale's. During the quarter, bloomingdales.com continued its very strong performance, and the outlet stores during the third quarter produced sales that were better than expected. 
During the third quarter, our average unit retail, or AUR, was up approximately 4.5%. As anticipated, it is moderating from the larger increases earlier in the year. And we expect that to continue to happen in the fourth quarter, but it is still quite healthy. Remember that AUR increases do not equate necessarily to price increases. AUR increases can result from mix changes, such as the mix between regular price and clearance selling, jackets versus tops and the higher price points versus lower. 
In the third quarter, our transaction count was up as well and our units per transaction continued to fall below last year. The gross margin rate in the quarter was 39.6%, up 20 basis points over last year. We were very pleased that we were able to more than offset the higher costs associated with free shipping with the higher merchandise margin. 
We ended the quarter with inventory up 0.7% and flat to last year on comp basis. This is lower than what you might have expected given our fourth quarter sales assumption. We planned inventory this way purposely because we wanted to enter the fourth quarter with lower stock levels than in the past, so that we would be able to flow in more newness for the holiday season. 
SG&A in the quarter was at $2,078,000,000, up 3% over last year. And as a percent of sales, SG&A was 20 basis points below last year. SG&A relative to last year benefited from $13 million in lower depreciation and amortization, but was negatively impacted by $23 million in lower credit income, $17 million in higher retirement expense and the continued investments in our omnichannel strategies. 
Relative to what we had expected, the biggest improvement but not the only improvement in SG&A was in credit income. Our credit penetration in the third quarter increased 20 basis points over last year, which is a positive change in trend from the spring season when our penetration was down 80 basis points. Losses continued to reflect improvement as well, and our delinquency is also in good shape. 
Operating income was $325 million in the quarter, up 12% over last year's $291 million. As a percent of sales, operating income was 5.4%, up 40 basis points over last year. 
Interest expense was $103 million in the quarter versus $108 million last year, and tax expense was $77 million as compared to $44 million last year. The tax rate this year was 35% as compared to the 24% last year. This can be attributed to several normal course state tax settlements that happened to fall into the third quarter of last year. 
Net income in the quarter was $145 million, and earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.36, up 12.5% over last year. Share count on a diluted basis was 407.9 million shares, down 5.5% as a result of our buyback program. Through the third quarter, we have bought back 26.3 million shares, utilizing $991 million in cash. We have $361 million remaining in our current authorization. 
Our year-to-date cash flow is strong as well, and we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash on our balance sheet. During the first 3 quarters of this year, we generated cash from operating activities less investing activities of $274 million, which is $119 million higher than last year. We've utilized this cash as well as cash on the balance sheet for a combination of our stock buyback, debt reduction and the increased dividend payout. This balanced approach is what you can expect from us, and our credit ratios were very strong at the end of the quarter and improved versus the year ago. 
So all in all, it was another great quarter for Macy's, and we are well positioned for the fourth quarter. Were it not for Hurricane Sandy, we would be even more optimistic about the fourth quarter than what you're hearing today. There are 4 key factors that are contributing to our confidence. 
One, our gift strategy is reaching a whole new level. Our merchants and our planners have learned from the experiences over the past 2 years and have been able to work with our vendor partners to make our offerings better than ever. Exclusivity and fashion content have been increased across all categories. Localized assortments as a result of My Macy's strategy has also enabled us to strengthen our gift offering. We believe that our marketing, both brand and promotional, is very powerful this year, and we're utilizing social media more than ever before to communicate our message. And our stores team is executing our gift strategies with greater precision. Our floors look terrific and our associates are better engaging with customers due to the ongoing MAGIC selling training and coaching. 
The second key factor is our omnichannel strategy, which as I mentioned a few minutes ago, is gaining traction. We currently have 292 Macy's stores in place to handle fulfillment of orders compared with only 23 stores at this time a year ago. And our dot-com and store organizations are far better aligned than in prior years on key merchandise and marketing initiatives, which will clearly help drive our business. 
The third factor relates to cold weather growth. And although the weather forecast remains to be seen, we believe we have a large cold weather opportunity. And as I mentioned earlier, the business has been encouraging when the weather has been cold, which bodes well for those categories for the fourth quarter. 
And the last factor but not the least relates to the calendar. This year's calendar is the most favorable fourth quarter we can have, with 32 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, 2 more than a year ago. However, as I just mentioned given the impact of Hurricane Sandy, this optimism at least for November is somewhat muted. We do anticipate that our November sales will be negatively impacted by the storm. But we still believe that the 4.2% comp increase for the quarter is achievable, and that 4.2% for the fourth quarter will result in a 4% comp increase for the fall season. 
As we think about the storm's impact, it's greater than just the lost sales from the closing of stores. Customers in the most directly impacted areas of Long Island and New Jersey have other priorities right now. Transportation issues are making it challenging for customers who do want to shop to get to the stores. And to some degree, the receipt of merchandise was interrupted. We are spending unplanned dollars to make sure that our stores recover and are staffed, so that we can both help customers and also get the new merchandise in selling floor as fast as we can. 
Additionally, in an attempt to help customers in the impacted areas, both Macy's and Bloomingdale's will be extending the duration of the promotional events just this week, and Macy's is adding a recovery coupon for customers who've experienced damage to their homes. We hope that these efforts will help us recover some of the lost sales. 
All of our best thinking has been incorporated into our guidance for the fourth quarter. With a strong third quarter, we are comfortable increasing our earnings guidance by $0.05 to $3.35 to $3.40 for the year, which translates to roughly $1.94 to $1.99 for the fourth quarter. This compares to $1.70 last year. That $1.70 excludes $54 million of income related to the sale of store leases to Lord and Taylor last year, partially offset by $29 million in store closing costs. The net of these 2 items is $25 million or $0.04 a share.  The guidance for the fourth quarter of this year assumes no costs associated with store closings because these decisions haven't yet been made. 
Here are a few additional detail to help you as you're thinking about and modeling the quarter. First, while we are expecting a comp store increase of roughly 4.2% in the fourth quarter, this increase is planned very differently by month, with November expected to have a much lower sales increase than the other 2 months of the quarter. This is due primarily to the calendar, but also to the impact of the hurricane. Also remember that this quarter has an extra week in January this year. So the spread between total sales growth and comp growth, which assumes the same number of weeks year-over-year in the comp guidance, the gap between total and comp will be a lot higher. We are expecting total sales in the quarter to be up approximately 7.2% or 3 points more than the comp guidance. 
Number two, we believe there will continue to be pressure on gross margin as a result of the free delivery. And so we are maintaining our guidance for flattish to down slightly gross margin rate for the fall season for the combination of the third and fourth quarters. 
Three, SG&A in the fourth quarter will continue to benefit from the strong credit results. We are estimating credit income for the fourth quarter to be approximately $25 million to $30 million higher than last year. This benefit versus last year will be offset in part by the higher retirement expense and also will be offset by the continued investment in our omnichannel strategy, and of course when you're looking at dollars, the impact of the 53rd week this year. 
Four, included in this guidance for the quarter is interest expense of approximately $112 million. Assuming we complete the debt tender that we launched last week, there will be additional interest expense associated with the premium paid. Its size will depend on the amount of bonds which are tendered. For example, if $500 million of the maturities for which we have tendered are redeemed, the pretax cost would be approximately $100 million. Remember though that future quarters will benefit by the lower interest expense as a result of this tender refinancing, and we will have locked in favorable interest rates while extending our maturities. Assuming the tender and the subsequent debt issue are completed, we will be more specific as to the impact. 
Five, the tax rate in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 37%, bringing the year's effective rate to approximately 37%, consistent with our guidance all year. 
Six, we still anticipate making a $150 million pension contribution in January, and our capital expenditures are still expected to be $950 million roughly this year. 
We are very proud of our team for the results that we have delivered since our My Macy's, One Macy's transformation. Our performance has been consistently strong in absolute terms and relative to our peer group. I note that this third quarter was our 11th consecutive quarter of increased sales and earnings at Macy’s, Inc. This speaks volumes about a, the strength of our strategies and visions; b, the rigor and determination in our execution on the front line; and c, our ability to continually improve the business, adding growth on top of growth. We have no intention of deviating from this path of growth. Hurricane Sandy was a terrible disaster and has affected our business in the short term. We are sensitive to the interruption it has caused to our customers and to our associates. But we, along with our communities, are bouncing back and look forward to a very good fourth quarter. 
Also before taking questions, I want to make sure that you saw in our release that beginning in fiscal 2013, we will no longer be reporting monthly sales. I have mixed feelings about this because it will make conversations with our investors much more challenging mid-quarter. But with so few companies reporting, it doesn't make sense to continue. We will look hard to continue the dialogue with you, but the discussions will have to be more about strategy and longer-term direction rather than the current business trends. And now, I'll open the call for your questions."

Before beginning my commentary, I want to take just a moment to express our sympathy, empathy and gratitude to so many people whose lives were impacted by Hurricane Sandy. Our sincere sympathy goes to the families of the 100-plus people who died as a result of the storm and the countless others who were injured. Our hearts also go out to the millions of people who suffered significant property damage, including those who lost homes, cars and many of their possessions, not to mention electricity, telephone and cell service as well as access to transportation. I know that a number of people on this call were among them.
And lastly, thanks to the Macy's and Bloomingdale's teams in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions who have shown such incredible resiliency in preparing our facilities for the storm, helping to get them up and running so quickly after the storm and for taking good care of our customers in the process, all while dealing with the disruptions in their own personal lives.
Our associates did a phenomenal job getting our stores reopened. Our logistics team has been able to get merchandise delivered to our stores and to our customers with little delay. And our New York-based teams overcame numerous obstacles to get their jobs done. I have to express particular thanks to the finance organization that worked together in new ways to make sure that we could get the quarter closed on schedule. That said, let's move on to the business at hand.
The third quarter was another good one for the company. Not only did our sales performance continued strong, but we were also able to significantly exceed our earnings expectations and beat last year's $0.32 per share by 12.5%. As you know, we had expected a down quarter, so we are very pleased with these results. As you will recall, we had spoken in each of our conference calls this year about the challenges of year-rounding on last year's $108 million increase in credit income and the 24% tax rate in the third quarter. But we were able to more than offset these with a combination of better-than-expected sales, gross margin rate and SG&A. I'll discuss each of these factors, as well as our cash flow, and then I'll talk about our key planning assumptions for the fourth quarter.
Sales in the third quarter were $6,075,000,000, up 3.8% over last year or 3.7% on a comp basis. We continued to see strength during the quarter in Center Core, men's and home categories with some encouraging trends in parts of women's apparel. Amongst the strongest performers were watches, handbags, fragrances, women's suits, men's shoes, men's tailored clothing, home textiles, luggage, mattresses and furniture. The weaker performers included juniors, tabletop and housewares. Within women's apparel, we saw trend improvement in the classic parts of our assortment. The cold weather categories experienced great sell-throughs in the quarter when the weather was cold, but we didn't see enough of that weather during the quarter.
Geographically, the business trends were very similar across our Macy's regions, with the exception of our Houston-based South-Central region, which had a particularly strong quarter.
Our macys.com business continued to be very strong. We are getting more and more traction from our omnichannel initiatives, which are enabling us to utilize inventory in our direct-to-customer warehouses and in 292 store locations to satisfy customer demand, both online and also in stores. I have to say that it is getting harder and harder to define Internet versus store sales, given all the ways customers are now researching products, as well as shopping and purchasing. But what is so great about our performance is that we're doing better than anticipated, both in store and online. Each channel is driving sales in its own channel, as well as helping to drive sales in the other channel.
Bloomingdale's performance in the third quarter was consistent with their recent trend. As with Macy's, Center Core, men's and parts of home showed the most strength. The women's apparel area was the toughest for Bloomingdale's. During the quarter, bloomingdales.com continued its very strong performance, and the outlet stores during the third quarter produced sales that were better than expected.
During the third quarter, our average unit retail, or AUR, was up approximately 4.5%. As anticipated, it is moderating for the larger increases earlier in the year. And we expect that to continue to happen in the fourth quarter, but it is still quite healthy. Remember that AUR increases do not equate necessarily to price increases. AUR increases can result from mix changes, such as the mix between regular price and clearance selling, jackets versus tops and higher price points versus lower.
In the third quarter, our transaction count was up as well, and our units per transaction continued to fall below last year. The gross margin rate in the quarter was 39.6%, up 20 basis points over last year. We were very pleased that we were able to more than offset the higher costs associated with free shipping with a higher merchandise margin.
We ended the quarter with inventory up 0.7% and flat to last year on a comp basis. This is lower than what you might have expected given our fourth quarter sales assumption. We planned inventory this way purposely because we wanted to enter the fourth quarter with lower stock levels than in the past so that we would be able to flow in more newness for the holiday season.
SG&A in the quarter was $2,078,000,000, up 3% over last year. And as a percent of sales, SG&A was 20 basis points below last year. SG&A relative to last year benefited from $13 million in lower depreciation and amortization, but was negatively impacted by $23 million in lower credit income, $17 million in higher retirement expense and the continued investments in our omnichannel strategies.
Relative to what we had expected, the biggest improvement, but not the only improvement in SG&A, was in credit income. Our credit penetration in the third quarter increased 20 basis points over last year, which is a positive change in trend from the spring season when our penetration was down 80 basis points. Losses continue to reflect improvement as well, and our delinquency is also in good shape.
Operating income was $325 million in the quarter, up 12% over last year's $291 million. As a percent of sales, operating income was 5.4%, up 40 basis points over last year.
Interest expense was $103 million in the quarter versus $108 million last year, and tax expense was $77 million as compared to $44 million last year. The tax rate this year was 35% as compared to the 24% last year. This can be attributed to several normal course state tax settlements that happened to fall into the third quarter of last year.
Net income in the quarter was $145 million; and earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.36, up 12.5% over last year. Share count on a diluted basis was 407.9 million shares, down 5.5% as a result of our buyback program. Through the third quarter, we have bought back 26.3 million shares, utilizing $991 million in cash. We have $361 million remaining in our current authorization.
Our year-to-date cash flow is strong as well, and we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash on our balance sheet. During the first 3 quarters of this year, we generated cash from operating activities less investing activities of $274 million, which is $119 million higher than last year. We've utilized this cash, as well as cash on the balance sheet, for a combination of our stock buyback, debt reduction and the increased dividend payout. This balanced approach is what you can expect from us, and our credit ratios were very strong at the end of the quarter and improved versus a year ago.
So all in all, it was another great quarter for Macy's, and we are well positioned for the fourth quarter. Were it not for Hurricane Sandy, we would be even more optimistic about the fourth quarter than what you're hearing today. There are 4 key factors that are contributing to our confidence.
One, our gift strategy is reaching a whole new level. Our merchants and our planners have learned from the experiences over the past 2 years and have been able to work with our vendor partners to make our offerings better than ever. Exclusivity and fashion content have been increased across all categories. Localizing the assortments as a result of our My Macy's strategy has also enabled us to strengthen our gift offering. We believe that our marketing, both brand and promotional, is very powerful this year; and we're utilizing social media more than ever before to communicate our message. And our storage team is executing our gift strategy with greater precision. Our floors look terrific, and our associates are better engaging with customers due to the ongoing MAGIC Selling training and coaching.
The second key factor is our omnichannel strategy, which as I mentioned a few minutes ago, is gaining traction. We currently have 292 Macy's stores in place to handle fulfillment of orders compared with only 23 stores at this time a year ago. And our dot-com and store organizations are far better aligned than in prior years on key merchandise and marketing initiatives, which will clearly help drive our business.
The third factor relates to cold weather growth. And although the weather forecast remains to be seen, we believe we have a large cold weather opportunity. And as I mentioned earlier, the business has been encouraging when the weather has been cold, which bodes well for those categories for the fourth quarter.
And the last factor, but not the least, relates to the calendar. This year's calendar is the most favorable fourth quarter we can have, with 32 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, 2 more than a year ago. However, as I just mentioned, given the impact of Hurricane Sandy, this optimism, at least for November, is somewhat muted. We do anticipate that our November sales will be negatively impacted by the storm. But we still believe that the 4.2% comp increase for the quarter is achievable, and that 4.2% for the fourth quarter will result in a 4% comp increase for the fall season.
As we think about the storm's impact, it's greater than just the lost sales from the closing of stores. Customers in the most directly impacted areas of Long Island and New Jersey have other priorities right now. Transportation issues are making it challenging for customers who do want to shop to get to the stores. And to some degree, the receipt of merchandise was interrupted. We are spending unplanned dollars to make sure that our stores recover and are staffed, so that we can both help customers and also get the new merchandise to the selling floor as fast as we can.
Additionally, in an attempt to help customers in the impacted areas, both Macy's and Bloomingdale's will be extending the duration of promotional events just this week, and Macy's is adding a recovery coupon for customers who've experienced damage to their homes. We hope that these efforts will help us recover some of the lost sales.
All of our best thinking has been incorporated into our guidance for the fourth quarter. With the strong third quarter, we are comfortable increasing our earnings guidance by $0.05 to $3.35 to $3.40 for the year, which translates to roughly $1.94 to $1.99 for the fourth quarter. This compares to $1.70 last year. That $1.70 excludes $54 million of income related to the sale of store leases to Lord & Taylor last year, partially offset by $29 million in store closing costs. The net of these 2 items is $25 million or $0.04 a share. The guidance for the fourth quarter of this year assumes no costs associated with store closings because these decisions haven't yet been made.
Here are a few additional detail to help you as you're thinking about in modeling the quarter. First, while we are expecting a comp store increase of roughly 4.2% in the fourth quarter, this increase is planned very differently by month, with November expected to have a much lower sales increase than the other 2 months of the quarter. This is due primarily to the calendar but also to the impact of the hurricane. Also remember that this quarter has an extra week in January this year. So the spread between total sales growth and comp growth, which assumes the same number of weeks year-over-year in the comp guidance, the gap between total and comp will be a lot higher. We are expecting total sales in the quarter to be up approximately 7.2% or 3 points more than the comp guidance.
Number two, we believe there will continue to be pressure on gross margin as a result of the free delivery. And so we are maintaining our guidance of flattish to down slightly gross margin rate for the fall season or the combination of the third and fourth quarters.
Three, SG&A in the fourth quarter will continue to benefit from the strong credit results. We are estimating credit income for the fourth quarter to be approximately $25 million to $30 million higher than last year. This benefit versus last year will be offset in part by the higher retirement expense and also will be offset by the continued investment in our omnichannel strategy, and of course, when you're looking at dollars, the impact of the 53rd week this year.
Four, included in this guidance for the quarter is interest expense of approximately $112 million. Assuming we complete the debt tender that we launched last week, there will be additional interest expense associated with the premium pay. Its size will depend on the amount of bonds which are tendered. For example, if $500 million of the maturities for which we have tendered are redeemed, the pretax cost would be approximately $100 million. Remember, though, that future quarters will benefit by the lower interest expense as a result of this tender refinancing, and we will have locked in favorable interest rates while extending our maturities. Assuming the tender and the subsequent debt issue are completed, we will be more specific as to the impact.
Five, the tax rate in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 37%, bringing the year's effective rate to approximately 37%, consistent with our guidance all year.
Six, we still anticipate making a $150 million pension contribution in January, and our capital expenditures are still expected to be $950 million roughly this year.
We are very proud of our team for the results that we have delivered since our My Macy's, One Macy's transformation. Our performance has been consistently strong in absolute terms and relative to our peer group. I note that this third quarter was our 11th consecutive quarter of increased sales and earnings at Macy’s, Inc. This speaks volumes about a, the strength of our strategies and vision; b, the rigor and determination in our execution on the front line; and c, our ability to continually improve the business, adding growth on top of growth. We have no intention of deviating from this path of growth.
Hurricane Sandy was a terrible disaster and has affected our business in the short term. We are sensitive to the interruption it has caused to our customers and to our associates. But we, along with our communities, are bouncing back and look forward to a very good fourth quarter.
Also, before taking questions, I want to make sure you saw in our release that beginning in fiscal 2013, we will no longer be reporting monthly sales. I have mixed feelings about this because it will make conversations with our investors much more challenging mid-quarter. But with so few companies reporting, it doesn't make sense to continue. We will look hard to continue the dialogue with you, but the discussions will have to be more about strategy and longer-term direction rather than current business trends.
And now, I'll open the call for your questions."

Before beginning my commentary, I want to take just a moment to express our sympathy, empathy and gratitude to so many people whose lives were impacted by Hurricane Sandy. Our sincere sympathy goes to the families of the 100-plus people who died as a result of the storm and the countless others who were injured. Our hearts also go out to the millions of people who suffered significant property damage, including those who lost homes, cars and many of their possessions, not to mention electricity, telephone and cell service as well as access to transportation. I know that a number of people on this call were among them.
And lastly, thanks to the Macy's and Bloomingdale's teams in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions who have shown such incredible resiliency in preparing our facilities for the storm, helping to get them up and running so quickly after the storm and for taking good care of our customers in the process, all while dealing with the disruptions in their own personal lives.
Our associates did a phenomenal job getting our stores reopened. Our logistics team has been able to get merchandise delivered to our stores and to our customers with little delay. And our New York-based teams overcame numerous obstacles to get their jobs done. I have to express particular thanks to the finance organization that worked together in new ways to make sure that we could get the quarter closed on schedule. That said, let's move on to the business at hand.
The third quarter was another good one for the company. Not only did our sales performance continue strong, but we were also able to significantly exceed our earnings expectations and beat last year's $0.32 per share by 12.5%. As you know, we had expected a down quarter, so we are very pleased with these results. As you will recall, we had spoken in each of our conference calls this year about the challenges of year-rounding on last year's $108 million increase in credit income and the 24% tax rate in the third quarter. But we were able to more than offset these with a combination of better-than-expected sales, gross margin rate and SG&A. I'll discuss each of these factors, as well as our cash flow, and then I'll talk about our key planning assumptions for the fourth quarter.
Sales in the third quarter were $6,075,000,000, up 3.8% over last year or 3.7% on a comp basis. We continued to see strength during the quarter in Center Core, men's and home categories with some encouraging trends in parts of women's apparel. Amongst the strongest performers were watches, handbags, fragrances, women's suits, men's shoes, men's tailored clothing, home textiles, luggage, mattresses and furniture. The weaker performers included juniors, tabletop and housewares. Within women's apparel, we saw trend improvement in the classic parts of our assortment. The cold weather categories experienced great sell-throughs in the quarter when the weather was cold, but we didn't see enough of that weather during the quarter.
Geographically, the business trends were very similar across our Macy's regions, with the exception of our Houston-based South-Central region, which had a particularly strong quarter.
Our macys.com business continued to be very strong. We are getting more and more traction from our omnichannel initiatives, which are enabling us to utilize inventory in our direct-to-customer warehouses and in 292 store locations to satisfy customer demand, both online and also in stores. I have to say that it is getting harder and harder to define Internet versus store sales, given all the ways customers are now researching products, as well as shopping and purchasing. But what is so great about our performance is that we're doing better than anticipated, both in store and online. Each channel is driving sales in its own channel, as well as helping to drive sales in the other channel.
Bloomingdale's performance in the third quarter was consistent with their recent trend. As with Macy's, Center Core, men's and parts of home showed the most strength. The women's apparel area was the toughest for Bloomingdale's. During the quarter, bloomingdales.com continued its very strong performance, and the outlet stores during the third quarter produced sales that were better than expected.
During the third quarter, our average unit retail, or AUR, was up approximately 4.5%. As anticipated, it is moderating from the larger increases earlier in the year. And we expect that to continue to happen in the fourth quarter, but it is still quite healthy. Remember that AUR increases do not equate necessarily to price increases. AUR increases can result from mix changes, such as the mix between regular price and clearance selling, jackets versus tops and higher price points versus lower.
In the third quarter, our transaction count was up as well, and our unit per transaction continued to fall below last year. The gross margin rate in the quarter was 39.6%, up 20 basis points over last year. We were very pleased that we were able to more than offset the higher costs associated with free shipping with a higher merchandise margin.
We ended the quarter with inventory up 0.7% and flat to last year on a comp basis. This is lower than what you might have expected given our fourth quarter sales assumption. We planned inventory this way purposely because we wanted to enter the fourth quarter with lower stock levels than in the past so that we would be able to flow in more newness for the holiday season.
SG&A in the quarter was $2,078,000,000, up 3% over last year. And as a percent to sales, SG&A was 20 basis points below last year. SG&A relative to last year benefited from $13 million in lower depreciation and amortization, but was negatively impacted by $23 million in lower credit income, $17 million in higher retirement expense and the continued investments in our omnichannel strategies.
Relative to what we had expected, the biggest improvement, but not the only improvement in SG&A, was in credit income. Our credit penetration in the third quarter increased 20 basis points over last year, which is a positive change in trend from the spring season when our penetration was down 80 basis points. Losses continue to reflect improvement as well, and our delinquency is also in good shape.
Operating income was $325 million in the quarter, up 12% over last year's $291 million. As a percent to sales, operating income was 5.4%, up 40 basis points over last year.
Interest expense was $103 million in the quarter versus $108 million last year, and tax expense was $77 million as compared to $44 million last year. The tax rate this year was 35% as compared to the 24% last year. This can be attributed to several normal course state tax settlements that happened to fall into the third quarter of last year.
Net income in the quarter was $145 million; and earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.36, up 12.5% over last year. Share count on a diluted basis was 407.9 million shares, down 5.5% as a result of our buyback program. Through the third quarter, we have bought back 26.3 million shares, utilizing $991 million in cash. We have $361 million remaining in our current authorization.
Our year-to-date cash flow is strong as well, and we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash on our balance sheet. During the first 3 quarters of this year, we generated cash from operating activities less investing activities of $274 million, which is $119 million higher than last year. We've utilized this cash, as well as cash on the balance sheet, for a combination of our stock buyback, debt reduction and the increased dividend payout. This balanced approach is what you can expect from us, and our credit ratios were very strong at the end of the quarter and improved versus a year ago.
So all in all, it was another great quarter for Macy's, and we are well positioned for the fourth quarter. Were it not for Hurricane Sandy, we would be even more optimistic about the fourth quarter than what you're hearing today. There are 4 key factors that are contributing to our confidence.
One, our gift strategy is reaching a whole new level. Our merchants and our planners have learned from the experiences over the past 2 years and have been able to work with our vendor partners to make our offerings better than ever. Exclusivity and fashion content have been increased across all categories. Localizing the assortments as a result of our My Macy's strategy has also enabled us to strengthen our gift offering. We believe that our marketing, both brand and promotional, is very powerful this year; and we're utilizing social media more than ever before to communicate our message. And our stores team is executing our gift strategy with greater precision. Our floors look terrific, and our associates are better engaging with customers due to the ongoing MAGIC Selling training and coaching.
The second key factor is our omnichannel strategy, which as I mentioned a few minutes ago, is gaining traction. We currently have 292 Macy's stores in place to handle fulfillment of orders compared with only 23 stores at this time a year ago. And our dot-com and store organizations are far better aligned than in prior years on key merchandise and marketing initiatives, which will clearly help drive our business.
The third factor relates to cold weather goods. And although the weather forecast remains to be seen, we believe we have a large cold weather opportunity. And as I mentioned earlier, the business has been encouraging when the weather has been cold, which bodes well for those categories for the fourth quarter.
And the last factor, but not the least, relates to the calendar. This year's calendar is the most favorable fourth quarter we can have, with 32 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, 2 more than a year ago. However, as I just mentioned, given the impact of Hurricane Sandy, this optimism, at least for November, is somewhat muted. We do anticipate that our November sales will be negatively impacted by the storm. But we still believe that the 4.2% comp increase for the quarter is achievable, and that 4.2% for the fourth quarter will result in a 4% comp increase for the fall season.
As we think about the storm's impact, it's greater than just the lost sales from the closing of stores. Customers in the most directly impacted areas of Long Island and New Jersey have other priorities right now. Transportation issues are making it challenging for customers who do want to shop to get to the stores. And to some degree, the receipt of merchandise was interrupted. We are spending unplanned dollars to make sure that our stores recover and are staffed, so that we can both help customers and also get the new merchandise to the selling floors as fast as we can.
Additionally, in an attempt to help customers in the impacted areas, both Macy's and Bloomingdale's will be extending the duration of promotional events just this week, and Macy's is adding a recovery coupon for customers who've experienced damage to their homes. We hope that these efforts will help us recover some of the lost sales.
All of our best thinking has been incorporated into our guidance for the fourth quarter. With the strong third quarter, we are comfortable increasing our earnings guidance by $0.05 to $3.35 to $3.40 for the year, which translates to roughly $1.94 to $1.99 for the fourth quarter. This compares to $1.70 last year. That $1.70 excludes $54 million of income related to the sale of store leases to Lord & Taylor last year, partially offset by $29 million in store closing costs. The net of these 2 items is $25 million or $0.04 a share. The guidance for the fourth quarter of this year assumes no costs associated with store closings because these decisions haven't yet been made.
Here are a few additional details to help you as you're thinking about and modeling the quarter. First, while we are expecting a comp store increase of roughly 4.2% in the fourth quarter, this increase is planned very differently by month, with November expected to have a much lower sales increase than the other 2 months of the quarter. This is due primarily to the calendar but also to the impact of the hurricane. Also remember that this quarter has an extra week in January this year. So the spread between total sales growth and comp growth, which assumes the same number of weeks year-over-year in the comp guidance, the gap between total and comp will be a lot higher. We are expecting total sales in the quarter to be up approximately 7.2% or 3 points more than the comp guidance.
Number two, we believe there will continue to be pressure on gross margin as a result of the free delivery. And so we are maintaining our guidance for flattish to down slightly gross margin rate for the fall season or the combination of the third and fourth quarters.
Three, SG&A in the fourth quarter will continue to benefit from the strong credit results. We are estimating credit income for the fourth quarter to be approximately $25 million to $30 million higher than last year. This benefit versus last year will be offset in part by the higher retirement expense and also will be offset by the continued investment in our omnichannel strategy, and of course, when you're looking at dollars, the impact of the 53rd week this year.
Four, included in this guidance for the quarter is interest expense of approximately $112 million. Assuming we complete the debt tender that we launched last week, there will be additional interest expense associated with the premium pay. Its size will depend on the amount of bonds which are tendered. For example, if $500 million of the maturities for which we have tendered are redeemed, the pretax cost would be approximately $100 million. Remember, though, that future quarters will benefit by the lower interest expense as a result of this tender refinancing, and we will have locked in favorable interest rates while extending our maturities. Assuming the tender and the subsequent debt issue are completed, we will be more specific as to the impact.
Five, the tax rate in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 37%, bringing the year's effective rate to approximately 37%, consistent with our guidance all year.
Six, we still anticipate making a $150 million pension contribution in January, and our capital expenditures are still expected to be $950 million roughly this year.
We are very proud of our team for the results that we have delivered since our My Macy's, One Macy's transformation. Our performance has been consistently strong in absolute terms and relative to our peer group. I note that this third quarter was our 11th consecutive quarter of increased sales and earnings at Macy’s, Inc. This speaks volumes about a, the strength of our strategies and vision; b, the rigor and determination in our execution on the front line; and c, our ability to continually improve the business, adding growth on top of growth. We have no intention of deviating from this path of growth.
Hurricane Sandy was a terrible disaster and has affected our business in the short term. We are sensitive to the interruption it has caused to our customers and to our associates. But we, along with our communities, are bouncing back and look forward to a very good fourth quarter.
Also, before taking questions, I want to make sure you saw in our release that beginning in fiscal 2013, we will no longer be reporting monthly sales. I have mixed feelings about this because it will make conversations with our investors much more challenging mid-quarter. But with so few companies reporting, it doesn't make sense to continue. We will work hard to continue the dialogue with you, but the discussions will have to be more about strategy and longer-term direction rather than current business trends.
And now, I'll open the call for your questions."

Before beginning my commentary, I want to take just a moment to express our sympathy, empathy and gratitude to so many people whose lives were impacted by Hurricane Sandy. Our sincere sympathy goes to the families of the 100-plus people who died as a result of the storm and the countless others who were injured. Our hearts also go out to the millions of people who suffered significant property damage, including those who lost homes, cars and many of their possessions, not to mention electricity, telephone and cell service as well as access to transportation. I know that a number of people on this call were among them.
And lastly, thanks to the Macy's and Bloomingdale's teams in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions who have shown such incredible resiliency in preparing our facilities for the storm, helping to get them up and running so quickly after the storm and for taking good care of our customers in the process, all while dealing with the disruptions in their own personal lives.
Our associates did a phenomenal job getting our stores reopened. Our logistics team has been able to get merchandise delivered to our stores and to our customers with little delay. And our New York-based teams overcame numerous obstacles to get their jobs done. I have to express particular thanks to the finance organization that worked together in new ways to make sure that we could get the quarter closed on schedule. That said, let's move on to the business at hand.
The third quarter was another good one for the company. Not only did our sales performance continue strong, but we were also able to significantly exceed our earnings expectations and beat last year's $0.32 per share by 12.5%. As you know, we had expected a down quarter, so we are very pleased with these results. As you will recall, we had spoken in each of our conference calls this year about the challenges of year-rounding on last year's $108 million increase in credit income and the 24% tax rate in the third quarter. But we were able to more than offset these with a combination of better-than-expected sales, gross margin rate and SG&A. I'll discuss each of these factors, as well as our cash flow, and then I'll talk about our key planning assumptions for the fourth quarter.
Sales in the third quarter were $6,075,000,000, up 3.8% over last year or 3.7% on a comp basis. We continued to see strength during the quarter in Center Core, men's and home categories with some encouraging trends in parts of women's apparel. Amongst the strongest performers were watches, handbags, fragrances, women's suits, men's shoes, men's tailored clothing, home textiles, luggage, mattresses and furniture. The weaker performers included juniors, tabletop and housewares. Within women's apparel, we saw trend improvement in the classic parts of our assortment. The cold weather categories experienced great sell-throughs in the quarter when the weather was cold, but we didn't see enough of that weather during the quarter.
Geographically, the business trends were very similar across our Macy's regions, with the exception of our Houston-based South-Central region, which had a particularly strong quarter.
Our macys.com business continued to be very strong. We are getting more and more traction from our omnichannel initiatives, which are enabling us to utilize inventory in our direct-to-customer warehouses and in 292 store locations to satisfy customer demand, both online and also in stores. I have to say that it is getting harder and harder to define Internet versus store sales, given all the ways customers are now researching products, as well as shopping and purchasing. But what is so great about our performance is that we're doing better than anticipated, both in store and online. Each channel is driving sales in its own channel, as well as helping to drive sales in the other channel.
Bloomingdale's performance in the third quarter was consistent with their recent trend. As with Macy's, Center Core, men's and parts of home showed the most strength. The women's apparel area was the toughest for Bloomingdale's. During the quarter, bloomingdales.com continued its very strong performance, and the outlet stores during the third quarter produced sales that were better than expected.
During the third quarter, our average unit retail, or AUR, was up approximately 4.5%. As anticipated, it is moderating from the larger increases earlier in the year. And we expect that to continue to happen in the fourth quarter, but it is still quite healthy. Remember that AUR increases do not equate necessarily to price increases. AUR increases can result from mix changes, such as the mix between regular price and clearance selling, jackets versus tops and higher price points versus lower.
In the third quarter, our transaction count was up as well, and our unit per transaction continued to fall below last year. The gross margin rate in the quarter was 39.6%, up 20 basis points over last year. We were very pleased that we were able to more than offset the higher costs associated with free shipping with a higher merchandise margin.
We ended the quarter with inventory up 0.7% and flat to last year on a comp basis. This is lower than what you might have expected given our fourth quarter sales assumption. We planned inventory this way purposely because we wanted to enter the fourth quarter with lower stock levels than in the past so that we would be able to flow in more newness for the holiday season.
SG&A in the quarter was $2,078,000,000, up 3% over last year. And as a percent to sales, SG&A was 20 basis points below last year. SG&A relative to last year benefited from $13 million in lower depreciation and amortization, but was negatively impacted by $23 million in lower credit income, $17 million in higher retirement expense and the continued investments in our omnichannel strategies.
Relative to what we had expected, the biggest improvement, but not the only improvement in SG&A, was in credit income. Our credit penetration in the third quarter increased 20 basis points over last year, which is a positive change in trend from the spring season when our penetration was down 80 basis points. Losses continue to reflect improvement as well, and our delinquency is also in good shape.
Operating income was $325 million in the quarter, up 12% over last year's $291 million. As a percent to sales, operating income was 5.4%, up 40 basis points over last year.
Interest expense was $103 million in the quarter versus $108 million last year, and tax expense was $77 million as compared to $44 million last year. The tax rate this year was 35% as compared to the 24% last year. This can be attributed to several normal course state tax settlements that happened to fall into the third quarter of last year.
Net income in the quarter was $145 million; and earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.36, up 12.5% over last year. Share count on a diluted basis was 407.9 million shares, down 5.5% as a result of our buyback program. Through the third quarter, we have bought back 26.3 million shares, utilizing $991 million in cash. We have $361 million remaining in our current authorization.
Our year-to-date cash flow is strong as well, and we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash on our balance sheet. During the first 3 quarters of this year, we generated cash from operating activities less investing activities of $274 million, which is $119 million higher than last year. We've utilized this cash, as well as cash on the balance sheet, for a combination of our stock buyback, debt reduction and the increased dividend payout. This balanced approach is what you can expect from us, and our credit ratios were very strong at the end of the quarter and improved versus a year ago.
So all in all, it was another great quarter for Macy's, and we are well positioned for the fourth quarter. Were it not for Hurricane Sandy, we would be even more optimistic about the fourth quarter than what you're hearing today. There are 4 key factors that are contributing to our confidence.
One, our gift strategy is reaching a whole new level. Our merchants and our planners have learned from the experiences over the past 2 years and have been able to work with our vendor partners to make our offerings better than ever. Exclusivity and fashion content have been increased across all categories. Localizing the assortments as a result of our My Macy's strategy has also enabled us to strengthen our gift offering. We believe that our marketing, both brand and promotional, is very powerful this year; and we're utilizing social media more than ever before to communicate our message. And our stores team is executing our gift strategy with greater precision. Our floors look terrific, and our associates are better engaging with customers due to the ongoing MAGIC Selling training and coaching.
The second key factor is our omnichannel strategy, which as I mentioned a few minutes ago, is gaining traction. We currently have 292 Macy's stores in place to handle fulfillment of orders compared with only 23 stores at this time a year ago. And our dot-com and store organizations are far better aligned than in prior years on key merchandise and marketing initiatives, which will clearly help drive our business.
The third factor relates to cold weather goods. And although the weather forecast remains to be seen, we believe we have a large cold weather opportunity. And as I mentioned earlier, the business has been encouraging when the weather has been cold, which bodes well for those categories for the fourth quarter.
And the last factor, but not the least, relates to the calendar. This year's calendar is the most favorable fourth quarter we can have, with 32 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, 2 more than a year ago. However, as I just mentioned, given the impact of Hurricane Sandy, this optimism, at least for November, is somewhat muted. We do anticipate that our November sales will be negatively impacted by the storm. But we still believe that the 4.2% comp increase for the quarter is achievable, and that 4.2% for the fourth quarter will result in a 4% comp increase for the fall season.
As we think about the storm's impact, it's greater than just the lost sales from the closing of stores. Customers in the most directly impacted areas of Long Island and New Jersey have other priorities right now. Transportation issues are making it challenging for customers who do want to shop to get to the stores. And to some degree, the receipt of merchandise was interrupted. We are spending unplanned dollars to make sure that our stores recover and are staffed, so that we can both help customers and also get the new merchandise to the selling floors as fast as we can.
Additionally, in an attempt to help customers in the impacted areas, both Macy's and Bloomingdale's will be extending the duration of promotional events just this week, and Macy's is adding a recovery coupon for customers who've experienced damage to their homes. We hope that these efforts will help us recover some of the lost sales.
All of our best thinking has been incorporated into our guidance for the fourth quarter. With the strong third quarter, we are comfortable increasing our earnings guidance by $0.05 to $3.35 to $3.40 for the year, which translates to roughly $1.94 to $1.99 for the fourth quarter. This compares to $1.70 last year. That $1.70 excludes $54 million of income related to the sale of store leases to Lord & Taylor last year, partially offset by $29 million in store closing costs. The net of these 2 items is $25 million or $0.04 a share. The guidance for the fourth quarter of this year assumes no costs associated with store closings because these decisions haven't yet been made.
Here are a few additional details to help you as you're thinking about and modeling the quarter. First, while we are expecting a comp store increase of roughly 4.2% in the fourth quarter, this increase is planned very differently by month, with November expected to have a much lower sales increase than the other 2 months of the quarter. This is due primarily to the calendar but also to the impact of the hurricane. Also remember that this quarter has an extra week in January this year. So the spread between total sales growth and comp growth, which assumes the same number of weeks year-over-year in the comp guidance, the gap between total and comp will be a lot higher. We are expecting total sales in the quarter to be up approximately 7.2% or 3 points more than the comp guidance.
Number two, we believe there will continue to be pressure on gross margin as a result of the free delivery. And so we are maintaining our guidance for flattish to down slightly gross margin rate for the fall season or the combination of the third and fourth quarters.
Three, SG&A in the fourth quarter will continue to benefit from the strong credit results. We are estimating credit income for the fourth quarter to be approximately $25 million to $30 million higher than last year. This benefit versus last year will be offset in part by the higher retirement expense and also will be offset by the continued investment in our omnichannel strategy, and of course, when you're looking at dollars, the impact of the 53rd week this year.
Four, included in this guidance for the quarter is interest expense of approximately $112 million. Assuming we complete the debt tender that we launched last week, there will be additional interest expense associated with the premium pay. Its size will depend on the amount of bonds which are tendered. For example, if $500 million of the maturities for which we have tendered are redeemed, the pretax cost would be approximately $100 million. Remember, though, that future quarters will benefit by the lower interest expense as a result of this tender refinancing, and we will have locked in favorable interest rates while extending our maturities. Assuming the tender and the subsequent debt issue are completed, we will be more specific as to the impact.
Five, the tax rate in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 37%, bringing the year's effective rate to approximately 37%, consistent with our guidance all year.
Six, we still anticipate making a $150 million pension contribution in January, and our capital expenditures are still expected to be $950 million roughly this year.
We are very proud of our team for the results that we have delivered since our My Macy's, One Macy's transformation. Our performance has been consistently strong in absolute terms and relative to our peer group. I note that this third quarter was our 11th consecutive quarter of increased sales and earnings at Macy’s, Inc. This speaks volumes about a, the strength of our strategies and vision; b, the rigor and determination in our execution on the front line; and c, our ability to continually improve the business, adding growth on top of growth. We have no intention of deviating from this path of growth.
Hurricane Sandy was a terrible disaster and has affected our business in the short term. We are sensitive to the interruption it has caused to our customers and to our associates. But we, along with our communities, are bouncing back and look forward to a very good fourth quarter.
Also, before taking questions, I want to make sure you saw in our release that beginning in fiscal 2013, we will no longer be reporting monthly sales. I have mixed feelings about this because it will make conversations with our investors much more challenging mid-quarter. But with so few companies reporting, it doesn't make sense to continue. We will work hard to continue the dialogue with you, but the discussions will have to be more about strategy and longer-term direction rather than current business trends.
And now, I'll open the call for your questions."
