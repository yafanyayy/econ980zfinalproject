269488,154198773,262648,"Ensco plc, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2012",2012-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Before Jay takes us through the financial results, I will discuss the benefits we were seeing from recent acquisition, fourth quarter and full year highlights and the state of our markets. Last February, we announced",1930,"Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Before Jay takes us through the financial results, I will discuss the benefits we were seeing from recent acquisition, fourth quarter and full year highlights and the state of our markets. Last February, we announced a major acquisition. Looking back a year later, we are realizing the benefits that we discussed with our shareholders. Our larger customer base, expanded geographic presence and wider range of enhanced rig capabilities are giving us a distinct advantage. We have the world's youngest ultra-deepwater fleet, the largest number of active premium jackups and a major presence in the most strategic offshore basins across 6 continents. In addition, we are realizing benefits from standardization within our fleet, especially the ENSCO 8500 Series semisubmersibles, Samsung DP3 drillships and Keppel FELS premium jackups. We believe that these will differentiate Ensco from other drillers in terms of uptime, which in turn will lead to more business and the highest scores in our industry for overall customer satisfaction. The integration of operations and systems is proceeding well, and we are on track to achieve our targeted synergies for 2012 and beyond. 
Turning now to the highlights since last quarter. ENSCO 120, our first ultrapremium jackup that will delivered next year, was contracted for $230,000 per day, plus mobilization for initial 500-day term in the Central North Sea. ENSCO 8505, which was recently delivered was contracted to Anadarko, Apache and Noble Energy for at least 2 years and will commence its term contract next quarter. ENSCO 8506, the last rig in the ENSCO 8500 Series was contracted to Anadarko at $530,000 per day for 2.5 years and will commence its term contract in the fourth quarter. Both of these 8500 Series contracts are for work in the U.S. gov, which is another positive sign that customers are confident in our ability to manage the permitting process.
We are also very gratified that these 2 contracts are repeat customers. These rigs and their crews have proven the benefits of standardization across the 8500 Series, which had 97% utilization in 2011. Performance like this continues to enhance Ensco's reputation for exceeding customers' expectations. 
As I mentioned last quarter, some of our newbuild drillships have experienced downtime on their initial wells that is outside our acceptable range, mostly due to OEM equipment issues that we are working to resolve with suppliers. We are systematically sharing lessons learned with the rest of the fleet to ensure that we do not experience repeat occurrences.
Given the measures we have taken and the benefits of standardization I mentioned earlier, we expect higher utilization for our deepwater segment in 2012. Since there has been a great deal of discussion in our sector about downtime, let me be clear. All of Ensco's active rigs, including the BOPs are certified to work in the market with are currently working. None of the current or upcoming shipyard stays [indiscernible] most recent fleet status report involve any recertification work and none of the OEM equipment issues we experienced in our newbuild rigs involve recertification work but rather were entirely related to new equipment being delivered to us that did not meet commissioning standards. 
Finally, in our most recent fleet status report, we provided an update on the status of ENSCO DS-6 that was recently delivered in South Korea. The rig is now in Singapore to load equipment and further terms of our interim agreement is undergoing customer requested and funded enhancements. The interim agreement with our customer states that our intention to sign a 5-year contract by April 1, and we will provide an update in our next fleet status report.
Moving on to our other segments. Our midwater rigs performed very well in the fourth quarter, and the jackup segment showed significant improvement in utilization, surpassing another 7 percentage points from last quarter to 90% for the legacy Ensco fleet as we expected due to our dedicated jackup crews around the world. Let me also commend our shipyard personnel who have successfully delivered our newbuild semis and drillships and currently are managing the construction of 5 additional rigs. We expect to promote and add hundreds of employees over the coming years, as our new rigs come out the shipyard and go to work around the world. 
Now let me discuss the markets. I will begin with deepwater. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, demand continues to improve, as evidenced by our multi-year agreements for ENSCO 8505 and 8506 that I mentioned earlier. Customers have become more confident in managing the permitting process and are building on inventory work that enables them to commit to long-term contracts. As we have anticipated, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico is now a catalyst for incremental demand, a new geological success along with favorable economics will perpetuate this trend. 
In Brazil, we expect demand for deepwater rigs to continue to grow as operators increase their requirements. Petrobras is planning to increase the number of exploration wells drilled in 2012 to over 65 versus the 47 drilled in 2011. And they have outstanding tenders for multiple rigs for 3- to 5-year term contracts. Other operators such a Shell, Aramco and Total have requirements as well. 
In addition, the industry is expecting a new license round to be launched soon, which will offer new offshore blocks for our exploration and generate further rig demand. 
The African deepwater market also continues to tighten with multiple operators looking for deepwater rigs in late 2012 to mid-2013 against an environment with little visible rig supply. Areas like Angola, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea continue to generate new drilling opportunities as do the new basins being discovered offshore East Africa. The African pre-salt basins offshore Anadarko, [indiscernible] Gabon are providing our clients a high-impact play that appears to be one of the most exciting new frontiers in our industry. 
Early results from the initial well drilled in the African pre-salt are encouraging and give the possible connectivity to the Brazil pre-salt. Ensco was well positioned with our presence in West Africa to take advantage of the expected growth in this region.
Deepwater activity continues to pick up in Asia with demand driven by requirements in Indonesia and Malaysia. More than 10 new fixtures have been set since October. Floater activity in the Mediterranean remains stronger driven by opportunities in Egypt, Cyprus and Israel and longer term potentially, Libya. Worldwide, there are several outstanding deepwater grades and tenders in process that indicate to us that the pace of contracting is likely to quicken, leaving to us like demand supply imbalance for both semis and drillships in 2012.
Moving to midwater, additions will remain challenged in 2012 for lower spec assets that can only drill in water depths below 2,000 feet. However, there are pockets of activity. In the fourth quarter 10 new fixtures were short-term programs were set in Asia and PEMEX may require 3 semis for work in a 1,000-foot water depths. 4 of Ensco's 6 midwater rigs are already contracted into 2013. 
Turning to the jackup markets. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the market, in general, continues to improve with bids and inquiries increasing, supply tightening and rig day rates moving up as units reprice. Operators are asking about longer terms, even 1 to 2 years in some cases. Most operators are focused on oil prospects given the low price of gas.
In Mexico, PEMEX announced positive modifications to their contracts and their intention to directly negotiate contracts for up to 10 jackups. In the North Sea, standard duty rigs in the southern U.K. and Danish sectors are currently fully utilized. We expect operators will extend any options they have and for many rigs new contracts already in place once the current contracts expire. With availability extremely limited in 2012, operators are planning for work programs in 2013. The market rates continue to improve with new market highs being reached as a rigs are repriced.
We already are receiving inquiries for work in the Central North Sea for 2013 and 2014, a target market for our 2 remaining newbuild rigs. The Mediterranean and jack markets is expected to remain a challenge with a surplus of 5 to 6 rigs. It seems that operators are currently focused on deeper waters, as mentioned in our floater report. We've already moved over our 2 jackups previously in this region to other markets. 
Despite the excess supply of jackups in the African, day rates are increasing, especially for higher-end rigs. Work programs tend to be short term and as many as 12 jackups may be available in the next 6 months. Long-term programs are available in Nigeria, Angola and possibly Gabon. 
In the Middle East, only a handful of marketed jackups are becoming available in 2012 and is likely that the regional will be close to 4 utilization in coming months. Saudi Aramco plans to increase their drilling rig count by 12%, as evidenced by the recent contract awards. 26 contracts were awarded and several more may be forthcoming. Most recent day rates fixtures indicate a significant strengthening for standard jackups. 
Elsewhere in the region, several rigs were extended and there is a likelihood that several tenders will be issued for workover, standard and high specification programs in Qatar and for standard work in the Egyptian Gulf of Suez. 
In the Asia-Pacific market, demand is set to increase in the Indian Ocean, Thailand, Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand. The majority are short-term programs, but with 56 known projects in 2012, the rig movement will help absorb the newbuild rigs that will be delivered in the second half of the year. 
Operators in the region have an increasing interest for high-spec units with started duty rigs remain the workhorse with their $20,000 to $30,000 per day discount. 
Customer demand is growing and there's limited near-term supply of new rigs, which is driving deepwater and jackup utilization, as well as day rates. Exploration and appraisal success, deepwater basins, rising energy demand and healthy commodity prices are all positive indicators for long-term growth. Clients are under pressure to efficiently replace production in the midst of increasing technical complexity and rising safety standards. Permit activity is improving in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Petrobras continues to contract due to their increasing geological success and clients are placing a greater value on newer, high-specification equipment.
In addition, customers more often are contracting rigs with designs that are part of a series that have performed well for them in the past. The jackup markets also have improved with increased utilization in most major markets, and newbuild rigs are being absorbed into the fleet. Clients are focused on hiring companies with proven operational experience, competent crews and successful safety and environmental track records. Having newer assets that are part of a series, which allowed us to leverage standardization in Ensco a distinct advantage. Our newbuild delivery schedule will perpetuate our advantage of having the newest ultra-deepwater fleet in the industry and puts us in a great position to meet incremental customer demand.
In closing, we remain focused on safety and operational execution. We are realizing the benefits of our acquisition, and we are well positioned to grow our company organically for the foreseeable future. Our teams across the world are doing a fantastic job, and the growth of our company will create many new clear opportunities for our employees, as well as significant benefits for customers and shareholders. Our employees have worked countless hours to get us where we are today, and I'm extremely proud of their accomplishments. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jay."
269488,154198773,262648,"Ensco plc, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2012",2012-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, Dan. Our comments today will cover highlights of our fourth quarter results, our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2012, and our financial position.Regarding fourth quarter results, let me start by saying that we have provided informat",1426,"Thanks, Dan. Our comments today will cover highlights of our fourth quarter results, our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2012, and our financial position.
Regarding fourth quarter results, let me start by saying that we have provided information on our earnings release that we issued yesterday after the market closed that should assist you in making certain year-to-year comparisons related to our recent acquisition. And therefore, my comments today will focus mainly on factors such as the growth of our fleet and rising utilization that influence comparisons between periods.
Now let's discuss our fourth quarter results versus prior year. Earnings from continuing operations were $0.99 per share, up from $0.90 a year ago. Fourth quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.99 compared to $0.93 last year. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.0 billion compared to $409 million a year ago. Approximately $481 million of the $593 million increase was related to our recent acquisitions. Deepwater revenues increased from $113 million to $514 million, driven primarily by the acquisition, as well as new ultra-deepwater rigs that were added to the fleet.
This increase in revenues is somewhat lower than previously expected, primarily due to OEM equipment issues on ENSCO DS-5, our newbuild drillships that Dan referred to earlier, as well as the delayed stat up for Ensco 7500, which has now commenced its new contract in Brazil. Revenues were $116 million all related to the acquisition. The average day rate was $229,000 per day and utilization was 82%. 
Jackup segment revenues increased by approximately 18%, primarily due to more operating days year-to-year. Jackup utilization in the fourth quarter was 82%, up from 75% a year ago. And as Dan indicated earlier, utilization was 90% for the legacy Ensco jackup fleet in the fourth quarter.  Average jackup day rates though were down $5,000 year-over-year to $97,000 per day as shown on our earnings release. 
Full contract drilling expense for all segments was $516 million, up from $186 million in fourth quarter 2010. Excluding $282 million from the effect of our recent acquisition, contract drilling expense increased $48 million or 26% year-to-year, mostly related to the addition of ENSCO 8503 and ENSCO 8504 to the fleet. 
Now let's discuss quarterly trends by comparison comparing fourth quarter 2011 sequentially to third quarter 2011. Fourth quarter revenue increased 9% to $1.0 billion. This increase is mostly attributable to a $73 million or 17% increase in deepwater segment revenues driven by an 8 percentage points increase in utilization to 80%, partially offset by a decline in the average day rate and a $19 million or 6% increase in jackup segment revenues, driven by a 5 percentage points increase in utilization to 82%, partially offset by a decline in the average day rate. Full contract drilling expense increased $38 million sequentially from the third quarter, mostly due to the increasing utilization. 
Looking at other expenses, depreciation increased $4 million with the addition of ENSCO 8504, which commenced its initial contract in September of 2011. D&A expense decreased $500,000. Effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17% versus our prior guidance of 15.6%. In the full year, the effective tax rate was approximately 18%, slightly higher than our projection of 17%. 
Now to discuss the first quarter outlook. Based in our current outlook, first quarter revenues are expected to increase approximately 8% from the fourth quarter. Deepwater segment revenue is projected to increase by approximately 15%, primarily due to commencement of ENSCO 7500's new contracts and increased utilization for ENSCO DS-5 versus fourth quarter. 
The midwater segment, comprising just 6 rigs in our fleet, will have lower utilization due to planned shipyard work for ENSCO 5002 in the first quarter of this year as noted in our fleet status report and ENSCO 5003 becoming available in early January.
The jackups, the average recorded day rate is projected to increase to more than $100,000 per day in the first quarter and utilization is projected to rise significantly to about 90%, up from 82% in the fourth quarter. 
Moving to expenses, we anticipate first quarter 2011 total contract drilling expense will be up approximately 7% from the fourth quarter. Depreciation expense should increased slightly to approximately $142 million. We anticipate G&A expense will decline to about $35 million in the first quarter, which in part reflects the synergies that we have described from the acquisition. Other expenses are anticipated to be approximately $30 million comprised of $36 million of interest expense, partially offset by $6 million of interest income.
Now let's move on to the outlook for full year 2012. The quarter revenues are estimated to increase approximately 99% year-to-year. ENSCO 8505 and ENSCO 8506 have been contracted with commencement date later this year and we have also signed an interim agreement for ENSCO DS-6. This interim agreement states that our intention is to sign a term contract that would, if signed, commence in fourth quarter 2012. In addition, Ensco 7500, which was undergoing shipyard upgrades last year is now operating in Brazil and ENSCO 8503 and 8504 that commenced operations last year will have a full year impact in 2012.
We expect deepwater segment utilization to be in the low-90% range in 2012, which includes the usual higher level of estimated downtime for new rigs coming out of the shipyard as a ramp up on their first drilling assignments. For our midwater segment, revenues are estimated to be approximately $390 million in 2012, which reflects shipyard work in 2012 for 2 rigs and limited contracting opportunities for Ensco 5003, which is the lease capable of our 6 midwater rigs. 
Turning now to jackups, on average, 2012 utilization is expected to increase from 77% in 2011 to the mid-80% range 2012.
With respect to contract drilling expense, we expect an increase of approximately 49% in 2012 due to several factors. Full year effect of the acquisition, rising deepwater in jackup segment utilization and a 9% increase in average unit labor cost for offshore employees to meet current market conditions. 
Depreciation is projected to increase approximately $600 million with the addition of our new ultra-deepwater rigs. G&A expenses is anticipated to be approximately $125 million, which reflects $50 million of synergies we have forecasted for 2012. 
Interest expense is estimated to be $135 million, net of approximately $95 million of interest that will be capitalized in 2012.
We expect interest income of $22 million for the year due to interest earned on certain long-term contracts for reimbursement of mobilization and capital upgrade costs. Effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 12.5% for full year 2012. 
Last year, in 2011, capital spending was lower than our previous outlook, mostly due to the delivery of ENSCO DS-6, moving slightly from late December to early January, which postponed one of our milestone payments to the shipyard. 2012 capital spending, which is subject to change throughout the year is forecasted to be $1.83 billion. This breakdown as follows: $1.2 billion is committed to new rig construction, which includes the final milestone payment for ENSCO DS-6; $380 million is for rig enhancements; and $250 million is for sustaining projects. Approximately $90 million of the shipyard capital spending is reimbursable by our customers.
We ended the year with $431 million of cash and a 31% leverage ratio. Backlog for the company's approximately $9.7 billion. 
Now let's turn to synergies. As we outlined in our last earnings call, for 2012, we expect total expense synergies to be approximately $100 million or about half related to G&A and half related to contract drilling expense, mostly from procurement an insurance as we leverage our increased scale. 
Anticipated full year run rate synergies for 2013 and beyond will be approximately $150 million comprised of $120 million of expense savings and $30 million of capital expenditures synergy. 
In terms of our financial position, this adding to the positive that Dan mentioned earlier regarding our recent acquisition, maintained our investment-grade ratings while improving the efficiency of our balance sheet and Ensco's overall cost of capital. Revenue backlog is now $9.7 billion, which gives us greater visibility of future cash flows. We have a newer fleet of high-quality assets that we believe will give us industry-leading utilization and day rates over time, and we have enhanced diversification across geographies, rig types and customers, which is both an offense and defensive advantage. 
Overall, As Dan noted, we are realizing the benefits of the acquisition, and we will continue to capitalize on our expanded capabilities for shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Sean."

Before Jay takes us to the financial results, I will discuss the benefits we are seeing from recent acquisition, fourth quarter and full year highlights and the state of our markets. Last February, we announced a ma",1937,"Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Before Jay takes us to the financial results, I will discuss the benefits we are seeing from recent acquisition, fourth quarter and full year highlights and the state of our markets. 
Last February, we announced a major acquisition. Looking back a year later, we are realizing the benefits that we discussed with our shareholders. Our larger customer base, expanded geographic presence and wider range of enhanced rig capabilities are giving us a distinct advantage. We have the world's youngest ultra-deepwater fleet, the largest number of active premium jackups and a major presence in the most strategic offshore basins across 6 continents. 
In addition, we are realizing benefits from standardization within our fleet, especially the ENSCO 8500 Series semisubmersibles, Samsung DP3 drillships and Keppel FELS premium jackups. We believe these advantages will differentiate Ensco from other drillers in terms of uptime, which, in turn, will lead to more business and the highest scores in our industry for overall customer satisfaction. The integration of operations and systems is proceeding well, and we are on track to achieve our targeted synergies for 2012 and beyond. 
Turning now to the highlights since last quarter. ENSCO 120, our first ultra-premium jackup that will be delivered next year, was contracted for $230,000 per day, plus mobilization for initial 500-day term in the Central North Sea. ENSCO 8505, which was recently delivered, was contracted to Anadarko, Apache and Noble Energy for at least 2 years and will commence its term contract next quarter. ENSCO 8506, the last rig in the ENSCO 8500 Series, was contracted to Anadarko at $530,000 per day for 2.5 years and will commence its term contract in the fourth quarter. Both of these 8500 Series contracts are for work in the U.S. Gulf, which is another positive sign that customers are confident in our ability to manage the permitting process.
We are also very gratified that these 2 contracts are with repeat customers. These rigs and their crews have proven the benefits of standardization across the 8500 Series, which had 97% utilization in 2011. Performance like this continues to enhance Ensco's reputation for exceeding customers' expectations. 
As I mentioned last quarter, some of our newbuild drillships have experienced downtime on their initial wells that is outside our acceptable range, mostly due to OEM equipment issues that we are working to resolve with suppliers. We are systematically sharing lessons learned with the rest of the fleet to ensure that we do not experience repeat occurrences. Given the measures we have taken and the benefits of standardization I mentioned earlier, we expect higher utilization for our deepwater segment in 2012. 
Since there has been a great deal of discussion in our sector about downtime, let me be clear. All of Ensco's active rigs, including their BOPs are certified to work in the markets where they are currently working. None of the current or upcoming shipyard stays noted on our most recent fleet status report involve any recertification work and none of the OEM equipment issues we experienced on our newbuild rigs involve recertification, work but rather were entirely related to a new equipment being delivered to us that did not meet commissioning standards. 
Finally, in our most recent fleet status report, we provided an update on the status of ENSCO DS-6 that was recently delivered in South Korea. The rig is now in Singapore to load equipment, and further terms of our interim agreement is undergoing customer-requested and funded enhancements. The interim agreement with our customer states our intention to sign a 5-year contract by April 1, and we will provide an update in our next fleet status report.
Moving on to our other segments. Our midwater rigs performed very well in the fourth quarter, and the jackup segment showed significant improvement in utilization, rising another 7 percentage points from last quarter to 90% for the legacy Ensco fleet as we expected due to our dedicated jackup crews around the world. 
Let me also commend our shipyard personnel who have successfully delivered our newbuild semis and drillships and currently, are managing the construction of 5 additional rigs. We expect to promote and add hundreds of employees over the coming years as our new rigs come out of the shipyard and go to work around the world. 
Now let me discuss the markets. I will begin with deepwater. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, demand continues to improve, as evidenced by our multi-year agreements for ENSCO 8505 and 8506 that I mentioned earlier. Customers have become more confident in managing the permitting process and are building on inventory work that enables them to commit to long-term contracts. As we have anticipated, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico is now a catalyst for incremental demand. A new geological success, along with favorable economics, will perpetuate this trend. 
In Brazil, we expect demand for deepwater rigs to continue to grow as operators increase their requirements. Petrobras is planning to increase the number of exploration wells drilled in 2012 to over 65 versus the 47 drilled in 2011. And they have outstanding tenders for multiple rigs for 3- to 5-year term contracts. Other operators such a Shell, Marinco and Total have requirements as well. 
In addition, the industry is expecting a new license round to be launched soon, which will offer new offshore blocks for exploration and generate further rig demand. 
The African deepwater market also continues to tighten, with multiple operators looking for deepwater rigs in late 2012 to mid-2013 against an environment with little visible rig supply. Areas like Angola, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea continue to generate new drilling opportunities as do the new basins being discovered offshore East Africa. The African pre-salt basins offshore Angola, Congo and Gabon are providing our clients a high-impact play that appears to be one of the most exciting new frontiers in our industry. 
Early results from the initial wells drilled in the African pre-salt are encouraging and give the possible connectivity to the Brazil pre-salt. Ensco is well positioned with our presence in West Africa to take advantage of the expected growth in this region.
Deepwater activity continues to pick up in Asia, with demand driven by requirements in Indonesia and Malaysia. More than 10 new fixtures have been set since October. Floater activity in the Mediterranean remains strong, driven by opportunities in Egypt, Cyprus and Israel and longer term, potentially, Libya. Worldwide, there are several outstanding deepwater bids and tenders in progress that indicate to us that the pace of contracting is likely to quicken, leading to slight demand, supply imbalance for both semis and drillships in 2012.
Moving to midwater, conditions will remain challenged in 2012 for lower spec assets that can only drill in water depths below 2,000 feet. However, there are pockets of activity. In the fourth quarter 10 new fixtures for short-term programs were set in Asia, and PEMEX may require 3 semis for work in a 1,000-foot water depths. 4 of Ensco's 6 midwater rigs are already contracted into 2013. 
Turning to the jackup markets. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the market, in general, continues to improve with bids and inquiries increasing, supply tightening and rig day rates moving up as units reprice. Operators are asking about longer terms, even 1 to 2 years in some cases. Most operators are focused on oil prospects given the low price of gas.
In Mexico, PEMEX announced positive modifications to their contracts and their intention to directly negotiate contracts for up to 10 jackups. In the North Sea, standard duty rigs in the southern U.K. and Danish sectors are currently fully utilized. We expect operators will extend any options they have  for many rigs new contracts already in place once the current contracts expire. With availability extremely limited in 2012, operators are planning for work programs in 2013. The market rates continue to improve with new market highs being reached as rigs are repriced.
We already are receiving inquiries for work in the Central North Sea for 2013 and 2014, a target market for our 2 remaining newbuild rigs. The Mediterranean and jack markets is expected to remain a challenge, with a surplus of 5 to 6 rigs. It seems operators are currently focused on deeper waters, as mentioned in our floater report. We have already moved our 2 jackups previously in this region to other markets. 
Despite the excess supply of jackups in the African markets, day rates are increasing, especially for higher-end rigs. Work programs tend to be short term and as many as 12 jackups may be available in the next 6 months. Long-term programs are available in Nigeria, Angola and possibly Gabon. 
In the Middle East, only a handful of marketed jackups are becoming available in 2012, and it's likely that the region will be closed to full utilization in coming months. Saudi Aramco plans to increase their drilling rig count by 12%, as evidenced by their recent contract awards. 26 contracts were awarded and several more may be forthcoming. Most recent day rates fixtures indicate a significant strengthening for standard jackups. 
Elsewhere in the region, several rigs were extended, and there is a likelihood that several tenders will be issued for workover, standard and high specification programs in Qatar and for standard work in the Egyptian Gulf of Suez. 
In the Asia Pacific market, demand is said to increase in the Indian Ocean, Thailand, Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand. The majority are short-term programs, but with 56 known projects in 2012, the rig movement will help absorb the newbuild rigs that will be delivered in the second half of the year. Operators in the region have an increasing interest for high-spec units, with standard duty rigs remain the workhorse with their $20,000 to $30,000 per day discount. 
Customer demand is growing, and there's limited near-term supply of new rigs, which is driving up deepwater and jackup utilization, as well as day rates. Exploration and appraisal success for deepwater basins, rising energy demand and healthy commodity prices are all positive indicators for long-term growth. 
Clients are under pressure to efficiently replace production in the midst of increasing technical complexity and rising safety standards. Permit activity is improving in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Petrobras continues to contract rigs due to their increasing geological success, and clients are placing a greater value on newer, high-specification equipment.
In addition, customers, more often, are contracting rigs with designs that are part of a series that have performed well for them in the past. The jackup markets also have improved with increased utilization in most major markets, and newbuild rigs are being absorbed into the fleet. Clients are focused on hiring companies with proven operational experience, competent crews and successful safety and environmental track records. 
Having newer assets that are part of a series, which allowed us to leverage standardization as Ensco is a distinct advantage. Our newbuild delivery schedule will perpetuate our advantage of having the newest ultra-deepwater fleet in the industry and puts us in a great position to meet incremental customer demand.
In closing, we remain focused on safety and operational execution. We are realizing the benefits of our acquisition, and we are well positioned to grow our company organically for the foreseeable future. Our teams across the world are doing a fantastic job, and the growth of our company will create many new clear opportunities for our employees, as well as significant benefits for customers and shareholders. Our employees have worked countless hours to get us where we are today, and I'm extremely proud of their accomplishments. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jay."
269488,154198773,262814,"Ensco plc, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2012",2012-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, Dan. Our comments today will cover highlights of our fourth quarter results, our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2012, and our financial position.Regarding fourth quarter results, let me start by saying that we have provided informat",1433,"Thanks, Dan. Our comments today will cover highlights of our fourth quarter results, our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2012, and our financial position.
Regarding fourth quarter results, let me start by saying that we have provided information on our earnings release, that we issued yesterday after the market closed, that should assist you in making certain year-to-year comparisons related to our recent acquisition. Therefore, my comments today will focus mainly on factors such as the growth of our fleet and rising utilization that influence comparisons between periods.
Now let's discuss our fourth quarter results versus prior year. Earnings from continuing operations were $0.99 per share, up from $0.90 a year ago. Fourth quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.99 compared to $0.93 last year. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.0 billion compared to $409 million a year ago. Approximately $481 million of the $593 million increase was related to our recent acquisitions. Deepwater revenues increased from $113 million to $514 million, driven primarily by the acquisition, as well as new ultra-deepwater rigs that were added to the fleet.
This increase in revenues is somewhat lower than previously expected, primarily due to OEM equipment issues on ENSCO DS-5, our newbuild drillships that Dan referred to earlier, as well as the delayed startup for Ensco 7500, which has now commenced its new contract in Brazil. Midwater revenues were $116 million, all related to the acquisition. The average day rate was $229,000 per day and utilization was 82%. 
Jackup segment revenues increased by approximately 18%, primarily due to more operating days year-to-year. Jackup utilization in the fourth quarter was 82%, up from 75% a year ago. And as Dan indicated earlier, utilization was 90% for the legacy Ensco jackup fleet in the fourth quarter.  Average jackup day rates, though, were down $5,000 year-over-year to $97,000 per day, as shown on our earnings release. 
Full contract drilling expense for all segments was $516 million, up from $186 million in fourth quarter 2010. Excluding $282 million from the effect of our recent acquisition, contract drilling expense increased $48 million or 26% year-to-year, mostly related to the addition of ENSCO 8503 and ENSCO 8504 to the fleet. 
Now let's discuss quarterly trends by comparing fourth quarter 2011 sequentially to third quarter 2011. Fourth quarter revenue increased 9% to $1.0 billion. This increase is mostly attributable to a $73 million or 17% increase in deepwater segment revenues, driven by an 8 percentage point increase in utilization to 80%, partially offset by a decline in the average day rate and a $19 million or 6% increase in jackup segment revenues, driven by a 5 percentage point increase in utilization to 82%, partially offset by a decline in the average day rate. Full contract drilling expense increased $38 million sequentially from the third quarter, mostly due to the increasing utilization. 
Looking at other expenses, depreciation increased $4 million with the addition of ENSCO 8504, which commenced its initial contract in September of 2011. D&A expense decreased $500,000. Effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17% versus our prior guidance of 15.6%. In the full year, the effective tax rate was approximately 18%, slightly higher than our last projection of 17%. 
Now let's discuss the first quarter outlook. Based on our current outlook, first quarter revenues are expected to increase approximately 8% from the fourth quarter. Deepwater segment revenue is projected to increase by approximately 15%, primarily due to commencement of ENSCO 7500's new contract and increased utilization for ENSCO DS-5 versus fourth quarter. 
The midwater segment, comprising just 6 rigs in our fleet, will have lower utilization due to planned shipyard work for ENSCO 5002 in the first quarter of this year, as noted in our fleet status report, and ENSCO 5003 becoming available in early January.
For jackups, the average reported day rate is projected to increase to more than $100,000 per day in the first quarter, and utilization is projected to rise significantly to about 90%, up from 82% in the fourth quarter. 
Moving to expenses. We anticipate first quarter 2011 total contract drilling expense will be up approximately 7% from the fourth quarter. Depreciation expense should increase slightly to approximately $142 million. We anticipate G&A expense will decline to about $35 million in the first quarter, which in part reflects the synergies that we have described from the acquisition. Other expense is anticipated to be approximately $30 million, comprised of $36 million of interest expense, partially offset by $6 million of interest income.
Now let's move on to the outlook for full year 2012. Deepwater revenues are estimated to increase approximately 99% year-to-year. ENSCO 8505 and ENSCO 8506 have been contracted with commencement dates later this year, and we have also signed an interim agreement for ENSCO DS-6. This interim agreement states that our intention is to sign a term contract that would, if signed, commence in fourth quarter 2012. In addition, Ensco 7500, which was undergoing shipyard upgrades last year, is now operating in Brazil and ENSCO 8503 and 8504, that commenced operations last year, will have a full year impact in 2012.
We expect deepwater segment utilization to be in the low-90% range in 2012, which includes the usual higher level of estimated downtime for new rigs coming out of the shipyard as they ramp up on their first drilling assignments. For our midwater segment, revenues are estimated to be approximately $390 million in 2012. This reflects shipyard work in 2012 for 2 rigs and limited contracting opportunities for Ensco 5003, which is the least capable of our 6 midwater rigs 
Turning now to jackups, on average, 2012 utilization is expected to increase from 77% in 2011 to the mid-80% range in 2012. With respect to contract drilling expense, we expect an increase of approximately 49% in 2012 due to several factors: a full year effect of the acquisition, rising deepwater and jackup segment utilization and a 9% increase in average unit labor cost for offshore employees to meet current market conditions. 
Depreciation is projected to increase to approximately $600 million, with the addition of our new ultra-deepwater rigs. G&A expense is anticipated to be approximately $125 million, which reflects $50 million of synergies we have forecasted for 2012. 
Interest expense is estimated to be $135 million, net of approximately $95 million of interest that would be capitalized in 2012. We expect interest income of $22 million for the year due to interest earned on certain long-term contracts for reimbursement of mobilization and capital upgrade costs. Our effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 12.5% for full year 2012. 
Last year, in 2011, capital spending was lower than our previous outlook, mostly due to the delivery of ENSCO DS-6 moving slightly from late December to early January, which postponed one of our milestone payments to the shipyard. 2012 capital spending, which is subject to change throughout the year, is forecasted to be $1.83 billion. This breaks down as follows: $1.2 billion is committed to new rig construction, which includes the final milestone payment for ENSCO DS-6; $380 million is for rig enhancements; and $250 million is for sustaining projects. 
Approximately $90 million of the shipyard capital spending is reimbursable by our customers.
We ended the year with $431 million of cash and a 31% leverage ratio. Total backlog for the company is approximately $9.7 billion. 
Now let's turn to synergies. As we outlined on our last earnings call, for 2012, we expect total expense synergies to be approximately $100 million, with about half related to G&A and half related to contract drilling expense, mostly from procurement and insurance as we leverage our increased scale. 
Anticipated full year run rate synergies for 2013 and beyond will be approximately $150 million, comprised of $120 million of expense savings and $30 million of capital expenditures synergy. 
In terms of our financial position, just adding to the positive that Dan mentioned earlier regarding our recent acquisition, we maintained our investment-grade ratings while improving the efficiency of our balance sheet and Ensco's overall cost of capital. Revenue backlog is now $9.7 billion, which gives us greater visibility of future cash flows. 
We have a newer fleet of high-quality assets that we believe will give us industry-leading utilization and day rates over time, and we have enhanced diversification across geographies, rig types and customers, which is both an offensive and defensive advantage. So overall, as Dan noted, we are realizing the benefits of the acquisition, and we will continue to capitalize on our expanded capabilities for shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Sean."

Before Jay takes us to the financial results, I will discuss the benefits we are seeing from recent acquisition, fourth quarter and full year highlights and the state of our markets. Last February, we announced a ma",1940,"Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Before Jay takes us to the financial results, I will discuss the benefits we are seeing from recent acquisition, fourth quarter and full year highlights and the state of our markets. 
Last February, we announced a major acquisition. Looking back a year later, we are realizing the benefits that we discussed with our shareholders. Our larger customer base, expanded geographic presence and wider range of enhanced rig capabilities are giving us a distinct advantage. We have the world's youngest ultra-deepwater fleet, the largest number of active premium jackups and a major presence in the most strategic offshore basins across 6 continents. 
In addition, we are realizing benefits from standardization within our fleet, especially the ENSCO 8500 Series semisubmersibles, Samsung DP3 drillships and Keppel FELS premium jackups. We believe these advantages will differentiate Ensco from other drillers in terms of uptime, which, in turn, will lead to more business and the highest scores in our industry for overall customer satisfaction. The integration of operations and systems is proceeding well, and we are on track to achieve our targeted synergies for 2012 and beyond. 
Turning now to the highlights since last quarter. ENSCO 120, our first ultra-premium jackup that will be delivered next year, was contracted for $230,000 per day, plus mobilization for initial 500-day term in the Central North Sea. ENSCO 8505, which was recently delivered, was contracted to Anadarko, Apache and Noble Energy for at least 2 years and will commence its term contract next quarter. ENSCO 8506, the last rig in the ENSCO 8500 Series, was contracted to Anadarko at $530,000 per day for 2.5 years and will commence its term contract in the fourth quarter. Both of these 8500 Series contracts are for work in the U.S. Gulf, which is another positive sign that customers are confident in our ability to manage the permitting process.
We are also very gratified that these 2 contracts are with repeat customers. These rigs and their crews have proven the benefits of standardization across the 8500 Series, which had 97% utilization in 2011. Performance like this continues to enhance Ensco's reputation for exceeding customers' expectations. 
As I mentioned last quarter, some of our newbuild drillships have experienced downtime on their initial wells that is outside our acceptable range, mostly due to OEM equipment issues that we are working to resolve with suppliers. We are systematically sharing lessons learned with the rest of the fleet to ensure that we do not experience repeat occurrences. Given the measures we have taken and the benefits of standardization I mentioned earlier, we expect higher utilization for our deepwater segment in 2012. 
Since there has been a great deal of discussion in our sector about downtime, let me be clear. All of Ensco's active rigs, including their BOPs are certified to work in the markets where they are currently working. None of the current or upcoming shipyard stays noted on our most recent fleet status report involve any recertification work and none of the OEM equipment issues we experienced on our newbuild rigs involve recertification work, but rather were entirely related to a new equipment being delivered to us that did not meet commissioning standards. 
Finally, in our most recent fleet status report, we provided an update on the status of ENSCO DS-6 that was recently delivered in South Korea. The rig is now in Singapore to load equipment, and per the terms of our interim agreement is undergoing customer-requested and funded enhancements. The interim agreement with our customer states our intention to sign a 5-year contract by April 1, and we will provide an update in our next fleet status report.
Moving on to our other segments. Our midwater rigs performed very well in the fourth quarter, and the jackup segment showed significant improvement in utilization, rising another 7 percentage points from last quarter to 90% for the legacy Ensco fleet as we expected due to our dedicated jackup crews around the world. 
Let me also commend our shipyard personnel who have successfully delivered our newbuild semis and drillships and currently, are managing the construction of 5 additional rigs. We expect to promote and add hundreds of employees over the coming years as our new rigs come out of the shipyard and go to work around the world. 
Now let me discuss the markets. I will begin with deepwater. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, demand continues to improve, as evidenced by our multi-year agreements for ENSCO 8505 and 8506 that I mentioned earlier. Customers have become more confident in managing the permitting process and are building on inventory work that enables them to commit to long-term contracts. As we have anticipated, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico is now a catalyst for incremental demand. A new geological success, along with favorable economics, will perpetuate this trend. 
In Brazil, we expect demand for deepwater rigs to continue to grow as operators increase their requirements. Petrobras is planning to increase the number of exploration wells drilled in 2012 to over 65 versus the 47 drilled in 2011. And they have outstanding tenders for multiple rigs for 3- to 5-year term contracts. Other operators such as Shell, Marinco and Total have requirements as well. 
In addition, the industry is expecting a new license round to be launched soon, which will offer new offshore blocks for exploration and generate further rig demand. 
The African deepwater market also continues to tighten, with multiple operators looking for deepwater rigs in late 2012 to mid-2013 against an environment with little visible rig supply. Areas like Angola, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea continue to generate new drilling opportunities as do the new basins being discovered offshore East Africa. The African pre-salt basins offshore Angola, Congo and Gabon are providing our clients a high-impact play that appears to be one of the most exciting new frontiers in our industry. 
Early results from the initial wells drilled in the African pre-salt are encouraging and give the possible connectivity to the Brazil pre-salt. Ensco is well positioned with our presence in West Africa to take advantage of the expected growth in this region.
Deepwater activity continues to pick up in Asia, with demand driven by requirements in Indonesia and Malaysia. More than 10 new fixtures have been set since October. Floater activity in the Mediterranean remains strong, driven by opportunities in Egypt, Cyprus and Israel and longer term, potentially, Libya. Worldwide, there are several outstanding deepwater bids and tenders in progress that indicate to us that the pace of contracting is likely to quicken, leading to a slight demand, supply imbalance for both semis and drillships in 2012.
Moving to midwater, conditions will remain challenged in 2012 for lower spec assets that can only drill in water depths below 2,000 feet. However, there are pockets of activity. In the fourth quarter 10 new fixtures for short-term programs were set in Asia, and PEMEX may require up to 3 semis for work in 1,000-foot water depths. 4 of Ensco's 6 midwater rigs are already contracted into 2013. 
Turning to the jackup markets. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the market, in general, continues to improve with bids and inquiries increasing, supply tightening and rig day rates moving up as units reprice. Operators are asking about longer terms, even 1 to 2 years in some cases. Most operators are focused on oil prospects given the low price of gas.
In Mexico, PEMEX announced positive modifications to their contracts and their intention to directly negotiate contracts for up to 10 jackups. In the North Sea, standard duty rigs in the southern U.K. and Danish sectors are currently fully utilized. We expect operators will extend any options they have. And for many rigs new contracts already in place once current contracts expire. With availability extremely limited in 2012, operators are planning for work programs in 2013. The market rates continue to improve with new market highs being reached as rigs are repriced.
We already are receiving inquiries for work in the Central North Sea for 2013 and 2014, a target market for our 2 remaining newbuild rigs. The Mediterranean and jack markets is expected to remain a challenge, with a surplus of 5 to 6 rigs. It seems operators are currently focused on deeper waters, as mentioned in our floater report. We have already moved our 2 jackups previously in this region to other markets. 
Despite the excess supply of jackups in the African markets, day rates are increasing, especially for higher-end rigs. Work programs tend to be short term and as many as 12 jackups may be available in the next 6 months. Long-term programs are available in Nigeria, Angola and possibly Gabon. 
In the Middle East, only a handful of marketed jackups are becoming available in 2012, and it's likely that the region will be close to full utilization in coming months. Saudi Aramco plans to increase their drilling rig count by 12%, as evidenced by their recent contract awards. 26 contracts were awarded and several more may be forthcoming. Most recent day rates fixtures indicate a significant strengthening for standard jackups. 
Elsewhere in the region, several rigs were extended, and there is a likelihood that several tenders will be issued for workover, standard and high specification programs in Qatar and for standard work in the Egyptian Gulf of Suez. 
In the Asia Pacific market, demand is said to increase in the Indian Ocean, Thailand, Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand. The majority are short-term programs, but with 56 known projects in 2012, the rig movement will help absorb the newbuild rigs that will be delivered in the second half of the year. Operators in the region have an increasing interest for high-spec units, with standard duty rigs remain the workhorse with their $20,000 to $30,000 per day discount. 
Customer demand is growing, and there's limited near-term supply of new rigs, which is driving up deepwater and jackup utilization, as well as day rates. Exploration and appraisal success, new deepwater basins, rising energy demand and healthy commodity prices are all positive indicators for long-term growth. 
Clients are under pressure to efficiently replace production in the midst of increasing technical complexity and rising safety standards. Permit activity is improving in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Petrobras continues to contract rigs due to their increasing geological success, and clients are placing a greater value on newer, high-specification equipment.
In addition, customers, more often, are contracting rigs with designs that are part of a series that have performed well for them in the past. The jackup markets also have improved with increased utilization in most major markets, and newbuild rigs are being absorbed into the fleet. Clients are focused on hiring companies with proven operational experience, competent crews and successful safety and environmental track records. 
Having newer assets that are part of a series, which allowed us to leverage standardization gives Ensco is a distinct advantage. Our newbuild delivery schedule will perpetuate our advantage of having the newest ultra-deepwater fleet in the industry and puts us in a great position to meet incremental customer demand.
In closing, we remain focused on safety and operational execution. We are realizing the benefits of our acquisition, and we are well positioned to grow our company organically for the foreseeable future. Our teams across the world are doing a fantastic job, and the growth of our company will create many new career opportunities for our employees, as well as significant benefits for customers and shareholders. Our employees have worked countless hours to get us where we are today, and I'm extremely proud of their accomplishments. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jay."
269488,154198773,262950,"Ensco plc, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2012",2012-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, Dan. My comments today will cover highlights of our fourth quarter results, our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2012, and our financial position.Regarding fourth quarter results, let me start by saying that we have provided informati",1433,"Thanks, Dan. My comments today will cover highlights of our fourth quarter results, our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2012, and our financial position.
Regarding fourth quarter results, let me start by saying that we have provided information on our earnings release, that we issued yesterday after the market closed, that should assist you in making certain year-to-year comparisons related to our recent acquisition. Therefore, my comments today will focus mainly on factors such as the growth of our fleet and rising utilization that influence comparisons between periods.
Now let's discuss our fourth quarter results versus prior year. Earnings from continuing operations were $0.99 per share, up from $0.90 a year ago. Fourth quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.99 compared to $0.93 last year. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.0 billion compared to $409 million a year ago. Approximately $481 million of the $593 million increase was related to our recent acquisitions. Deepwater revenues increased from $113 million to $514 million, driven primarily by the acquisition, as well as new ultra-deepwater rigs that were added to the fleet.
This increase in revenues is somewhat lower than previously expected, primarily due to OEM equipment issues on ENSCO DS-5, our newbuild drillships that Dan referred to earlier, as well as the delayed startup for Ensco 7500, which has now commenced its new contract in Brazil. Midwater revenues were $116 million, all related to the acquisition. The average day rate was $229,000 per day and utilization was 82%. 
Jackup segment revenues increased by approximately 18%, primarily due to more operating days year-to-year. Jackup utilization in the fourth quarter was 82%, up from 75% a year ago. And as Dan indicated earlier, utilization was 90% for the legacy Ensco jackup fleet in the fourth quarter.  Average jackup day rates, though, were down $5,000 year-over-year to $97,000 per day, as shown on our earnings release. 
Full contract drilling expense for all segments was $516 million, up from $186 million in fourth quarter 2010. Excluding $282 million from the effect of our recent acquisition, contract drilling expense increased $48 million or 26% year-to-year, mostly related to the addition of ENSCO 8503 and ENSCO 8504 to the fleet. 
Now let's discuss quarterly trends by comparing fourth quarter 2011 sequentially to third quarter 2011. Fourth quarter revenue increased 9% to $1.0 billion. This increase is mostly attributable to a $73 million or 17% increase in deepwater segment revenues, driven by an 8 percentage point increase in utilization to 80%, partially offset by a decline in the average day rate and a $19 million or 6% increase in jackup segment revenues, driven by a 5 percentage point increase in utilization to 82%, partially offset by a decline in the average day rate. Full contract drilling expense increased $38 million sequentially from the third quarter, mostly due to the increasing utilization. 
Looking at other expenses, depreciation increased $4 million with the addition of ENSCO 8504, which commenced its initial contract in September of 2011. G&A expense decreased $500,000. Effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17% versus our prior guidance of 15.6%. For the full year, the effective tax rate was approximately 18%, slightly higher than our last projection of 17%. 
Now let's discuss the first quarter outlook. Based on our current outlook, first quarter revenues are expected to increase approximately 8% from the fourth quarter. Deepwater segment revenue is projected to increase by approximately 15%, primarily due to commencement of ENSCO 7500's new contract and increased utilization for ENSCO DS-5 versus fourth quarter. 
The midwater segment, comprising just 6 rigs in our fleet, will have lower utilization due to planned shipyard work for ENSCO 5002 in the first quarter of this year, as noted in our fleet status report, and ENSCO 5003 becoming available in early January.
For jackups, the average reported day rate is projected to increase to more than $100,000 per day in the first quarter, and utilization is projected to rise significantly to about 90%, up from 82% in the fourth quarter. 
Moving to expenses. We anticipate first quarter 2011 total contract drilling expense will be up approximately 7% from the fourth quarter. Depreciation expense should increase slightly to approximately $142 million. We anticipate G&A expense will decline to about $35 million in the first quarter, which in part reflects the synergies that we have described from the acquisition. Other expense is anticipated to be approximately $30 million, comprised of $36 million of interest expense, partially offset by $6 million of interest income.
Now let's move on to the outlook for full year 2012. Deepwater revenues are estimated to increase approximately 99% year-to-year. ENSCO 8505 and ENSCO 8506 have been contracted with commencement dates later this year, and we have also signed an interim agreement for ENSCO DS-6. This interim agreement states that our intention is to sign a term contract that would, if signed, commence in fourth quarter 2012. In addition, Ensco 7500, which was undergoing shipyard upgrades last year, is now operating in Brazil and ENSCO 8503 and 8504, that commenced operations last year, will have a full year impact in 2012.
We expect deepwater segment utilization to be in the low-90% range in 2012, which includes the usual higher level of estimated downtime for new rigs coming out of the shipyard as they ramp up on their first drilling assignments. For our midwater segment, revenues are estimated to be approximately $390 million in 2012. This reflects shipyard work in 2012 for 2 rigs and limited contracting opportunities for Ensco 5003, which is the least capable of our 6 midwater rigs.
Turning now to jackups, on average, 2012 utilization is expected to increase from 77% in 2011 to the mid-80% range in 2012. With respect to contract drilling expense, we expect an increase of approximately 49% in 2012 due to several factors: a full year effect of the acquisition, rising deepwater and jackup segment utilization and a 9% increase in average unit labor cost for offshore employees to meet current market conditions. 
Depreciation is projected to increase to approximately $600 million, with the addition of our new ultra-deepwater rigs. G&A expense is anticipated to be approximately $125 million, which reflects $50 million of synergies we have forecasted for 2012. 
Interest expense is estimated to be $135 million, net of approximately $95 million of interest that would be capitalized in 2012. We expect interest income of $22 million for the year due to interest earned on certain long-term contracts for reimbursement of mobilization and capital upgrade costs. Our effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 12.5% for full year 2012. 
Last year, in 2011, capital spending was lower than our previous outlook, mostly due to the delivery of ENSCO DS-6 moving slightly from late December to early January, which postponed one of our milestone payments to the shipyard. 2012 capital spending, which is subject to change throughout the year, is forecasted to be $1.83 billion. This breaks down as follows: $1.2 billion is committed to new rig construction, which includes the final milestone payment for ENSCO DS-6; $380 million is for rig enhancements; and $250 million is for sustaining projects. 
Approximately $90 million of the shipyard capital spending is reimbursable by our customers.
We ended the year with $431 million of cash and a 31% leverage ratio. Total backlog for the company is approximately $9.7 billion. 
Now let's turn to synergies. As we outlined on our last earnings call, for 2012, we expect total expense synergies to be approximately $100 million, with about 1/2 related to G&A and 1/2 related to contract drilling expense, mostly from procurement and insurance as we leverage our increased scale. 
Anticipated full year run rate synergies for 2013 and beyond will be approximately $150 million, comprised of $120 million of expense savings and $30 million of capital expenditures synergy. 
In terms of our financial position, just adding to the positive that Dan mentioned earlier regarding our recent acquisition, we maintained our investment-grade ratings while improving the efficiency of our balance sheet and Ensco's overall cost of capital. Revenue backlog is now $9.7 billion, which gives us greater visibility of future cash flows. 
We have a newer fleet of high-quality assets that we believe will give us industry-leading utilization and day rates over time, and we have enhanced diversification across geographies, rig types and customers, which is both an offensive and defensive advantage. So overall, as Dan noted, we are realizing the benefits of the acquisition, and we will continue to capitalize on our expanded capabilities for shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Sean."

Before Jay takes us to the financial results, I will discuss the benefits we are seeing from recent acquisition, fourth quarter and full year highlights and the state of our markets. Last February, we announced a ma",1940,"Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Before Jay takes us to the financial results, I will discuss the benefits we are seeing from recent acquisition, fourth quarter and full year highlights and the state of our markets. 
Last February, we announced a major acquisition. Looking back a year later, we are realizing the benefits that we discussed with our shareholders. Our larger customer base, expanded geographic presence and wider range of enhanced rig capabilities are giving us a distinct advantage. We have the world's youngest ultra-deepwater fleet, the largest number of active premium jackups and a major presence in the most strategic offshore basins across 6 continents. 
In addition, we are realizing benefits from standardization within our fleet, especially the ENSCO 8500 Series semisubmersibles, Samsung DP3 drillships and Keppel FELS premium jackups. We believe these advantages will differentiate Ensco from other drillers in terms of uptime, which, in turn, will lead to more business and the highest scores in our industry for overall customer satisfaction. The integration of operations and systems is proceeding well, and we are on track to achieve our targeted synergies for 2012 and beyond. 
Turning now to the highlights since last quarter. ENSCO 120, our first ultra-premium jackup that will be delivered next year, was contracted for $230,000 per day, plus mobilization for initial 500-day term in the Central North Sea. ENSCO 8505, which was recently delivered, was contracted to Anadarko, Apache and Noble Energy for at least 2 years and will commence its term contract next quarter. ENSCO 8506, the last rig in the ENSCO 8500 Series, was contracted to Anadarko at $530,000 per day for 2.5 years and will commence its term contract in the fourth quarter. Both of these 8500 Series contracts are for work in the U.S. Gulf, which is another positive sign that customers are confident in our ability to manage the permitting process.
We are also very gratified that these 2 contracts are with repeat customers. These rigs and their crews have proven the benefits of standardization across the 8500 Series, which had 97% utilization in 2011. Performance like this continues to enhance Ensco's reputation for exceeding customers' expectations. 
As I mentioned last quarter, some of our newbuild drillships have experienced downtime on their initial wells that is outside our acceptable range, mostly due to OEM equipment issues that we are working to resolve with suppliers. We are systematically sharing lessons learned with the rest of the fleet to ensure that we do not experience repeat occurrences. Given the measures we have taken and the benefits of standardization I mentioned earlier, we expect higher utilization for our deepwater segment in 2012. 
Since there has been a great deal of discussion in our sector about downtime, let me be clear. All of Ensco's active rigs, including their BOPs are certified to work in the markets where they are currently working. None of the current or upcoming shipyard stays noted on our most recent fleet status report involve any recertification work and none of the OEM equipment issues we experienced on our newbuild rigs involve recertification work, but rather were entirely related to a new equipment being delivered to us that did not meet commissioning standards. 
Finally, in our most recent fleet status report, we provided an update on the status of ENSCO DS-6 that was recently delivered in South Korea. The rig is now in Singapore to load equipment, and per the terms of our interim agreement is undergoing customer-requested and funded enhancements. The interim agreement with our customer states our intention to sign a 5-year contract by April 1, and we will provide an update in our next fleet status report.
Moving on to our other segments. Our midwater rigs performed very well in the fourth quarter, and the jackup segment showed significant improvement in utilization, rising another 7 percentage points from last quarter to 90% for the legacy Ensco fleet as we expected due to our dedicated jackup crews around the world. 
Let me also commend our shipyard personnel who have successfully delivered our newbuild semis and drillships and currently, are managing the construction of 5 additional rigs. We expect to promote and add hundreds of employees over the coming years as our new rigs come out of the shipyard and go to work around the world. 
Now let me discuss the markets. I will begin with deepwater. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, demand continues to improve, as evidenced by our multi-year agreements for ENSCO 8505 and 8506 that I mentioned earlier. Customers have become more confident in managing the permitting process and are building on inventory work that enables them to commit to long-term contracts. As we have anticipated, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico is now a catalyst for incremental demand. A new geological success, along with favorable economics, will perpetuate this trend. 
In Brazil, we expect demand for deepwater rigs to continue to grow as operators increase their requirements. Petrobras is planning to increase the number of exploration wells drilled in 2012 to over 65 versus the 47 drilled in 2011. And they have outstanding tenders for multiple rigs for 3- to 5-year term contracts. Other operators such as Shell, Marinco and Total have requirements as well. 
In addition, the industry is expecting a new license round to be launched soon, which will offer new offshore blocks for exploration and generate further rig demand. 
The African deepwater market also continues to tighten, with multiple operators looking for deepwater rigs in late 2012 to mid-2013 against an environment with little visible rig supply. Areas like Angola, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea continue to generate new drilling opportunities as do the new basins being discovered offshore East Africa. The African pre-salt basins offshore Angola, Congo and Gabon are providing our clients a high-impact play that appears to be one of the most exciting new frontiers in our industry. 
Early results from the initial wells drilled in the African pre-salt are encouraging and give the possible connectivity to the Brazil pre-salt. Ensco is well positioned with our presence in West Africa to take advantage of the expected growth in this region.
Deepwater activity continues to pick up in Asia, with demand driven by requirements in Indonesia and Malaysia. More than 10 new fixtures have been set since October. Floater activity in the Mediterranean remains strong, driven by opportunities in Egypt, Cyprus and Israel and longer term, potentially, Libya. Worldwide, there are several outstanding deepwater bids and tenders in progress that indicate to us that the pace of contracting is likely to quicken, leading to a slight demand, supply imbalance for both semis and drillships in 2012.
Moving to midwater, conditions will remain challenged in 2012 for lower spec assets that can only drill in water depths below 2,000 feet. However, there are pockets of activity. In the fourth quarter 10 new fixtures for short-term programs were set in Asia, and PEMEX may require up to 3 semis for work in 1,000-foot water depths. 4 of Ensco's 6 midwater rigs are already contracted into 2013. 
Turning to the jackup markets. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the market, in general, continues to improve with bids and inquiries increasing, supply tightening and rig day rates moving up as units reprice. Operators are asking about longer terms, even 1 to 2 years in some cases. Most operators are focused on oil prospects given the low price of gas.
In Mexico, PEMEX announced positive modifications to their contracts and their intention to directly negotiate contracts for up to 10 jackups. In the North Sea, standard duty rigs in the southern U.K. and Danish sectors are currently fully utilized. We expect operators will extend any options they have. And for many rigs new contracts already in place once current contracts expire. With availability extremely limited in 2012, operators are planning for work programs in 2013. The market rates continue to improve with new market highs being reached as rigs are repriced.
We already are receiving inquiries for work in the Central North Sea for 2013 and 2014, a target market for our 2 remaining newbuild rigs. The Mediterranean and jack markets is expected to remain a challenge, with a surplus of 5 to 6 rigs. It seems operators are currently focused on deeper waters, as mentioned in our floater report. We have already moved our 2 jackups previously in this region to other markets. 
Despite the excess supply of jackups in the African markets, day rates are increasing, especially for higher-end rigs. Work programs tend to be short term and as many as 12 jackups may be available in the next 6 months. Long-term programs are available in Nigeria, Angola and possibly Gabon. 
In the Middle East, only a handful of marketed jackups are becoming available in 2012, and it's likely that the region will be close to full utilization in coming months. Saudi Aramco plans to increase their drilling rig count by 12%, as evidenced by their recent contract awards. 26 contracts were awarded and several more may be forthcoming. Most recent day rates fixtures indicate a significant strengthening for standard jackups. 
Elsewhere in the region, several rigs were extended, and there is a likelihood that several tenders will be issued for workover, standard and high specification programs in Qatar and for standard work in the Egyptian Gulf of Suez. 
In the Asia Pacific market, demand is said to increase in the Indian Ocean, Thailand, Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand. The majority are short-term programs, but with 56 known projects in 2012, the rig movement will help absorb the newbuild rigs that will be delivered in the second half of the year. Operators in the region have an increasing interest for high-spec units, with standard duty rigs remain the workhorse with their $20,000 to $30,000 per day discount. 
Customer demand is growing, and there's limited near-term supply of new rigs, which is driving up deepwater and jackup utilization, as well as day rates. Exploration and appraisal success, new deepwater basins, rising energy demand and healthy commodity prices are all positive indicators for long-term growth. 
Clients are under pressure to efficiently replace production in the midst of increasing technical complexity and rising safety standards. Permit activity is improving in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Petrobras continues to contract rigs due to their increasing geological success, and clients are placing a greater value on newer, high-specification equipment.
In addition, customers, more often, are contracting rigs with designs that are part of a series that have performed well for them in the past. The jackup markets also have improved with increased utilization in most major markets, and newbuild rigs are being absorbed into the fleet. Clients are focused on hiring companies with proven operational experience, competent crews and successful safety and environmental track records. 
Having newer assets that are part of a series, which allowed us to leverage standardization gives Ensco is a distinct advantage. Our newbuild delivery schedule will perpetuate our advantage of having the newest ultra-deepwater fleet in the industry and puts us in a great position to meet incremental customer demand.
In closing, we remain focused on safety and operational execution. We are realizing the benefits of our acquisition, and we are well positioned to grow our company organically for the foreseeable future. Our teams across the world are doing a fantastic job, and the growth of our company will create many new career opportunities for our employees, as well as significant benefits for customers and shareholders. Our employees have worked countless hours to get us where we are today, and I'm extremely proud of their accomplishments. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jay."
269488,154198773,263528,"Ensco plc, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2012",2012-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, Dan. My comments today will cover highlights of our fourth quarter results, our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2012, and our financial position.Regarding fourth quarter results, let me start by saying that we have provided informati",1433,"Thanks, Dan. My comments today will cover highlights of our fourth quarter results, our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2012, and our financial position.
Regarding fourth quarter results, let me start by saying that we have provided information on our earnings release, that we issued yesterday after the market closed, that should assist you in making certain year-to-year comparisons related to our recent acquisition. Therefore, my comments today will focus mainly on factors such as the growth of our fleet and rising utilization that influence comparisons between periods.
Now let's discuss our fourth quarter results versus prior year. Earnings from continuing operations were $0.99 per share, up from $0.90 a year ago. Fourth quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.99 compared to $0.93 last year. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.0 billion compared to $409 million a year ago. Approximately $481 million of the $593 million increase was related to our recent acquisitions. Deepwater revenues increased from $113 million to $514 million, driven primarily by the acquisition, as well as new ultra-deepwater rigs that were added to the fleet.
This increase in revenues is somewhat lower than previously expected, primarily due to OEM equipment issues on ENSCO DS-5, our newbuild drillships that Dan referred to earlier, as well as the delayed startup for Ensco 7500, which has now commenced its new contract in Brazil. Midwater revenues were $116 million, all related to the acquisition. The average day rate was $229,000 per day and utilization was 82%. 
Jackup segment revenues increased by approximately 18%, primarily due to more operating days year-to-year. Jackup utilization in the fourth quarter was 82%, up from 75% a year ago. And as Dan indicated earlier, utilization was 90% for the legacy Ensco jackup fleet in the fourth quarter.  Average jackup day rates, though, were down $5,000 year-over-year to $97,000 per day, as shown on our earnings release. 
Full contract drilling expense for all segments was $516 million, up from $186 million in fourth quarter 2010. Excluding $282 million from the effect of our recent acquisition, contract drilling expense increased $48 million or 26% year-to-year, mostly related to the addition of ENSCO 8503 and ENSCO 8504 to the fleet. 
Now let's discuss quarterly trends by comparing fourth quarter 2011 sequentially to third quarter 2011. Fourth quarter revenue increased 9% to $1.0 billion. This increase is mostly attributable to a $73 million or 17% increase in deepwater segment revenues, driven by an 8 percentage point increase in utilization to 80%, partially offset by a decline in the average day rate and a $19 million or 6% increase in jackup segment revenues, driven by a 5 percentage point increase in utilization to 82%, partially offset by a decline in the average day rate. Full contract drilling expense increased $38 million sequentially from the third quarter, mostly due to the increasing utilization. 
Looking at other expenses, depreciation increased $4 million with the addition of ENSCO 8504, which commenced its initial contract in September of 2011. G&A expense decreased $500,000. Effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17% versus our prior guidance of 15.6%. For the full year, the effective tax rate was approximately 18%, slightly higher than our last projection of 17%. 
Now let's discuss the first quarter outlook. Based on our current outlook, first quarter revenues are expected to increase approximately 8% from the fourth quarter. Deepwater segment revenue is projected to increase by approximately 15%, primarily due to commencement of ENSCO 7500's new contract and increased utilization for ENSCO DS-5 versus fourth quarter. 
The midwater segment, comprising just 6 rigs in our fleet, will have lower utilization due to planned shipyard work for ENSCO 5002 in the first quarter of this year, as noted in our fleet status report, and ENSCO 5003 becoming available in early January.
For jackups, the average reported day rate is projected to increase to more than $100,000 per day in the first quarter, and utilization is projected to rise significantly to about 90%, up from 82% in the fourth quarter. 
Moving to expenses. We anticipate first quarter 2011 total contract drilling expense will be up approximately 7% from the fourth quarter. Depreciation expense should increase slightly to approximately $142 million. We anticipate G&A expense will decline to about $35 million in the first quarter, which in part reflects the synergies that we have described from the acquisition. Other expense is anticipated to be approximately $30 million, comprised of $36 million of interest expense, partially offset by $6 million of interest income.
Now let's move on to the outlook for full year 2012. Deepwater revenues are estimated to increase approximately 99% year-to-year. ENSCO 8505 and ENSCO 8506 have been contracted with commencement dates later this year, and we have also signed an interim agreement for ENSCO DS-6. This interim agreement states that our intention is to sign a term contract that would, if signed, commence in fourth quarter 2012. In addition, Ensco 7500, which was undergoing shipyard upgrades last year, is now operating in Brazil and ENSCO 8503 and 8504, that commenced operations last year, will have a full year impact in 2012.
We expect deepwater segment utilization to be in the low-90% range in 2012, which includes the usual higher level of estimated downtime for new rigs coming out of the shipyard as they ramp up on their first drilling assignments. For our midwater segment, revenues are estimated to be approximately $390 million in 2012. This reflects shipyard work in 2012 for 2 rigs and limited contracting opportunities for Ensco 5003, which is the least capable of our 6 midwater rigs.
Turning now to jackups, on average, 2012 utilization is expected to increase from 77% in 2011 to the mid-80% range in 2012. With respect to contract drilling expense, we expect an increase of approximately 49% in 2012 due to several factors: a full year effect of the acquisition, rising deepwater and jackup segment utilization and a 9% increase in average unit labor cost for offshore employees to meet current market conditions. 
Depreciation is projected to increase to approximately $600 million, with the addition of our new ultra-deepwater rigs. G&A expense is anticipated to be approximately $125 million, which reflects $50 million of synergies we have forecasted for 2012. 
Interest expense is estimated to be $135 million, net of approximately $95 million of interest that would be capitalized in 2012. We expect interest income of $22 million for the year due to interest earned on certain long-term contracts for reimbursement of mobilization and capital upgrade costs. Our effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 12.5% for full year 2012. 
Last year, in 2011, capital spending was lower than our previous outlook, mostly due to the delivery of ENSCO DS-6 moving slightly from late December to early January, which postponed one of our milestone payments to the shipyard. 2012 capital spending, which is subject to change throughout the year, is forecasted to be $1.83 billion. This breaks down as follows: $1.2 billion is committed to new rig construction, which includes the final milestone payment for ENSCO DS-6; $380 million is for rig enhancements; and $250 million is for sustaining projects. 
Approximately $90 million of the shipyard capital spending is reimbursable by our customers.
We ended the year with $431 million of cash and a 31% leverage ratio. Total backlog for the company is approximately $9.7 billion. 
Now let's turn to synergies. As we outlined on our last earnings call, for 2012, we expect total expense synergies to be approximately $100 million, with about half related to G&A and half related to contract drilling expense, mostly from procurement and insurance as we leverage our increased scale. 
Anticipated full year run rate synergies for 2013 and beyond will be approximately $150 million, comprised of $120 million of expense savings and $30 million of capital expenditures synergy. 
In terms of our financial position, just adding to the positive that Dan mentioned earlier regarding our recent acquisition, we maintained our investment-grade ratings while improving the efficiency of our balance sheet and Ensco's overall cost of capital. Revenue backlog is now $9.7 billion, which gives us greater visibility of future cash flows. 
We have a newer fleet of high-quality assets that we believe will give us industry-leading utilization and day rates over time, and we have enhanced diversification across geographies, rig types and customers, which is both an offensive and defensive advantage. So overall, as Dan noted, we are realizing the benefits of the acquisition, and we will continue to capitalize on our expanded capabilities for shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Sean."

Before Jay takes us to the financial results, I will discuss first quarter highlights and the state of our markets. Before I do though, let me also was extend our thanks to everyone who participated in our Investor Day. I mentioned last quarter that we were realizing the benefits of our wreckage acquisitions and I'm sure following our Investor Day the benefits of the acquisition are even more clear. We have a deep pool of talent within our company, ranging from engineering and capital projects as evidenced by our drillship and high spec jackup presentations to operational expertise as noted in our 8500 Series discussion and tour of ENSCO 8505 to safety management and training and market intelligence. Our talented recruits and onshore professionals are leveraging the advantages we have in terms of our large customer base, geographic presence, newer fleet and standardization across our rigs. And I'm sure it was evident from our Investor Day that our teams from the various departments have joined together extremely well and are very passionate about their work. I can say this because it was extremely gratifying for us once again to earn the #1 customer satisfaction rating in EnergyPoint's independent survey. In fact, we are in the #1 score in 13 of 17 categories. This is a big achievement in any year but particularly this year, given the integration of our 2 companies. Sometimes employees lose their focus when 2 companies come together. Our employees did not, they remained focused on safety, operational excellence and addressing customer needs, and I'm very proud of their performance during this transition period.
Turning now to other highlights during the quarter. ENSCO 8506, the final rig in the 8500 Series, was contracted to Anadarko at $530,000 per day for 2.5 years and will commence its term contract in the fourth quarter in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This is yet another positive sign that customers are confident in their ability to manage the permitting process. We are also very gratified that ENSCO 8506 is the third 8500 Series rig that Anadarko has contracted with us. During the quarter, we also contracted our news drillship, ENSCO DS-6 to BP, another repeat customer, for an initial 5-year term. Given our contracting success and positive outlook for future demand, we ordered a new ultra-deepwater drillship, ENSCO DS-8, with options for 2 additional drillships. In total, we now have 6 rigs under construction that will drive earnings and cash flow growth well into the future. 
Given our positive outlook, our Board of Directors increased our regular cash dividend by 7% during the first quarter. We believe Ensco is now solidly both an income and a growth investment.  Key is execution. I mentioned last quarter that some of our newbuild drillships experienced downtime on their initial wells closely due to the OEM equipment issues. We are working through these issues and other causes of downtime such as human error that added to unacceptable levels of downtime in the first quarter, including some season rigs that should not be experiencing extended downtime. We are systematically sharing lessons learned to prevent repeated occurrences and given the measures we have taken and the benefits of standardization and a newer fleet, we anticipate higher utilization for our deepwater segment in 2012. As I noted on prior calls, all of Ensco's active rigs, including their BOPs, are certified to work in the markets where they're currently working, and none of the current or upcoming shipyard stays noted on our Fleet Status Report involve any recertification work related to new requirements since Macondo. While we did have unacceptable levels of downtime in the first quarter, I believe Ensco has effective systems to both minimize unplanned downtime and effectively recover from an unplanned downtime when it occurs. One example of the latter is a recent contract we assigned with Noble Energy since our last Fleet Status Report. Following the acquisition last year, we had some downtime challenges with ENSCO 5006 working in the Mediterranean. We acted quickly to resolve the problems with an integrated team approach to regain our customer's confidence and in the first quarter, ENSCO 5006 had 97% utilization. Given this positive performance, last week, Noble Energy not only exercised 6 months of remaining options, they added a new 1-year term at  a day rate of $415,000, up significantly from the current rate of $285,000. This is the type of performance that I believe distinguishes Ensco from other drillers.
As noted in our Fleet Status Reports, we've also added several jackup contracts around the globe at higher day rates and for longer terms. Finally, our shipyard personnel successfully delivered via 6 and ENSCO 8505 may have already begun work on ENSCO DS-8, our next-generation drillship that we recently ordered. Through these rigs, we will promote and recruit hundreds of employees around the world. I truly believe ENSCO will continue to offer fantastic career opportunities to our employees as we grow our company. 
Now let me discuss the markets. I'll begin with deepwater in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico with permitting continues to improve, the clarity of regulations and requirements is increasing each month. A level of inquiries continues to increase and operators are planning to expand their drilling programs. For example, we understand BP is looking to increase from 8 deepwater rigs in 2012 to 12 by 2014. In Brazil, several units arrived during the first quarter to commence contracts, and Petrobras awarded contracts for 21 units to be built in Brazil with delivery dates 2015 and 2010. Petrobras has outstanding tenders, 2 rigs for 3- to 6-year term contracts and other operators have requirements as well. The African Deepwater market continues to be very active and given the short supply of ultra-deepwater assets globally, several lucrative contracts were recently awarded. Given the tightness of supply, we feel that operators will exercise whatever options they can in 2012 and early 2013. On a longer-term basis, Deepwater floater demand in the West Africa is projected to rise considerably in coming years. A significant interest was the award of 11 Pre-Salt blocks offshore Angola, sustained activity is expected offshore Nigeria and Angola and will be complemented by increase in activity in Ghana, and Sierra Leone and potentially offshore Namibia. East Africa is a newly emerging Deepwater frontier with several world-class gas discoveries, which should lead to developments link to LNG. The Asian Deepwater market is still in its infancy but with it's recent reports indicating that potential for large oil and gas reserves, this market is expected to grow significantly. Current demand for Deepwater rigs is picked up with interest coming from clients to drill 1 or 2 exploration wells. As a result, mid and Deepwater floater market remains very tight with no surplus capacity of rigs in 2012. Operators for short-term programs in Asia are trying to form consortiums to attract suitable rigs into the market. Almost a dozen operators are actively looking for rigs for exploration programs. Floater activity in the Mediterranean is set to increase driven by opportunities in the Egyptian, Libya and Israeli markets. Total and Gas has outstanding requirements in Egypt but have been unsuccessful in securing rig time.
Now moving to midwater. Market remains challenging for lower spec assets that can only drill on water depths below 2,000 feet. However, there are pockets of activity, and as mentioned there is no rig available this year in the Asia-Pacific region. ENSCO 5004 recently drilled a new discovery for OGX in Brazil, the well, which is named OGX 79, reached the depth of 2,030 meters and confirms our customer's expectations for the unexplored potential for the Campos basin. 
Now turning to the jackup markets. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, markets utilization is effectively 100% for premium jackups. Two competitive jackups were recently contracted outside the region, so we anticipate that U.S. Gulf of Mexico market will continue to be tight, especially given that PEMEX has reaffirmed its intention to increase its jackup fleet to 40 units before the end of the year. PEMEX several rigs in the U.S. Gulf is evaluating its options. 
In the North Sea, jackup utilization and day rates continue to trend upward, and 2013 appears to be promising as well with the current demand outlook exceeding supply. Standard duty jackup availability in the U.K., Dutch and Danish sectors is now the premium as demonstrated by the new fixtures set over the last quarter. Availability is even tighter in the 12 strong nonthe region heavy-duty fleet with one rig being reactivated. We continue to receive new inquiries for work starting in 2013 and 2014, with a majority of the demand being for work in the Central North Sea. Mediterranean jackup market is expected to remain a challenge, and contractors continue to reposition jackups to other regions. 
In the African markets, the demand for high specification units continues to grow. Over the next few months, there will be 4 new arrivals and day rates are increasing for higher rigs. By contrast, market for standard duty rigs is less active. There has been very little tendering activity this quarter with only 2 fixtures compared to 14 at the end of 2011. The most notable inquiry in the recent weeks, which is planning to drill its first exploration well off Togo in the third quarter of 2012. Only a handful of wells have ever been drilled offshore Togo, none since 2005. So this campaign, along with the Deepwater program, that is planning for later this year would be monitored with great interest. 
In the Middle East, high commodity prices continue to support strong tender activity in the region, and operators are struggling to secure rigs for their programs. Rigs are entering the market from all corners of globe in order to meet demand, and subsequently day rates continue to trend higher. In the first quarter, Saudi Aramco contracted another 6 jackups and in Qatar, to tender for up to 5 jackups. Opportunities also exist in the surrounding vicinity. We expect overall utilization in the region to be close to 100% for the remainder of the year, with only a handful of lower specification jackups coming available. 
The Asia-Pacific market, there's a shortage of rigs, where programs have been planed for second, third quarters of 2012 now being deferred until late in to the year or into 2013. In order to fill long-term work projects, operators contracted several rigs from outside the region. Most of the demand is being driven by governments who are taking an aggressive approach to increase production. 
To summarize, customer demand is growing and there is limited near-term supply of new rigs, which is driving up deepwater and jackup utilization and day rates. Exploration and appraisal success to Deepwater basins, approved activity in the U.S. Gulf, healthy commodity prices, these are all positive indications for long-term growth. In addition to these factors, clients are placing a greater value from newer high specification equipment and on rigs that are part of the series that are performed well due in part to standardization CeBIT Anadarko contracting 3  8500 Series rigs, the BP contracting another drillship, ENSCO DS-6. Clients are also focused on hiring companies with proven operational experience, crews and successful safety and environmental track records. All of these factors bode well for Ensco and put us in a great position to meet incremental customer demand. Now I'll turn it over to Jay"

My comments today will cover highlights of our first quarter results and our financial position. We provided information on our earnings release that we issued yesterday after the market closed that should assist you in making certain year-to-year comparisons related to our acquisition. Therefore, my comments today will focus mainly on factors such as the growth of our fleet and rising utilization and day rates that influence and comparisons between periods. 
Now let's start with first quarter results versus prior year. Earnings were $1.15 per share, up from $0.45 a year ago. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.03 billion compared to $362 million a year ago. Approximately $461 million of the increase was related to our acquisition. Deepwater revenues increased from $98 million to $549 million, driven primarily by the acquisition, as well as the addition of ENSCO 8503 and ENSCO 8504 to the fleet and the commencement of ENSCO 7500, which began its new contract in Brazil in late December following upgrades completing during 2011. Midwater revenues were $91 million all related to the acquisition. The average day rate was $227,000, and utilization was 68%. 
Jackup segment revenues increased by approximately 39% primarily due to higher utilization and higher average day rates. Utilization for the entire jackup fleet in the first quarter was 84%, up from 72% a year ago. The average day rate increased $2,000 year-over-year to $99,000 as shown in our earnings release. For our market at jackup fleet that excludes cold stacked rigs, utilization was 94%. Total contract drilling expense for all segments was $520 million, up from $192 million in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding $269 million from the effect of our most recent acquisition, contract drilling expense increased $59 million or 31% year-to-year, mostly related to significantly improved utilization i n the jackup segment, the commencement of ENSCO 7500 contract and the addition of ENSCO 8503 and ENSCO 8504 to the fleet. Unit labor cost increased year-to-year in line with our expectations but contract drilling expense overall came in below our prior outlook, mostly due to lower repair and maintenance costs related to timing. As I'll discuss in a moment, we expect to see an increase in contract drilling expense in the second quarter.
Full year 2012 our outlook for contract drilling expense is in line with our prior outlook on our last earnings call. 
Now let's discuss quarterly trends by comparing first quarter 2012 sequentially to fourth quarter 2011. First quarter revenue increased 3%, mostly attributable to a $35 million or 7% increase in deepwater segment revenues, driven by a 7 percentage point increase in deepwater utilization to 87%, combined with an $11,000 increase in the average day rate. In addition, we had a $16 million or 5% increase in jackup segment revenues driven by a 2-percentage point increase in utilization to 84%, combined with a $3,000- increase in the average day rate. These increases were partially offset by a decline in midwater segment revenue due mostly to Ensco 5003 being stacked and shipyard work for Ensco 5002. Total contract drilling expense increased $5 million sequentially from the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher personnel costs as projected last quarter, as well as an increase in mobilization expense, offset in part by lower repair and maintenance cost. 
Looking at other expenses, depreciation was essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter and G&A expense decreased $2 million. The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 11.6%, slightly lower than our guidance for the full year, due to a discrete tax item in the quarter.
Now let's discuss the second quarter outlook. Based on our current projections, revenues are expected to increase approximately 6% from the first quarter. Deepwater segment revenue is projected to increase by approximately 10%, primarily due to further improvement in utilization and day rates. For midwater, our smaller segment, we expect higher utilization in the second quarter due to the completion of planned shipyard work for ENSCO 5002 to as noted in our Fleet Status Report. The jackups the average reported day rate will increase further based on contracts already in place. However, utilization will decline somewhat to about 80% for the entire jackup fleet, due mostly to planned shipyard stays. As noted in our most recent Fleet Status Report, 8 rigs will be in the shipyard for upgrades or regular inspections during the second quarter. For example, we have a few rigs in Saudi Arabia undergoing upgrades funded mostly by our customer under long-term contracts. And in Mexico, ENSCO 83  as well as ENSCO 98 , which recently received an extension with PEMEX through November are undergoing regular inspections. 
Full year 2012 we expect utilization to be approximately 80% for the entire jackup fleet, including cold stacked rigs. Jackup utilization, which includes cold stacked rigs, is anticipated to be in the high 80% range. This outlook includes planned shipyard upgrades or regular inspections for approximately 15 of our 40 active marketed jackup rigs. We anticipate second quarter 2012 total contract drilling expense will be up approximately 4% from the first quarter, mostly due to higher repair and maintenance expense. Depreciation expense should increase approximately $3 million, primarily due to the commencement of ENSCO 8505 drilling operations. We anticipate G&A expense will decline further to about $34 million in the second quarter, which in part reflects the synergies that we've described from the acquisition. Other expense is anticipated to be approximately $25 million comprised of $31 million of interest expense, partially offset by $6 million of interest income. Overall, we feel very good about our synergy targets for 2012 and beyond.
Full year 2012 capital spending is forecasted to be about $1.9 billion. The anticipated breakdown is as follows: $1.3 billion is for newbuild rigs, $380 million for rig enhancement projects, the $250 million for sustaining projects. 
In terms of our financial performance, we ended the first quarter with a 32% leverage ratio and more than $10 billion of revenue backlog. As we noted in our earnings release, we recently extended our 364-day credit facility at improved terms. This facility, plus our remaining 4-year credit facility, totals $1.9 billion of undrawn revolver capacity, giving us ample liquidity. The strong financial position coupled with our positive outlook for customer demand and future cash flows prompted the board's decision to increase our regular cash dividend by 7% during the first quarter as Dan noted earlier. 
As we discussed during our Investor Day in Corpus Christi, we have the newest fleet of ultra-deepwater rigs and the largest fleet of active premium jackups, which we expect will lead to industry-leading utilization and day rates, especially given the advantages of scale and our enhanced diversification across geographies, rig types and customers. Customers have ranked us #1 for overall customer satisfaction, and we are realizing the benefit of our competitive advantages, including those gains through the acquisition. We will continue to capitalize on these advantages for our shareholders, and we expect to see significant growth opportunities as marketwide utilization and day rates increase, as well as from our newbuild rigs as they are delivered and commence their initial contract. Now I will turn the call back to Sean."

Regarding Brazil right now, all the questions you asked are currently under study with Petrobras with the recent announcements down there about different shipyards and different projects and different players in those shipyards, along with kind of how the worldwide market has tightened up considerably, Petrobras has stepped back and running a steady to try to determine what their go forward position is going to be. But in all scenarios they're looking at, they're looking at increased demand. So where the rigs come from, I think is a question mark. But the demand is there and with the recent discoveries they've had, as they move to book those reserves and commit to development programs, our expectation is that we see demand in Brazil increasing. Now in a worldwide market where the Rest of the World is already practically 100% utilized for deepwater rigs in 2012, and it appears that most of '13 if not spoken for is close to being spoken for, this whether the incremental demand actually adds rigs in Brazil or creates a vacuum where rigs are in short supply in other markets, I don't think it matters, because it's a global market. But we are seeing now a significant requirement being talked about into 2014. So I think that's the take away here is operators are realizing they need to get out in front of this or they're not going to have a rig."

Just following on, Kevin, to that issue about Brazil, you have quite a few rigs that are coming up for contract renewal, not really this year but starting fairly early in '13 and some of them are specially well midwater rigs and some of the deepwater as well would appear to be pretty low compared to what we've seen as recent fixtures, leading-edge rates for mid and kind of conventional deepwater rigs. So how do think that -- how far in advance of those explorations would you expect to be talking to Petrobras about pricing on the renewals of those rigs assuming they stay in Brazil?"

Before Jay takes us to the financial results, I will discuss first quarter highlights and the state of our markets. Before I do, though, let me also extend our thanks to everyone who participated in our Investor Day. 
I mentioned last quarter that we were realizing the benefits of our acquisition, and I'm sure, following our Investor Day, the benefits of the acquisition are even more clear. We have a deep pool of talent within our company, ranging from engineering and capital projects, as evidenced by our drillship and high-spec jackup presentations; to operational expertise, as noted in our 8500 Series discussion and tour of ENSCO 8505; to safety management and training and market intelligence. Our talented recruits and onshore professionals are leveraging the advantages we have in terms of our large customer base, geographic presence, newer fleet and standardization across our rigs. And I'm sure it was evident from our Investor Day that our teams from the various departments have joined together extremely well and are very passionate about their work. I can say this because it was extremely gratifying for us once again to earn the #1 customer satisfaction rating in EnergyPoint's independent survey. In fact, we are in the #1 score in 13 of 17 categories. This is a big achievement in any year but particularly this year given the integration of our 2 companies. Sometimes, employees lose their focus when 2 companies come together. Our employees did not. They remained focused on safety, operational excellence and addressing customer needs, and I'm very proud of their performance during this transition period.
Turning now to other highlights during the quarter. ENSCO 8506, the final rig in the 8500 Series, was contracted to Anadarko at $530,000 per day for 2.5 years and will commence its term contract in the fourth quarter in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This is yet another positive sign that customers are confident in their ability to manage the permitting process. We are also very gratified that ENSCO 8506 is the third 8500 Series rig that Anadarko has contracted with us. 
During the quarter, we also contracted our newest drillship, ENSCO DS-6, to BP, another repeat customer, for an initial 5-year term. Given our contracting success and positive outlook for future demand, we ordered a new ultra-deepwater drillship, ENSCO DS-8, with options for 2 additional drillships. In total, we now have 6 rigs under construction that will drive earnings and cash flow growth well into the future. 
Given our positive outlook, our Board of Directors increased our regular cash dividend by 7% during the first quarter. We believe Ensco is now solidly both an income and a growth investment. The key is execution. I mentioned last quarter that some of our newbuild drillships experienced downtime on their initial wells mostly due to OEM equipment issues. We are working through these issues and other causes of downtime, such as human error, that added to unacceptable levels of downtime in the first quarter, including some for-season rigs that should not be experiencing extended downtime. We are systematically sharing lessons learned to prevent repeat occurrences. And given the measures we have taken and the benefits of standardization and a newer fleet, we anticipate higher utilization for our deepwater segment in 2012. 
As I noted on prior calls, all of Ensco's active rigs, including their BOPs, are certified to work in the markets where they are currently working, and none of the current or upcoming shipyard stays noted on our Fleet Status Report involve any recertification work related to new requirements since Macondo. 
While we did have unacceptable levels of downtime in the first quarter, I believe Ensco has effective systems to both minimize unplanned downtime and effectively recover from an unplanned downtime when it occurs. One example of the latter is a recent contract we signed with Noble Energy since our last Fleet Status Report. Following the acquisition last year, we had some downtime challenges with ENSCO 5006 working in the Mediterranean. We acted quickly to resolve the problems with an integrated team approach to regain our customer's confidence, and in the first quarter, ENSCO 5006 had 97% utilization. Given this positive performance, last week, Noble Energy not only exercised 6 months of remaining options, they added a new 1-year term at a day rate of $415,000, up significantly from the current rate of $285,000. This is the type of performance that I believe distinguishes Ensco from other drillers.
As noted in our fleet status reports, we've also added several jackup contracts around the globe at higher day rates and for longer terms. 
Finally, our shipyard personnel successfully delivered DS-6 and ENSCO 8505, and they have already begun to work on ENSCO DS-8, our next-generation drillship that we recently ordered. Through these rigs, we will promote and recruit hundreds of employees around the world, and I truly believe ENSCO will continue to offer fantastic career opportunities to our employees as we grow our company. 
Now let me discuss the markets. I'll begin with deepwater in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The permitting continues to improve. The clarity of regulations and requirements is increasing each month. The level of inquiries continues to increase, and operators are planning to expand their drilling programs. For example, we understand BP is looking to increase from 8 deepwater rigs in 2012 to 12 by 2014. In Brazil, several units arrived during the first quarter to commence contracts, and Petrobras awarded contracts for 21 units to be built in Brazil with delivery dates between 2015 and 2010. Petrobras has outstanding tenders, 2 rigs for 3- to 6-year term contracts, and other operators have requirements as well. 
The African deepwater market continues to be very active, and given the short supply of ultra-deepwater assets globally, several lucrative contracts were recently awarded. Given the tightness of supply, we feel that operators will exercise whatever options they can in 2012 and early 2013. On a longer-term basis, deepwater floater demand in the West Africa is projected to rise considerably in coming years. Of significant interest was the award of 11 Pre-Salt blocks offshore Angola. Sustained activity is expected offshore Nigeria and Angola and will be complemented by increase in activity in Ghana, Cote D'Ivoire and Sierra Leone and potentially offshore Namibia. East Africa is a newly emerging deepwater frontier with several world-class gas discoveries, which should lead to developments linked to LNG. 
The Asian deepwater market is still in its infancy, but with recent reports indicating the potential for large oil and gas reserves, this market is expected to grow significantly. 
Current demand for deepwater rigs has picked up with interest coming from clients to drill 1 or 2 exploration wells. As a result, mid- and deepwater floater market remains very tight with no surplus capacity of rigs in 2012. Operators with short-term programs in Asia are trying to form consortiums to attract suitable rigs into the market. Almost a dozen operators are actively looking for rigs for exploration programs. 
Floater activity in the Mediterranean is set to increase, driven by opportunities in the Egyptian, Libya and Israeli markets. Total and Gaz de France have outstanding requirements in Egypt but have been unsuccessful in securing rig time.
Now moving to midwater. The market remains challenging for lower-spec assets that can only drill in water depths below 2,000 feet. However, there are pockets of activity, and, as mentioned, there is no rig available through this year in the Asia Pacific region. 
ENSCO 5004 recently drilled a new discovery for OGX in Brazil. The well, which is named OGX-79, reached a depth of 2,030 meters and confirms our customer's expectations for the unexplored potential for Campos basin. 
Now turning to the jackup markets. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, market utilization is effectively 100% for premium jackups. Two competitive jackups were recently contracted outside the region, so we anticipate that U.S. Gulf of Mexico market will continue to be tight, especially given that PEMEX has reaffirmed its intention to increase its jackup fleet to 40 units before the end of the year. PEMEX,  which got several rigs in the U.S. Gulf, is evaluating its options. 
In the North Sea, jackup utilization and day rates continue to trend upward, and 2013 appears to be promising as well with the current demand outlook exceeding supply. Standard-duty jackup availability in the U.K., Dutch and Danish sectors is now at a premium as demonstrated by the new fixtures set over the last quarter. Availability is even tighter in the 12-strong, non-Norwegian, heavy-duty fleet with one rig being reactivated. We continue to receive new inquiries for work starting in 2013 and 2014, with the majority of the demand being for work in the Central North Sea. 
Mediterranean jackup market is expected to remain a challenge, and contractors continue to reposition jackups to other regions. 
In the African markets, the demand for high-specification units continues to grow. Over the next few months, there will be 4 new arrivals, and day rates are increasing for higher-end rigs. By contrast, the market for standard-duty rigs is less active. There has been very little tendering activity this quarter with only 2 fixtures compared to 14 at the end of 2011. The most notable inquiry in the recent weeks was from Eni, which is planning to drill its first exploration well off Togo in the third quarter of 2012. Only a handful of wells have ever been drilled offshore Togo, none since 2005. So this campaign, along with the deepwater program that Eni is planning for later this year, will be monitored with great interest. 
In the Middle East, high commodity prices continue to support strong tender activity in the region, and operators are struggling to secure rigs for their programs. Rigs are entering the market from all corners of the globe in order to meet demand, and subsequently, day rates continue to trend higher. In the first quarter, Saudi Aramco contracted another 6 jackups. And in Qatar, Maersk has issued a tender for up to 5 jackups. Opportunities also exist in the surrounding vicinity. We expect overall utilization in the region to be close to 100% for the remainder of the year, with only a handful of lower-specification jackups coming available. 
The Asia Pacific market, there is a shortage of rigs with programs that had been planed for second, third quarters of 2012 now being deferred until late into the year or into 2013. In order to fill long-term work projects, operators contracted several rigs from outside the region. Most of the demand is being driven by governments who are taking an aggressive approach to increase production. 
To summarize, customer demand is growing, and there is limited near-term supply of new rigs, which is driving up deepwater and jackup utilization and day rates. Exploration and appraisal success through deepwater basins, improved permit activity in the U.S. Gulf, healthy commodity prices, these are all positive indications for long-term growth. In addition to these factors, clients are placing a greater value on newer high-specification equipment and on rigs that are part of a series that have performed well due in part to standardization, as seen with Anadarko contracting 3 8500 Series rigs and BP contracting another drillship, ENSCO DS-6. Clients are also focused on hiring companies with proven operational experience, opt-in [ph] crews and successful safety and environmental track records. All of these factors bode well for Ensco and put us in a great position to meet incremental customer demand. Now I'll turn it over to Jay."

My comments today will cover highlights of our first quarter results and our financial position. We provided information on our earnings release that we issued yesterday after the market closed that should assist you in making certain year-to-year comparisons related to our acquisition. Therefore, my comments today will focus mainly on factors, such as the growth of our fleet and rising utilization and day rates, that influence the comparisons between periods. 
Now let's start with first quarter results versus prior year. Earnings were $1.15 per share, up from $0.45 a year ago. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.03 billion compared to $362 million a year ago. Approximately $461 million of the increase was related to our acquisition. 
Deepwater revenues increased from $98 million to $549 million, driven primarily by the acquisition as well as the addition of ENSCO 8503 and ENSCO 8504 to the fleet and the commencement of ENSCO 7500, which began its new contract in Brazil in late December following upgrades completing during 2011. 
Midwater revenues were $91 million, all related to the acquisition. The average day rate was $227,000, and utilization was 68%. 
Jackup segment revenues increased by approximately 39% primarily due to higher utilization and higher average day rates. Utilization for the entire jackup fleet in the first quarter was 84%, up from 72% a year ago. The average day rate increased $2,000 year-over-year to $99,000 as shown in our earnings release. For our marketed jackup fleet that excludes cold-stacked rigs, utilization was 94%. 
Total contract drilling expense for all segments was $520 million, up from $192 million in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding $269 million from the effect of our most recent acquisition, contract drilling expense increased $59 million or 31% year-to-year, mostly related to significantly improved utilization in the jackup segment, the commencement of ENSCO 7500 contract and the addition of ENSCO 8503 and ENSCO 8504 to the fleet. Unit labor costs increased year-to-year, in line with our expectations, but contract drilling expense overall came in below our prior outlook, mostly due to lower repair and maintenance costs related to timing. As I'll discuss in a moment, we expect to see an increase in contract drilling expense in the second quarter.
Full year 2012, our outlook for contract drilling expense is in line with our prior outlook on our last earnings call. 
Now let's discuss quarterly trends by comparing first quarter 2012 sequentially to fourth quarter 2011. First quarter revenue increased 3%, mostly attributable to a $35 million or 7% increase in deepwater segment revenues, driven by a 7-percentage-point increase in deepwater utilization to 87%, combined with an $11,000 increase in the average day rate. In addition, we had a $16 million or 5% increase in jackup segment revenues, driven by a 2-percentage-point increase in utilization to 84%, combined with a $3,000 increase in the average day rate. These increases were partially offset by a decline in midwater segment revenue due mostly to Ensco 5003 being stacked and shipyard work for Ensco 5002. Total contract drilling expense increased $5 million sequentially from the fourth quarter primarily due to higher personnel costs as projected last quarter, as well as an increase in mobilization expense, offset in part by lower repair and maintenance costs. 
Looking at other expenses, depreciation was essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter, and G&A expense decreased $2 million. 
The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 11.6%, slightly lower than our guidance for the full year, due to a discrete tax item in the quarter.
Now let's discuss the second quarter outlook. Based on our current projections, revenues are expected to increase approximately 6% from the first quarter. Deepwater segment revenue is projected to increase by approximately 10% primarily due to further improvement in utilization and day rates. For midwater, our smallest segment, we expect higher utilization in the second quarter due to the completion of planned shipyard work for ENSCO 5002, as noted in our Fleet Status Report. For jackups, the average reported day rate will increase further based on contracts already in place. However, utilization will decline somewhat to about 80% for the entire jackup fleet due mostly to planned shipyard stays. 
As noted in our most recent Fleet Status Report, 8 rigs will be in the shipyard for upgrades or regular inspections during the second quarter. For example, we have a few rigs in Saudi Arabia undergoing upgrades funded mostly by our customer under long-term contracts. And in Mexico, ENSCO 83 as well as ENSCO 98, which recently received an extension with PEMEX through November, are undergoing regular inspections. 
Full year 2012, we expect utilization to be approximately 80% for the entire jackup fleet, including cold-stacked rigs. Targeted jackup utilization, which includes cold-stacked rigs, is anticipated to be in the high 80% range. This outlook includes planned shipyard upgrades or regular inspections for approximately 15 of our 40 active marketed jackup rigs. 
We anticipate second quarter 2012 total contract drilling expense will be up approximately 4% from the first quarter, mostly due to higher repair and maintenance expense. Depreciation expense should increase approximately $3 million primarily due to the commencement of ENSCO 8505 drilling operations. 
We anticipate G&A expense will decline further to about $34 million in the second quarter, which in part reflects the synergies that we have described from the acquisition. Other expense is anticipated to be approximately $25 million, comprised of $31 million of interest expense, partially offset by $6 million of interest income. Overall, we feel very good about our synergy targets for 2012 and beyond.
Full year 2012 capital spending is forecasted to be about $1.9 billion. The anticipated breakdown is as follows: $1.3 billion is for newbuild rigs, $380 million for rig enhancement projects and $250 million for sustaining projects. 
In terms of our financial performance, we ended the first quarter with a 32% leverage ratio and more than $10 billion of revenue backlog. As we noted in our earnings release, we have recently extended our 364-day credit facility at improved terms. This facility, plus our remaining 4-year credit facility, totals $1.9 billion of undrawn revolver capacity, giving us ample liquidity. The strong financial position, coupled with our positive outlook for customer demand and future cash flows, prompted the board's decision to increase our regular cash dividend by 7% during the first quarter, as Dan noted earlier. 
As we discussed during our Investor Day in Corpus Christi, we have the newest fleet of ultra-deepwater rigs and the largest fleet of active premium jackups, which we expect will lead to industry-leading utilization and day rates, especially given the advantages of scale and our enhanced diversification across geographies, rig types and customers. 
Customers have ranked us #1 for overall customer satisfaction, and we are realizing the benefit of our competitive advantages, including those gains through the acquisition. We will continue to capitalize on these advantages for our shareholders, and we expect to see significant growth opportunities as market-wide utilization and day rates increase, as well as from our newbuild rigs as they are delivered and commence their initial contracts. Now I will turn the call back to Sean."

The longer answer is there were some problems when we did our re-domestication between HMRC and DTC that were very difficult to follow at that point in time and would have been very expensive to try to solve. HMRC has really changed their position on stamp tax, which is what's allowed all of this to happen.

Regarding Brazil right now, all the questions you asked are currently under study by Petrobras with the recent announcements down there about different shipyards and different projects and different players in those shipyards, along with kind of how the worldwide market has tightened up considerably. Petrobras has stepped back and they're running a study to try to determine what their go-forward position is going to be. But in all scenarios they're looking at, they're looking at increased demand. So where the rigs come from, I think, is a question mark, but the demand is there. And with the recent discoveries they've had, as they move to book those reserves and commit to development programs, our expectation is that we see demand in Brazil increasing. Now in a worldwide market where the rest of the world is already practically 100% utilized for deepwater rigs in 2012 and it appears that most of '13 is, if not spoken for, is close to being spoken for, this -- whether the incremental demand actually adds rigs in Brazil or creates a vacuum where rigs are in short supply in other markets I don't think it matters because it's a global market. But we are seeing now a significant requirement being talked about into 2014. So I think that's the takeaway here, is operators are realizing they need to get out in front of this or they're not going to have a rig."

Before Jay takes us through the financial results, I will discuss first quarter highlights and the state of our markets. Before I do, though, let me also extend our thanks to everyone who participated in our Investors Day. 
I mentioned last quarter that we were realizing the benefits of our acquisition, and I'm sure, following our Investor Day, the benefits of the acquisition are even more clear. We have a deep pool of talent within our company, ranging from engineering and capital projects, as evidenced by our drillship and high-spec jackup presentations; to operational expertise, as noted in our 8500 Series discussion and tour of ENSCO 8505; to safety management and training and market intelligence. Our talented rig crews and onshore professionals are leveraging the advantages we have in terms of our large customer base, geographic presence, newer fleet and standardization across our rigs. And I'm sure it was evident from our Investor Day that our teams from the various departments have joined together extremely well and are very passionate about their work. I can say this because it was extremely gratifying for us once again to earn the #1 customer satisfaction rating in EnergyPoint's independent survey. In fact, we earned the #1 score in 13 of 17 categories. This is a big achievement in any year but particularly this year given the integration of our 2 companies. Sometimes, employees lose their focus when 2 companies come together. Our employees did not. They remained focused on safety, operational excellence and addressing customer needs, and I'm very proud of their performance during this transition period.
Turning now to other highlights during the quarter. ENSCO 8506, the final rig in the 8500 Series, was contracted to Anadarko at $530,000 per day for 2.5 years and will commence its term contract in the fourth quarter in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This is yet another positive sign that customers are confident in their ability to manage the permitting process. We are also very gratified that ENSCO 8506 is the third 8500 Series rig that Anadarko has contracted with us. 
During the quarter, we also contracted our newest drillship, ENSCO DS-6, to BP, another repeat customer, for an initial 5-year term. Given our contracting success and positive outlook for future demand, we ordered a new ultra-deepwater drillship, ENSCO DS-8, with options for 2 additional drillships. In total, we now have 6 rigs under construction that will drive earnings and cash flow growth well into the future. 
Given our positive outlook, our Board of Directors increased our regular cash dividend by 7% during the first quarter. We believe Ensco is now solidly both an income and a growth investment. The key is execution. I mentioned last quarter that some of our new-build drillships experienced downtime on their initial wells mostly due to OEM equipment issues. We are working through these issues and other causes of downtime, such as human error, that added to unacceptable levels of downtime in the first quarter, including some for seasoned rigs that should not be experiencing extended downtime. We are systematically sharing lessons learned to prevent repeat occurrences. And, given the measures we have taken and the benefits of standardization and a newer fleet, we anticipate higher utilization for our deepwater segment in 2012. 
As I noted on prior calls, all of Ensco's active rigs, including their BOPs, are certified to work in the markets where they are currently working, and none of the current or upcoming shipyard stays noted on our Fleet Status Report involve any recertification work related to new requirements since Macondo. 
While we did have unacceptable levels of downtime in the first quarter, I believe Ensco has effective systems to both minimize unplanned downtime and effectively recover from an unplanned downtime when it occurs. One example of the latter is a recent contract we have signed with Noble Energy since our last Fleet Status Report. Following the acquisition last year, we had some downtime challenges with ENSCO 5006 working in the Mediterranean. We acted quickly to resolve the problems with an integrated team approach to regain our customer's confidence, and in the first quarter, ENSCO 5006 had 97% utilization. Given this positive performance, last week, Noble Energy not only exercised 6 months of remaining options, they added a new 1-year term at a day rate of $415,000, up significantly from the current rate of $285,000. This is the type of performance that I believe distinguishes Ensco from other drillers.
As noted in our fleet status reports, we've also added several jackup contracts around the globe at higher day rates and for longer terms. 
Finally, our shipyard personnel successfully delivered DS-6 and ENSCO 8505, and they have already begun the work on ENSCO DS-8, our next-generation drillship that we recently ordered. To crew these rigs, we will promote and recruit hundreds of employees around the world, and I truly believe ENSCO will continue to offer fantastic career opportunities to our employees as we grow our company. 
Now let me discuss the markets. I'll begin with deepwater in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The permitting process continues to improve. The clarity of regulations and requirements is increasing each month. The level of inquiries continues to increase, and operators are planning to expand their drilling programs. For example, we understand BP is looking to increase from 8 deepwater rigs in 2012 to 12 by 2014. In Brazil, several units arrived during the first quarter to commence contracts, and Petrobras awarded contracts for 21 units to be built in Brazil with delivery dates between 2015 and 2010. Petrobras has outstanding tenders, 2 rigs for 3- to 6-year term contracts, and other operators have requirements as well. 
The African deepwater market continues to be very active, and given the short supply of ultra-deepwater assets globally, several lucrative contracts were recently awarded. Given the tightness of supply, we feel that operators will exercise whatever options they can in 2012 and early 2013. On a longer-term basis, deepwater floater demand in the West Africa is projected to rise considerably in coming years. Of significant interest was the award of 11 Pre-Salt blocks offshore Angola. Sustained activity is expected offshore Nigeria and Angola and will be complemented by increase in activity in Ghana, Cote D'Ivoire and Sierra Leone and potentially offshore Namibia. East Africa is a newly emerging deepwater frontier with several world-class gas discoveries, which should lead to developments linked to LNG. 
The Asian deepwater market is still in its infancy, but with its recent reports indicating the potential for large oil and gas reserves, this market is expected to grow significantly. 
Current demand for deepwater rigs has picked up with interest coming from clients to drill 1 or 2 exploration wells. As a result, mid- and deepwater floater market remains very tight with no surplus capacity of rigs in 2012. Operators with short-term programs in Asia are trying to form consortiums to attract suitable rigs into the market. Almost a dozen operators are actively looking for rigs for exploration programs. 
Floater activity in the Mediterranean is set to increase, driven by opportunities in the Egyptian, Libyan and Israeli markets. Total and Gaz de France have outstanding requirements in Egypt but have been unsuccessful in securing rig time.
Now moving to midwater. The market remains challenging for lower-spec assets that can only drill in water depths below 2,000 feet. However, there are pockets of activity, and, as mentioned, there is no rig availability this year in the Asia Pacific region. 
ENSCO 5004 recently drilled a new discovery for OGX in Brazil. The well, which is named OGX-79, reached a depth of 2,030 meters and confirms our customer's expectations for the unexplored potential, the Campos Basin. 
Now turning to the jackup markets. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, marketed utilization is effectively 100% for premium jackups. Two competitive jackups were recently contracted outside the region, so we anticipate that the U.S. Gulf of Mexico market will continue to be tight, especially given that PEMEX has reaffirmed its intention to increase its jackup fleet to 40 units before the end of the year. PEMEX,  listed several rigs in the U.S. Gulf and is evaluating its options. 
In the North Sea, jackup utilization and day rates continue to trend upward, and 2013 appears to be promising as well with the current demand outlook exceeding supply. Standard-duty jackup availability in the U.K., Dutch and Danish sectors is now at a premium as demonstrated by the new fixtures set over the last quarter. Availability is even tighter in the 12-strong, non-Norwegian, heavy-duty fleet with one rig being reactivated. We continue to receive new inquiries for work starting in 2013 and 2014, with the majority of the demand being for work in the Central North Sea. 
Mediterranean jackup market is expected to remain a challenge, and contractors continue to reposition jackups to other regions. 
In the African markets, the demand for high-specification units continues to grow. Over the next few months, there will be 4 new arrivals, and day rates are increasing for higher-end rigs. By contrast, the market for standard-duty rigs is less active. There has been very little tendering activity this quarter with only 2 fixtures compared to 14 at the end of 2011. The most notable inquiry in the recent weeks was from Eni, which is planning to drill its first exploration well off Togo in the third quarter of 2012. Only a handful of wells have ever been drilled offshore Togo, none since 2005. So this campaign, along with the deepwater program that Eni is planning for later this year, will be monitored with great interest. 
In the Middle East, high commodity prices continue to support strong tender activity in the region, and operators are struggling to secure rigs for their programs. Rigs are entering the market from all corners of the globe in order to meet demand, and subsequently, day rates continue to trend higher. In the first quarter, Saudi Aramco contracted another 6 jackups. And in Qatar, Maersk has issued a tender for up to 5 jackups. Opportunities also exist in the surrounding vicinity. We expect overall utilization in the region to be close to 100% for the remainder of the year, with only a handful of lower-specification jackups becoming available. 
In the Asia Pacific market, there is a shortage of rigs with programs that had been planned for second, third quarters of 2012 now being deferred until late into the year or into 2013. In order to fill long-term work projects, operators contracted several rigs from outside the region. Most of the demand is being driven by governments who are taking an aggressive approach to increase production. 
To summarize, customer demand is growing, and there is limited near-term supply of new rigs, which is driving up deepwater and jackup utilization and day rates. Exploration and appraisal success through deepwater basins, improved permit activity in the U.S. Gulf, healthy commodity prices, these are all positive indications for long-term growth. In addition to these factors, clients are placing a greater value on newer high-specification equipment and on rigs that are part of a series that have performed well due in part to standardization, as seen with Anadarko contracting 3 8500 Series rigs and BP contracting another drillship, ENSCO DS-6. Clients are also focused on hiring companies with proven operational experience, competent crews and successful safety and environmental track records. All of these factors bode well for Ensco and put us in a great position to meet incremental customer demand. Now I'll turn it over to Jay."

My comments today will cover highlights of our first quarter results and our financial position.

My comments today will cover highlights of our first quarter results and our financial position. We provided information on our earnings release that we issued yesterday after the market closed that should assist you in making certain year-to-year comparisons related to our acquisition. Therefore, my comments today will focus mainly on factors, such as the growth of our fleet and rising utilization and day rates, that influence the comparisons between periods. 
Now let's start with first quarter results versus prior year. Earnings were $1.15 per share, up from $0.45 a year ago. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.03 billion compared to $362 million a year ago. Approximately $461 million of the increase was related to our acquisition. 
Deepwater revenues increased from $98 million to $549 million, driven primarily by the acquisition as well as the addition of ENSCO 8503 and ENSCO 8504 to the fleet and the commencement of ENSCO 7500, which began its new contract in Brazil in late December following upgrades completing during 2011. 
Midwater revenues were $91 million, all related to the acquisition. The average day rate was $227,000, and utilization was 68%. 
Jackup segment revenues increased by approximately 39% primarily due to higher utilization and higher average day rates. Utilization for the entire jackup fleet in the first quarter was 84%, up from 72% a year ago. The average day rate increased $2,000 year-over-year to $99,000 as shown in our earnings release. For our marketed jackup fleet that excludes cold-stacked rigs, utilization was 94%. 
Total contract drilling expense for all segments was $520 million, up from $192 million in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding $269 million from the effect of our most recent acquisition, contract drilling expense increased $59 million or 31% year-to-year, mostly related to significantly improved utilization in the jackup segment, the commencement of ENSCO 7500 contract and the addition of ENSCO 8503 and ENSCO 8504 to the fleet. Unit labor costs increased year-to-year, in line with our expectations, but contract drilling expense overall came in below our prior outlook, mostly due to lower repair and maintenance costs related to timing. As I'll discuss in a moment, we expect to see an increase in contract drilling expense in the second quarter.
For full year 2012, our outlook for contract drilling expense is in line with our prior outlook on our last earnings call. 
Now let's discuss quarterly trends by comparing first quarter 2012 sequentially to fourth quarter 2011. First quarter revenue increased 3%, mostly attributable to a $35 million or 7% increase in deepwater segment revenues, driven by a 7-percentage-point increase in deepwater utilization to 87%, combined with an $11,000 increase in the average day rate. In addition, we had a $16 million or 5% increase in jackup segment revenues, driven by a 2-percentage-point increase in utilization to 84%, combined with a $3,000 increase in the average day rate. These increases were partially offset by a decline in midwater segment revenue due mostly to ENSCO 5003 being stacked and shipyard work for ENSCO 5002. Total contract drilling expense increased $5 million sequentially from the fourth quarter primarily due to higher personnel costs as projected last quarter, as well as an increase in mobilization expense, offset in part by lower repair and maintenance costs. 
Looking at other expenses, depreciation was essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter, and G&A expense decreased $2 million. 
The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 11.6%, slightly lower than our guidance for the full year, due to a discrete tax item in the quarter.
Now let's discuss the second quarter outlook. Based on our current projections, revenues are expected to increase approximately 6% from the first quarter. Deepwater segment revenue is projected to increase by approximately 10% primarily due to further improvement in utilization and day rates. For midwater, our smallest segment, we expect higher utilization in the second quarter due to the completion of planned shipyard work for ENSCO 5002, as noted in our Fleet Status Report. For jackups, the average reported day rate will increase further based on contracts already in place. However, utilization will decline somewhat to about 80% for the entire jackup fleet due mostly to planned shipyard stays. 
As noted in our most recent Fleet Status Report, 8 rigs will be in the shipyard for upgrades or regular inspections during the second quarter. For example, we have a few rigs in Saudi Arabia undergoing upgrades funded mostly by our customer under long-term contracts. And in Mexico, ENSCO 83 as well as ENSCO 98, which recently received an extension with PEMEX through November, are undergoing regular inspections. 
For full year 2012, we expect utilization to be approximately 80% for the entire jackup fleet, including cold-stacked rigs. Marketed jackup utilization, which includes cold-stacked rigs, is anticipated to be in the high 80% range. This outlook includes planned shipyard upgrades or regular inspections for approximately 15 of our 40 active marketed jackup rigs. 
We anticipate second quarter 2012 total contract drilling expense will be up approximately 4% from the first quarter, mostly due to higher repair and maintenance expense. Depreciation expense should increase approximately $3 million primarily due to the commencement of ENSCO 8505 drilling operations. 
We anticipate G&A expense will decline further to about $34 million in the second quarter, which in part reflects the synergies that we have described from the acquisition. Other expense is anticipated to be approximately $25 million, comprised of $31 million of interest expense, partially offset by $6 million of interest income. Overall, we feel very good about our synergy targets for 2012 and beyond.
Full year 2012 capital spending is forecasted to be about $1.9 billion. The anticipated breakdown is as follows: $1.3 billion is for new-build rigs, $380 million for rig enhancement projects and $250 million for sustaining projects. 
In terms of our financial performance, we ended the first quarter with a 32% leverage ratio and more than $10 billion of revenue backlog. As we noted in our earnings release, we have recently extended our 364-day credit facility at improved terms. This facility, plus our remaining 4-year credit facility, totals $1.9 billion of undrawn revolver capacity, giving us ample liquidity. The strong financial position, coupled with our positive outlook for customer demand and future cash flows, prompted the board's decision to increase our regular cash dividend by 7% during the first quarter, as Dan noted earlier. 
As we discussed during our Investor Day in Corpus Christi, we have the newest fleet of ultra-deepwater rigs and the largest fleet of active premium jackups, which we expect will lead to industry-leading utilization and day rates, especially given the advantages of scale and our enhanced diversification across geographies, rig types and customers. 
Customers have ranked us #1 for overall customer satisfaction, and we are realizing the benefit of our competitive advantages, including those gained through the acquisition. We will continue to capitalize on these advantages for our shareholders, and we expect to see significant growth opportunities as market-wide utilization and day rates increase, as well as from our new-build rigs as they are delivered and commence their initial contracts. Now I will turn the call back to Sean."

The longer answer is there were some problems when we did our re-domestication between HMRC and DTC that were very difficult to solve at that point in time and would have been very expensive to try to solve. HMRC has really changed their position on stamp tax, which is what's allowed all of this to happen. So as we look at making the change now, it's not a particularly expensive thing to do, and it doesn't require undue regulatory approval. So I think it'd be safe to assume we're looking at it and we'll move us quickly as we think makes sense."

Regarding Brazil right now, all the questions you asked are currently under study by Petrobras with the recent announcements down there about different shipyards and different projects and different players in those shipyards, along with kind of how the worldwide market has tightened up considerably. Petrobras has stepped back and they're running a study to try to determine what their go-forward position is going to be. But in all scenarios they're looking at, they're looking at increased demand. So where the rigs come from, I think, is a question mark, but the demand is there. And with the recent discoveries they've had, as they move to book those reserves and commit to development programs, our expectation is that we see demand in Brazil increasing. Now, in a worldwide market where the rest of the world is already practically 100% utilized for deepwater rigs in 2012 and it appears that most of '13 is, if not spoken for, close to being spoken for, this -- whether the incremental demand actually adds rigs in Brazil or creates a vacuum where rigs are in short supply in other markets I don't think matters because it's a global market. But we are seeing now a significant requirement being talked about into 2014. So I think that's the takeaway here, is operators are realizing they need to get out in front of this or they're not going to have a rig."

Before Jay takes us through the financial results, I will discuss the second quarter highlights and the state of our markets.

Before Jay takes us through the financial results, I will discuss the second quarter highlights and the state of our markets. Before I do though, I'd like to take a moment to extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to someone who has been a major contributor to Ensco's success from the first day we opened our doors for business. Neil, Chadwick, our Chief Operating Officer, will be retiring from Ensco in August after 25 years of service to our company. Bill has guided us through challenging periods on our history during down cycles as well as growth periods during up cycles always with the same steady demeanor and a deep commitment to safety and operational excellence. Put simply, we would not be where we are today with Bill's many contributions. Amongst Bill's most important achievements has been his ability to build strong teams, which is a good facility power succession planning process.
Mark Burns, as most of you know, will succeed Bill in August as EVP and Chief Operating Officer. Mark is an industry veteran, who has reported to Bill for several years and we anticipate a very smooth transition. Especially given Mark's a strong leadership skills. Steve Brady will succeed Mark as Senior Vice President of our Western hemisphere. Stave has worked for Ensco for many years and has led all of our Eastern Hemisphere business units during his career. I'm confident that Steve will do an excellent job in his new position. Julian Hall will replace Steve as Vice President of Europe and the Mediterranean; and Derek Kent has been promoted to Vice President of the Middle East and Africa business unit. We also promoted Jay Swent, our CFO, to Executive Vice President. We all know Jay from our investor events and earnings calls and Jay's promotion to EVP recognizes his many contributions to Ensco's success, including our re-domestication and acquisition. Jay has also added human resources and supply chain to his other responsibilities and Jay will now be based in Houston where he will be leading most of our corporate departments. Kevin Roberts, Senior Vice President of Marketing, will be relocating to our Corporate Headquarters here in London. 
Turning now to other highlight during the quarter, we ordered 2 additional drillships underscoring our positive outlook for deepwater in the coming years based on very strong customer demand. In total, we now have 7 rigs under construction that will drive earnings and cash flow growth well into the future. ENSCO 8505, our newest rigs commits its initial two-year contract with Anadarko, Appache and Noble Energy in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. All 3 operators are repeat customers of our 8500 Series rigs and we plan to exceed their expectations once again as we have in the past. 
In the second quarter, our 8500 Series fleet achieve 96% utilization highlighting the many benefits from standardization. In Singapore, we held our naming ceremony for ENSCO 8506 that is contracted to Anadarko, a $530,000 per day in 2.5 years. The new rig will commence its term contract in the fourth quarter of this year. We did have above average unplanned downtime in Brazil during the second quarter on our Deepwater rigs so we can't declare victory yet. But overall, I believe we made progress by sharing lessons learned and leveraging the advantages of standardization across our rigs as evidenced by the improvement on our Deepwater segment utilization to 91% in the second quarter. 
Turning now to jackup segment highlights. All of our actively marketed jackups are contracted and marketed utilization reached 92% in the second quarter. High levels of utilization in turn are driving the increase an average day rates that Jay will discuss in a moment. As part of our ongoing hydrating strategy, we sold 2 additional coal stack jackups during the second quarter, bringing our three-year total to 7 rigs sold. These leaves us with just 4 coal stack rigs in our fleet. 
The other part of our hydrating strategy is new build construction. And our 3 Ensco 120 series jackup is being built in Singapore, are on schedule for the deliveries next year and 2014. 
Now let me discuss the markets. I'll begin with Deepwater. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the ultra-deepwater fleet industry wide is 100% contracted and the availability of other Deepwater pluggers[ph] is almost nonexistent in 2012 and well into 2013. Operators have adapted to the longer permitting process and more opportunities to continue to surface. In Mexico, PEMEX is preparing to commence exploration drilling in the ultra-deepwater [ph] belt just south of the U.S. border. Our PEMEX is a new player in the Deepwater market, they are focused on offsetting declines in the production from shallow water and onshore fields. 
In Brazil, although lower production quarters for OGX and Petrobras recently have been announcement, we anticipate that independent operators may become more active in Brazil. Also it appears that Petrobras will proceed with their plans to come to the market this year to add additional rigs. 
The African ultra Deepwater water market remains extremely strong with available supply rapidly evaporating recent day rates are now in the high $500,000 to low $600,000 range. The tightness in the ultra-deepwater sector is having a positive effect on the Deepwater fleet which has become more competitive and has put upward pressure on day rates worldwide. The Asian Deepwater market remains tight with no circlose[ph] capacity in 2012. 
Floater activity in the Mediterranean is set to increase next year driven by opportunities offshore Egypt and Israel. We know of operators with tenders that have been canceled since they were unable to secure rig time in Egypt. 
Moving to Midwater, Ensco's smallest segment with just 6 rigs, the market remains challenging with most rigs on terms of less than 1 year. However, they are opportunities in the North Sea which remains strong with improving day rates and short-term programs appearing in Southeast Asia, West Africa, and the Mexico Latin America market. 
Turning to the jackup markets. All regions are experiencing strong demand. Average day rates have climbed and operators are offering longer-term contracts. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico marketed rigs are 100% contracted for premium jackups like Ensco's. Those healthy demand has suggested by increasing day rates and increasing bath plugs[ph] that we have seen recently. The majority of Ensco's jackup fleet is presently drilling for oil so we are not impacted by low U.S. gas prices. We anticipate that premium jackups market will continue to be very tight as our borders lock in rigs are long-term contracts. 
In Mexico, PEMEX ordered 4 contracts during the quarter and they are continuing their pursuit to increase their jackup fleet to 40 units before the end of the year. Much of the contracting is being done through direct negotiations. 
In the North Sea, jackup utilization and day rates have continued to trend upward with full utilization for active, standard jackups in 2012 and scarce availability in 2013. The 12-rig non-Norwegian, heavy duty fleet is contracted through to 2012 and we expect that these jackups will absorb some of the overflow projects from the UK semi market, which is effectively booked through 2013 and now also part of 2014. We don't have any jackups in the Mediterranean which has been a difficult market. But we are monitoring opportunities in Libya and due to success in Israel and Cyprus, the Lebanese government is expected to hold the licensing round in 2013. 
The African market has tightened in recent months with 14 new fixtures and options exercise during the quarter. 8 of these fixtures were term commitments of 1 year or longer. Only 4 of the 12 jackups potentially available this year are [ph] it to work in water depths of 350 feet or more. For recent uptick in term fixtures has left near-term availability in short supply and has helped boost day rates. 
Opportunities exist in Capone, Nigeria, [indiscernible] and the Congo. In the Middle East, operator interest is picking up and triggering activity is no longer dominated by Saudi Aramco. A number of operators have outstanding requirements and we expect contract awards to be announced imminently. In Qatar, Mersk is evaluating bids for its 5 rig jackup requirement with two-year firm terms. Commencement [ph] dates range from late this year to early next. Opportunities also exist in the surrounding vicinity. 
Moving to the Asia-Pacific market. Activity remains tight with high spec jackups reaching 100% utilization in the second quarter. Despite the inflex of rigs brought in from outside Asia to fill the demand, rates have continued their upward trend. Some operators are starting to the further programs due to the lack of rig availability and anticipation of new builds that will be delivered starting in late 2012 and beyond. We anticipate this market to remain balanced to the beginning of 2013. 
To summarize, customer demand is growing and it there is limited near-term supply of new rigs. This has driven up average day rates for both Deepwater and jackup segments. Exploration, operational success, and new Deepwater basins and healthy commodity prices are all positive indications for long-term growth. All these factors bode well for Ensco and put us in a great position to meet incremental customer demand that has been arising. 
Before I hand it over to Jay, I want to make a brief comment about safety. For those of you who attended our Investor Day in April, including the ENSCO 8505 rig tour, I'm sure came away with a very strong impression about the importance of safety at Ensco. In May, less than a week after our last earnings call, I was alerted that helicopter flying to our Ensco 102 jackup rig was forced landed in the North Sea. 7 of the 14 people on board were Ensco employees. Fortunately, as additional reports came in, we learned that the helicopter pilots did a textbook landing on the water, the passengers and crews safely got into life rafts and rescue workers are everyone back to shore without injury. Safety training is an integral part of our daily lives at Ensco and I want to recognize our employees as well as the other people on board the helicopter that day, especially the crew who applied in their training and got everybody back to shore safely. Now, I'll turn it over to Jay."

Today I'm going to cover highlights of our second quarter results, the outlook for the third quarter and our financial position. We provided information on our earnings release which should assist you in making certain year-to-year comparisons related to our acquisition. Therefore my comments today will focus mainly on factors such as the growth of our fleet and rising utilization and average day rates to positively influence the comparisons between periods. 
Now let's start with second quarter results versus prior year. Earnings were $1.47 per share, up from $0.59 a year ago. As noted in our earnings release, there were a few items that influenced that comparisons. In contract drilling expense, warranty claims receive in the quarter increased earnings by $0.10 per share and gains from the disposition of coal stack jackup rigs increased earnings by $0.06 per share this quarter and $0.02 per share a year ago. In addition, acquisition-related costs reduced earnings a year ago by $0.14 per share, in which $0.13 was in general and administrative expenses and a penny was in contract drilling expense. Total revenue for the quarter was just above $1 billion compared to $564 million a year ago. Excluding the effect of the acquisition, revenues grew 44% year-over-year. Deepwater revenues increased from $232 million to $572 million, and excluding the effect of the acquisition, grew by 71% due to the addition of ENSCO 8504 to the fleet, significantly higher utilization and average day rates, and the reactivation of Ensco 7500 late last year following upgrades completed during 2011. Midwater revenues were $101 million, all related to the acquisition. The average day rate was $227,000 compared to $237,000 a year ago, and utilization was unchanged at 79%. Jackup segment revenues increased by approximately 31% due to an increase in both utilization and the average day rate. Backup utilization for the entire fleet in the second quarter was 83% up from 75% a year ago. As Dan noted, utilization for our marketed rigs all of which are contracted was 92% in the second quarter. The average day rate increased 6% to $105,000 as shown in our earnings release. 
Turning onto the contract drilling expense, for all segments the total was $490 million, up from $286 million in the second quarter 2011. Excluding the effect of our acquisition, contract drilling expense increased $72 million or 37% year-over-year, mostly related to significantly improved utilization in the Deepwater and jackup segments, the reactivation of Ensco 7500 and the addition of ENSCO 8504 to the active fleet. Also unit labor cost increased year-over-year in line with our expectations. 
Compared to our prior outlook, contract drilling expense came in lower than expected due mostly to $22 million of warranty claims recognized in the quarter and $13 million of gains related to the sale of 2 coal stack jackup rigs. General and administrative expense for the quarter was $36 million, down from $38 million last quarter and $47 million last year. Please note last year's number included acquisition-related expenses as noted in our press release. The effect of tax rate in the second quarter was 10.5%. Adjusted for discrete tax items have benefited results, the effective tax rate was 11.2% in line with our guidance for the full year. 
Now let's discuss quarterly trends by comparing second quarter 2012 sequentially to first quarter 2012. Second quarter revenue increased 4%, mostly attributable to $23 million or 4% increase in deepwater segment revenues, driven by a 4% each point increase in Deepwater utilization to 91%, combined with the $7000 increase in the average day rate. In addition, we had a $13 million or 3% increase in jackup segment revenues driven by a $6000 increase in the average day rate. Midwater segment revenues increased $10 million due to an 11% each point increase in utilization as Ensco 5002 commenced a new contract following a plan shipyards stay in the first quarter of this year. 
Full contract drilling expense decreased $31 million sequentially from the first quarter. Adjusted for the warranty claims and the gains from the jackup sales that I just mentioned, contract drilling expense was up approximately $5 million or about 1%.  Looking at other expenses, depreciation was flat compared to the first quarter and G&A expense decreased about $3 million. 
Now let's discuss third quarter outlook. Based on our current projections, revenues are expected to increase approximately 3% from the second quarter. Deepwater segment revenues projected to increase approximately 9% primarily due to further improvement in the average day rate and ENSCO 8505 commencing its initial contract late in the second quarter. The Midwater, our smaller segment, revenue should essentially unchanged. For jackups, the average reported day rate will increase further based on contracts already in place. However utilization is expected to decline slightly in the third quarter due to planned shipyards stays. As noted in our most recent Fleet Status Report, 8 rigs will be in the shipyard for plant upgrades on a regular inspections during the third quarter. We anticipated third quarter 2012 total contract drilling expense will be up approximately $65 million from the second quarter. Adjusted for the warranty the un-rigged sales items in the second quarter contract drilling expense should be up about 6% due impart to ENSCO 8505 and operating for the full third quarter and higher repair and maintenance cost for the rigs and plants shipyards states. Depreciation expense is expected to increase approximately $6 million, primarily due to the commencement of ENSCO 8505. We anticipate general and administrative expense will decline further to about $32 million in the third quarter. For the full year, we expect to achieve our $50 million synergy target for G&A expense as planned. Other expenses is anticipated to be approximately $26 million, $31 million from interest expense, partially offset by $5 million of interest income. 
Overall, we feel very good about our total synergy target of $100 million for 2012, which includes $50 million from contract drilling expense. Full year 2012 capital spending is forecasted to be about $1.9 billion. We anticipate a breakdown as follows: $1.3 billion for new build rigs, $380 million for rig enhancement projects, and $250 million for sustaining projects. We have already invested $1 billion through June 30, so remaining capital expenditures are estimated to be about $900 million for the balance of the year. In terms of our financial reposition, we ended the second quarter with a 30% leverage ratio and $10 billion of revenue backlog. In total, we have more than 100 rig years of contracted revenue backlog. Our strong financial position coupled with our positive outlook for customer demand and future cash flows, prompted our decision to commit an additional $1.3 billion to expand our fleet with 2 new drillships. We expect to see significant growth opportunities as market wide utilization and average day rates increased and we feel very good about contracting opportunities for our 7 rigs under construction. During the quarter, we converted back to an ordinary share listing on the NYSE, so we are now fully eligible to be reinstated in the S&P 500 index. Whilst to complete the conversion, we're included in the second quarter of G&A expense. 
In closing, as Dan mentioned, I have now added responsibilities for human resources and supply chain in addition to my responsibilities as CFO and I'm moving to Houston. I'm very excited by all of these changes. Winning the battle for talent and forging strong relationships with our vendors will be key ingredients to working safely and minimizing downtime, both of which are important success factors for the future. Ensco is committed to world-class performance in all of these areas. Now, I will turn the call over back to Sean."

We got down to 30% this quarter. So we're not feeling pressured to reduce debt at all. In fact as you know, it makes a very efficient balance sheet. So we don't feel like we need to be investing heavily in debt reduction in the near term. Maybe the other point I make is historically, we've invested heavily in fleet renewal and our fleet's in great shape today, so our future capital investments are really primarily directed to new builds and those generate growth for us. We are not having to spend a lot of cash in the next several years renewing our existing fleet. So all of our -- most of our investment will go to growth. If you look at the cash profile for the company for the future, it really does allow us a lot of flexibility to allocate capital wherever we choose to and as I said, I think we can very efficiently allocate it to growth and we can very efficiently allocate it to dividends as well. As you know we increased the dividend to $1.50 in the first quarter, there was 7% increase there. So I think we're well positioned, as we like to say where we were in investor meetings, we a great income and a great growth story today. And I think we'll continue to be that. I think obviously how we decide to allocate capital between dividends and growth in the future, is going to depend on the facts and circumstances at the time. But all options are on the table. I think with that, I managed not to answer your timing question."

Before Jay takes us through the financial results, I will discuss second quarter highlights and the state of our markets. Before I do though, I'd like to take a moment to extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to someone who has been a major contributor to Ensco's success from the first day we opened our doors for business. 
Bill Chadwick, our Chief Operating Officer, will be retiring from Ensco in August after 25 years of service to our company. Bill has guided us through challenging periods on our history during down cycles as well as growth periods during up cycles, always with the same steady demeanor and a deep commitment to safety and operational excellence. Put simply, we would not be where we are today without Bill's many contributions. Amongst Bill's most important achievements has been his ability to build strong teams, which has greatly facilitated our succession planning process.
Mark Burns, who most of you know, will succeed Bill in August as EVP and Chief Operating Officer. Mark is an industry veteran who has reported to Bill for several years, and we anticipate a very smooth transition especially given Mark's strong leadership skills. 
Steve Brady will succeed Mark as Senior Vice President of our Western Hemisphere. Stave has worked for Ensco for many years and has led all of our Eastern Hemisphere business units during his career. I'm confident Steve will do an excellent job in his new position. Julian Hall will replace Steve as Vice President of Europe and the Mediterranean, and Derek Kent has been promoted to Vice President of the Middle East and Africa business unit. 
We also promoted Jay Swent, our CFO, to Executive Vice President. You all know Jay from our investor events and earnings calls, and Jay's promotion to EVP recognizes his many contributions to Ensco's success, including our re-domestication and acquisition. Jay has also added human resources and supply chain to his other responsibilities, and Jay will now be based in Houston where he will be leading most of our corporate departments. Kevin Robert, Senior Vice President of Marketing, will be relocating to our corporate headquarters here in London. 
Turning now to other highlights during the quarter, we ordered 2 additional drillships underscoring our positive outlook for deepwater in the coming years based on very strong customer demand. In total, we now have 7 rigs under construction that will drive earnings and cash flow growth well into the future. ENSCO 8505, our newest rig, commenced its initial 2-year contract with Anadarko, Appache and Noble Energy in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. All 3 operators are repeat customers of our 8500 Series rigs, and we plan to exceed their expectations once again as we have in the past. 
In the second quarter, our 8500 Series fleet achieve 96% utilization highlighting the many benefits from standardization. In Singapore, we held our naming ceremony for ENSCO 8506 that is contracted to Anadarko at $530,000 per day for 2.5 years. The new rig will commence its term contract in the fourth quarter of this year. 
We did have above-average unplanned downtime in Brazil during the second quarter on our deepwater rigs so we can't declare victory yet. But overall, I believe we made progress by sharing lessons learned and leveraging the advantages of standardization across our rigs as evidenced by the improvement on our Deepwater segment utilization to 91% in the second quarter. 
Turning now to Jackup segment highlights. All of our actively marketed jackups are contracted and market utilization reached 92% in the second quarter. High levels of utilization in turn are driving the increase in average day rates that Jay will discuss in a moment. As part of our ongoing high-grading strategy, we sold 2 additional cold stacked jackups during the second quarter, bringing our 3-year total to 7 rigs sold. This leaves us with just 4 cold stacked rigs in our fleet. The other part of our high-grading strategy is newbuild construction, and our 3 ENSCO 120 Series jackups being built in Singapore are on schedule for the deliveries next year and 2014. 
Now let me discuss the markets. I'll begin with Deepwater. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the ultra-deepwater fleet industry wide is 100% contracted, and the availability of other deepwater  floaters is almost nonexistent in 2012 and well into 2013. Operators have adapted to the longer permitting process and more opportunities to continue to surface. 
In Mexico, PEMEX is preparing to commence exploration drilling in the ultra-deepwater Perdido Fold Belt just south of the U.S. border. While PEMEX is a new player in the deepwater market, they are very focused on offsetting declines in the production from shallow water and onshore fields. 
In Brazil, although lower production quarters for OGX and Petrobras recently have been announced, we anticipate that independent operators may become more active in Brazil. Also, it appears Petrobras will proceed with their plans to come to the market this year to add additional rigs. 
The African ultra-deepwater market remains extremely strong with available supply rapidly evaporating, recent day rates are now in the high 500s to low $600,000 range. The tightness in the ultra-deepwater sector is having a positive effect on the deepwater fleet, which has become more competitive and has put upward pressure on day rates worldwide. The Asian deepwater market remains tight with no surplus capacity in 2012. 
Floater activity in the Mediterranean is set to increase next year driven by opportunities offshore Egypt and Israel. We know of operators with tenders that have been canceled since they were unable to secure rig time in Egypt. 
Moving to Midwater, Ensco's smallest segment with just 6 rigs, the market remains challenging with most rigs working on terms of less than 1 year. However, there are opportunities in the North Sea which remains strong with improving day rates, and short-term programs are appearing in Southeast Asia, West Africa and the Mexico-Latin American market. 
Turning to the jackup markets. All regions are experiencing strong demand. Average day rates have climbed, and operators are offering longer-term contracts. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, marketed rigs are 100% contracted for premium jackups like Ensco's. There is healthy demand as suggested by the increasing day rates and increasing backlogs that we have seen recently. The majority of Ensco's jackup fleet is presently drilling for oil, so we are not impacted by low U.S. gas prices. We anticipate the premium jackup market will continue to be very tight as operators lock in rigs on long-term contracts. 
In Mexico, PEMEX awarded 4 contracts during the quarter, and they are continuing their pursuit to increase their jackup fleet to 40 units before the end of the year. Much of the contracting is being done through direct negotiations. 
In the North Sea, jackup utilization and day rates have continued to trend upward with full utilization for active, standard-duty jackups in 2012 and scarce availability in 2013. The 12-rig, non-Norwegian, heavy-duty fleet is contracted through to 2012, and we expect that these jackups will absorb some of the overflow projects from the U.K. semi market, which is effectively booked through 2013 and now also for 2014. We don't have any jackups in the Mediterranean which has been a difficult market. But we are monitoring opportunities in Libya, and due to success in Israel and Cyprus, the Lebanese government is expected to hold the licensing round in 2013. 
The African market has tightened in recent months with 14 new fixtures and options exercise during the quarter. 8 of these fixtures were term commitments of 1 year or longer. Only 4 of the 12 jackups potentially available this year are outfitted to work in water depths of 350 feet or more. The recent uptick in term fixtures has left near-term availability in short supply and has helped boost day rates. 
Opportunities exist in Gabon, Nigeria, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire and the Congo. In the Middle East, operator interest is picking up and tendering activity is no longer dominated by Saudi Aramco. A number of operators have outstanding requirements, and we expect contract awards to be announced imminently. In Qatar, Maersk is evaluating bids for its 5-rig jackup requirement with 2-year firm terms. Commencement dates range from late this year to early next. Opportunities also exist in the surrounding vicinity. 
Moving to the Asia Pacific market. Activity remains tight with high-spec jackups reaching 100% utilization in the second quarter. Despite the influx of rigs brought in from outside Asia to fill the demand, rates have continued their upward trend. Some operators are starting to defer their programs due to the lack of rig availability in anticipation of newbuilds that will be delivered starting in late 2012 and beyond. We anticipate this market to remain balanced at the beginning of 2013. 
To summarize, customer demand is growing, and there is limited near-term supply of new rigs. This has driven up average day rates for both Deepwater and Jackup segments. Exploration and appraisal success, new deepwater basins and healthy commodity prices are all positive indications for long-term growth. All these factors bode well for Ensco and put us in a great position to meet incremental customer demand that has been rising. 
Before I hand it over to Jay, I want to make a brief comment about safety. For those of you who attended our Investor Day in April, including the ENSCO 8505 rig tour, I'm sure you came away with a very strong impression about the importance of safety at Ensco. 
In May, less than a week after our last earnings call, I was alerted that a helicopter flying to our ENSCO 102 jackup rig was forced to land in the North Sea. 7 of the 14 people on board were Ensco employees. Fortunately, as additional reports came in, we learned that the helicopter pilot did a textbook landing on the water. The passengers and the crews safely got into life rafts and rescue workers brought everyone back to shore without injury. 
Safety training is an integral part of our daily lives at Ensco, and I want to recognize our employees as well as the other people on board the helicopter that day especially the crew who applied their training and got everybody back to shore safely. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jay."
269488,212748387,333662,"Ensco plc, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, Dan. Today I'm going to cover highlights of our second quarter results, the outlook for the third quarter and our financial position.

Today I'm going to cover highlights of our second quarter results, the outlook for the third quarter and our financial position. We provided information on our earnings release, which should assist you in making certain year-to-year comparisons related to our acquisition. Therefore, my comments today will focus mainly on factors such as the growth of our fleet and rising utilization and average day rates that positively influenced the comparisons between periods. 
Now let's start with second quarter results versus prior year. Earnings were $1.47 per share, up from $0.59 a year ago. As noted in our earnings release, there were a few items that influenced that comparisons. In contract drilling expense, warranty claims received in the quarter increased earnings by $0.10 per share, and gains from the disposition of cold stacked jackup rigs increased earnings by $0.06 per share this quarter and $0.02 per share a year ago. In addition, acquisition-related costs reduced earnings a year ago by $0.14 per share, in which $0.13 was in general and administrative expense and $0.01 was in contract drilling expense. 
Total revenue for the quarter was just above $1 billion compared to $564 million a year ago. Excluding the effect of the acquisition, revenues grew 44% year-over-year. Deepwater revenues increased from $232 million to $572 million, and excluding the effect of the acquisition, grew by 71% due to the addition of ENSCO 8504 to the fleet, significantly higher utilization and average day rates and the reactivation of ENSCO 7500 late last year following upgrades completed during 2011. 
Midwater revenues were $101 million, all related to the acquisition. The average day rate was $227,000 compared to $237,000 a year ago, and utilization was unchanged at 79%. Jackup segment revenues increased by approximately 31% due to an increase in both utilization and the average day rate. Jackup utilization for the entire fleet in the second quarter was 83%, up from 75% a year ago. As Dan noted, utilization for our marketed rigs, all of which are contracted, was 92% in the second quarter. The average day rate increased 6% to $105,000 as shown in our earnings release. 
Turning now to contract drilling expense. For all segments, the total was $490 million, up from $286 million in the second quarter 2011. Excluding the effect of our acquisition, contract drilling expense increased $72 million or 37% year-over-year, mostly related to significantly improved utilization in the Deepwater and Jackup segments, the reactivation of ENSCO 7500 and the addition of ENSCO 8504 to the active fleet. Also, unit labor costs increased year-over-year in line with our expectations. Compared to our prior outlook, contract drilling expense came in lower than expected due mostly to $22 million of warranty claims recognized in the quarter and $13 million of gains related to the sale of 2 cold stacked jackup rigs. 
General and administrative expense for the quarter was $36 million, down from $38 million last quarter and $47 million last year. Please note, last year's number included acquisition-related expenses as noted in our press release. The effective tax rate in the second quarter was 10.5%. Adjusted for discrete tax items that benefited results, the effective tax rate was 11.2% in line with our guidance for the full year. 
Now let's discuss quarterly trends by comparing second quarter 2012 sequentially to first quarter 2012. Second quarter revenue increased 4%, mostly attributable to a $23 million or 4% increase in Deepwater segment revenues driven by a 4 percentage point increase in deepwater utilization to 91%, combined with the $7,000 increase in the average day rate. In addition, we had a $13 million or 3% increase in Jackup segment revenues driven by a $6,000 increase in the average day rate. Midwater segment revenues increased $10 million due to an 11 percentage point increase in utilization as ENSCO 5002 commenced a new contract following a planned shipyard stay in the first quarter of this year. 
Total contract drilling expense decreased $31 million sequentially from the first quarter. Adjusted for the warranty claims and the gains from the jackup sales that I just mentioned, contract drilling expense was up approximately $5 million or about 1%. Looking at other expenses, depreciation was flat compared to the first quarter, and G&A expense decreased about $3 million. 
Now let's discuss third quarter outlook. Based on our current projections, revenues are expected to increase approximately 3% from the second quarter. Deepwater segment revenue is projected to increase approximately 9% primarily due to further improvement in the average day rate and ENSCO 8505 commencing its initial contract late in the second quarter. 
For Midwater, our smallest segment, revenue should be essentially unchanged. For Jackups, the average reported day rate will increase further based on contracts already in place. However, utilization is expected to decline slightly in the third quarter due to planned shipyard stays. As noted in our most recent Fleet Status Report, 8 rigs will be in the shipyard for planned upgrades or regular inspections during the third quarter. 
We anticipate third quarter 2012 total contract drilling expense will be up approximately $65 million from the second quarter. Adjusted for the warranty and rig sale items in the second quarter, contract drilling expense should be up about 6% due impart to ENSCO 8505 operating for the full third quarter and higher repair and maintenance costs for the rigs with planned shipyard stays. 
Depreciation expense is expected to increase approximately $6 million primarily due to the commencement of ENSCO 8505. We anticipate general and administrative expense will decline further to about $32 million in the third quarter. For the full year, we expect to achieve our $50 million synergy target for G&A expense as planned. Other expense is anticipated to be approximately $26 million, $31 million from interest expense, partially offset by $5 million of interest income. Overall, we feel very good about our total synergy target of $100 million for 2012, which includes $50 million from contract drilling expense. 
Full year 2012 capital spending is forecasted to be about $1.9 billion. The anticipated breakdown is as follows: $1.3 billion for newbuild rigs, $380 million for rig enhancement projects and $250 million for sustaining projects. We have already invested $1 billion through June 30, so remaining capital expenditures are estimated to be about $900 million for the balance of the year. 
In terms of our financial reposition, we ended the second quarter with a 30% leverage ratio and $10 billion of revenue backlog. In total, we have more than 100 rig years of contracted revenue backlog. Our strong financial position, coupled with our positive outlook for customer demand and future cash flows, prompted our decision to commit an additional $1.3 billion to expand our fleet with 2 new drillships. We expect to see significant growth opportunities as market-wide utilization and average day rates increase, and we feel very good about contracting opportunities for our 7 rigs under construction. 
During the quarter, we converted back to an ordinary share listing on the NYSE, so we are now fully eligible to be reinstated in the S&P 500 Index. Costs to complete the conversion were included in the second quarter G&A expense. 
In closing, as Dan mentioned, I have now added responsibilities for human resources and supply chain in addition to my responsibilities as CFO, and I'm moving to Houston. I'm very excited by all of these changes. Winning the battle for talent and forging strong relationships with our vendors will be key ingredients to working safely and minimizing downtime, both of which are important success factors for the future. Ensco is committed to world-class performance in all of these areas. 
Now I will turn the call back over to Sean."

One is we're really comfortable today with our current debt structure and our leverage ratio, got down to 30% this quarter. So we're not feeling pressured to reduce debt at all. In fact, as you know, it makes for a very efficient balance sheet. So we don't feel like we need to be investing heavily in debt reduction in the near term. I think the other point I'd make is historically, we've invested heavily in fleet renewal, and our fleet is in great shape today. So our future capital investments are really primarily directed to newbuilds and those generate growth for us. We are not having to spend a lot of cash in the next several years renewing our existing fleet. So all of our -- most of our investment there will go to growth. If you look at the cash profile for the company for the future, it really does allow us a lot of flexibility to allocate capital wherever we choose to. And as I said, I think we can very efficiently allocate it to growth, and we can very efficiently allocate it to dividends as well. As you know, we increased the dividend to $1.50 in the first quarter. It was a 7% increase there. So I think we're well positioned as we like to say when we're in investor meetings. We're a great income and a great growth story today, and I think we'll continue to be that. I think obviously, how we decide to allocate capital between dividends and growth in the future is going to depend on the facts and circumstances at the time. But all options are on the table. I think with that, I managed not to answer your timing question."

Before Jay takes us through the financial results, I will discuss second quarter highlights and the state of our markets. Before I do though, I'd like to take a moment to extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to someone who has been a major contributor to Ensco's success from the first day we opened our doors for business. 
Bill Chadwick, our Chief Operating Officer, will be retiring from Ensco in August after 25 years of service to our company. Bill has guided us through challenging periods on our history during down cycles as well as growth periods during up cycles, always with the same steady demeanor and a deep commitment to safety and operational excellence. Put simply, we would not be where we are today without Bill's many contributions. Amongst Bill's most important achievements has been his ability to build strong teams, which has greatly facilitated our succession planning process.
Mark Burns, who most of you know, will succeed Bill in August as EVP and Chief Operating Officer. Mark is an industry veteran who has reported to Bill for several years, and we anticipate a very smooth transition, especially given Mark's strong leadership skills. 
Steve Brady will succeed Mark as Senior Vice President of our Western Hemisphere. Stave has worked for Ensco for many years and has led all of our Eastern Hemisphere business units during his career. I'm confident Steve will do an excellent job in his new position. Julian Hall will replace Steve as Vice President of Europe and the Mediterranean, and Derek Kent has been promoted to Vice President of the Middle East and Africa business unit. 
We also promoted Jay Swent, our CFO, to Executive Vice President. You all know Jay from our investor events and earnings calls, and Jay's promotion to EVP recognizes his many contributions to Ensco's success, including our re-domestication and acquisition. Jay has also added human resources and supply chain to his other responsibilities, and Jay will now be based in Houston where he will be leading most of our corporate departments. Kevin Robert, Senior Vice President of Marketing, will be relocating to our corporate headquarters here in London. 
Turning now to other highlights during the quarter, we ordered 2 additional drillships underscoring our positive outlook for deepwater in the coming years based on very strong customer demand. In total, we now have 7 rigs under construction that will drive earnings and cash flow growth well into the future. ENSCO 8505, our newest rig, commenced its initial 2-year contract with Anadarko, Appache and Noble Energy in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. All 3 operators are repeat customers of our 8500 Series rigs, and we plan to exceed their expectations once again as we have in the past. 
In the second quarter, our 8500 Series fleet achieved 96% utilization, highlighting the many benefits from standardization. In Singapore, we held our naming ceremony for ENSCO 8506 that is contracted to Anadarko at $530,000 per day for 2.5 years. The new rig will commence its term contract in the fourth quarter of this year. 
We did have above-average unplanned downtime in Brazil during the second quarter on our deepwater rigs so we can't declare victory yet. But overall, I believe we've made progress by sharing lessons learned and leveraging the advantages of standardization across our rigs as evidenced by the improvement on our Deepwater segment utilization to 91% in the second quarter. 
Turning now to Jackup segment highlights. All of our actively marketed jackups are contracted and market utilization reached 92% in the second quarter. High levels of utilization in turn are driving the increase in average day rates that Jay will discuss in a moment. As part of our ongoing high-grading strategy, we sold 2 additional cold stacked jackups during the second quarter, bringing our 3-year total to 7 rigs sold. This leaves us with just 4 cold stacked rigs in our fleet. The other part of our high-grading strategy is newbuild construction, and our 3 ENSCO 120 Series jackups being built in Singapore are on schedule for the deliveries next year and 2014. 
Now let me discuss the markets. I'll begin with Deepwater. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the ultra-deepwater fleet industry wide is 100% contracted, and the availability of other deepwater floaters is almost nonexistent in 2012 and well into 2013. Operators have adapted to the longer permitting process and more opportunities to continue to surface. 
In Mexico, PEMEX is preparing to commence exploration drilling in the ultra-deepwater Perdido Fold Belt just south of the U.S. border. While PEMEX is a new player in the deepwater market, they are very focused on offsetting declines in the production from shallow water and onshore fields. 
In Brazil, although lower production quarters for OGX and Petrobras recently have been announced, we anticipate that independent operators may become more active in Brazil. Also, it appears Petrobras will proceed with their plans to come to the market this year to add additional rigs. 
The African ultra-deepwater market remains extremely strong. With available supply rapidly evaporating, recent day rates are now in the high $500,000s to low $600,000 range. The tightness in the ultra-deepwater sector is having a positive effect on the deepwater fleet, which has become more competitive and has put upward pressure on day rates worldwide. The Asian deepwater market remains tight with no surplus capacity in 2012. 
Floater activity in the Mediterranean is set to increase next year driven by opportunities offshore Egypt and Israel. We know of operators with tenders that have been canceled since they were unable to secure rig time in Egypt. 
Moving to Midwater, Ensco's smallest segment with just 6 rigs, their market remains challenging with most rigs working on terms of less than 1 year. However, there are opportunities in the North Sea which remains strong with improving day rates, and short-term programs are appearing in Southeast Asia, West Africa and the Mexico-Latin American market. 
Turning to the jackup markets. All regions are experiencing strong demand. Average day rates have climbed, and operators are offering longer-term contracts. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, marketed rigs are 100% contracted for premium jackups like Ensco's. There is healthy demand as suggested by the increasing day rates and increasing backlogs that we have seen recently. The majority of Ensco's jackup fleet is presently drilling for oil, so we are not impacted by low U.S. gas prices. We anticipate the premium jackup market will continue to be very tight as operators lock in rigs on long-term contracts. 
In Mexico, PEMEX awarded 4 contracts during the quarter, and they are continuing their pursuit to increase their jackup fleet to 40 units before the end of the year. Much of the contracting is being done through direct negotiations. 
In the North Sea, jackup utilization and day rates have continued to trend upward with full utilization for active, standard-duty jackups in 2012 and scarce availability in 2013. The 12-rig, non-Norwegian, heavy-duty fleet is contracted through to 2012, and we expect that these jackups will absorb some of the overflow projects from the U.K. semi market, which is effectively booked through 2013 and now, also for 2014. We don't have any jackups in the Mediterranean which has been a difficult market. But we are monitoring opportunities in Libya, and due to success in Israel and Cyprus, the Lebanese government is expected to hold the licensing round in 2013. 
The African market has tightened in recent months with 14 new fixtures and options exercise during the quarter. Eight of these fixtures were term commitments of 1 year or longer. Only 4 of the 12 jackups potentially available this year are outfitted to work in water depths of 350 feet or more. The recent uptick in term fixtures has left near-term availability in short supply and has helped boost day rates. 
Opportunities exist in Gabon, Nigeria, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire and the Congo. In the Middle East, operator interest is picking up and tendering activity is no longer dominated by Saudi Aramco. A number of operators have outstanding requirements, and we expect contract awards to be announced imminently. In Qatar, Maersk is evaluating bids for its 5-rig jackup requirement with 2-year firm terms. Commencement dates range from late this year to early next. Opportunities also exist in the surrounding vicinity. 
Moving to the Asia Pacific market. Activity remains tight with high-spec jackups reaching 100% utilization in the second quarter. Despite the influx of rigs brought in from outside Asia to fill the demand, rates have continued their upward trend. Some operators are starting to defer their programs due to the lack of rig availability in anticipation of newbuilds that will be delivered starting in late 2012 and beyond. We anticipate this market to remain balanced at the beginning of 2013. 
To summarize, customer demand is growing, and there is limited near-term supply of new rigs. This has driven up average day rates for both Deepwater and Jackup segments. Exploration and appraisal success, new deepwater basins and healthy commodity prices are all positive indications for long-term growth. All these factors bode well for Ensco and put us in a great position to meet incremental customer demand that has been rising. 
Before I hand it over to Jay, I want to make a brief comment about safety. For those of you who attended our Investor Day in April, including the ENSCO 8505 rig tour, I'm sure you came away with a very strong impression about the importance of safety at Ensco. 
In May, less than a week after our last earnings call, I was alerted that a helicopter flying to our ENSCO 102 jackup rig was forced to land in the North Sea. Seven of the 14 people on board were Ensco employees. Fortunately, as additional reports came in, we learned that the helicopter pilot did a textbook landing on the water, the passengers and the crews safely got into life rafts and rescue workers brought everyone back to shore without injury. 
Safety training is an integral part of our daily lives at Ensco, and I want to recognize our employees as well as the other people on board the helicopter that day, especially the crew, who applied their training and got everybody back to shore safely. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jay."

Today I'm going to cover highlights of our second quarter results, the outlook for the third quarter and our financial position. We provided information on our earnings release, which should assist you in making certain year-to-year comparisons related to our acquisition. Therefore, my comments today will focus mainly on factors such as the growth of our fleet and rising utilization and average day rates that positively influenced the comparisons between periods. 
Now let's start with second quarter results versus prior year. Earnings were $1.47 per share, up from $0.59 a year ago. As noted in our earnings release, there were a few items that influenced that comparisons. In contract drilling expense, warranty claims received in the quarter increased earnings by $0.10 per share, and gains from the disposition of cold stacked jackup rigs increased earnings by $0.06 per share this quarter and $0.02 per share a year ago. In addition, acquisition-related costs reduced earnings a year ago by $0.14 per share, in which $0.13 was in general and administrative expense and $0.01 was in contract drilling expense. 
Total revenue for the quarter was just above $1 billion compared to $564 million a year ago. Excluding the effect of the acquisition, revenues grew 44% year-over-year. Deepwater revenues increased from $232 million to $572 million, and excluding the effect of the acquisition, grew by 71% due to the addition of ENSCO 8504 to the fleet, significantly higher utilization and average day rates and the reactivation of ENSCO 7500 late last year, following upgrades completed during 2011. 
Midwater revenues were $101 million, all related to the acquisition. The average day rate was $227,000 compared to $237,000 a year ago, and utilization was unchanged at 79%. Jackup segment revenues increased by approximately 31% due to an increase in both utilization and the average day rate. Jackup utilization for the entire fleet in the second quarter was 83%, up from 75% a year ago. As Dan noted, utilization for our marketed rigs, all of which are contracted, was 92% in the second quarter. The average day rate increased 6% to $105,000 as shown in our earnings release. 
Turning now to contract drilling expense. For all segments, the total was $490 million, up from $286 million in the second quarter 2011. Excluding the effect of our acquisition, contract drilling expense increased $72 million or 37% year-over-year, mostly related to significantly improved utilization in the Deepwater and Jackup segments, the reactivation of ENSCO 7500 and the addition of ENSCO 8504 to the active fleet. Also, unit labor costs increased year-over-year in line with our expectations. Compared to our prior outlook, contract drilling expense came in lower than expected due mostly to $22 million of warranty claims recognized in the quarter and $13 million of gains related to the sale of 2 cold stacked jackup rigs. 
General and administrative expense for the quarter was $36 million, down from $38 million last quarter and $47 million last year. Please note, last year's number included acquisition-related expenses as noted in our press release. The effective tax rate in the second quarter was 10.5%. Adjusted for discrete tax items that benefited results, the effective tax rate was 11.2% in line with our guidance for the full year. 
Now let's discuss quarterly trends by comparing second quarter 2012 sequentially to first quarter 2012. Second quarter revenue increased 4%, mostly attributable to a $23 million or 4% increase in Deepwater segment revenues driven by a 4 percentage point increase in deepwater utilization to 91%, combined with the $7,000 increase in the average day rate. In addition, we had a $13 million or 3% increase in Jackup segment revenues driven by a $6,000 increase in the average day rate. Midwater segment revenues increased $10 million due to an 11 percentage point increase in utilization as ENSCO 5002 commenced a new contract following a planned shipyard stay in the first quarter of this year. 
Total contract drilling expense decreased $31 million sequentially from the first quarter. Adjusted for the warranty claims and the gains from the jackup sales that I just mentioned, contract drilling expense was up approximately $5 million or about 1%. Looking at other expenses, depreciation was flat compared to the first quarter, and G&A expense decreased about $3 million. 
Now let's discuss third quarter outlook. Based on our current projections, revenues are expected to increase approximately 3% from the second quarter. Deepwater segment revenue is projected to increase approximately 9% primarily due to further improvement in the average day rate and ENSCO 8505 commencing its initial contract late in the second quarter. 
For Midwater, our smallest segment, revenue should be essentially unchanged. For Jackups, the average reported day rate will increase further based on contracts already in place. However, utilization is expected to decline slightly in the third quarter due to planned shipyard stays. As noted in our most recent Fleet Status Report, 8 rigs will be in the shipyard for planned upgrades or regular inspections during the third quarter. 
We anticipate third quarter 2012 total contract drilling expense will be up approximately $65 million from the second quarter. Adjusted for the warranty and rig sale items in the second quarter, contract drilling expense should be up about 6% due impart to ENSCO 8505 operating for the full third quarter and higher repair and maintenance costs for the rigs with planned shipyard stays. 
Depreciation expense is expected to increase approximately $6 million primarily due to the commencement of ENSCO 8505. We anticipate general and administrative expense will decline further to about $32 million in the third quarter. For the full year, we expect to achieve our $50 million synergy target for G&A expense as planned. Other expense is anticipated to be approximately $26 million, $31 million from interest expense, partially offset by $5 million of interest income. Overall, we feel very good about our total synergy target of $100 million for 2012, which includes $50 million from contract drilling expense. 
Full year 2012 capital spending is forecasted to be about $1.9 billion. The anticipated breakdown is as follows: $1.3 billion for newbuild rigs, $380 million for rig enhancement projects and $250 million for sustaining projects. We have already invested $1 billion through June 30, so remaining capital expenditures are estimated to be about $900 million for the balance of the year. 
In terms of our financial position, we ended the second quarter with a 30% leverage ratio and $10 billion of revenue backlog. In total, we have more than 100 rig years of contracted revenue backlog. Our strong financial position, coupled with our positive outlook for customer demand and future cash flows, prompted our decision to commit an additional $1.3 billion to expand our fleet with 2 new drillships. We expect to see significant growth opportunities as market-wide utilization and average day rates increase, and we feel very good about contracting opportunities for our 7 rigs under construction. 
During the quarter, we converted back to an ordinary share listing on the NYSE, so we are now fully eligible to be reinstated in the S&P 500 Index. Costs to complete the conversion were included in the second quarter G&A expense. 
In closing, as Dan mentioned, I have now added responsibilities for human resources and supply chain in addition to my responsibilities as CFO, and I'm moving to Houston. I'm very excited by all of these changes. Winning the battle for talent and forging strong relationships with our vendors will be key ingredients to working safely and minimizing downtime, both of which are important success factors for the future. Ensco is committed to world-class performance in all of these areas. 
Now I will turn the call back over to Sean."

In fac",302,"I guess, Jud, let me maybe preface the answer with a couple of points. One is we're really comfortable today with our current debt structure and our leverage ratio, got down to 30% this quarter. So we're not feeling pressured to reduce debt at all. In fact, as you know, it makes for a very efficient balance sheet. So we don't feel like we need to be investing heavily in debt reduction in the near term. I think the other point I'd make is historically, we've invested heavily in fleet renewal, and our fleet is in great shape today. So our future capital investments are really primarily directed to newbuilds and those generate growth for us. We are not having to spend a lot of cash in the next several years renewing our existing fleet. So all of our -- most of our investment there will go to growth. If you look at the cash profile for the company for the future, it really does allow us a lot of flexibility to allocate capital wherever we choose to. And as I said, I think we can very efficiently allocate it to growth, and we can very efficiently allocate it to dividends as well. As you know, we increased the dividend to $1.50 in the first quarter. There was a 7% increase there. So I think we're well positioned, as we like to say, we're in investor meetings. We're a great income and a great growth story today, and I think we'll continue to be that. I think obviously, how we decide to allocate capital between dividends and growth in the future is going to depend on the facts and circumstances at the time. But all options are on the table. I think with that, I managed not to answer your timing question."

We've seen some pretty healthy rates for rigs with availability, really all the way up through 2013 and not a whole lot quite yet extending into '14. Is that somewhat of a mental barrier at this point from an operator standpoint? I guess what I'm trying to get at is, are the types of rate discussions at those same levels even for those rigs going right up to the end of '13? Or do we have to continue to see the market tighten and get a little closer and continue to see those rigs get snapped up?"

As you look at the availability of ultra-deepwater equipment, even just looking at the newbuilds, there's only about 10 newbuilds uncontracted left for delivery in 2013, and I think 8 or 9 of those are very close to getting a job. So just as the market develops, I think we're going to naturally see some '14 contracts and some -- more '14 timeframes for tenders coming from clients. And that's not only in response to lack of rigs, but it's also just in response to the lead time that clients are taking to get out there and get these projects figured out because they've also got to have subsea equipment, they got to have production equipment. So really, the natural cycle is requiring they get out there that far in advance."

So I think in terms of our ability to get our job done, we feel very comfortable about it. There's certainly a huge number of people that have to come in to this industry. The big crew change that everybody talked about I don't think has turned out to be quite as dramatic as it was expected, but we are -- I think everybody is seeing some level of retirements out of the industry.

We do want to maintain a balanced portfolio and have a nice exposure to the more near-term markets as well as look at rigs that work really well for clients that have long-term programs. A number of our clients are planning business 10, 15 years out. So that does give you opportunity to enter into long-term contracts. And at the same time, when you look at the 8500 Series rigs, we've talked to clients about terms anywhere from 2 to 5 years on those rigs as well. So I don't think it's a function of the rig as much as it is the business that the client is chasing and kind of his program.

Before Jay takes us through the financial results, I will discuss second quarter highlights and the state of our markets. Before I do though, I'd like to take a moment to extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to someone who has been a major contributor to Ensco's success from the first day we opened our doors for business. 
Bill Chadwick, our Chief Operating Officer, will be retiring from Ensco in August after 25 years of service to our company. Bill has guided us through challenging periods on our history during down cycles as well as growth periods during up cycles, always with the same steady demeanor and a deep commitment to safety and operational excellence. Put simply, we would not be where we are today without Bill's many contributions. Amongst Bill's most important achievements has been his ability to build strong teams, which has greatly facilitated our succession planning process.
Mark Burns, who most of you know, will succeed Bill in August as EVP and Chief Operating Officer. Mark is an industry veteran who has reported to Bill for several years, and we anticipate a very smooth transition, especially given Mark's strong leadership skills. 
Steve Brady will succeed Mark as Senior Vice President of our Western Hemisphere. Stave has worked for Ensco for many years and has led all of our Eastern Hemisphere business units during his career. I'm confident Steve will do an excellent job in his new position. Julian Hall will replace Steve as Vice President of Europe and the Mediterranean, and Derek Kent has been promoted to Vice President of the Middle East and Africa business unit. 
We also promoted Jay Swent, our CFO, to Executive Vice President. You all know Jay from our investor events and earnings calls, and Jay's promotion to EVP recognizes his many contributions to Ensco's success, including our re-domestication and acquisition. Jay has also added human resources and supply chain to his other responsibilities, and Jay will now be based in Houston where he will be leading most of our corporate departments. Kevin Robert, Senior Vice President of Marketing, will be relocating to our corporate headquarters here in London. 
Turning now to other highlights during the quarter, we ordered 2 additional drillships underscoring our positive outlook for deepwater in the coming years based on very strong customer demand. In total, we now have 7 rigs under construction that will drive earnings and cash flow growth well into the future. ENSCO 8505, our newest rig, commenced its initial 2-year contract with Anadarko, Appache and Noble Energy in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. All 3 operators are repeat customers of our 8500 Series rigs, and we plan to exceed their expectations once again as we have in the past. 
In the second quarter, our 8500 Series fleet achieved 96% utilization, highlighting the many benefits from standardization. In Singapore, we held our naming ceremony for ENSCO 8506 that is contracted to Anadarko at $530,000 per day for 2.5 years. The new rig will commence its term contract in the fourth quarter of this year. 
We did have above-average unplanned downtime in Brazil during the second quarter on our deepwater rigs so we can't declare victory yet. But overall, I believe we've made progress by sharing lessons learned and leveraging the advantages of standardization across our rigs as evidenced by the improvement on our Deepwater segment utilization to 91% in the second quarter. 
Turning now to Jackup segment highlights. All of our actively marketed jackups are contracted and market utilization reached 92% in the second quarter. High levels of utilization in turn are driving the increase in average day rates that Jay will discuss in a moment. As part of our ongoing high-grading strategy, we sold 2 additional cold stacked jackups during the second quarter, bringing our 3-year total to 7 rigs sold. This leaves us with just 4 cold stacked rigs in our fleet. The other part of our high-grading strategy is newbuild construction, and our 3 ENSCO 120 Series jackups being built in Singapore are on schedule for the deliveries next year and 2014. 
Now let me discuss the markets. I'll begin with Deepwater. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the ultra-deepwater fleet industry wide is 100% contracted, and the availability of other deepwater floaters is almost nonexistent in 2012 and well into 2013. Operators have adapted to the longer permitting process and more opportunities to continue to surface. 
In Mexico, PEMEX is preparing to commence exploration drilling in the ultra-deepwater Perdido Fold Belt just south of the U.S. border. While PEMEX is a new player in the deepwater market, they are very focused on offsetting declines in the production from shallow water and onshore fields. 
In Brazil, although lower production quarters for OGX and Petrobras recently have been announced, we anticipate that independent operators may become more active in Brazil. Also, it appears Petrobras will proceed with their plans to come to the market this year to add additional rigs. 
The African ultra-deepwater market remains extremely strong. With available supply rapidly evaporating, recent day rates are now in the high $500,000s to low $600,000 range. The tightness in the ultra-deepwater sector is having a positive effect on the deepwater fleet, which has become more competitive and has put upward pressure on day rates worldwide. The Asian deepwater market remains tight with no surplus capacity in 2012. 
Floater activity in the Mediterranean is set to increase next year driven by opportunities offshore Egypt and Israel. We know of operators with tenders that have been canceled since they were unable to secure rig time in Egypt. 
Moving to Midwater, Ensco's smallest segment with just 6 rigs, their market remains challenging with most rigs working on terms of less than 1 year. However, there are opportunities in the North Sea which remains strong with improving day rates, and short-term programs are appearing in Southeast Asia, West Africa and the Mexico-Latin American market. 
Turning to the jackup markets. All regions are experiencing strong demand. Average day rates have climbed, and operators are offering longer-term contracts. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, marketed rigs are 100% contracted for premium jackups like Ensco's. There is healthy demand as suggested by the increasing day rates and increasing backlogs that we have seen recently. The majority of Ensco's jackup fleet is presently drilling for oil, so we are not impacted by low U.S. gas prices. We anticipate the premium jackup market will continue to be very tight as operators lock in rigs on long-term contracts. 
In Mexico, PEMEX awarded 4 contracts during the quarter, and they are continuing their pursuit to increase their jackup fleet to 40 units before the end of the year. Much of the contracting is being done through direct negotiations. 
In the North Sea, jackup utilization and day rates have continued to trend upward with full utilization for active, standard-duty jackups in 2012 and scarce availability in 2013. The 12-rig, non-Norwegian, heavy-duty fleet is contracted through to 2012, and we expect that these jackups will absorb some of the overflow projects from the U.K. semi market, which is effectively booked through 2013 and now, also for 2014. We don't have any jackups in the Mediterranean which has been a difficult market. But we are monitoring opportunities in Libya, and due to success in Israel and Cyprus, the Lebanese government is expected to hold the licensing round in 2013. 
The African market has tightened in recent months with 14 new fixtures and options exercise during the quarter. Eight of these fixtures were term commitments of 1 year or longer. Only 4 of the 12 jackups potentially available this year are outfitted to work in water depths of 350 feet or more. The recent uptick in term fixtures has left near-term availability in short supply and has helped boost day rates. 
Opportunities exist in Gabon, Nigeria, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire and the Congo. In the Middle East, operator interest is picking up and tendering activity is no longer dominated by Saudi Aramco. A number of operators have outstanding requirements, and we expect contract awards to be announced imminently. In Qatar, Maersk is evaluating bids for its 5-rig jackup requirement with 2-year firm terms. Commencement dates range from late this year to early next. Opportunities also exist in the surrounding vicinity. 
Moving to the Asia Pacific market. Activity remains tight with high-spec jackups reaching 100% utilization in the second quarter. Despite the influx of rigs brought in from outside Asia to fill the demand, rates have continued their upward trend. Some operators are starting to defer their programs due to the lack of rig availability in anticipation of newbuilds that will be delivered starting in late 2012 and beyond. We anticipate this market to remain balanced at the beginning of 2013. 
To summarize, customer demand is growing, and there is limited near-term supply of new rigs. This has driven up average day rates for both Deepwater and Jackup segments. Exploration and appraisal success, new deepwater basins and healthy commodity prices are all positive indications for long-term growth. All these factors bode well for Ensco and put us in a great position to meet incremental customer demand that has been rising. 
Before I hand it over to Jay, I want to make a brief comment about safety. For those of you who attended our Investor Day in April, including the ENSCO 8505 rig tour, I'm sure you came away with a very strong impression about the importance of safety at Ensco. 
In May, less than a week after our last earnings call, I was alerted that a helicopter flying to our ENSCO 102 jackup rig was forced to land in the North Sea. Seven of the 14 people on board were Ensco employees. Fortunately, as additional reports came in, we learned that the helicopter pilot did a textbook landing on the water, the passengers and the crews safely got into life rafts and rescue workers brought everyone back to shore without injury. 
Safety training is an integral part of our daily lives at Ensco, and I want to recognize our employees as well as the other people on board the helicopter that day, especially the crew, who applied their training and got everybody back to shore safely. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jay."
269488,212748387,335988,"Ensco plc, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, Dan.

Today I'm going to cover highlights of our second quarter results, the outlook for the third quarter and our financial position. We provided information on our earnings release, which should assist you in making certain year-to-year comparisons related to our acquisition. Therefore, my comments today will focus mainly on factors such as the growth of our fleet and rising utilization and average day rates that positively influenced the comparisons between periods. 
Now let's start with second quarter results versus prior year. Earnings were $1.47 per share, up from $0.59 a year ago. As noted in our earnings release, there were a few items that influenced that comparisons. In contract drilling expense, warranty claims received in the quarter increased earnings by $0.10 per share, and gains from the disposition of cold stacked jackup rigs increased earnings by $0.06 per share this quarter and $0.02 per share a year ago. In addition, acquisition-related costs reduced earnings a year ago by $0.14 per share, in which $0.13 was in general and administrative expense and $0.01 was in contract drilling expense. 
Total revenue for the quarter was just above $1 billion compared to $564 million a year ago. Excluding the effect of the acquisition, revenues grew 44% year-over-year. Deepwater revenues increased from $232 million to $572 million, and excluding the effect of the acquisition, grew by 71% due to the addition of ENSCO 8504 to the fleet, significantly higher utilization and average day rates and the reactivation of ENSCO 7500 late last year, following upgrades completed during 2011. 
Midwater revenues were $101 million, all related to the acquisition. The average day rate was $227,000 compared to $237,000 a year ago, and utilization was unchanged at 79%. Jackup segment revenues increased by approximately 31% due to an increase in both utilization and the average day rate. Jackup utilization for the entire fleet in the second quarter was 83%, up from 75% a year ago. As Dan noted, utilization for our marketed rigs, all of which are contracted, was 92% in the second quarter. The average day rate increased 6% to $105,000 as shown in our earnings release. 
Turning now to contract drilling expense. For all segments, the total was $490 million, up from $286 million in the second quarter 2011. Excluding the effect of our acquisition, contract drilling expense increased $72 million or 37% year-over-year, mostly related to significantly improved utilization in the Deepwater and Jackup segments, the reactivation of ENSCO 7500 and the addition of ENSCO 8504 to the active fleet. Also, unit labor costs increased year-over-year in line with our expectations. Compared to our prior outlook, contract drilling expense came in lower than expected due mostly to $22 million of warranty claims recognized in the quarter and $13 million of gains related to the sale of 2 cold stacked jackup rigs. 
General and administrative expense for the quarter was $36 million, down from $38 million last quarter and $47 million last year. Please note, last year's number included acquisition-related expenses as noted in our press release. The effective tax rate in the second quarter was 10.5%. Adjusted for discrete tax items that benefited results, the effective tax rate was 11.2% in line with our guidance for the full year. 
Now let's discuss quarterly trends by comparing second quarter 2012 sequentially to first quarter 2012. Second quarter revenue increased 4%, mostly attributable to a $23 million or 4% increase in Deepwater segment revenues driven by a 4 percentage point increase in deepwater utilization to 91%, combined with the $7,000 increase in the average day rate. In addition, we had a $13 million or 3% increase in Jackup segment revenues driven by a $6,000 increase in the average day rate. Midwater segment revenues increased $10 million due to an 11 percentage point increase in utilization as ENSCO 5002 commenced a new contract following a planned shipyard stay in the first quarter of this year. 
Total contract drilling expense decreased $31 million sequentially from the first quarter. Adjusted for the warranty claims and the gains from the jackup sales that I just mentioned, contract drilling expense was up approximately $5 million or about 1%. Looking at other expenses, depreciation was flat compared to the first quarter, and G&A expense decreased about $3 million. 
Now let's discuss third quarter outlook. Based on our current projections, revenues are expected to increase approximately 3% from the second quarter. Deepwater segment revenue is projected to increase approximately 9% primarily due to further improvement in the average day rate and ENSCO 8505 commencing its initial contract late in the second quarter. 
For Midwater, our smallest segment, revenue should be essentially unchanged. For Jackups, the average reported day rate will increase further based on contracts already in place. However, utilization is expected to decline slightly in the third quarter due to planned shipyard stays. As noted in our most recent Fleet Status Report, 8 rigs will be in the shipyard for planned upgrades or regular inspections during the third quarter. 
We anticipate third quarter 2012 total contract drilling expense will be up approximately $65 million from the second quarter. Adjusted for the warranty and rig sale items in the second quarter, contract drilling expense should be up about 6% due impart to ENSCO 8505 operating for the full third quarter and higher repair and maintenance costs for the rigs with planned shipyard stays. 
Depreciation expense is expected to increase approximately $6 million primarily due to the commencement of ENSCO 8505. We anticipate general and administrative expense will decline further to about $32 million in the third quarter. For the full year, we expect to achieve our $50 million synergy target for G&A expense as planned. Other expense is anticipated to be approximately $26 million, $31 million from interest expense, partially offset by $5 million of interest income. Overall, we feel very good about our total synergy target of $100 million for 2012, which includes $50 million from contract drilling expense. 
Full year 2012 capital spending is forecasted to be about $1.9 billion. The anticipated breakdown is as follows: $1.3 billion for newbuild rigs, $380 million for rig enhancement projects and $250 million for sustaining projects. We have already invested $1 billion through June 30, so remaining capital expenditures are estimated to be about $900 million for the balance of the year. 
In terms of our financial position, we ended the second quarter with a 30% leverage ratio and $10 billion of revenue backlog. In total, we have more than 100 rig years of contracted revenue backlog. Our strong financial position, coupled with our positive outlook for customer demand and future cash flows, prompted our decision to commit an additional $1.3 billion to expand our fleet with 2 new drillships. We expect to see significant growth opportunities as market-wide utilization and average day rates increase, and we feel very good about contracting opportunities for our 7 rigs under construction. 
During the quarter, we converted back to an ordinary share listing on the NYSE, so we are now fully eligible to be reinstated in the S&P 500 Index. Costs to complete the conversion were included in the second quarter G&A expense. 
In closing, as Dan mentioned, I have now added responsibilities for human resources and supply chain in addition to my responsibilities as CFO, and I'm moving to Houston. I'm very excited by all of these changes. Winning the battle for talent and forging strong relationships with our vendors will be key ingredients to working safely and minimizing downtime, both of which are important success factors for the future. Ensco is committed to world-class performance in all of these areas. 
Now I will turn the call back over to Sean."

One is we're really comfortable today with our current debt structure and our leverage ratio, got down to 30% this quarter. So we're not feeling pressured to reduce debt at all. In fact, as you know, it makes for a very efficient balance sheet. So we don't feel like we need to be investing heavily in debt reduction in the near term. I think the other point I'd make is historically, we've invested heavily in fleet renewal, and our fleet is in great shape today. So our future capital investments are really primarily directed to newbuilds and those generate growth for us. We are not having to spend a lot of cash in the next several years renewing our existing fleet. So all of our -- most of our investment there will go to growth. If you look at the cash profile for the company for the future, it really does allow us a lot of flexibility to allocate capital wherever we choose to. And as I said, I think we can very efficiently allocate it to growth, and we can very efficiently allocate it to dividends as well. As you know, we increased the dividend to $1.50 in the first quarter. There was a 7% increase there. So I think we're well positioned, as we like to say, we're in investor meetings. We're a great income and a great growth story today, and I think we'll continue to be that. I think obviously, how we decide to allocate capital between dividends and growth in the future is going to depend on the facts and circumstances at the time. But all options are on the table. I think with that, I managed not to answer your timing question."

We do want to maintain a balanced portfolio and have a nice exposure to the more near-term markets as well as look at rigs that work really well for clients that have long-term programs. A number of our clients are planning business 10, 15 years out. So that does give you opportunity to enter into long-term contracts. And at the same time, when you look at the 8500 Series rigs, we've talked to clients about terms anywhere from 2 to 5 years on those rigs as well. So I don't think it's a function of the rig as much as it is the business that the client is chasing and kind of his program.

Before Jay takes us through the financial results, I will discuss third quarter highlights and the state of our markets. In terms of highlights, I want to congratulate our capital projects team in Singapore for successfully delivering our seventh and final ENSCO 8500 Series rig during the quarter. They've done a terrific job managing this multibillion dollar investment project beginning with the first rig rate back in 2005. Given the commitment to operational excellence and exceeding expectations, Ensco has been recognized for one of the best on-time and on-budget newbuild records in our industry. 
ENSCO 8506, the final rig in the series is contracted to Anadarko at $530,000 per day for 2.5 years and will commence its term contract in early January. It is the third rig in the 8500 Series that will be working for Anadarko, a tremendous endorsement excellent delivered to Anadarko over the past few years. 
During the third quarter, our 8500 Series fleet achieved 99% utilization for rigs working at least 6 months, highlighting the many benefits of standardization. ENSCO 8505, which commenced drilling operations last quarter has experienced some downtime on its first wells due to startup issues as reflected in our most recent Fleet Status Report. But we anticipate the rig will quickly improve its uptime and in line with the other 8500 Series rigs.
The capital project teams in Singapore and South Korea will continue to be busy as they manage the construction of our ENSCO 120 Series jackups and our ultra-deepwater drillships, which will drive Ensco's revenue and earnings growth well into the future. I'm also pleased to report ENSCO DS-6 has completed its upgrades in Singapore. The rig will commence its 5-year term contract in Angola with BP in January. 
New construction is a key element of Ensco's continuous high-grading strategy but so our sales of less capable rigs. As we noted in our recent Fleet Status Report, we sold 2 more assets, a jackup rig and a barge rig. We have sold 9 rigs and now have only 3 cold stacked jackup rigs remaining in the fleet. All of our actively marketed jackups are contracted and marketed at utilization was 92% in the third quarter.
As utilization has risen, so as average day rates for the jackup segment. We expect this trend to continue due in large part of the contracts already in place. For some time, Ensco has had the largest number of active premium jackup rigs. Now given the recent divestiture by one of our competitors, Ensco is the leading provider of premium jackups worldwide. 
Before I turn to a discussion of the markets, I also want to recognize our North and South America business unit for a job well done managing through Hurricane Isaac. We had 18 rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico at the time of the hurricane and our operations and support team did an excellent job implementing our severe weather plans. No one was injured. There was no significant damage to our rigs and there was no financial impact. These outcomes are the result of effective planning and execution by our employees, as well as close collaboration with our customers.
Now let me discuss the markets. I'll begin with deepwater. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the deepwater fleet industrywide is 100% contracted through 2012 and well into 2013. The demand for deepwater floaters has added 10 rigs to this market from a year ago and we expect the positive trend to continue for at least the next several years. Permitting process has improved significantly and more deepwater permits are being granted. 
In Mexico, PEMEX has not announced to increase the deepwater fleet however, they have publicly announced the need for deepwater drilling to offset declines production from shallow water and onshore fields. The successful new discovers like the recent announcement of a new deepwater natural gas find we can only surmise sometime in the future, this market will require more deepwater assets. 
In Brazil, several short and long-term programs have outstanding tenders from multiple operators. Petrobras added 8 ultra-deepwater rigs to their fleet this year and 3 more units are expected to finalize acceptance testing before the end of the year. We anticipate that independent operators may become more active in Brazil for the continued exploration success pursue the production sharing agreement and if approved, potential licensing around next year for oil and gas and pre-salt blocks.
The African ultra-deepwater market remains extremely strong, with uncommitted time the virtually nonexistent until 2015. The discovery is being announced often in Africa. The future is promising for ultra-deepwater assets. Tightness in the African deepwater ultra segment is possibly affecting the deepwater fleet, adding upward pressure to day rates. There are a number of deepwater rigs that will have availability in 2013, but we expect that demand will keep the market balance.
In Asian and Australian market, we believe the demand for deepwater floaters will increase in 2013. There are a few multi-year programs that have yet to be awarded and our customers are also talking about potential ultra-deepwater work commencing in 2014. We currently expect ENSCO 8504 to be available in January of next year to remain in Asia, and we are in advanced discussions with customers about long-term programs. 
Moving to Midwater. Ensco's smallest segment with just 6 rigs, the market remains challenging, but there are signs of improvement. There are opportunities in the North Sea with the U.K. semi market, which is effectively booked to 2013 and into 2014. More short-term programs are surfacing in Southeast Asia, still, India, Egypt, Libya, West Africa and the Mexico Latin American market. In Brazil, last week, we extended our existing contract with Petrobras for ENSCO 6000 by 1-year to April 2014 at a rate of $275,000 per day, a $75,000 increase to the current rate. ENSCO 5005, which has been contracted to Petrobras through April of next year is now mobilizing to Singapore for a planned inspection and shipyard upgrades that will extend them into the second quarter of next year.
While certain operators in Brazil have reduced their demand for midwater drilling rigs, we don't believe this is a long-term trend since the midwater geology in Brazil continues to support additional drilling by capable midwater assets. 
Turning to the jackup markets. Activity continues to be robust. Almost all regions see higher utilization and in competition for assets has pushed day rates higher. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the premium jackup fleet is 100% utilized, and new contract rates for premium jackups are in excess of $100,000 per day. Rigs that roll off contracts are quickly awarded you were, often for 6 to 18 month terms. We anticipate the premium jackup market will continue to be strong into 2013. 
In Mexico, PEMEX continues to attract rigs from around the world and their efforts to increase their jackup fleet to 40-plus units. Currently, they have 25 rigs working with 10 contracts expiring before year-end. We anticipate the majority of these rigs weeks will be awarded further work through direct associations. 
In the North Sea, where most of Ensco's fleet is fully contracted through the 2013, only a limited supply of standard duty jackups will become available in the third and fourth quarters of next year. In 2013, we anticipate that several newbuild units, including our ENSCO 120 jackup will enter the region. They should be easily absorbed based on the number of new inquiries for work starting in 2013 and 2014 and as operators evaluate jackups to handle overflow projects from the U.K., semi market.
We don't have any jackups in the Mediterranean, which has been a difficult market. With a lack of long-term opportunity and ongoing political instability, we do not anticipate improvement anytime soon. 
The African market has tightened in recent months and we expect that the market will be balanced into 2013. There are currently 8 tenders or pretenders outstanding for 2012 projects and approximately 7 more for 2013. 
In the Middle East, utilization reached 95%, up from 86% a year ago. Incremental demand is expected in Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar. 
Moving to the Asia Pacific market, activity remains tight with we jackup utilization exceeding 96% in the third quarter. There is an upward convergence in day rates for standard and high-spec breaks due to the lack of supply. Jackup demand is forecasted to continue increasing in 2013 with a number of incremental long-term projects from several operators.
Australia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Indonesia are actively seeking investment in their countries' reserved, which we believe will underpin drilling in the region for years to come and absorb a newbuild rigs as they are delivered. 
To summarize, customer demand continues to rise and there is a limited near-term supply of new rigs. This has driven up average day rates for both our deepwater and Jackup segments. Exploration and appraisal success, 2 [ph] deepwater basins and healthy commodity prices are all positive indications for long-term growth. All of these factors bode well for Ensco and put us on a great position to meet incremental customer demand. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jay."
269488,222540067,375149,"Ensco plc, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2012",2012-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, Dan. Today, I'm going to cover highlights of our third quarter results, the outlook for the fourth quarter and our financial position. Now let's start with third quarter results versus prior year. Earnings were $1.48 per share, up from $0.88 a yea",1208,"Thanks, Dan. Today, I'm going to cover highlights of our third quarter results, the outlook for the fourth quarter and our financial position. Now let's start with third quarter results versus prior year. Earnings were $1.48 per share, up from $0.88 a year ago. As noted in our earnings release, certain item influence the comparisons. Third quarter 2012 contract drilling expense included an $8 million loss on the sale of ENSCO I and $4 million of impairment charges. These items reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. We also had a $31 million warranty claims settlement that improved earnings by $0.13 per share. These warranty settlements have benefited the current quarter or related to items that reduced operating income in prior periods.
Finally, in the third quarter of last year, the contract drilling expense included an $11 million insurance settlement gain for ENSCO 69. 
Total revenue for the quarter was a record $1.1 billion compared to $916 million a year ago. Revenues grew 23% year-over-year. [indiscernible] quarter, revenues increased from $440 million to $629 million, growing 43% from the prior year due to the addition of ENSCO 8505 to the active fleet, a full quarter of operations from ENSCO 8504 and significantly higher utilizations, primarily due to the reactivation of ENSCO 7500 late last year, following upgrades that were completed during 2011.
Deepwater revenues were $94 million, down from $121 billion in the prior year. The average day rate was $221,000 compared to $239,000 a year ago. Utilization declined to 74% from 89% as a result of downtime from ENSCO 6000 and ENSCO 5003 being warm-stacked. [indiscernible] segment revenues increased by approximately 15% due to an increase in both utilization and the average day rate. Utilization for the entire jackup fleet in the third quarter was 83%, up from 77% a year ago. As Dan noted, utilization for our marketed rigs, all of which are contracted, was 92% in the third quarter. The average day rate increased 9% to $109,000 as shown in our earnings release.
Turning now to contract drilling expense. For all segments, the total was $523 million, up from $478 million in the third quarter 2011. This increase was mostly related to significantly improved utilization in the deepwater and jackup segments, reactivation of ENSCO 7500, the addition of ENSCO 8504 and 8505 to the active fleet, an increase in unit labor cost, previously mentioned loss on ENSCO I and impairments totaling $12 million and the $11 million insurance settlement for ENSCO 69 last year.
Third quarter contract drilling expense was lower than expected mostly due to the $31 million of warranty claims that I mentioned earlier and repair and maintenance expense coming in $13 million below our forecast. 
General and administrative expense for the quarter was $40 million, down from $41 million last year. Both the last year's number included $7 million in professional fees, severance payments and other acquisition-related costs. Effective tax rate in the third quarter was 11.4%, in line with our guidance for the full year. 
Now let's discuss quarterly trends by comparing third quarter 2012 sequentially to second quarter 2012. Third quarter revenue increased 5%, mostly attributable to a 10% increase in deepwater segment revenues, driven by the addition of ENSCO 8505 to the active fleet and a 1% increase in jackup segment revenues from higher average day rates. Deepwater segment revenues declined $8 million due to a 5 percentage points decrease in utilization, combined with a $6,000 decline in the average day rate. Total contract drilling expense increased $33 million sequentially from the second quarter. There were several items that influenced the comparisons.
For third quarter as noted previously, there were $31 million of warranty claims settlements, partially offset by $12 million from the ENSCO I sale and impairments. In the second quarter, there were $22 million in warranty claims settlements and a $13 million gain on the sale of 2 cold stacked jackups. Adjusted for these items, contract drilling expense increased $17 million or approximately 3%, mostly due to more operating days for ENSCO 8505. 
Looking at other expenses, depreciation increased $6 million or 4% compared to the second quarter due to the addition of ENSCO 8505. D&A expense increased $4 million, primarily due to higher compensation expense-related to the retirement of our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Chadwick after 25 years of service to our company. 
Now let's discuss the fourth quarter outlook. Based on our current projections, revenues are expected to be approximately equal to the third quarter. The quarter segment revenue utilization and average day rates are projected to remain consistent at third quarter levels. In Midwater, our smallest segment, revenue should decline slightly due to lower utilization as ENSCO 5005 mobilizes to Singapore for a regular inspection and shipyard upgrade, partially offset by ENSCO 6000 that is expected to have more operating base in the fourth quarter. Jackups, the average reported day rate will increase further and utilization is expected to be up slightly in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted for the $31 million warranty claims settlement that benefited the third quarter, we expect no increase to contract drilling expense in the fourth quarter. Depreciation expense is expected to be unchanged. General and administrative expense is expected to decline $8 million to $32 million in the fourth quarter. Other expense anticipated to be approximately $22 million, $29 million from interest expense, partially offset by $7 million of interest income and other items.
Finally, we feel very good about our total synergy target of $100 million for the year, which is included in our outlook. Capital spending is forecast to be about $1.8 billion for the full year. We anticipate the breakdown is $1.3 billion for newbuild rigs, $330 million for rig enhancement projects and $210 million for sustaining projects. We've already invested $1.6 billion through September 30, so remaining capital expenditures are estimated to be about $240 million for the balance of this year. Looking ahead, contractual commitments for our newbuild rigs under construction are approximately $1.9 billion, which will be spent through the end of 2014.
In terms of our financial position, we ended the third quarter with a 29% leverage ratio and $9 billion of revenue backlog. Overall, we feel very good about the progress we've made this year. Our new rigs have been delivered on time and on budget and our 6 rigs under construction are all on track for their delivery dates. Growth of our fleet has produced record revenues and earnings. We have divested several rigs and reinvested the proceeds back into our fleet as part of our continuous high grading strategy, in the integration of our ups following the acquisition last year has been extraordinary well and we are achieving our targeted synergies in improved our leverage ratio to below 30%, even as we have increased our dividend payout 7% earlier this year and invested another $1.6 billion year-to-date in our fleet.  Importantly, 75% of this capital investment has been dedicated to the growth of our rig fleet, which will drive future earnings and cash flows. 
Finally, Ensco has reinstated into the S&P 500 Index in the third quarter shortly after we converted our NYSE listing back to ordinary shares. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Sean."

First of all, Petrobas is being very practical to make sure that the rig they efficiently utilize so rebalancing of the portfolio, what we see them doing is shifting more resources to pre-salt, which is a lot higher value game for that. So what that has done is deemphasize some of their efforts in the midwater region. We've got the ENSCO 5000 that will roll off contract in the middle of next year. There's a number of opportunities for that rig that we're chasing down. We also see the independent operators in that market growing in terms of their presence in the midwater. We see OGX staying consistent with what they're doing. And I think all in all, it does bode well that the geology there is strong and we don't expect this to be a long-term problem in Brazil."

And I think it's possible over the next couple of years ago, we go plus or minus a rig there but we're committed to something in the 10 kind of number. I think our view is that it probably will always be a market that has slightly lower returns since some other markets that we have, and the offsetting benefit is that it has more term and more protectable cash flow and the rigs stay in the same region.

Before Jay takes us through the financial results, I will discuss third quarter highlights and the state of our markets. In terms of highlights, I want to congratulate our capital projects team in Singapore for successfully delivering our seventh and final ENSCO 8500 Series rig during the quarter. They've done a terrific job managing this multibillion dollar investment project beginning with the first rig back in 2005. Given their commitment to operational excellence and exceeding expectations, Ensco has been recognized for one of the best on-time and on-budget newbuild records in our industry. 
ENSCO 8506, the final rig in the series, is contracted to Anadarko at $530,000 per day for 2.5 years and will commence its term contract in early January. It is the third rig in the 8500 Series that will be working for Anadarko, a tremendous endorsement of the excellent customer service our crews have delivered to Anadarko over the past few years. 
During the third quarter, our 8500 Series fleet achieved 99% utilization for rigs working at least 6 months, highlighting the many benefits of standardization. ENSCO 8505, which commenced drilling operations last quarter, has experienced some downtime on its first wells due to some startup issues as reflected in our most recent Fleet Status Report. But we anticipate the rig will quickly improve its uptime in line with the other 8500 Series rigs.
The capital project teams in Singapore and South Korea will continue to be busy as they manage the construction of our ENSCO 120 Series jackups and our ultra-deepwater drillships, which will drive Ensco's revenue and earnings growth well into the future. I'm also pleased to report ENSCO DS-6 has completed its upgrades in Singapore. The rig will commence its 5-year term contract in Angola with BP in January. 
New construction is a key element of Ensco's continuous high-grading strategy but sow our sales of less capable rigs. As we noted in our recent Fleet Status Report, we sold 2 more assets, a jackup rig and a barge rig. We have sold 9 rigs and now have only 3 cold stacked jackup rigs remaining in the fleet. All of our actively marketed jackups are contracted and marketed utilization was 92% in the third quarter.
As utilization has risen, so has average day rates for the jackup segment. We expect this trend to continue due in large part to contracts already in place. For some time, Ensco has had the largest number of active premium jackup rigs. Now given the recent divestiture by one of our competitors, Ensco is the leading provider of premium jackups worldwide. 
Before I turn to a discussion of the markets, I also want to recognize our North and South America business unit for a job well done managing through Hurricane Isaac. We had 18 rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico at the time of the hurricane and our operations and support teams did an excellent job implementing our severe weather plans. No one was injured. There was no significant damage to our rigs and there was no financial impact. These outcomes are the result of effective planning and execution by our employees, as well as close collaboration with our customers.
Now let me discuss the markets. I'll begin with deepwater. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the deepwater fleet industrywide is 100% contracted through 2012 and well into 2013. The demand for deepwater floaters has added 10 rigs to this market from a year ago and we expect the positive trend to continue for at least the next several years. Permitting process has improved significantly and more deepwater permits are being granted. 
In Mexico, PEMEX has not announced any current plans to increase their deepwater fleet however, they have publicly announced the need for deepwater drilling to offset declines in production from shallow water and onshore fields. The successful new discoveries, like the recent announcement of a new deepwater natural gas find, we can only surmise sometime in the future, this market will require more deepwater assets. 
In Brazil, several short- and long-term programs have outstanding tenders from multiple operators. Petrobras added 8 ultra-deepwater rigs to their fleet this year and 3 more units are expected to finalize acceptance testing before the end of the year. We anticipate that independent operators may become more active in Brazil for the continued exploration success, pursuit of production sharing agreements and if approved, potential licensing around next year for oil and gas and pre-salt blocks.
The African ultra-deepwater market remains extremely strong, with uncommitted time virtually nonexistent until 2015. The discovery is being announced often in Africa. The future is promising for ultra-deepwater assets. Tightness in the African ultra deepwater segment is possibly affecting the deepwater fleet, adding upward pressure to day rates. There are a number of deepwater rigs that will have availability in 2013, and we expect that demand will keep the market balanced.
In Asian and Australian markets, we believe the demand for deepwater floaters will increase in 2013. There are a few multi-year programs that have yet to be awarded and our customers are also talking about potential ultra-deepwater work commencing in 2014. We currently expect ENSCO 8504, which is available in January of next year, to remain in Asia, and we are in advanced discussions with customers about long-term programs. 
Moving to midwater. Ensco's smallest segment with just 6 rigs, the market remains challenging, but there are signs of improvement. There are opportunities in the North Sea with the U.K. semi market, which is effectively booked through 2013 and into 2014. More short-term programs are surfacing in Southeast Asia, Australia, India, Egypt, Libya, West Africa and the Mexico-Latin American market. In Brazil, last week, we extended our existing contract with Petrobras for ENSCO 6000 by 1 year to April 2014 at a rate of $275,000 per day, a $75,000 increase to the current rate. ENSCO 5005, which has been contracted to Petrobras through April of next year, is now mobilizing to Singapore for a planned inspection and shipyard upgrades that will extend into the second quarter of next year.
While certain operators in Brazil have reduced their demand for midwater drilling rigs, we don't believe this is a long-term trend since the midwater geology in Brazil continues to support additional drilling by capable midwater assets. 
Turning to the jackup markets. Activity continues to be robust. Almost all regions see higher utilization and competition for assets has pushed day rates higher. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the premium jackup fleet is 100% utilized, and new contract rates for premium jackups are in excess of $100,000 per day. Rigs that roll off contract are quickly awarded new work, often for 6- to 18-month terms. We anticipate the premium jackup market will continue to be strong into 2013. 
In Mexico, PEMEX continues to attract rigs from around the world in their effort to increase their jackup fleet to 40-plus units. Currently, they have 25 rigs working with 10 contracts expiring before year-end. We anticipate the majority of these rigs weeks will be awarded further work through direct negotiations. 
In the North Sea, where most of Ensco's fleet is fully contracted through the 2013, only a limited supply of standard duty jackups will become available in the third and fourth quarters of next year. In 2013, we anticipate that several newbuild units, including our ENSCO 120 jackup will enter the region. They should be easily absorbed based on the number of new inquiries for work starting in 2013 and 2014 and as operators evaluate jackups to handle overflow projects from the U.K. semi market.
We don't have any jackups in the Mediterranean, which has been a difficult market. With the lack of long-term opportunities and ongoing political instability, we do not anticipate improvement anytime soon. 
The African market has tightened in recent months and we expect that the market will be balanced into 2013. There are currently 8 tenders or pre-tenders outstanding for 2012 projects and approximately 7 more for 2013. 
In the Middle East, utilization reached 95%, up from 86% a year ago. Incremental demand is expected in Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar. 
Moving to the Asia Pacific market, activity remains tight with jackup utilization exceeding 96% in the third quarter. There is an upward convergence in day rates for standard and high-spec rigs due to the lack of supply. Jackup demand is forecast to continue increasing in 2013 with a number of incremental long-term projects from several operators.
Australia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Indonesia are actively seeking investment in their country's reserves, which we believe will underpin drilling in the region for years to come and absorb newbuild rigs as they are delivered. 
To summarize, customer demand continues to rise and there is a limited near-term supply of new rigs. This has driven up average day rates for both our deepwater and jackup segments. Exploration and appraisal success, new deepwater basins and healthy commodity prices are all positive indications for long-term growth. All of these factors bode well for Ensco and put us on a great position to meet incremental customer demand. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jay."
269488,222540067,375460,"Ensco plc, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2012",2012-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, Dan. Today, I'm going to cover highlights of our third quarter results, the outlook for the fourth quarter and our financial position. Now let's start with third quarter results versus prior year. Earnings were $1.48 per share, up from $0.88 a yea",1206,"Thanks, Dan. Today, I'm going to cover highlights of our third quarter results, the outlook for the fourth quarter and our financial position. Now let's start with third quarter results versus prior year. Earnings were $1.48 per share, up from $0.88 a year ago. As noted in our earnings release, certain item influence the comparisons. Third quarter 2012 contract drilling expense included an $8 million loss on the sale of ENSCO I and $4 million of impairment charges. These items reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. We also had a $31 million warranty claims settlement that improved earnings by $0.13 per share. These warranty settlements have benefited the current quarter are related to items that reduced operating income in prior periods.
Finally, in the third quarter of last year, contract drilling expense included an $11 million insurance settlement gain for ENSCO 69. 
Total revenue for the quarter was a record $1.1 billion compared to $916 million a year ago. Revenues grew 23% year-over-year. Deepwater revenues increased from $440 million to $629 million, growing 43% from the prior year due to the addition of ENSCO 8505 to the active fleet, a full quarter of operations for ENSCO 8504 and significantly higher utilizations, primarily due to reactivation of ENSCO 7500 late last year, following upgrades that were completed during 2011.
Midwater revenues were $94 million, down from $121 billion in the prior year. The average day rate was $221,000 compared to $239,000 a year ago. Utilization declined to 74% from 89% as a result of downtime from ENSCO 6000 and ENSCO 5003 being warm stacked. Jackup segment revenues increased by approximately 15% due to an increase in both utilization and the average day rate. Utilization for the entire jackup fleet in the third quarter was 83%, up from 77% a year ago. As Dan noted, utilization for our marketed rigs, all of which are contracted, was 92% in the third quarter. The average day rate increased 9% to $109,000 as shown in our earnings release.
Turning now to contract drilling expense. For all segments, the total was $523 million, up from $478 million in the third quarter 2011. This increase was mostly related to significantly improved utilization in the deepwater and jackup segments, reactivation of ENSCO 7500, the addition of ENSCO 8504 and 8505 to the active fleet, an increase in unit labor cost, previously mentioned loss on ENSCO I and impairments totaling $12 million and the $11 million insurance settlement for ENSCO 69 last year.
Third quarter contract drilling expense was lower than expected mostly due to the $31 million of warranty claims that I mentioned earlier and repair and maintenance expense coming in $13 million below our forecast. 
General and administrative expense for the quarter was $40 million, down from $41 million last year. Both the last year's number included $7 million in professional fees, severance payments and other acquisition-related costs. Effective tax rate in the third quarter was 11.4%, in line with our guidance for the full year. 
Now let's discuss quarterly trends by comparing third quarter 2012 sequentially to second quarter 2012. Third quarter revenue increased 5%, mostly attributable to a 10% increase in deepwater segment revenues, driven by the addition of ENSCO 8505 to the active fleet and a 1% increase in jackup segment revenues from higher average day rates. Midwater segment revenues declined $8 million due to a 5 percentage point decrease in utilization, combined with a $6,000 decline in the average day rate. Total contract drilling expense increased $33 million sequentially from the second quarter. There were several items that influenced the comparisons.
The third quarter, as noted previously, there were $31 million of warranty claims settlements, partially offset by $12 million from the ENSCO I sale and impairments. In the second quarter, there were $22 million in warranty claims settlements and a $13 million gain on the sale of 2 cold stacked jackups. Adjusted for these items, contract drilling expense increased $17 million or approximately 3%, mostly due to more operating days for ENSCO 8505. 
Looking at other expenses, depreciation increased $6 million or 4% compared to the second quarter due to the addition of ENSCO 8505. D&A expense increased $4 million, primarily due to higher compensation expense related to the retirement of our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Chadwick, after 25 years of service to our company. 
Now let's discuss the fourth quarter outlook. Based on our current projections, revenues are expected to be approximately equal to the third quarter. The quarter segment revenue utilization and average day rates are projected to remain consistent at third quarter levels. In Midwater, our smallest segment, revenue should decline slightly due to lower utilization as ENSCO 5005 mobilizes to Singapore for a regular inspection and shipyard upgrades, partially offset by ENSCO 6000 that is expected to have more operating days in the fourth quarter. Jackups, the average reported day rate will increase further and utilization is expected to be up slightly in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted for the $31 million warranty claim settlement that benefited the third quarter, we expect no increase to contract drilling expense in the fourth quarter. Depreciation expense is expected to be unchanged. General and administrative expense is expected to decline $8 million to $32 million in the fourth quarter. Their expense is anticipated to be approximately $22 million, $29 million from interest expense, partially offset by $7 million of interest income and other items.
Finally, we feel very good about our total synergy target of $100 million for the year, which is included in our outlook. Capital spending is forecast to be about $1.8 billion for the full year. The anticipated breakdown is $1.3 billion for newbuild rigs, $330 million for rig enhancement projects and $210 million for sustaining projects. We've already invested $1.6 billion through September 30, so remaining capital expenditures are estimated to be about $240 million for the balance of this year. Looking ahead, contractual commitments for our newbuild rigs under construction are approximately $1.9 billion, which will be spent through the end of 2014.
In terms of our financial position, we ended the third quarter with a 29% leverage ratio and $9 billion of revenue backlog. Overall, we feel very good about the progress we've made this year. Our new rigs have been delivered on time and on budget and our 6 rigs under construction are all on track for their delivery dates. Growth of our fleet has produced record revenues and earnings. We have divested several rigs and reinvested the proceeds back into our fleet as part of our continuous high grading strategy. The integration of our operations following the acquisition last year has gone extraordinary well and we are achieving our targeted synergies. We've improved our leverage ratio to below 30%, even as we have increased our dividend payout 7% earlier this year and invested another $1.6 billion year-to-date in our fleet.  Importantly, 75% of this capital investment has been dedicated to the growth of our rig fleet, which will drive future earnings and cash flows. 
Finally, Ensco was reinstated into the S&P 500 Index in the third quarter shortly after we converted our NYSE listing back to ordinary shares. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Sean."

Everywhere we work is challenging. We feel like we have a great position there. We've got an outstanding organization on the ground there that allows us to really do a good job for our customers. And I think it's possible over the next couple of years, we go plus or minus a rig there but we're committed to something in the 10 kind of number. I think our view is that it probably will always be a market that has slightly lower returns in some other markets that we have, and the offsetting benefit is that it has more term and more predictable cash flow and the rigs stay in the same region. So on balance, we like the exposure. I don't think we're looking to massively increase it or decrease it ."

Before Jay takes us through the financial results, I will discuss third quarter highlights and the state of our markets.

Before Jay takes us through the financial results, I will discuss third quarter highlights and the state of our markets. In terms of highlights, I want to congratulate our capital projects team in Singapore for successfully delivering our seventh and final ENSCO 8500 Series rig during the quarter. They've done a terrific job managing this multibillion dollar investment project beginning with the first rig back in 2005. Given their commitment to operational excellence and exceeding expectations, Ensco has been recognized for one of the best on-time and on-budget new build records in our industry. 
ENSCO 8506, the final rig in the series, is contracted to Anadarko at $530,000 per day for 2.5 years and will commence its term contract in early January. It is the third rig in the 8500 Series that will be working for Anadarko, a tremendous endorsement of the excellent customer service our crews have delivered to Anadarko over the past few years. 
During the third quarter, our 8500 Series fleet achieved 99% utilization for rigs working at least 6 months, highlighting the many benefits of standardization. ENSCO 8505, which commenced drilling operations last quarter, has experienced some downtime on its first wells due to some startup issues as reflected in our most recent Fleet Status Report. But we anticipate the rig will quickly improve its uptime in line with the other 8500 Series rigs.
The capital project teams in Singapore and South Korea will continue to be busy as they manage the construction of our ENSCO 120 Series jackups and our ultra-deepwater drillships, which will drive Ensco's revenue and earnings growth well into the future. I'm also pleased to report ENSCO DS-6 has completed its upgrades in Singapore. The rig will commence its 5-year term contract in Angola with BP in January. 
New construction is a key element of Ensco's continuous high-grading strategy but so are sales of less capable rigs. As we noted in our recent Fleet Status Report, we sold 2 more assets, a jackup rig and a barge rig. We have sold 9 rigs and now have only 3 cold stacked jackup rigs remaining in the fleet. All of our actively marketed jackups are contracted and marketed utilization was 92% in the third quarter.
As utilization has risen, so has average day rates for the jackup segment. We expect this trend to continue due in large part to contracts already in place. For some time, Ensco has had the largest number of active premium jackup rigs. Now given the recent divestiture by one of our competitors, Ensco is the leading provider of premium jackups worldwide. 
Before I turn to a discussion of the markets, I also want to recognize our North and South America business unit for a job well done managing through Hurricane Isaac. We had 18 rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico at the time of the hurricane and our operations and support teams did an excellent job implementing our severe weather plans. No one was injured. There was no significant damage to our rigs and there was no financial impact. These outcomes are the result of effective planning and execution by our employees, as well as close collaboration with our customers.
Now let me discuss the markets. I'll begin with deepwater. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the deepwater fleet industrywide is 100% contracted through 2012 and well into 2013. The demand for deepwater floaters has added 10 rigs to this market from a year ago and we expect the positive trend to continue for at least the next several years. Permitting process has improved significantly and more deepwater permits are being granted. 
In Mexico, PEMEX has not announced any current plans to increase their deepwater fleet however, they have publicly announced the need for deepwater drilling to offset declines in production from shallow water and onshore fields. The successful new discoveries, like the recent announcement of a new deepwater natural gas find, we can only surmise sometime in the future, this market will require more deepwater assets. 
In Brazil, several short- and long-term programs have outstanding tenders from multiple operators. Petrobras added 8 ultra-deepwater rigs to their fleet this year and 3 more units are expected to finalize acceptance testing before the end of the year. We anticipate that independent operators may become more active in Brazil for the continued exploration success, pursuit of production sharing agreements and, if approved, potential licensing around next year for oil and gas and pre-salt blocks.
The African ultra-deepwater market remains extremely strong, with uncommitted time virtually nonexistent until 2015. The discovery is being announced often in Africa. The future is promising for ultra-deepwater assets. Tightness in the African ultra deepwater segment is possibly affecting the deepwater fleet, adding upward pressure to day rates. There are a number of deepwater rigs that will have availability in 2013, but we expect that demand will keep the market balanced.
In Asian and Australian markets, we believe the demand for deepwater floaters will increase in 2013. There are a few multi-year programs that have yet to be awarded and our customers are also talking about potential ultra-deepwater work commencing in 2014. We currently expect ENSCO 8504, which is available in January of next year, to remain in Asia, and we are in advanced discussions with customers about long-term programs. 
Moving to midwater. Ensco's smallest segment with just 6 rigs, the market remains challenging, but there are signs of improvement. There are opportunities in the North Sea with the U.K. semi market, which is effectively booked through 2013 and into 2014. More short-term programs are surfacing in Southeast Asia, Australia, India, Egypt, Libya, West Africa and the Mexico-Latin American market. In Brazil, last week, we extended our existing contract with Petrobras for ENSCO 6000 by 1 year to April 2014 at a rate of $275,000 per day, a $75,000 increase to the current rate. ENSCO 5005, which has been contracted to Petrobras through April of next year, is now mobilizing to Singapore for a planned inspection and shipyard upgrades that will extend into the second quarter of next year.
While certain operators in Brazil have reduced their demand for midwater drilling rigs, we don't believe this is a long-term trend since the midwater geology in Brazil continues to support additional drilling by capable midwater assets. 
Turning to the jackup markets. Activity continues to be robust. Almost all regions see higher utilization and competition for assets has pushed day rates higher. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the premium jackup fleet is 100% utilized, and new contract rates for premium jackups are in excess of $100,000 per day. Rigs that roll off contract are quickly awarded new work, often for 6- to 18-month terms. We anticipate the premium jackup market will continue to be strong into 2013. 
In Mexico, PEMEX continues to attract rigs from around the world in their effort to increase their jackup fleet to 40-plus units. Currently, they have 25 rigs working with 10 contracts expiring before year-end. We anticipate the majority of these rigs weeks will be awarded further work through direct negotiations. 
In the North Sea, where most of Ensco's fleet is fully contracted through the 2013, only a limited supply of standard duty jackups will become available in the third and fourth quarters of next year. In 2013, we anticipate that several newbuild units, including our ENSCO 120 jackup will enter the region. They should be easily absorbed based on the number of new inquiries for work starting in 2013 and 2014 and as operators evaluate jackups to handle overflow projects from the U.K. semi market.
We don't have any jackups in the Mediterranean, which has been a difficult market. With the lack of long-term opportunities and ongoing political instability, we do not anticipate improvement anytime soon. 
The African market has tightened in recent months and we expect that the market will be balanced into 2013. There are currently 8 tenders or pre-tenders outstanding for 2012 projects and approximately 7 more for 2013. 
In the Middle East, utilization reached 95%, up from 86% a year ago. Incremental demand is expected in Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar. 
Moving to the Asia Pacific market, activity remains tight with jackup utilization exceeding 96% in the third quarter. There is an upward convergence in day rates for standard and high-spec rigs due to the lack of supply. Jackup demand is forecast to continue increasing in 2013 with a number of incremental long-term projects from several operators.
Australia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Indonesia are actively seeking investment in their country's reserves, which we believe will underpin drilling in the region for years to come and absorb newbuild rigs as they are delivered. 
To summarize, customer demand continues to rise and there is a limited near-term supply of new rigs. This has driven up average day rates for both our deepwater and jackup segments. Exploration and appraisal success, new deepwater basins and healthy commodity prices are all positive indications for long-term growth. All of these factors bode well for Ensco and put us in a great position to meet incremental customer demand. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jay."
269488,222540067,375633,"Ensco plc, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2012",2012-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, Dan. Today, I'm going to cover highlights of our third quarter results, the outlook for the fourth quarter and our financial position. Now let's start with third quarter results versus prior year. Earnings were $1.48 per share, up from $0.88 a yea",1208,"Thanks, Dan. Today, I'm going to cover highlights of our third quarter results, the outlook for the fourth quarter and our financial position. Now let's start with third quarter results versus prior year. Earnings were $1.48 per share, up from $0.88 a year ago. As noted in our earnings release, certain items influence the comparisons. Third quarter 2012 contract drilling expense included an $8 million loss on the sale of ENSCO I and $4 million of impairment charges. These items reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. We also had a $31 million warranty claims settlement that improved earnings by $0.13 per share. These warranty settlements have benefited the current quarter are related to items that reduced operating income in prior periods.
Finally, in the third quarter of last year, contract drilling expense included an $11 million insurance settlement gain for ENSCO 69. 
Total revenue for the quarter was a record $1.1 billion compared to $916 million a year ago. Revenues grew 23% year-over-year. Deepwater revenues increased from $440 million to $629 million, growing 43% from the prior year due to the addition of ENSCO 8505 to the active fleet, a full quarter of operations for ENSCO 8504 and significantly higher utilizations, primarily due to reactivation of ENSCO 7500 late last year, following upgrades that were completed during 2011.
Midwater revenues were $94 million, down from $121 billion in the prior year. The average day rate was $221,000 compared to $239,000 a year ago. Utilization declined to 74% from 89% as a result of downtime from ENSCO 6000 and ENSCO 5003 being warm stacked. Jackup segment revenues increased by approximately 15% due to an increase in both utilization and the average day rate. Utilization for the entire jackup fleet in the third quarter was 83%, up from 77% a year ago. As Dan noted, utilization for our marketed rigs, all of which are contracted, was 92% in the third quarter. The average day rate increased 9% to $109,000 as shown in our earnings release.
Turning now to contract drilling expense. For all segments, the total was $523 million, up from $478 million in the third quarter 2011. This increase was mostly related to significantly improved utilization in the deepwater and jackup segments, reactivation of ENSCO 7500, the addition of ENSCO 8504 and 8505 to the active fleet, an increase in unit labor cost, previously mentioned loss on ENSCO I and impairments totaling $12 million and the $11 million insurance settlement for ENSCO 69 last year.
Third quarter contract drilling expense was lower than expected mostly due to the $31 million of warranty claims that I mentioned earlier and repair and maintenance expense coming in $13 million below our forecast. 
General and administrative expense for the quarter was $40 million, down from $41 million last year. Both the last year's number included $7 million in professional fees, severance payments and other acquisition-related costs. Effective tax rate in the third quarter was 11.4%, in line with our guidance for the full year. 
Now let's discuss quarterly trends by comparing third quarter 2012 sequentially to second quarter 2012. Third quarter revenue increased 5%, mostly attributable to a 10% increase in deepwater segment revenues, driven by the addition of ENSCO 8505 to the active fleet and a 1% increase in jackup segment revenues from higher average day rates. Midwater segment revenues declined $8 million due to a 5 percentage point decrease in utilization, combined with a $6,000 decline in the average day rate. Total contract drilling expense increased $33 million sequentially from the second quarter. There were several items that influenced the comparisons.
In the third quarter, as noted previously, there were $31 million of warranty claims settlements, partially offset by $12 million from the ENSCO I sale and impairments. In the second quarter, there were $22 million in warranty claims settlements and a $13 million gain on the sale of 2 cold stacked jackups. Adjusted for these items, contract drilling expense increased $17 million or approximately 3%, mostly due to more operating days for ENSCO 8505. 
Looking at other expenses, depreciation increased $6 million or 4% compared to the second quarter due to the addition of ENSCO 8505. G&A expense increased $4 million, primarily due to higher compensation expense related to the retirement of our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Chadwick, after 25 years of service to our company. 
Now let's discuss the fourth quarter outlook. Based on our current projections, revenues are expected to be approximately equal to the third quarter. The quarter segment revenue utilization and average day rates are projected to remain consistent at third quarter levels. In Midwater, our smallest segment, revenue should decline slightly due to lower utilization as ENSCO 5005 mobilizes to Singapore for a regular inspection and shipyard upgrades, partially offset by ENSCO 6000 that is expected to have more operating days in the fourth quarter. In jackups, the average reported day rate will increase further and utilization is expected to be up slightly in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted for the $31 million warranty claim settlement that benefited the third quarter, we expect no increase to contract drilling expense in the fourth quarter. Depreciation expense is expected to be unchanged. General and administrative expense is expected to decline $8 million to $32 million in the fourth quarter. Their expense is anticipated to be approximately $22 million, $29 million from interest expense, partially offset by $7 million of interest income and other items.
Finally, we feel very good about our total synergy target of $100 million for the year, which is included in our outlook. Capital spending is forecast to be about $1.8 billion for the full year. The anticipated breakdown is $1.3 billion for newbuild rigs, $330 million for rig enhancement projects and $210 million for sustaining projects. We've already invested $1.6 billion through September 30, so remaining capital expenditures are estimated to be about $240 million for the balance of this year. Looking ahead, contractual commitments for our newbuild rigs under construction are approximately $1.9 billion, which will be spent through the end of 2014.
In terms of our financial position, we ended the third quarter with a 29% leverage ratio and $9 billion of revenue backlog. Overall, we feel very good about the progress we've made this year. Our new rigs have been delivered on time and on budget and our 6 rigs under construction are all on track for their delivery dates. Growth of our fleet has produced record revenues and earnings. We have divested several rigs and reinvested the proceeds back into our fleet as part of our continuous high grading strategy. The integration of our operations following the acquisition last year has gone extraordinary well and we are achieving our targeted synergies. We've improved our leverage ratio to below 30%, even as we have increased our dividend payout 7% earlier this year and invested another $1.6 billion year-to-date in our fleet.  Importantly, 75% of this capital investment has been dedicated to the growth of our rig fleet, which will drive future earnings and cash flows. 
Finally, Ensco was reinstated into the S&P 500 Index in the third quarter shortly after we converted our NYSE listing back to ordinary shares. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Sean."

First of all, I think Petrobas is being very practical to make sure that the rigs they have are efficiently utilized. So in their rebalancing of their portfolio, what we see them doing is shifting more resources to pre-salt, which is a lot higher value game for them. So what that has done is de-emphasize some of their efforts in the midwater region. We've got the ENSCO 5000 that will roll off contract in the middle of next year. There's a number of opportunities for that rig that we're chasing down. We also see the independent operators in that market growing in terms of their presence in the midwater. We see OGX staying consistent with what they're doing. And I think all in all, it does bode well that the geology there is strong and we don't expect this to be a long-term problem in Brazil."

And I think it's possible over the next couple of years, we may go plus or minus a rig there but we're committed to something in the 10 kind of number. I think our view is that it probably will always be a market that has slightly lower returns in some other markets that we have, and the offsetting benefit is that it has more term and more predictable cash flow and the rigs stay in the same region.

Before Jay takes us through the financial results, I will discuss third quarter highlights and the state of our markets. In terms of highlights, I want to congratulate our capital projects team in Singapore for successfully delivering our seventh and final ENSCO 8500 Series rig during the quarter. They've done a terrific job managing this multibillion dollar investment project beginning with the first rig back in 2005. Given their commitment to operational excellence and exceeding expectations, Ensco has been recognized for one of the best on-time and on-budget new build records in our industry. 
ENSCO 8506, the final rig in the series, is contracted to Anadarko at $530,000 per day for 2.5 years and will commence its term contract in early January. It is the third rig in the 8500 Series that will be working for Anadarko, a tremendous endorsement of the excellent customer service our crews have delivered to Anadarko over the past few years. 
During the third quarter, our 8500 Series fleet achieved 99% utilization for rigs working at least 6 months, highlighting the many benefits of standardization. ENSCO 8505, which commenced drilling operations last quarter, has experienced some downtime on its first wells due to some startup issues as reflected in our most recent Fleet Status Report. But we anticipate the rig will quickly improve its uptime in line with the other 8500 Series rigs.
The capital project teams in Singapore and South Korea will continue to be busy as they manage the construction of our ENSCO 120 Series jackups and our ultra-deepwater drillships, which will drive Ensco's revenue and earnings growth well into the future. I'm also pleased to report ENSCO DS-6 has completed its upgrades in Singapore. The rig will commence its 5-year term contract in Angola with BP in January. 
New construction is a key element of Ensco's continuous high-grading strategy but so are sales of less capable rigs. As we noted in our recent Fleet Status Report, we sold 2 more assets, a jackup rig and a barge rig. We have sold 9 rigs and now have only 3 cold stacked jackup rigs remaining in the fleet. All of our actively marketed jackups are contracted and marketed utilization was 92% in the third quarter.
As utilization has risen, so has average day rates for the jackup segment. We expect this trend to continue due in large part to contracts already in place. For some time, Ensco has had the largest number of active premium jackup rigs. Now given the recent divestiture by one of our competitors, Ensco is the leading provider of premium jackups worldwide. 
Before I turn to a discussion of the markets, I also want to recognize our North and South America business unit for a job well done managing through Hurricane Isaac. We had 18 rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico at the time of the hurricane and our operations and support teams did an excellent job implementing our severe weather plans. No one was injured. There was no significant damage to our rigs and there was no financial impact. These outcomes are the result of effective planning and execution by our employees, as well as close collaboration with our customers.
Now let me discuss the markets. I'll begin with deepwater. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the deepwater fleet industrywide is 100% contracted through 2012 and well into 2013. The demand for deepwater floaters has added 10 rigs to this market from a year ago and we expect the positive trend to continue for at least the next several years. Permitting process has improved significantly and more deepwater permits are being granted. 
In Mexico, PEMEX has not announced any current plans to increase their deepwater fleet however, they have publicly announced the need for deepwater drilling to offset declines in production from shallow water and onshore fields. The successful new discoveries, like the recent announcement of a new deepwater natural gas find, we can only surmise sometime in the future, this market will require more deepwater assets. 
In Brazil, several short- and long-term programs have outstanding tenders from multiple operators. Petrobras added 8 ultra-deepwater rigs to their fleet this year and 3 more units are expected to finalize acceptance testing before the end of the year. We anticipate that independent operators may become more active in Brazil for the continued exploration success, pursuit of production sharing agreements and, if approved, potential licensing around next year for oil and gas and pre-salt blocks.
The African ultra-deepwater market remains extremely strong, with uncommitted time virtually nonexistent until 2015. The discovery is being announced often in Africa. The future is promising for ultra-deepwater assets. Tightness in the African ultra deepwater segment is possibly affecting the deepwater fleet, adding upward pressure to day rates. There are a number of deepwater rigs that will have availability in 2013, but we expect that demand will keep the market balanced.
In Asian and Australian markets, we believe the demand for deepwater floaters will increase in 2013. There are a few multi-year programs that have yet to be awarded and our customers are also talking about potential ultra-deepwater work commencing in 2014. We currently expect ENSCO 8504, which is available in January of next year, to remain in Asia, and we are in advanced discussions with customers about long-term programs. 
Moving to midwater. Ensco's smallest segment with just 6 rigs, the market remains challenging, but there are signs of improvement. There are opportunities in the North Sea with the U.K. semi market, which is effectively booked through 2013 and into 2014. More short-term programs are surfacing in Southeast Asia, Australia, India, Egypt, Libya, West Africa and the Mexico-Latin American market. In Brazil, last week, we extended our existing contract with Petrobras for ENSCO 6000 by 1 year to April 2014 at a rate of $275,000 per day, a $75,000 increase to the current rate. ENSCO 5005, which has been contracted to Petrobras through April of next year, is now mobilizing to Singapore for a planned inspection and shipyard upgrades that will extend into the second quarter of next year.
While certain operators in Brazil have reduced their demand for midwater drilling rigs, we don't believe this is a long-term trend since the midwater geology in Brazil continues to support additional drilling by capable midwater assets. 
Turning to the jackup markets. Activity continues to be robust. Almost all regions see higher utilization and competition for assets has pushed day rates higher. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the premium jackup fleet is 100% utilized, and new contract rates for premium jackups are in excess of $100,000 per day. Rigs that roll off contract are quickly awarded new work, often for 6- to 18-month terms. We anticipate the premium jackup market will continue to be strong into 2013. 
In Mexico, PEMEX continues to attract rigs from around the world in their effort to increase their jackup fleet to 40-plus units. Currently, they have 25 rigs working with 10 contracts expiring before year-end. We anticipate the majority of these rigs weeks will be awarded further work through direct negotiations. 
In the North Sea, where most of Ensco's fleet is fully contracted through the 2013, only a limited supply of standard duty jackups will become available in the third and fourth quarters of next year. In 2013, we anticipate that several newbuild units, including our ENSCO 120 jackup will enter the region. They should be easily absorbed based on the number of new inquiries for work starting in 2013 and 2014 and as operators evaluate jackups to handle overflow projects from the U.K. semi market.
We don't have any jackups in the Mediterranean, which has been a difficult market. With the lack of long-term opportunities and ongoing political instability, we do not anticipate improvement anytime soon. 
The African market has tightened in recent months and we expect that the market will be balanced into 2013. There are currently 8 tenders or pre-tenders outstanding for 2012 projects and approximately 7 more for 2013. 
In the Middle East, utilization reached 95%, up from 86% a year ago. Incremental demand is expected in Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar. 
Moving to the Asia Pacific market, activity remains tight with jackup utilization exceeding 96% in the third quarter. There is an upward convergence in day rates for standard and high-spec rigs due to the lack of supply. Jackup demand is forecast to continue increasing in 2013 with a number of incremental long-term projects from several operators.
Australia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Indonesia are actively seeking investment in their country's reserves, which we believe will underpin drilling in the region for years to come and absorb newbuild rigs as they are delivered. 
To summarize, customer demand continues to rise and there is a limited near-term supply of new rigs. This has driven up average day rates for both our deepwater and jackup segments. Exploration and appraisal success, new deepwater basins and healthy commodity prices are all positive indications for long-term growth. All of these factors bode well for Ensco and put us in a great position to meet incremental customer demand. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jay."
269488,222540067,376251,"Ensco plc, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2012",2012-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, Dan. Today, I'm going to cover highlights of our third quarter results, the outlook for the fourth quarter and our financial position. Now let's start with third quarter results versus prior year. Earnings were $1.48 per share, up from $0.88 a yea",1208,"Thanks, Dan. Today, I'm going to cover highlights of our third quarter results, the outlook for the fourth quarter and our financial position. Now let's start with third quarter results versus prior year. Earnings were $1.48 per share, up from $0.88 a year ago. As noted in our earnings release, certain items influence the comparisons. Third quarter 2012 contract drilling expense included an $8 million loss on the sale of ENSCO I and $4 million of impairment charges. These items reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. We also had a $31 million warranty claims settlement that improved earnings by $0.13 per share. These warranty settlements have benefited the current quarter are related to items that reduced operating income in prior periods.
Finally, in the third quarter of last year, contract drilling expense included an $11 million insurance settlement gain for ENSCO 69. 
Total revenue for the quarter was a record $1.1 billion compared to $916 million a year ago. Revenues grew 23% year-over-year. Deepwater revenues increased from $440 million to $629 million, growing 43% from the prior year due to the addition of ENSCO 8505 to the active fleet, a full quarter of operations for ENSCO 8504 and significantly higher utilizations, primarily due to reactivation of ENSCO 7500 late last year, following upgrades that were completed during 2011.
Midwater revenues were $94 million, down from $121 billion in the prior year. The average day rate was $221,000 compared to $239,000 a year ago. Utilization declined to 74% from 89% as a result of downtime from ENSCO 6000 and ENSCO 5003 being warm stacked. Jackup segment revenues increased by approximately 15% due to an increase in both utilization and the average day rate. Utilization for the entire jackup fleet in the third quarter was 83%, up from 77% a year ago. As Dan noted, utilization for our marketed rigs, all of which are contracted, was 92% in the third quarter. The average day rate increased 9% to $109,000 as shown in our earnings release.
Turning now to contract drilling expense. For all segments, the total was $523 million, up from $478 million in the third quarter 2011. This increase was mostly related to significantly improved utilization in the deepwater and jackup segments, reactivation of ENSCO 7500, the addition of ENSCO 8504 and 8505 to the active fleet, an increase in unit labor cost, previously mentioned loss on ENSCO I and impairments totaling $12 million and the $11 million insurance settlement for ENSCO 69 last year.
Third quarter contract drilling expense was lower than expected mostly due to the $31 million of warranty claims that I mentioned earlier and repair and maintenance expense coming in $13 million below our forecast. 
General and administrative expense for the quarter was $40 million, down from $41 million last year. Both the last year's number included $7 million in professional fees, severance payments and other acquisition-related costs. Effective tax rate in the third quarter was 11.4%, in line with our guidance for the full year. 
Now let's discuss quarterly trends by comparing third quarter 2012 sequentially to second quarter 2012. Third quarter revenue increased 5%, mostly attributable to a 10% increase in deepwater segment revenues, driven by the addition of ENSCO 8505 to the active fleet and a 1% increase in jackup segment revenues from higher average day rates. Midwater segment revenues declined $8 million due to a 5 percentage point decrease in utilization, combined with a $6,000 decline in the average day rate. Total contract drilling expense increased $33 million sequentially from the second quarter. There were several items that influenced the comparisons.
In the third quarter, as noted previously, there were $31 million of warranty claims settlements, partially offset by $12 million from the ENSCO I sale and impairments. In the second quarter, there were $22 million in warranty claims settlements and a $13 million gain on the sale of 2 cold stacked jackups. Adjusted for these items, contract drilling expense increased $17 million or approximately 3%, mostly due to more operating days for ENSCO 8505. 
Looking at other expenses, depreciation increased $6 million or 4% compared to the second quarter due to the addition of ENSCO 8505. G&A expense increased $4 million, primarily due to higher compensation expense related to the retirement of our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Chadwick, after 25 years of service to our company. 
Now let's discuss the fourth quarter outlook. Based on our current projections, revenues are expected to be approximately equal to the third quarter. The quarter segment revenue utilization and average day rates are projected to remain consistent at third quarter levels. In Midwater, our smallest segment, revenue should decline slightly due to lower utilization as ENSCO 5005 mobilizes to Singapore for a regular inspection and shipyard upgrades, partially offset by ENSCO 6000 that is expected to have more operating days in the fourth quarter. In jackups, the average reported day rate will increase further and utilization is expected to be up slightly in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted for the $31 million warranty claim settlement that benefited the third quarter, we expect no increase to contract drilling expense in the fourth quarter. Depreciation expense is expected to be unchanged. General and administrative expense is expected to decline $8 million to $32 million in the fourth quarter. Their expense is anticipated to be approximately $22 million, $29 million from interest expense, partially offset by $7 million of interest income and other items.
Finally, we feel very good about our total synergy target of $100 million for the year, which is included in our outlook. Capital spending is forecast to be about $1.8 billion for the full year. The anticipated breakdown is $1.3 billion for newbuild rigs, $330 million for rig enhancement projects and $210 million for sustaining projects. We've already invested $1.6 billion through September 30, so remaining capital expenditures are estimated to be about $240 million for the balance of this year. Looking ahead, contractual commitments for our newbuild rigs under construction are approximately $1.9 billion, which will be spent through the end of 2014.
In terms of our financial position, we ended the third quarter with a 29% leverage ratio and $9 billion of revenue backlog. Overall, we feel very good about the progress we've made this year. Our new rigs have been delivered on time and on budget and our 6 rigs under construction are all on track for their delivery dates. Growth of our fleet has produced record revenues and earnings. We have divested several rigs and reinvested the proceeds back into our fleet as part of our continuous high grading strategy. The integration of our operations following the acquisition last year has gone extraordinary well and we are achieving our targeted synergies. We've improved our leverage ratio to below 30%, even as we have increased our dividend payout 7% earlier this year and invested another $1.6 billion year-to-date in our fleet.  Importantly, 75% of this capital investment has been dedicated to the growth of our rig fleet, which will drive future earnings and cash flows. 
Finally, Ensco was reinstated into the S&P 500 Index in the third quarter shortly after we converted our NYSE listing back to ordinary shares. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Sean."

And I think it's possible over the next couple of years, we may go plus or minus a rig there but we're committed to something in the 10 kind of number. I think our view is that it probably will always be a market that has slightly lower returns in some other markets that we have, and the offsetting benefit is that it has more term and more predictable cash flow and the rigs stay in the same region. So on balance, we like the exposure. I don't think we're looking to massively increase it or decrease it ."

If that pace has certainly already put pressure on 2013 availability for both jackups and floaters, and I think that's why you see the rates going up and the terms getting longer. Now on the floater side, a lot of clients have expanded their tenders to look for rigs to the end of '14 because of the strength in the market and we see that continuing because of the activity level.
