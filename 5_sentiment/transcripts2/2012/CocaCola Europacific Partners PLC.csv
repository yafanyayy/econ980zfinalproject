For 2011, we achieved comparable earnings per diluted common share of $2.18 that was up 22% on a comparable basis. Revenue grew 5.5% and operating income increased 9% both on a comparable and currency neutral basis.
These results are driven by solid volume growth of 3.5%. These are excellent results over our prior year pro forma performance and are in line with or exceed our long-term growth targets. Importantly, these results are another step toward a most important objective, growing value for our shareholders.
2011 also marked our first full year of operation as an exclusively Western European bottler. And we believe these results demonstrate both the value of our operating strategies, as well as our ability to succeed in the Western European markets in which we operate.
This growth achieved amid ongoing global macroeconomic challenges marks the sixth consecutive year of volume and profit growth in our legacy territories. And it reinforces our confidence in our long-term potential. In fact, these are the types of results that we foresaw when we closed the transaction of the Coca-Cola Company to create this Company less than 18 months ago.
Now, let's take a look at some of the key factors behind our earnings. Importantly our core Coca-Cola trademark brands, where at the heart of these results growing approximately 3.5% and delivering more than half of our total volume growth for the year. And that was led by both regular Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Zero.
In addition, we saw a solid 4% growth in sparkling flavors including an increase of more than 40% in energy driven by Monster as well as the introduction of POWERADE Energy in Great Britain. We also achieved 3% growth in stills led by Capri Sun and Ocean Spray and growth in water led by Soda Fountain and (inaudible).
By territory, volume growth was led by continental Europe, which was up 4.5% while Great Britain volume increased 2.5%. For the fourth quarter volume increased 3% driven primarily by the excellent growth from the continent of 6% and growth of 1% in Great Britain.
As previously forecasted, our full-year pricing per case was below the full-year increase in cost of goods sold per case. Bill will provide more color on this in a few moments, but let me emphasize we remain committed to expanding or maintaining margins over time, even though shifts in business conditions such as those we experienced in 2011 can create margin fluctuations.
Overall we’re pleased by these results. And we are confident that our 2012 business plans will build on this foundation creating value again for our customers and for our shareholders.
As we discussed with you in December, our full year 2012 outlook is inline with or above our long-term objectives despite the impact of a recently enacted tax increase in France. We expect earnings per share growth of about 10% driven by operating income growth in a mid single-digit range and continued execution of our planned share repurchase program.
We anticipate revenue growth in a high single-digit range. Each of these ranges are comparable and currency neutral and include the expected impact of the French tax. We also expect free cash flow in a range of $500 million to $525 million with capital expenditures in the range of $400 million to $425 million. This guidance is build on solid operating and marketing plans that focus on maximizing the benefits of key significant initiatives, which include the London 2012 Olympics and the Euro 2012 Soccer Championship.
The London Olympics as a centerpiece of our marketing plans this year and represent a unique opportunity for our company and our people. In 2012, we’ll demonstrate our ability to successfully meet customer and consumer needs while maximizing the benefits of the Coca-Cola system support of the games for our share owners. Our Olympic related activity actually began in 2010 with significant successful programs in place with our key customers.
Our plans for 2012 include the Olympic torch relay which runs for 70 days and comes within one hour of 95% of the population in Great Britain. Extensive in-store Olympic programs will be in place for the summer across all of our markets. We will also utilize our partnership with the 2012 European Soccer Championship or Euro 2012 throughout the territories. The Olympic and Euro 2012 activities supplement our longstanding programs which include music promotions and Coke with Food.
All of these programs create a solid platform from which to engage consumers and continued to build our relationships with our customers. In fact customer service is at the heart of our ability to move this company forward. We have made excellent progress in this area as demonstrated by the fact that our customers now rate us as the number one fast moving consumer goods supplier in each of our legacy territories.
We will continue to enhance our customer relationships and our service in the year ahead ultimately creating sustainable growth and category value for our customers. Our commitment to service and to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency is reflected in a decision we announced today to step change our route-to-market and our packaging profile in Norway.
Norway despite having a relatively low population density currently uses a direct store delivery model and our Norwegian business also relies heavily on refillable packaging. By modifying our routes-to-market and converting to recyclable and non-refillable packaging, we will improve our customer service and drive value for customers, consumers and our share owners.
Additionally, moving to non-refillable bottles enables us to use innovative recyclable materials such as the PlantBottle in our operations. This allows us to provide additional packaging options to consumers and helps us to reduce our carbon footprint in our production and supply chain process fees. This initiative is in its early stages and we look forward to sharing additional details with you in the near term.
Bill will provide some incremental details on the financial impact in a few minute. Going forward, our business plans for 2012 are centered on one ultimate goal, creating enhanced value for our share owners through consistent value building growth. Beyond our operating plans, we’ve demonstrated that commitment in two key ways.
First, we recently enacted a substantial 23% increase in our dividend, marking the fifth consecutive year of increases. This is also the second increase since the completion of the transaction and creating our new company some 18 months ago.
In addition, we’re moving forward with our share repurchase program. We completed an initial $1 billion program in the fourth quarter of 2011 and begin a new $1 billion program last month.
Our goal for 2012 is to repurchase at least $500 million worth of our shares. These are meaningful actions and we remain committed to increasing share owner returns for the long-term.
At the core of these strategies as well as our company, is a highly talented and dedicated team that is focused on success. At every level of our company in every territory, our people were committed to achieving increasingly high standards of performance. Our results and our 2012 outlook are solid proof of their skill and dedication.
We continue to see opportunities ahead for growth and value creation in each of our territories. Despite the challenges of currencies and soft macroeconomic conditions we operate in stable territories with established consumer goods environments. We believe we have the right operating strategies in place to seize opportunities and to meet the demands of dynamic marketplace conditions.
In fact we believe the CCE Way, which is a combination of our operating philosophy and our marketplace approach will enable us to seize growth opportunities, enhance our operating strategies and deliver a seventh consecutive year of growth in 2012. Thank you for your continuing interest in our company and your participation today.
Now, I'll turn it over to Bill.

We achieved solid earnings growth in 2011 with comparable full year earnings per diluted common share of $2.18, up 22% from pro for",1014,"Thanks John, and we appreciate each of you being with us today as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results. We achieved solid earnings growth in 2011 with comparable full year earnings per diluted common share of $2.18, up 22% from pro forma 2010 results.
In addition, comparable operating income increased 17% to $1.1 billion and total revenue grew more than 11% to $8.3 billion. These results include a full year currency benefit of $0.15 on earnings per share. This was the sixth consecutive year of growth for CCE in Europe. And our results were inline with or above our long-term growth targets.
We are encouraged by these results, which as John mentioned demonstrate what we believe is the growth potential of our business. Full year net pricing per case grew 2%, while cost of sales per case grew 3%. As we discussed with you throughout the year, this reflects the impact of higher increases in cost of goods during the second and third quarters. As we expected the balance between pricing and cost returned in the fourth quarter with both pricing and cost of goods sold up 2.5% per case.
As John mentioned we remained committed to margin enhancement even though market and economic conditions may create occasional fluctuations.
For the full year, operating expenses increased approximately 2% on a comparable and currency neutral basis, allowing us to increase our comparable operating income margin by more than 50 basis points.
Weighted average cost of debt was approximately 3% including debt issuances, capital leases, as well as the impact of currency swaps. And our overall effective tax rate for 2011 was 26.5%.
We also ended the year with strong free cash flow of $490 million with total capital expenditures of $376 million. While this is solid free cash flow, it was slightly below our [par] guidance and reflects the impact of a combination of factors. These factors include a pension contribution in the fourth quarter, as well as a net negative change in working capital, as the year-over-year performance and accounts receivable improved while the performance of accounts payable declined. This also reflects a modest incremental investment and commodity inventories that we may do opportunistically benefit our commodities position for 2012.
Continued strong free cash flow coupled with a favorable balance sheet and our overall ongoing growth are the keys to our ability to create value to our share owners through share repurchase and increased dividends. As we’ve discussed, we completed a $1 billion program in 2011 and we have begun a new $1 billion program this past January. We anticipate repurchases of at least $500 million in our shares during this calendar year.
Now let’s turn to our outlook for 2012. As you saw in our release we confirmed expectations for the year inline with previously disclosed guidance including 10% growth in earnings per diluted common share.
Revenue is expected to grow in a high single-digit range with operating income growth in a mid single-digit range. This guidance includes the impact of the recently enacted excise tax increase in France and is comparable and currency neutral. Although it is still early to predict the 2012 currency impact based on recent rates, currency translation would decrease full year earnings per share by approximately 6%.
Let me note that the outlook for 2012 includes the expected impact of our work to transform our route-to-market model and packaging in Norway. As you saw in our release this morning we will move from direct store delivery to third party and customer warehouse delivery and transition our packaging from a fillable to recyclable and non-refillable packaging.
These actions will improve our marketplace competitiveness and flexibility, enhance customer service and increase the value we provide to our customers. It will also strengthen our operational efficiency and ultimately lower our carbon footprint. This initiative which we will complete over the next two years will require approximately $60 million in capital investments and result in $50 million in non-recurring restructuring charges.
We will provide updates on this matter as appropriate in our discussions with you throughout the year. Including this initiative, we now expect 2012 free cash flow in a range of $500 million to $525 million, with capital expenditures between $400 million and $425 million. Weighted average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3% and the effective tax rate for 2012 will be in a range of 26% to 28%.
Now let me add a bit of clarity regarding the expected facing of our 2012 results, particularly with regard to currency and operating income. Looking first at currency translations at recent rates, we expect a negative impact during the first three quarters and a negligible impact in the fourth quarter.
As for currency mutual operating income, given the recently enacted French excise tax, prior year hurdles and the timing of planned market activity we expect modest growth in the first half of 2012 with accelerated growth in the back half of this year.
In addition, you should note that there is one extra selling day in the fourth quarter of 2012 when compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This will have a modest favorable impact on fourth quarter results, but a negligible overall impact on the full year.
Given these and other factors we have discussed, we expect to achieve our 2012 guidance to the execution of solid operating plans with the phasing of the growth to be weighted toward the back half of the year.
So, in summary we are pleased with our success in 2011 and with the solid plans for growth that we have in place for this year. Of course, overall marketplace conditions remain difficult and then create issues as we move to the year.
However, we believe we have the right strategies in place to manage our business successfully, meet the challenging targets we've established for this year and achieve results at or above our long-term objectives.
Thanks again for joining us. And now, John, Hubert and I will be happy to open the line up for questions.

The majority of that’s incremental capital, but to be fair some of that is capital that we would have spent to maintain the old systems. So it's not all incremental, but the majority of it, clearly is incremental.
And we said that we would be looking at approximately $50 million in non-recurring restructuring charges, very broad strokes, about half of that would be non-cash charges as we accelerate the depreciation of the, filling lines for employees. And then roughly the other half would be cash charges, executing the project. Again the bulk of that would be incurred in 2012, but it would be spread over 2012 and ‘13.
This project will be fully go live in the second quarter of the 2013, so the benefits will start accruing to us in the back half of 2013 and beyond. I think if you look at it Norway is a very small country. Big picture, this is a relatively, it’s an important project for Norway but in the totality of the company it's a fairly small project.
It will have incremental investments, but I think at this juncture to model in significant increases in your overall model for the company, I think that would be unwarranted.

Norway was one where we really saw as we got into it a major opportunity here, frankly to get it much more in sync with the rest of our markets from both a DST System, broadly eliminating it and also getting into much more strongly consumer preferred package, which of course is one way. So, as Bill said, it’s not something that's particularly extrapolatable to other markets, most of them are already a lot closer to where we're going.

For 2011, we achieved comparable earnings per diluted common share of $2.18 that was up 22% on a comparable basis. Revenue grew 5.5% and operating income increased 9% both on a comparable and currency neutral basis.
These results are driven by solid volume growth of 3.5%. These are excellent results over our prior year pro forma performance and are in line with or exceed our long-term growth targets. Importantly, these results are another step toward a most important objective, growing value for our shareholders.
2011 also marked our first full year of operation as an exclusively Western European bottler. And we believe these results demonstrate both the value of our operating strategies, as well as our ability to succeed in the Western European markets in which we operate.

And it reinforces our confidence in our long-term potential. In fact, these are the types of results that we foresaw when we closed the transaction of the Coca-Cola Company to create this Company less than 18 months ago.
Now, let's take a look at some of the key factors behind our earnings. Importantly our core Coca-Cola trademark brands, where at the heart of these results growing approximately 3.5% and delivering more than half of our total volume growth for the year. And that was led by both regular Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Zero.
In addition, we saw a solid 4% growth in sparkling flavors including an increase of more than 40% in energy driven by Monster as well as the introduction of POWERADE Energy in Great Britain. We also achieved 3% growth in stills led by Capri Sun and Ocean Spray and growth in water led by Chaudfontaine
and Schweppes Abbey Well. 
By territory, volume growth was led by continental Europe, which was up 4.5% while Great Britain volume increased 2.5%. For the fourth quarter volume increased 3% driven primarily by the excellent growth from the continent of 6% and growth of 1% in Great Britain.
As previously forecasted, our full-year pricing per case was below the full-year increase in cost of goods sold per case. Bill will provide more color on this in a few moments, but let me emphasize we remain committed to expanding or maintaining margins over time, even though shifts in business conditions such as those we experienced in 2011 can create margin fluctuations.
Overall we’re pleased by these results. And we are confident that our 2012 business plans will build on this foundation creating value again for our customers and for our shareholders.
As we discussed with you in December, our full year 2012 outlook is in line with or above our long-term objectives despite the impact of a recently enacted tax increase in France. We expect earnings per share growth of about 10% driven by operating income growth in a mid single-digit range and continued execution of our planned share repurchase program.
We anticipate revenue growth in a high single-digit range. Each of these ranges are comparable and currency neutral and include the expected impact of the French tax. We also expect free cash flow in a range of $500 million to $525 million with capital expenditures in the range of $400 million to $425 million. This guidance is build on solid operating and marketing plans that focus on maximizing the benefits of key significant initiatives, which include the London 2012 Olympics and the Euro 2012 Soccer Championship.
The London Olympics as a centerpiece of our marketing plans this year and represent a unique opportunity for our company and our people. In 2012, we’ll demonstrate our ability to successfully meet customer and consumer needs while maximizing the benefits of the Coca-Cola system support of the games for our share owners. Our Olympic related activity actually began in 2010 with significant successful programs in place with our key customers.
Our plans for 2012 include the Olympic torch relay which runs for 70 days and comes within one hour of 95% of the population in Great Britain. Extensive in-store Olympic programs will be in place for the summer across all of our markets. We will also utilize our partnership with the 2012 European Soccer Championship or Euro 2012 throughout the territories. The Olympic and Euro 2012 activities supplement our longstanding programs which include music promotions and Coke with Food.
All of these programs create a solid platform from which to engage consumers and continued to build our relationships with our customers. In fact customer service is at the heart of our ability to move this company forward. We have made excellent progress in this area as demonstrated by the fact that our customers now rate us as the number one fast moving consumer goods supplier in each of our legacy territories.
We will continue to enhance our customer relationships and our service in the year ahead ultimately creating sustainable growth and category value for our customers. Our commitment to service and to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency is reflected in a decision we announced today to step change our route-to-market and our packaging profile in Norway.
Norway despite having a relatively low population density currently uses a direct store delivery model and our Norwegian business also relies heavily on refillable packaging. By modifying our routes-to-market and converting to recyclable and non-refillable packaging, we will improve our customer service and drive value for customers, consumers and our share owners.
Additionally, moving to non-refillable bottles enables us to use innovative recyclable materials such as the PlantBottle in our operations. This allows us to provide additional packaging options to consumers and helps us to reduce our carbon footprint in our production and supply chain process fees. This initiative is in its early stages and we look forward to sharing additional details with you in the near term.
Bill will provide some incremental details on the financial impact in a few minute. Going forward, our business plans for 2012 are centered on one ultimate goal, creating enhanced value for our share owners through consistent value building growth. Beyond our operating plans, we’ve demonstrated that commitment in 2 key ways.
First, we recently enacted a substantial 23% increase in our dividend, marking the fifth consecutive year of increases. This is also the second increase since the completion of the transaction and creating our new company some 18 months ago.
In addition, we’re moving forward with our share repurchase program. We completed an initial $1 billion program in the fourth quarter of 2011 and begin a new $1 billion program last month.
Our goal for 2012 is to repurchase at least $500 million worth of our shares. These are meaningful actions and we remain committed to increasing share owner returns for the long-term.
At the core of these strategies as well as our company, is a highly talented and dedicated team that is focused on success. At every level of our company in every territory, our people were committed to achieving increasingly high standards of performance. Our results and our 2012 outlook are solid proof of their skill and dedication.
We continue to see opportunities ahead for growth and value creation in each of our territories. Despite the challenges of currencies and soft macroeconomic conditions we operate in stable territories with established consumer goods environments. We believe we have the right operating strategies in place to seize opportunities and to meet the demands of dynamic marketplace conditions.
In fact we believe the CCE Way, which is a combination of our operating philosophy and our marketplace approach will enable us to seize growth opportunities, enhance our operating strategies and deliver a seventh consecutive year of growth in 2012. Thank you for your continuing interest in our company and your participation today.
Now, I'll turn it over to Bill."
109130811,145850517,260557,"Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2012",2012-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC","Executives","Thanks John, and we appreciate each of you being with us today as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results. We achieved solid earnings growth in 2011 with comparable full year earnings per diluted common share of $2.18, up 22% from pro for",1016,"Thanks John, and we appreciate each of you being with us today as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results. We achieved solid earnings growth in 2011 with comparable full year earnings per diluted common share of $2.18, up 22% from pro forma 2010 results.
In addition, comparable operating income increased 17% to $1.1 billion and total revenue grew more than 11% to $8.3 billion. These results include a full year currency benefit of $0.15 on earnings per share. This was the sixth consecutive year of growth for CCE in Europe. And our results were in line with or above our long-term growth targets.
We are encouraged by these results, which as John mentioned demonstrate what we believe is the growth potential of our business. Full year net pricing per case grew 2%, while cost of sales per case grew 3%. As we discussed with you throughout the year, this reflects the impact of higher increases in cost of goods during the second and third quarters. As we expected the balance between pricing and cost returned in the fourth quarter with both pricing and cost of goods sold up 2.5% per case.
As John mentioned we remained committed to margin enhancement even though market and economic conditions may create occasional fluctuations.
For the full year, operating expenses increased approximately 2% on a comparable and currency neutral basis, allowing us to increase our comparable operating income margin by more than 50 basis points.
Weighted average cost of debt was approximately 3% including debt issuances, capital leases, as well as the impact of currency swaps. And our overall effective tax rate for 2011 was 26.5%.
We also ended the year with strong free cash flow of $490 million with total capital expenditures of $376 million. While this is solid free cash flow, it was slightly below our prior guidance and reflects the impact of a combination of factors. These factors include a pension contribution in the fourth quarter, as well as a net negative change in working capital, as the year-over-year performance and accounts receivable improved while the performance of accounts payable declined. This also reflects a modest incremental investment and commodity inventories that we may do opportunistically benefit our commodities position for 2012.
Continued strong free cash flow coupled with a favorable balance sheet and our overall ongoing growth are the keys to our ability to create value to our share owners through share repurchase and increased dividends. As we’ve discussed, we completed a $1 billion program in 2011 and we have begun a new $1 billion program this past January. We anticipate repurchases of at least $500 million in our shares during this calendar year.
Now let’s turn to our outlook for 2012. As you saw in our release we confirmed expectations for the year in line with previously disclosed guidance including 10% growth in earnings per diluted common share.
Revenue is expected to grow in a high single-digit range with operating income growth in a mid single-digit range. This guidance includes the impact of the recently enacted excise tax increase in France and is comparable and currency neutral. Although it is still early to predict the 2012 currency impact based on recent rates, currency translation would decrease full year earnings per share by approximately 6%.
Let me note that the outlook for 2012 includes the expected impact of our work to transform our route-to-market model and packaging in Norway. As you saw in our release this morning we will move from direct store delivery to third party and customer warehouse delivery and transition our packaging from a fillable to recyclable and non-refillable packaging.
These actions will improve our marketplace competitiveness and flexibility, enhance customer service and increase the value we provide to our customers. It will also strengthen our operational efficiency and ultimately lower our carbon footprint. This initiative which we will complete over the next 2 years will require approximately $60 million in capital investments and result in $50 million in non-recurring restructuring charges.
We will provide updates on this matter as appropriate in our discussions with you throughout the year. Including this initiative, we now expect 2012 free cash flow in a range of $500 million to $525 million, with capital expenditures between $400 million and $425 million. Weighted average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3% and the effective tax rate for 2012 will be in a range of 26% to 28%.
Now let me add a bit of clarity regarding the expected phasing of our 2012 results, particularly with regard to currency and operating income. Looking first at currency translations at recent rates, we expect a negative impact during the first 3 quarters and a negligible impact in the fourth quarter.
As for currency mutual operating income, given the recently enacted French excise tax, prior year hurdles and the timing of planned market activity we expect modest growth in the first half of 2012 with accelerated growth in the back half of this year.
In addition, you should note that there is one extra selling day in the fourth quarter of 2012 when compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This will have a modest favorable impact on fourth quarter results, but a negligible overall impact on the full year.
Given these and other factors we have discussed, we expect to achieve our 2012 guidance to the execution of solid operating plans with the phasing of the growth to be weighted toward the back half of the year.
So, in summary we are pleased with our success in 2011 and with the solid plans for growth that we have in place for this year. Of course, overall marketplace conditions remain difficult and then create issues as we move to the year.
However, we believe we have the right strategies in place to manage our business successfully, meet the challenging targets we've established for this year and achieve results at or above our long-term objectives.
Thanks again for joining us. And now, John, Hubert and I will be happy to open the line up for questions."

The majority of that’s incremental capital, but to be fair some of that is capital that we would have spent to maintain the old systems. So it's not all incremental, but the majority of it, clearly is incremental. And we said that we would be looking at approximately $50 million in non-recurring restructuring charges, very broad strokes, about half of that would be non-cash charges as we accelerate the depreciation of the, filling lines are in place. And then roughly the other half would be cash charges, executing the project. Again the bulk of that would be incurred in 2012, but it would be spread over 2012 and ‘13.

For 2011, we achieved comparable earnings per diluted common share of $2.18 that was up 22% on a comparable basis. Revenue grew 5.5% and operating income increased 9% both on a comparable and currency neutral basis.
These results are driven by solid volume growth of 3.5%. These are excellent results over our prior year pro forma performance and are in line with or exceed our long-term growth targets. Importantly, these results are another step toward a most important objective, growing value for our shareholders.
2011 also marked our first full year of operation as an exclusively Western European bottler. And we believe these results demonstrate both the value of our operating strategies, as well as our ability to succeed in the Western European markets in which we operate.
This growth achieved amid ongoing global macroeconomic challenges marks the 6th consecutive year of volume and profit growth in our legacy territories. And it reinforces our confidence in our long-term potential. In fact, these are the types of results that we foresaw when we closed the transaction of the Coca-Cola Company to create this Company less than 18 months ago.
Now, let's take a look at some of the key factors behind our earnings. Importantly our core Coca-Cola trademark brands, where at the heart of these results growing approximately 3.5% and delivering more than half of our total volume growth for the year. And that was led by both regular Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Zero.
In addition, we saw a solid 4% growth in sparkling flavors including an increase of more than 40% in energy driven by Monster as well as the introduction of POWERADE Energy in Great Britain. We also achieved 3% growth in stills led by Capri Sun and Ocean Spray and growth in water led by Chaudfontaine and Schweppes Abbey Well. 
By territory, volume growth was led by continental Europe, which was up 4.5% while Great Britain volume increased 2.5%. For the fourth quarter volume increased 3% driven primarily by the excellent growth from the continent of 6% and growth of 1% in Great Britain.
As previously forecasted, our full-year pricing per case was below the full-year increase in cost of goods sold per case. Bill will provide more color on this in a few moments, but let me emphasize we remain committed to expanding or maintaining margins over time, even though shifts in business conditions such as those we experienced in 2011 can create margin fluctuations.
Overall we’re pleased by these results. And we are confident that our 2012 business plans will build on this foundation creating value again for our customers and for our shareholders.
As we discussed with you in December, our full year 2012 outlook is in line with or above our long-term objectives despite the impact of a recently enacted tax increase in France. We expect earnings per share growth of about 10% driven by operating income growth in a mid single-digit range and continued execution of our planned share repurchase program.
We anticipate revenue growth in a high single-digit range. Each of these ranges are comparable and currency neutral and include the expected impact of the French tax. We also expect free cash flow in a range of $500 million to $525 million with capital expenditures in the range of $400 million to $425 million. This guidance is build on solid operating and marketing plans that focus on maximizing the benefits of key significant initiatives, which include the London 2012 Olympics and the Euro 2012 Soccer Championship.
The London Olympics as a centerpiece of our marketing plans this year and represent a unique opportunity for our company and our people. In 2012, we’ll demonstrate our ability to successfully meet customer and consumer needs while maximizing the benefits of the Coca-Cola system support of the games for our share owners. Our Olympic related activity actually began in 2010 with significant successful programs in place with our key customers.
Our plans for 2012 include the Olympic torch relay which runs for 70 days and comes within one hour of 95% of the population in Great Britain. Extensive in-store Olympic programs will be in place for the summer across all of our markets. We will also utilize our partnership with the 2012 European Soccer Championship or Euro 2012 throughout the territories. The Olympic and Euro 2012 activities supplement our longstanding programs which include music promotions and Coke with Food.
All of these programs create a solid platform from which to engage consumers and continued to build our relationships with our customers. In fact customer service is at the heart of our ability to move this company forward. We have made excellent progress in this area as demonstrated by the fact that our customers now rate us as the number one fast moving consumer goods supplier in each of our legacy territories.
We will continue to enhance our customer relationships and our service in the year ahead ultimately creating sustainable growth and category value for our customers. Our commitment to service and to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency is reflected in a decision we announced today to step change our route-to-market and our packaging profile in Norway.
Norway despite having a relatively low population density currently uses a direct store delivery model and our Norwegian business also relies heavily on refillable packaging. By modifying our routes-to-market and converting to recyclable and non-refillable packaging, we will improve our customer service and drive value for customers, consumers and our share owners.
Additionally, moving to non-refillable bottles enables us to use innovative recyclable materials such as the PlantBottle in our operations. This allows us to provide additional packaging options to consumers and helps us to reduce our carbon footprint in our production and supply chain process fees. This initiative is in its early stages and we look forward to sharing additional details with you in the near term.
Bill will provide some incremental details on the financial impact in a few minute. Going forward, our business plans for 2012 are centered on one ultimate goal, creating enhanced value for our share owners through consistent value building growth. Beyond our operating plans, we’ve demonstrated that commitment in 2 key ways.
First, we recently enacted a substantial 23% increase in our dividend, marking the fifth consecutive year of increases. This is also the second increase since the completion of the transaction and creating our new company some 18 months ago.
In addition, we’re moving forward with our share repurchase program. We completed an initial $1 billion program in the fourth quarter of 2011 and begin a new $1 billion program last month.
Our goal for 2012 is to repurchase at least $500 million worth of our shares. These are meaningful actions and we remain committed to increasing share owner returns for the long-term.
At the core of these strategies as well as our company, is a highly talented and dedicated team that is focused on success. At every level of our company in every territory, our people were committed to achieving increasingly high standards of performance. Our results and our 2012 outlook are solid proof of their skill and dedication.
We continue to see opportunities ahead for growth and value creation in each of our territories. Despite the challenges of currencies and soft macroeconomic conditions we operate in stable territories with established consumer goods environments. We believe we have the right operating strategies in place to seize opportunities and to meet the demands of dynamic marketplace conditions.
In fact we believe the CCE Way, which is a combination of our operating philosophy and our marketplace approach will enable us to seize growth opportunities, enhance our operating strategies and deliver a seventh consecutive year of growth in 2012. Thank you for your continuing interest in our company and your participation today.
Now, I'll turn it over to Bill."

We achieved solid earnings growth in 2011 with comparable full year earnings per diluted common share of $2.18, up 22% from pro forma 2010 results.
In addition, comparable operating income increased 17% to $1.1 billion and total revenue grew more than 11% to $8.3 billion. These results include a full year currency benefit of $0.15 on earnings per share. This was the sixth consecutive year of growth for CCE in Europe. And our results were in line with or above our long-term growth targets.
We are encouraged by these results, which as John mentioned demonstrate what we believe is the growth potential of our business. Full year net pricing per case grew 2%, while cost of sales per case grew 3%. As we discussed with you throughout the year, this reflects the impact of higher increases in cost of goods during the second and third quarters. As we expected the balance between pricing and cost returned in the fourth quarter with both pricing and cost of goods sold up 2.5% per case.
As John mentioned we remained committed to margin enhancement even though market and economic conditions may create occasional fluctuations.
For the full year, operating expenses increased approximately 2% on a comparable and currency neutral basis, allowing us to increase our comparable operating income margin by more than 50 basis points.
Weighted average cost of debt was approximately 3% including debt issuances, capital leases, as well as the impact of currency swaps. And our overall effective tax rate for 2011 was 26.5%.
We also ended the year with strong free cash flow of $490 million with total capital expenditures of $376 million. While this is solid free cash flow, it was slightly below our prior guidance and reflects the impact of a combination of factors. These factors include a pension contribution in the fourth quarter, as well as a net negative change in working capital, as the year-over-year performance and accounts receivable improved while the performance of accounts payable declined. This also reflects a modest incremental investment and commodity inventories that we may do opportunistically benefit our commodities position for 2012.
Continued strong free cash flow coupled with a favorable balance sheet and our overall ongoing growth are the keys to our ability to create value to our share owners through share repurchase and increased dividends. As we’ve discussed, we completed a $1 billion program in 2011 and we have begun a new $1 billion program this past January. We anticipate repurchases of at least $500 million in our shares during this calendar year.
Now let’s turn to our outlook for 2012. As you saw in our release we confirmed expectations for the year in line with previously disclosed guidance including 10% growth in earnings per diluted common share.
Revenue is expected to grow in a high single-digit range with operating income growth in a mid single-digit range. This guidance includes the impact of the recently enacted excise tax increase in France and is comparable and currency neutral. Although it is still early to predict the 2012 currency impact based on recent rates, currency translation would decrease full year earnings per share by approximately 6%.
Let me note that the outlook for 2012 includes the expected impact of our work to transform our route-to-market model and packaging in Norway. As you saw in our release this morning we will move from direct store delivery to third party and customer warehouse delivery and transition our packaging from a fillable to recyclable and non-refillable packaging.
These actions will improve our marketplace competitiveness and flexibility, enhance customer service and increase the value we provide to our customers. It will also strengthen our operational efficiency and ultimately lower our carbon footprint. This initiative which we will complete over the next 2 years will require approximately $60 million in capital investments and result in $50 million in non-recurring restructuring charges.
We will provide updates on this matter as appropriate in our discussions with you throughout the year. Including this initiative, we now expect 2012 free cash flow in a range of $500 million to $525 million, with capital expenditures between $400 million and $425 million. Weighted average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3% and the effective tax rate for 2012 will be in a range of 26% to 28%.
Now let me add a bit of clarity regarding the expected phasing of our 2012 results, particularly with regard to currency and operating income. Looking first at currency translations at recent rates, we expect a negative impact during the first 3 quarters and a negligible impact in the fourth quarter.
As for currency mutual operating income, given the recently enacted French excise tax, prior year hurdles and the timing of planned market activity we expect modest growth in the first half of 2012 with accelerated growth in the back half of this year.
In addition, you should note that there is one extra selling day in the fourth quarter of 2012 when compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This will have a modest favorable impact on fourth quarter results, but a negligible overall impact on the full year.
Given these and other factors we have discussed, we expect to achieve our 2012 guidance to the execution of solid operating plans with the phasing of the growth to be weighted toward the back half of the year.
So, in summary we are pleased with our success in 2011 and with the solid plans for growth that we have in place for this year. Of course, overall marketplace conditions remain difficult and then create issues as we move to the year.
However, we believe we have the right strategies in place to manage our business successfully, meet the challenging targets we've established for this year and achieve results at or above our long-term objectives.
Thanks again for joining us. And now, John, Hubert and I will be happy to open the line up for questions."

The majority of that’s incremental capital, but to be fair some of that is capital that we would have spent to maintain the old systems. So it's not all incremental, but the majority of it, clearly is incremental. And we said that we would be looking at approximately $50 million in non-recurring restructuring charges, very broad strokes, about half of that would be non-cash charges as we accelerate the depreciation of the, filling lines are in place. And then roughly the other half would be cash charges, executing the project. Again the bulk of that would be incurred in 2012, but it would be spread over 2012 and ‘13.

As we discuss our results for the first quarter of 2012 and review our outlook for the remainder of this year. As you saw in our news release this morning we managed to achieve continued growth and made good progress toward our full-year financials goals in spite of a challenging operating environment.
Comparable earnings per diluted common share totaled $0.36 up 9%. Revenue grew 5% and comparable operating income grew 6% both on a currency neutral basis. Net pricing per case increased 2.5%, while strong comparisons from the prior year and the impact of the excise tax increase in France were to limit volume, which declined a 0.5% including a modest decline in France.
Trademark Coca-Cola volume for the quarter grew 1% and the energy category grew more than 30%. Still beverages declined in a mid-single-digit range as we hurdled the impact of 2011 brand expansion as well as new products particularly in Great Britain.
While we’re never content with even the modest decline in volume, it is important to remember that the first quarter is our smallest. Looking forward we’re confident that our operating strategies, promotions, and marketplace execution leave us well positioned to achieve our targets for the full-year.
As you know we have plans to maximize the benefits of key marketplace opportunities this year including the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games and the Euro 2012 Soccer Championship.
We’ve made excellent progress in activating these events, which include the Olympic torch relay. This 70-day event begins less than a month from now on May 19th, and will come within one hour of 95% of the UK population.
Of the 8,000 torchbearers, 1,300 will be future flames a group of outstanding young people selected by Coca-Cola for their inspirational lives. We’re also playing a key part in making these the Greenest Olympic Games ever.
We’re using environmentally friendly production, transportation and cooling processes along with the focus and sustainable packaging and recycling to reach our low carbon zero waste Olympic goal.
Our Olympic programming, which will feature the Coca-Cola POWERADE and vitamin water brands, is a significant opportunity for us. As we partner with key retailers create a solid platform from, which to engage consumers and continue to build our relationships with our customers.
In addition to Olympic related events we have other marketing activation in place like a renewed emphasis and campaigning free beverages and later in the year a tie end would be new James Bond’s film called Skyfall. We will also work to enhance the performance of our sparkling flavor portfolio and that includes energy. This will include new sweetener alternatives such as stevia and new Fanta flavors such as mango and passion fruit. Still beverages which provided more than 10% of our growth last year will benefit from both new flavors and packaging for Capri Sun, Oasis and POWERADE. Additionally, a new vitamin water flavor was created from suggestions by consumers through Facebook and we will also create a renewed focus in the tea category with the Nestea brand which is now being relaunched in France and Belgium.
Beyond product innovation we also have new packaging initiatives including a new 375 milliliter packet size bottle and 250 ml cans both targeted to meet specific consumer demands. We also continue to enhance consumer, I’m sorry, customer relationships to create even higher levels of execution.
For example, we’re working in Great Britain to improve in store displays and fixtures with an increased focus on brand presentation. In France we’re further enhancing our go-to-market strategies by improving sales versus productivity as well as our ability to monitor the effectiveness of our promotions. These opportunities and our commitment to world class execution are driving our 2012 business performance.
As we’ve discussed our full year outlook is inlined with or above our long term objectives with earnings per share growth of about 10% driven by operating income growth and a mid single digit range and continued execution of our current share repurchase program. Most importantly by reaching our 2012 targets and creating sustained growth we will continue to enhance value for our share owners, which is our ultimate goal.
Already in 2012, we’ve enacted a substantial 23% increase in our dividend and continue to move forward with share repurchase. Our goal for this year is to repurchase at least $500 million worth of our shares with a $150 million in repurchases in the first quarter we are on target to achieve that goal. These are meaningful actions and we remain committed to increasing share owner returns with a long term.
In closing, let me share some key thoughts, first rebuilding on a consistent track record Western Europe and we have confidence in our ability to deliver another year of growth. Second, while ongoing macro economic challenges persists, we continue to demonstrate our ability to manage our business to deliver that growth.
We believe the CCE way, which is a combination of our operating philosophy and our marketplace approach will continue to enable us to maximize the benefits of the growth and the value creation opportunities that we see ahead.
Third, we have one of the worlds most recognized brand portfolios with growing core brands led by the Coca-Cola trademark and a significant presence in emerging categories like energy.
And finally, our partner of Coca-Cola Company shares our commitment to our customers, to our brands and to refreshing consumers everyday. All of this comes together through the talent and dedication of our people they are a highly talented and skilled team that understands how to succeed in the marketplace. This team is a vital element in reaching almost important goal and that is driving increasing levels of shareowner value.
Thank you for your continued interest in our company as well as your participation today. Now I’ll turn it over to Bill.

And thanks to each of you for joining us this morning I know it’s a busy day for many of you. Now I’d like to turn to our first quarter results, which represent a good start to the year.On a reported basis first quarter diluted earnings",903,"Thanks John. And thanks to each of you for joining us this morning I know it’s a busy day for many of you. Now I’d like to turn to our first quarter results, which represent a good start to the year.
On a reported basis first quarter diluted earnings per common share were $0.35 and on a comparable basis earnings per share were $0.36 up from $0.33 in the same quarter last year.
Currency translation had a negative impact of $0.02 per share, compared to the prior year results. Revenue was $1.87 billion up 1.5%. Organic revenue grew approximately 2.5%, while the French excise tax increase also contributed 2.5% for a combined overall currency neutral revenue growth of 5%.
Inclusive of the French tax first quarter net pricing per case was up 5 % and cost of sales per case grew by 6.5%. However, excluding the French excise tax impact net pricing per case increased 2.5% and cost of goods per case also increased 2.5%.
As John, mentioned volume decline slightly in the quarter as a result of strong comps from a year ago as well as the impact from the French excise tax increase. The quarter benefited from positive conditions late in the quarter notably from favorable weather as well as the timing of the Easter holiday. Comparable operating income was $175 million up 6% on a currency neutral basis.
This growth reflects volume declines in operating expense timing and controls. During the first quarter we move forward with our share repurchase program completing purchases of $150 million.
We continue to expect at least $500 million in repurchases by the end of this year. The share repurchase demonstrates our commitment to deliver shareowner value. As John mentioned earlier this year, we increased our dividend by 23% to $0.16 per share quarterly or $0.64 per share on an annualized basis. As a reminder, this is more than doubled the dividend that we paid in 2009.
Turning to the full-year this morning in our news release we reaffirmed our guidance, this guidance calls for approximately 10% growth in earnings per diluted common share with revenue up in a high single-digit range and operating income increasing at a mid single-digit range.
Each of these ranges are comparable and currency neutral and include the impact of the French excise tax increase. Although it is really to predict the currency impact on the full-year based on recent rates currency translation would decrease full-year earnings per share by approximately 6%. The targets above are inline with our exceeded or long-term objectives and we expect solid business results and share repurchase to drive full-year EPS growth above our long-term objective.
We continue to expect free cash flow in a range of $500 million to $525 million and capital expenditures in a range of $400 million to $425 million. Our weighted average cost of debt will be approximately 3% and our effective tax rate is expected to be in a range of 26% to 28%.
As previously communicated we anticipate our growth will be weighted toward the back half of the year. Looking at phasing it is important to highlight four factors. First, at recent rates, currency translation would happen by negative impact on the second quarter and transition to a negligible impact in the fourth quarter.
Second, even with the solid marketing program as John described, we expect volume will continue to be challenged in the second quarter due to several items. In addition to a challenging prior year hurdle and the Easter timing, we continue to expect volume will be impacted as the retail prices in France will fully reflect the excess tax increase.
Further though our first quarter benefited from excellent weather in March, April has had very poor weather. Third, we expect operating expenses to increase leading up to and around our planned summer initiatives. And finally, when compared to prior year our fourth quarter will benefit from a one extra selling day though the full-year impact of this will be negligible.
Importantly, today yet again we affirmed our full-year guidance of operating income growth in a mid-single digit range and EPS growth of approximately 10% both on a comparable and currency neutral basis. That said given the facing factors noted, we continue to expect currency neutral first half operating income growth to be positive with growth accelerating in the second half. Including the negative impact of currency translation, we expect our first half comparable EPS to be up in low single digits.
So overall, we are encouraged by our first quarter results. Success in the summer selling season remains essential and we do remain cautiously optimistic about the opportunities and plans we have in place in support of our full-year outlook.
As John mentioned, there are several factors behind our optimism including our successful brand portfolio, our operating plans, as well as our talented skill team that understands how to succeed and win in the marketplace. In addition, we have a capital structure that will enable us to seize opportunities and continue to return cash to share owners.
As noted we have challenging, yet obtainable financial targets continuing to meet or exceed these targets consistently over the long-term will enable us to achieve our most important goal, delivering value to share owners.
Thanks again for joining us and now John, Hubert and I will be happy to open the line up for your questions. Operator?

So we remain again optimistic that we’ll do that for the year. And I can ask Hubert to comment a little bit more on the French excise tax increase. I would say in terms of again throughout Europe, we started off the first quarter with some challenging comps from a year ago Jan and Feb. And then moved into April, where we had a better comps and frankly much better weather. And so the net result was very solid first quarter in spite of all the things we’ve talked about.
The weather in April has not been good as I think most of you know, so we’ve got a slow start onto the second quarter. On the other hand, we’ve got some great programs out there that are going to be kicking in as we go through the quarter. So, Hubert, why don’t you comment on specifically the French situation.

And we saw that retail pricing in France progressively increased during this quarter, as the customer, we are selling their existing inventory. The volume net on the first quarter was down modestly as we are having a solid previous year growth.
In France the elasticity is history is fairly low and it moderated probably the impact. But it’s fair to say that the impact has not been fully reflected in the market yet. So some customer have delayed the full implementation of that cost increase and so we will see the full impact probably in the months to come.

What we will see in front is that we had also led promotional activities this quarter because the negotiation were probably more complex and challenging that they use to be due to this unprecedented level of price increase combining excise tax and our size increase. However, we are now a very solid plan along the right - what we called the 180 days of sports which start with the Euro and the Olympics. So I don’t think the trajectory would be as brutal as you say and again there is a respond to price increase from the consumer in this past as been probably less stronger as you can imagine the market. So too early to say about the exact level of demand, response and again on the full year basis still confidence for to show some growth at the end of the year.

Again as I said, our first task was to implement our first half price increase in GB, which we did. We had some competitive activity on commercial programs. And as we said, we are most focused now towards Q2 and Q3 in support of the very strong marketing program. And you mentioned the difficult comparable from last year, which was above 6%.
So looking forward, we continue our IFRS both under gross return and the immediate consumption in GB. We have just launched new product - the new package the 375, which will alert and which is well received by the customer, which we will be including in most combo melding in GB. And we have now a lot of marketing effort from advertising campaign, I will take their full traction.
So we are entering Q2 and Q3 with a very strong program. We had a pickup with the sales region last week and they are all committed to deliver on growth any opportunity will be captured by the GB team. And clearly the program, if you compare the program of this year compared to last year, it’s more skewed toward May, June, and July. As you remember, last year we are the - in April, the Royal Wedding now the Jubilee is more in June and again the kick up of the Torch Relay, which is a big occasion for us to activate both the grocery channel and we’re way from them will start May the 19th, and then you will have the Euro in June and then the full speed Olympic started end of July. So it’s an incredible, I would say, marketing plan for GB to deliver and capture any growth opportunity in the weeks to come. And the timing as you understood is a big difference than what we are last year.

Net pricing per case increased 2.5%, while strong comparisons from the prior year and the impact of the excise tax increase in France worked to limit volume, which declined a 0.5% including a modest decline in France.
Trademark Coca-Cola volume for the quarter grew 1% and the energy category grew more than 30%. Still beverages declined in a mid-single-digit range as we hurdled the impact of 2011 brand expansion as well as new products particularly in Great Britain.
While we’re never content with even the modest decline in volume, it is important to remember that the first quarter is our smallest. Looking forward we are confident that our operating strategies, promotions, and marketplace execution leave us well positioned to achieve our targets for the full-year.
As you know we have plans to maximize the benefits of key marketplace opportunities this year including the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games and the Euro 2012 Soccer Championship.
We’ve made excellent progress in activating these events, which include the Olympic torch relay. This 70-day event begins less than a month from now on May 19th, and will come within one hour of 95% of the UK population.
Of the 8,000 torchbearers, 1,300 will be future flames, a group of outstanding young people selected by Coca-Cola for their inspirational lives. We’re also playing a key part in making these the Greenest Olympic Games ever.
We’re using environmentally friendly production, transportation and cooling processes along with the focus on sustainable packaging and recycling to reach our low carbon zero waste Olympic goal.
Our Olympic programming, which will feature the Coca-Cola POWERADE and vitamin water brands, is a significant opportunity for us. As we partner with key retailers, create a solid platform from which to engage consumers and continue to build our relationships with our customers.
In addition to Olympic related events we have other marketing activation in place like a renewed emphasis and campaigning free beverages and later in the year a tie end would be new James Bond’s film called Skyfall. We will also work to enhance the performance of our sparkling flavor portfolio and that includes energy. This will include new sweetener alternatives such as stevia and new Fanta flavors such as mango and passion fruit. Still beverages which provided more than 10% of our growth last year will benefit from both new flavors and packaging for Capri Sun, Oasis and POWERADE. Additionally, a new vitamin water flavor was created from suggestions by consumers through Facebook and we will also create a renewed focus in the tea category with the Nestea brand which is now being relaunched in France and Belgium.
Beyond product innovation we also have new packaging initiatives including a new 375 milliliter packet size bottle and 250 ml cans both targeted to meet specific consumer demands. We also continue to enhance consumer, I’m sorry, customer relationships to create even higher levels of execution.
For example, we’re working in Great Britain to improve in store displays and fixtures with an increased focus on brand presentation. In France we’re further enhancing our go-to-market strategies by improving salesforce productivity as well as our ability to monitor the effectiveness of our promotions. These opportunities and our commitment to world class execution are driving our 2012 business performance.
As we’ve discussed our full year outlook is in line with or above our long term objectives with earnings per share growth of about 10% driven by operating income growth and a mid single digit range and continued execution of our current share repurchase program. Most importantly, by reaching our 2012 targets and creating sustained growth we will continue to enhance value for our share owners, which is our ultimate goal.
Already in 2012, we’ve enacted a substantial 23% increase in our dividend and continue to move forward with share repurchase. Our goal for this year is to repurchase at least $500 million worth of our shares with a $150 million in repurchases in the first quarter we are on target to achieve that goal. These are meaningful actions and we remain committed to increasing share owner returns with a long term.
In closing, let me share some key thoughts, first rebuilding on a consistent track record in Western Europe and we have confidence in our ability to deliver another year of growth. Second, while ongoing macroeconomic challenges persists, we continue to demonstrate our ability to manage our business to deliver that growth.
We believe the CCE way, which is a combination of our operating philosophy and our marketplace approach, will continue to enable us to maximize the benefits of the growth and the value creation opportunities that we see ahead.
Third, we have one of the world’s most recognized brand portfolios with growing core brands led by the Coca-Cola trademark and a significant presence in emerging categories like energy.
And finally, our partner of Coca-Cola Company shares our commitment to our customers, to our brands and to refreshing consumers every day. All of this comes together through the talent and dedication of our people they are a highly talented and skilled team that understands how to succeed in the marketplace. This team is a vital element in reaching our most important goal and that is driving increasing levels of shareowner value.
Thank you for your continued interest in our company as well as your participation today. Now I’ll turn it over to Bill."

And thanks to each of you for joining us this morning. I know it’s a busy day for many of you. Now I’d like to turn to our first quarter results, which represent a good start to the year.On a reported basis first quarter diluted earning",901,"Thanks John. And thanks to each of you for joining us this morning. I know it’s a busy day for many of you. Now I’d like to turn to our first quarter results, which represent a good start to the year.
On a reported basis first quarter diluted earnings per common share were $0.35 and on a comparable basis earnings per share were $0.36 up from $0.33 in the same quarter last year.
Currency translation had a negative impact of $0.02 per share, compared to the prior year results. Revenue was $1.87 billion up 1.5%. Organic revenue grew approximately 2.5%, while the French excise tax increase also contributed 2.5% for a combined overall currency neutral revenue growth of 5%.
Inclusive of the French tax first quarter net pricing per case was up 5% and cost of sales per case grew by 6.5%. However, excluding the French excise tax impact net pricing per case increased 2.5% and cost of goods per case also increased 2.5%.
As John, mentioned volume declined slightly in the quarter as a result of strong comps from a year ago as well as the impact from the French excise tax increase. The quarter benefited from positive conditions late in the quarter notably from favorable weather as well as the timing of the Easter holiday. Comparable operating income was $175 million up 6% on a currency neutral basis.
This growth reflects volume declines in operating expense timing and controls. During the first quarter we move forward with our share repurchase program completing purchases of $150 million.
We continue to expect at least $500 million in repurchases by the end of this year. The share repurchase demonstrates our commitment to deliver shareowner value. As John mentioned earlier this year, we increased our dividend by 23% to $0.16 per share quarterly or $0.64 per share on an annualized basis. As a reminder, this is more than double the dividend that we paid in 2009.
Turning to the full-year this morning in our news release we reaffirmed our guidance, this guidance calls for approximately 10% growth in earnings per diluted common share with revenue up in a high single-digit range and operating income increasing at a mid single-digit range.
Each of these ranges are comparable and currency neutral and include the impact of the French excise tax increase. Although it is early to predict the currency impact on the full-year based on recent rates currency translation would decrease full-year earnings per share by approximately 6%. The targets above are in line with our exceeded or long-term objectives and we expect solid business results and share repurchase to drive full-year EPS growth above our long-term objective.
We continue to expect free cash flow in a range of $500 million to $525 million and capital expenditures in a range of $400 million to $425 million. Our weighted average cost of debt will be approximately 3% and our effective tax rate is expected to be in a range of 26% to 28%.
As previously communicated we anticipate our growth will be weighted toward the back half of the year. Looking at phasing it is important to highlight 4 factors. First, at recent rates, currency translation would happen by negative impact on the second quarter and transition to a negligible impact in the fourth quarter.
Second, even with the solid marketing programs John described, we expect volume will continue to be challenged in the second quarter due to several items. In addition to a challenging prior year hurdle and the Easter timing, we continue to expect volume will be impacted as the retail prices in France more fully reflect the excess tax increase.
Further though our first quarter benefited from excellent weather in March, April has had very poor weather. Third, we expect operating expenses to increase leading up to and around our planned summer initiatives. And finally, when compared to prior year our fourth quarter will benefit from a one extra selling day though the full-year impact of this will be negligible.
Importantly, today yet again we affirmed our full-year guidance of operating income growth in a mid-single digit range and EPS growth of approximately 10% both on a comparable and currency neutral basis. That said given the phasing factors noted, we continue to expect currency neutral first half operating income growth to be positive with growth accelerating in the second half. Including the negative impact of currency translation, we expect our first half comparable EPS to be up low single digits.
So overall, we are encouraged by our first quarter results. Success in the summer selling season remains essential and we do remain cautiously optimistic about the opportunities and plans we have in place in support of our full-year outlook.
As John mentioned, there are several factors behind our optimism including our successful brand portfolio, our operating plans, as well as our talented skill team that understands how to succeed and win in the marketplace. In addition, we have a capital structure that will enable us to seize opportunities and continue to return cash to share owners.
As noted we have challenging, yet obtainable financial targets continuing to meet or exceed these targets consistently over the long-term will enable us to achieve our most important goal, delivering value to share owners.
Thanks again for joining us and now John, Hubert and I will be happy to open the line up for your questions. Operator?"

As you heard us say before, what we are principally aiming and doing as driving revenue growth and we don’t have specific volume targets, we look at volume price and mix is all three very important letters to use in driving revenue growth, which of course drives OI growth. So we remain again optimistic that we’ll do that for the year. And I can ask Hubert to comment a little bit more on the French excise tax increase. I would say in terms of again throughout Europe, we started off the first quarter with some challenging comps from a year ago Jan and Feb. And then moved into April, where we had a better comps and frankly much better weather. And so the net result was very solid first quarter in spite of all the things we’ve talked about. The weather in April has not been good as I think most of you know, so we’ve got a slow start onto the second quarter. On the other hand, we’ve got some great programs out there that are going to be kicking in as we go through the quarter. So, Hubert, why don’t you comment on specifically the French situation."

And we saw that retail pricing in France progressively increased during this quarter, as the customer, we are selling their existing inventory. The volume net on the first quarter was down modestly as we are having a solid previous year growth. In France the elasticity is history is fairly low and it moderated probably the impact. But it’s fair to say that the impact has not been fully reflected in the market yet. So some customer have delayed the full implementation of that cost increase and so we will see the full impact probably in the months to come. But, as John said, we remain guardedly optimistic that we can grow the full year volume in France too."

What we will see in front is that we had also led promotional activities this quarter because the negotiation were probably more complex and challenging that they use to be due to this unprecedented level of price increase combining excise tax and our size increase. However, we are now a very solid plan along the right -- what we called the 180 days of sports which start with the Euro and the Olympics. So I don’t think the trajectory would be as brutal as you say and again there is a respond to price increase from the consumer in this past has been probably less stronger as you can imagine the market. So too early to say about the exact level of demand, response and again on the full year basis still confidence for to show some growth at the end of the year."

It’s true in GB, it’s true in France, so in short we did not notice a gravitation of the situation in away from home and as you mentioned the price point already pretty high in France and I guess most of our customer will be pretty reasonable in the management of their pricing to there on consumer, so no impact for them."

As you saw in our news release this morning we managed to",990,"Thank you, Thor and thanks to each of you for joining our conference call and webcast as we discuss our results for the first quarter of 2012 and review our outlook for the remainder of this year. As you saw in our news release this morning we managed to achieve continued growth and made good progress toward our full-year financials goals in spite of a challenging operating environment.
Comparable earnings per diluted common share totaled $0.36 up 9%. Revenue grew 5% and comparable operating income grew 6% both on a currency neutral basis. Net pricing per case increased 2.5%, while strong comparisons from the prior year and the impact of the excise tax increase in France worked to limit volume, which declined a 0.5% including a modest decline in France.
Trademark Coca-Cola volume for the quarter grew 1% and the energy category grew more than 30%. Still beverages declined in a mid-single-digit range as we hurdled the impact of 2011 brand expansion as well as new products particularly in Great Britain.
While we’re never content with even the modest decline in volume, it is important to remember that the first quarter is our smallest. Looking forward we are confident that our operating strategies, promotions, and marketplace execution leave us well positioned to achieve our targets for the full-year.
As you know we have plans to maximize the benefits of key marketplace opportunities this year including the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games and the Euro 2012 Soccer Championship.
We’ve made excellent progress in activating these events, which include the Olympic torch relay. This 70-day event begins less than a month from now on May 19th, and will come within one hour of 95% of the UK population.
Of the 8,000 torchbearers, 1,300 will be future flames, a group of outstanding young people selected by Coca-Cola for their inspirational lives. We’re also playing a key part in making these the Greenest Olympic Games ever.
We’re using environmentally friendly production, transportation and cooling processes along with the focus on sustainable packaging and recycling to reach our low carbon zero waste Olympic goal.
Our Olympic programming, which will feature the Coca-Cola POWERADE and vitamin water brands, is a significant opportunity for us. As we partner with key retailers, create a solid platform from which to engage consumers and continue to build our relationships with our customers.
In addition to Olympic related events we have other marketing activation in place like a renewed emphasis and campaigning free beverages and later in the year a tie end would be new James Bond’s film called Skyfall. We will also work to enhance the performance of our sparkling flavor portfolio and that includes energy. This will include new sweetener alternatives such as stevia and new Fanta flavors such as mango and passion fruit. Still beverages which provided more than 10% of our growth last year will benefit from both new flavors and packaging for Capri Sun, Oasis and POWERADE. Additionally, a new vitamin water flavor was created from suggestions by consumers through Facebook and we will also create a renewed focus in the tea category with the Nestea brand which is now being relaunched in France and Belgium.
Beyond product innovation we also have new packaging initiatives including a new 375 milliliter packet size bottle and 250 ml cans both targeted to meet specific consumer demands. We also continue to enhance consumer, I’m sorry, customer relationships to create even higher levels of execution.
For example, we’re working in Great Britain to improve in store displays and fixtures with an increased focus on brand presentation. In France we’re further enhancing our go-to-market strategies by improving salesforce productivity as well as our ability to monitor the effectiveness of our promotions. These opportunities and our commitment to world class execution are driving our 2012 business performance.
As we’ve discussed our full year outlook is in line with or above our long term objectives with earnings per share growth of about 10% driven by operating income growth and a mid single digit range and continued execution of our current share repurchase program. Most importantly, by reaching our 2012 targets and creating sustained growth we will continue to enhance value for our share owners, which is our ultimate goal.
Already in 2012, we’ve enacted a substantial 23% increase in our dividend and continue to move forward with share repurchase. Our goal for this year is to repurchase at least $500 million worth of our shares with a $150 million in repurchases in the first quarter we are on target to achieve that goal. These are meaningful actions and we remain committed to increasing share owner returns with a long term.
In closing, let me share some key thoughts, first rebuilding on a consistent track record in Western Europe and we have confidence in our ability to deliver another year of growth. Second, while ongoing macroeconomic challenges persists, we continue to demonstrate our ability to manage our business to deliver that growth.
We believe the CCE way, which is a combination of our operating philosophy and our marketplace approach, will continue to enable us to maximize the benefits of the growth and the value creation opportunities that we see ahead.
Third, we have one of the world’s most recognized brand portfolios with growing core brands led by the Coca-Cola trademark and a significant presence in emerging categories like energy.
And finally, our partner of Coca-Cola Company shares our commitment to our customers, to our brands and to refreshing consumers every day. All of this comes together through the talent and dedication of our people they are a highly talented and skilled team that understands how to succeed in the marketplace. This team is a vital element in reaching our most important goal and that is driving increasing levels of shareowner value.
Thank you for your continued interest in our company as well as your participation today. Now I’ll turn it over to Bill."

Now I’d like to turn to our first quarter results, which represent a good start to the year.On a reported basis first quarter diluted earning",901,"Thanks John. And thanks to each of you for joining us this morning. I know it’s a busy day for many of you. Now I’d like to turn to our first quarter results, which represent a good start to the year.
On a reported basis first quarter diluted earnings per common share were $0.35 and on a comparable basis earnings per share were $0.36 up from $0.33 in the same quarter last year.
Currency translation had a negative impact of $0.02 per share, compared to the prior year results. Revenue was $1.87 billion up 1.5%. Organic revenue grew approximately 2.5%, while the French excise tax increase also contributed 2.5% for a combined overall currency neutral revenue growth of 5%.
Inclusive of the French tax first quarter net pricing per case was up 5% and cost of sales per case grew by 6.5%. However, excluding the French excise tax impact net pricing per case increased 2.5% and cost of goods per case also increased 2.5%.
As John, mentioned volume declined slightly in the quarter as a result of strong comps from a year ago as well as the impact from the French excise tax increase. The quarter benefited from positive conditions late in the quarter notably from favorable weather as well as the timing of the Easter holiday. Comparable operating income was $175 million up 6% on a currency neutral basis.
This growth reflects volume declines in operating expense timing and controls. During the first quarter we move forward with our share repurchase program completing purchases of $150 million.
We continue to expect at least $500 million in repurchases by the end of this year. The share repurchase demonstrates our commitment to deliver shareowner value. As John mentioned earlier this year, we increased our dividend by 23% to $0.16 per share quarterly or $0.64 per share on an annualized basis. As a reminder, this is more than double the dividend that we paid in 2009.
Turning to the full-year this morning in our news release we reaffirmed our guidance, this guidance calls for approximately 10% growth in earnings per diluted common share with revenue up in a high single-digit range and operating income increasing at a mid single-digit range.
Each of these ranges are comparable and currency neutral and include the impact of the French excise tax increase. Although it is early to predict the currency impact on the full-year based on recent rates currency translation would decrease full-year earnings per share by approximately 6%. The targets above are in line with our exceeded or long-term objectives and we expect solid business results and share repurchase to drive full-year EPS growth above our long-term objective.
We continue to expect free cash flow in a range of $500 million to $525 million and capital expenditures in a range of $400 million to $425 million. Our weighted average cost of debt will be approximately 3% and our effective tax rate is expected to be in a range of 26% to 28%.
As previously communicated we anticipate our growth will be weighted toward the back half of the year. Looking at phasing it is important to highlight 4 factors. First, at recent rates, currency translation would happen by negative impact on the second quarter and transition to a negligible impact in the fourth quarter.
Second, even with the solid marketing programs John described, we expect volume will continue to be challenged in the second quarter due to several items. In addition to a challenging prior year hurdle and the Easter timing, we continue to expect volume will be impacted as the retail prices in France more fully reflect the excess tax increase.
Further though our first quarter benefited from excellent weather in March, April has had very poor weather. Third, we expect operating expenses to increase leading up to and around our planned summer initiatives. And finally, when compared to prior year our fourth quarter will benefit from a one extra selling day though the full-year impact of this will be negligible.
Importantly, today yet again we affirmed our full-year guidance of operating income growth in a mid-single digit range and EPS growth of approximately 10% both on a comparable and currency neutral basis. That said given the phasing factors noted, we continue to expect currency neutral first half operating income growth to be positive with growth accelerating in the second half. Including the negative impact of currency translation, we expect our first half comparable EPS to be up low single digits.
So overall, we are encouraged by our first quarter results. Success in the summer selling season remains essential and we do remain cautiously optimistic about the opportunities and plans we have in place in support of our full-year outlook.
As John mentioned, there are several factors behind our optimism including our successful brand portfolio, our operating plans, as well as our talented skill team that understands how to succeed and win in the marketplace. In addition, we have a capital structure that will enable us to seize opportunities and continue to return cash to share owners.
As noted we have challenging, yet obtainable financial targets continuing to meet or exceed these targets consistently over the long-term will enable us to achieve our most important goal, delivering value to share owners.
Thanks again for joining us and now John, Hubert and I will be happy to open the line up for your questions. Operator?"

So we remain again optimistic that we’ll do that for the year. And I can ask Hubert to comment a little bit more on the French excise tax increase. I would say in terms of again throughout Europe, we started off the first quarter with some challenging comps from a year ago Jan and Feb. And then moved into April, where we had a better comps and frankly much better weather. And so the net result was very solid first quarter in spite of all the things we’ve talked about. The weather in April has not been good as I think most of you know, so we’ve got a slow start onto the second quarter. On the other hand, we’ve got some great programs out there that are going to be kicking in as we go through the quarter. So, Hubert, why don’t you comment on specifically the French situation."

And we saw that retail pricing in France progressively increased during this quarter, as the customer, we are selling their existing inventory. The volume net on the first quarter was down modestly as we are having a solid previous year growth. In France the elasticity is history is fairly low and it moderated probably the impact. But it’s fair to say that the impact has not been fully reflected in the market yet. So some customer have delayed the full implementation of that cost increase and so we will see the full impact probably in the months to come. But, as John said, we remain guardedly optimistic that we can grow the full year volume in France too."

What we will see in front is that we had also led promotional activities this quarter because the negotiation were probably more complex and challenging that they use to be due to this unprecedented level of price increase combining excise tax and our size increase. However, we are now a very solid plan along the right -- what we called the 180 days of sports which start with the Euro and the Olympics. So I don’t think the trajectory would be as brutal as you say and again there is a respond to price increase from the consumer in this past has been probably less stronger as you can imagine the market. So too early to say about the exact level of demand, response and again on the full year basis still confidence for to show some growth at the end of the year."

At the same time, our focus remains under long-term growth and margins held. Our competition has been predictably quite active with promotional activity. As you mentioned, it started at in the last quarter of last year, it has continued through Q1, but we are now entering the heart of our marketing calendar in Q2 and Q3 headlining as said by John by the Olympics and Paralympics, the Euro 2012 not to mention would be given for GB which is a Queen Jubilee in June. So although we expect the pricing environment to remain pretty rational even as we expand, as we do I would say every year, some prior years have been increased plan promotional activities. So our performance will be probably impacted by the timings, the depths of our promotion, but again a lot of investment on this quarter, not only in promotion but also in marketing and the media around this event, the prior year comparables, the weather and of course the carrier activities. We also continue to invest as John said on the immediate consumption, marked occasions and we’re just launched in GB and we’re going to launch in other countries. The 375 milliliter PET bottle which is a tough exit for the meal deal in [indiscernible]. So we see the category as growing and expandable and especially in Q2 and Q3 with this program. We have all the element to capture any growth opportunity in May, June and July."

We’re in London in conjunction with our Board of Directors meeting and the upcoming London Olympics. I can tell you this is a city filled with excitement in anticipation of the London Olympic and Paralympic Games and we’re proud to have a significant role in the games. I will have more on this in a few moments.
Turning to our second quarter results, overall the quarter was very challenging as we work through a combination of bad weather, economic and market factors as well as comparisons to strong growth in the same quarter one-year ago.
Regarding weather, while we’re always reluctant to cite it as a factor in our results, we faced extraordinary weather related second quarter pressures in all of our territories. For example, this was the wettest second quarter in the United Kingdom in over 100 years and the wettest April in France in over 50 years. Reflecting these factors, our second quarter earnings per share totaled $0.73. Operating income was down 2% and net sales were flat, both on a comparable and currency neutral basis. 
Our net sales figure also includes a 2% gain from the French excise tax increase.
Let me note that our long-term prospects for growth remained solid and the recent weather challenges are temporary. We are focused on the opportunities we see ahead, our business fundamentals remain solid and we’re committed to continuing to manage each aspect of our business to deliver long-term value building growth.
In fact, despite the difficulties in the second quarter, currency translation and ongoing weak macroeconomic conditions, the full-year guidance we’re providing today for both earnings per share and operating income is essentially the same as the guidance that we initially provided last December. We plan to deliver these results by managing the leverage of our business, including outstanding marketplace execution, customer service, cost control and our strong balance sheet.
Now let’s look more closely at our second quarter results and the factors that contributed to them. As you saw in our release this morning, volume declined 6%, primarily driven by overall unfavorable weathers throughout the quarter as well as the impact of the French tax increase and comparison to strong growth in the same quarter a year-ago. Looking ahead we expect to return to volume growth as we have strong marketing plans and initiatives and importantly our brands continue to provide value and resonate with both our customers and our consumers.
During the quarter, we continue to make important gains in the energy category, with our energy portfolio up more than 16% in the quarter. Our multi-brand energy strategy continues to allow us to seize opportunities with fast growing Monster brands, while gaining additional presence with Burn, Nalu, and Relentless.
The continued success of the Coke Zero brand was also evident during the quarter as the brand achieved low single-digit volume growth. The brand grew in Continental Europe during the quarter and grew an encouraging mid single-digit in Great Britain. For the quarter our cost of sales per case increased 3%, while net pricing per case increased 4%, both excluding - that is excluding the impact of the French excise tax increase. Operating expenses were essentially flat due to market initiatives, cost controls, volume declines and timing that Bill will discuss with you shortly.
Of course we’re now near the start of the London Olympics. For CCE, this represents a multi-year initiative. This planning and the dedication and skill of our employees will provide world class service to our customers, our consumers, and our Olympic guests.
We are also pleased with the significant steps we’ve taken to ensure that we do everything possible to make these games the cleanest greenest ever with excellent packaging, recycling initiatives, clean fuel vehicles and a solo warehouse that will serve the games with maximum energy efficiency. In fact, our hope is that our recycling leadership will translate into a broader sustained commitment to step change recycling rates for the London marketplace.
Everyone in CCE and particularly our team in Great Britain is exceptionally proud of the planning and the effort that we’ve put forth to support these games. We believe our role in these games will have lasting benefit to our business and ultimately our shareowners by increasing the consumer connection to our brands and enhancing our customer relationships.
Now let’s look at the full-year. We have more closely defined our estimate for earnings per share to a range of $2.18 to $2.24. And that includes a negative currency impact of about 10%. We expect net sales growth in a mid single-digit range and mid single-digit growth in operating income. Both net sales and operating income are comparable and currency neutral. Bill will provide more detail for you in a few minutes.
Continuing the return cash to our shareowners through our ongoing share repurchase program is also an important part of our full-year plan. Under our current plan, we repurchased $375 million worth of our stock during the first half of the year and that includes $225 million in the second quarter. We now plan to repurchase at least $600 million of our shares in 2012 subject to the share limits of the plan.
The share repurchase plan continues to demonstrate that we remain intently focused on finding ways to enhance shareowner value, our single most important goal. In fact earlier this year, we increased our dividend more than 20% and we will continue to evaluate ways to drive shareowner value. In summary although we continue to face challenges, we believe we remain well positioned to manage each element of our business to generate substantial, consistent long-term growth and in turn continue to grow value for our shareowners.
Now I will turn the call over to Bill for more detail on our financial results as well as our full-year outlook.

And we appreciate each of you taking the time to be with us this morning as we review our second quarter results from our London office.

And we appreciate each of you taking the time to be with us this morning as we review our second quarter results from our London office. Looking at the results for the second quarter our diluted earnings per share were $0.73 on a comparable basis and $0.67 on a reported basis.
Net sales totaled $2.2 billion, down 8.5% on a reported basis, flat on a currency neutral basis and down 2% after excluding the impact of the French excise tax increase. Comparable operating income was $328 million, or $301 million on a reported basis. On a comparable and currency neutral basis, operating income declined 2%. Currency neutral net pricing per case increased 4% for the quarter and cost of sales per case increased 3%, both excluding the impact of the French tax increase.
Comparable current neutral operating expenses were flat as the impact of certain plant, market initiatives were offset by volume decline and ongoing expense control. So overall while we’re disappointed with our volume results, we view the key factors behind these results particularly the weather to be temporary issues that do not reflect the long-term outlook of our business.
As we look forward to the remainder of the year, as John mentioned, our guidance now calls for comparable earnings per diluted share in a range of $2.18 to $2.24, including a negative currency impact of approximately 10% for the full-year based on recent rates.
We now expect net sales growth in a mid single-digit range reflecting the business conditions that we have seen in the second quarter as well as early in the current quarter. However, we’re taking the necessary steps to manage margins, control costs and deliver on our bottom line objectives and importantly continue to expect operating income growth in a mid single-digit range.
Now let me add some color around the timing of our results. As we discussed with you during our first quarter call, we have continued to expect our growth to be weighted to the back half of the year. More specifically, the majority of the operating income growth is expected to occur in the fourth quarter. This timing reflects several factors over the next two quarters, including the timing of operating expenses, promotional plans, cost of sales, as well as the benefit of one extra selling day in the fourth quarter.
For example, while we have benefited from our expense control initiatives in the first half of the year, we do expect an increase in third quarter operating expenses as we execute our Olympic programs. Given these factors, we expect mid single-digit comparable and currency neutral earnings per diluted share growth in the third quarter with an expected negative currency impact of approximately 12% for the third quarter at recent rates.
However, even as we work through challenging operating conditions, our earnings per share results will continue to benefit from our commitment to share repurchase. In the second quarter, we repurchased $225 million worth of shares bringing our total share repurchase for the year to $375 million. We now expect to repurchase at least $600 million of our shares for the full-year 2012.
As you may know, the Board authorization for our current and previous share repurchase program has a cumulative cap of 65 million shares. Through June 30th of this year we have repurchased a cumulative total of 51.5 million shares. Based on the recent currency rates, we now expect 2012 free cash flow in a range of $475 million to $500 million, capital expenditures in a range of $375 million to $400 million. We expect our weighted average cost of debt to be approximately 3% and an effective tax rate of the full-year in a range of 26% to 28%.
Now before I move on from our guidance discussion, it is important to highlight a key point related to our current guidance. As John mentioned, despite the challenges we have faced this year, our expectations for comparable and currency neutral operating income and earnings per share are essentially in line with what we first presented to you in December of 2011.
While we clearly have had a very difficult operating environment in the first half of the year, it is important to note that we’re successfully managing the levers of our business including cost, sales, and our balance sheet to drive overall value. We have solid operating plans in place, opportunities ahead and we look forward to sustaining the type of growth that will continue to drive increasing shareowner value.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Thanks for joining us today. And now John, Hubert, and I will be happy to open the call up for the questions.

I think it’s fair to say that, that July is broadly inline with our expectations and that some of the recent weather here is a bit better and that’s great news and that’s true throughout all of the territories and as you said the forecast looks a bit better. All honestly we’ve assumed here for the third quarter is a normal weather pattern and that’s what we would like to see it return to. And you were absolutely right that we have put in place some incredible activation programs and there is no doubt that they will be far more effective if we have some good weather. In the last few days I think were demonstrative of that.
I don’t think candidly there is a huge difference in terms of weathers impact on our portfolio. We’ve got a broad portfolio, which plays across all kinds of consumer desires and honestly I think weather simply keeps people from traveling around and it’s a bit psychological. And what we’ve seen in the last few days is a very different kind of situation and we’re optimistic if that’s going to continue.

Possibly influenced by the weather our marketing calendar, which is now in full swing was more aided into the Olympics and more aided into July-August.
What we don’t expect for the second half of the year is a more rational pricing environment, we’ve taken our price increase has been stated in the beginning of the year and listening to our competitor Britvic in the earnings call they’ve mentioned that they’re planning to take price as of May and June.

John, you talked a little bit about the difference in the business model in terms of the impact of immediate consumption and relative to the margins in terms of future consumption. I think that highlights sort of the big structural improvement to your operating model as you spun off the North American assets and went to a distribution light model and non-DSD model as you moved into Europe. And I guess as we look into your consideration of the Germany business, when I think about some of the brutal de-levering quarters that I’ve seen in terms of the U.S. business in terms of what happens when volumes go south with the big DSD model. And I think I guess the question becomes why deal with the aggravation of that if we’re going to end up with down quarters and why not just stay with the asset light model that you’ve currently in Western Europe, what’s the advantage of bringing on a DSD business like that?

But we’re pleased that we have the flexibility in our business model to tweak and turn the leverage in such a way to come up with the result which is frankly a heck of a lot better than it would have been maybe under other circumstances.

I can tell you this is a city filled with excitement in anticipation of the London Olympic and Paralympic Games and we are proud to have a significant role in the games. I will have more on this in a few moments.
Turning to our second quarter results, overall the quarter was very challenging as we work through a combination of bad weather, economic and market factors as well as comparisons to strong growth in the same quarter one-year ago.
Regarding weather, while we’re always reluctant to cite it as a factor in our results, we faced extraordinary weather-related second quarter pressures in all of our territories. For example, this was the wettest second quarter in the United Kingdom in over 100 years and the wettest April in France in over 50 years. Reflecting these factors, our second quarter earnings per share totaled $0.73. Operating income was down 2% and net sales were flat, both on a comparable and currency neutral basis.
Our net sales figure also includes a 2% gain from the French excise tax increase.
Let me note that our long-term prospects for growth remained solid and the recent weather challenges are temporary. We are focused on the opportunities we see ahead, our business fundamentals remain solid and we are committed to continuing to manage each aspect of our business to deliver long-term value building growth.
In fact, despite the difficulties in the second quarter, currency translation and ongoing weak macroeconomic conditions, the full-year guidance we’re providing today for both earnings per share and operating income is essentially the same as the guidance that we initially provided last December. We plan to deliver these results by managing the levers of our business, including outstanding marketplace execution, customer service, cost control and our strong balance sheet.
Now let’s look more closely at our second quarter results and the factors that contributed to them. As you saw in our release this morning, volume declined 6%, primarily driven by overall unfavorable weather throughout the quarter as well as the impact of the French tax increase and comparison to strong growth in the same quarter a year-ago. Looking ahead we expect to return to volume growth as we have strong marketing plans and initiatives, and importantly our brands continue to provide value and resonate with both our customers and our consumers.
During the quarter, we continued to make important gains in the energy category, with our energy portfolio up more than 16% in the quarter. Our multi-brand energy strategy continues to allow us to seize opportunities with fast growing Monster brands, while gaining additional presence with Burn, Nalu, and Relentless.
The continued success of the Coke Zero brand was also evident during the quarter as the brand achieved low single-digit volume growth. The brand grew in Continental Europe during the quarter and grew an encouraging mid single-digit in Great Britain. For the quarter our cost of sales per case increased 3%, while net pricing per case increased 4%, both excluding -- - that is excluding the impact of the French excise tax increase. Operating expenses were essentially flat due to market initiatives, cost controls, volume declines and timing that Bill will discuss with you shortly.
Of course we’re now near the start of the London Olympics. For CCE, this represents a multi-year initiative. This planning and the dedication and skill of our employees will provide world class service to our customers, our consumers, and our Olympic guests.
We are also pleased with the significant steps we’ve taken to ensure that we do everything possible to make these games the cleanest, greenest ever with excellent packaging, recycling initiatives, clean fuel vehicles and a solo warehouse that will serve the games with maximum energy efficiency. In fact, our hope is that our recycling leadership will translate into a broader sustained commitment to step change recycling rates for the London marketplace.
Everyone in CCE and particularly our team in Great Britain is exceptionally proud of the planning and the effort that we have put forth to support these games. We believe our role in these games will have lasting benefit to our business and ultimately our shareowners by increasing the consumer connection to our brands and enhancing our customer relationships.
Now let’s look at the full-year. We have more closely defined our estimate for earnings per share to a range of $2.18 to $2.24. And that includes a negative currency impact of about 10%. We expect net sales growth in a mid single-digit range and mid single-digit growth in operating income. Both net sales and operating income are comparable and currency neutral. Bill will provide more detail for you in a few minutes.
Continuing to return cash to our shareowners through our ongoing share repurchase program is also an important part of our full-year plan. Under our current plan, we repurchased $375 million worth of our stock during the first half of the year and that includes $225 million in the second quarter. We now plan to repurchase at least $600 million of our shares in 2012 subject to the share limits of the plan.
The share repurchase plan continues to demonstrate that we remain intently focused on finding ways to enhance shareowner value, our single most important goal. In fact earlier this year, we increased our dividend more than 20% and we will continue to evaluate ways to drive shareowner value. In summary, although we continue to face challenges, we believe we remain well positioned to manage each element of our business to generate substantial, consistent long-term growth and in turn continue to grow value for our shareowners.
Now I will turn the call over to Bill for more detail on our financial results as well as our full-year outlook."

And we appreciate each of you taking the time to be with us this morning as we review our second quarter results from our London office. Looking at the results for the second quarter our diluted earnings per share were $0.73 on a comparable",781,"Thanks, John. And we appreciate each of you taking the time to be with us this morning as we review our second quarter results from our London office. Looking at the results for the second quarter our diluted earnings per share were $0.73 on a comparable basis and $0.67 on a reported basis.
Net sales totaled $2.2 billion, down 8.5% on a reported basis, flat on a currency neutral basis and down 2% after excluding the impact of the French excise tax increase. Comparable operating income was $328 million, or $301 million on a reported basis. On a comparable and currency neutral basis, operating income declined 2%. Currency neutral net pricing per case increased 4% for the quarter and cost of sales per case increased 3%, both excluding the impact of the French tax increase.
Comparable currency neutral operating expenses were flat as the impact of certain planned market initiatives were offset by volume decline and ongoing expense control. So overall while we are disappointed with our volume results, we view the key factors behind these results, particularly the weather, to be temporary issues that do not reflect the long-term outlook of our business.
As we look forward to the remainder of the year, as John mentioned, our guidance now calls for comparable earnings per diluted share in a range of $2.18 to $2.24, including a negative currency impact of approximately 10% for the full-year based on recent rates.
We now expect net sales growth in a mid single-digit range reflecting the business conditions that we have seen in the second quarter as well as early in the current quarter. However, we are taking the necessary steps to manage margins, control costs and deliver on our bottom line objectives and importantly continue to expect operating income growth in a mid single-digit range.
Now let me add some color around the timing of our results. As we discussed with you during our first quarter call, we have continued to expect our growth to be weighted to the back half of the year. More specifically, the majority of the operating income growth is expected to occur in the fourth quarter. This timing reflects several factors over the next 2 quarters, including the timing of operating expenses, promotional plans, cost of sales, as well as the benefit of one extra selling day in the fourth quarter.
For example, while we have benefited from our expense control initiatives in the first half of the year, we do expect an increase in third quarter operating expenses as we execute our Olympic programs. Given these factors, we expect mid single-digit comparable and currency neutral earnings per diluted share growth in the third quarter with an expected negative currency impact of approximately 12% for the third quarter at recent rates.
However, even as we work through challenging operating conditions, our earnings per share results will continue to benefit from our commitment to share repurchase. In the second quarter, we repurchased $225 million worth of shares, bringing our total share repurchase for the year to $375 million. We now expect to repurchase at least $600 million of our shares for the full-year 2012.
As you may know, the board authorization for our current and previous share repurchase program has a cumulative cap of 65 million shares. Through June 30 of this year we have repurchased a cumulative total of 51.5 million shares. Based on the recent currency rates, we now expect 2012 free cash flow in a range of $475 million to $500 million, capital expenditures in a range of $375 million to $400 million. We expect our weighted average cost of debt to be approximately 3% and an effective tax rate for the full-year in a range of 26% to 28%.
Now before I move on from our guidance discussion, it is important to highlight a key point related to our current guidance. As John mentioned, despite the challenges we have faced this year, our expectations for comparable and currency neutral operating income and earnings per share are essentially in line with what we first presented to you in December of 2011.
While we clearly have had a very difficult operating environment in the first half of the year, it is important to note that we’re successfully managing the levers of our business including cost, sales, and our balance sheet to drive overall value. We have solid operating plans in place, opportunities ahead and we look forward to sustaining the type of growth that will continue to drive increasing shareowner value.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Thanks for joining us today. And now John, Hubert, and I will be happy to open the call up for the questions."

And you are absolutely right that we have put in place some incredible activation programs and there is no doubt that they will be far more effective if we have some good weather. And the last few days I think are demonstrative of that.
I don’t think candidly there is a huge difference in terms of weather's impact on our portfolio. We’ve got a broad portfolio, which plays across all kinds of consumer desires and honestly I think weather simply keeps people from traveling around and it’s a bit psychological. And what we’ve seen in the last few days is a very different kind of situation and we’re optimistic that, that’s going to continue."

But on top of that and related for example to the torch relay which visited 66 GB cities, we are pushing a lot, the icon glass bottle in the license trade -- the first in GB and here again we are seeing some growth and this will be for the long-term. And on top of that as you mentioned we have 3-year plan with our customer.

We would feel confident about our ability to do that for the rest of the year. There has been some weakening in the commodity environment not withstanding corn over the last 60 days which has taken some of the pressure. I think our current outlook for the full-year for cost of goods sold per case is now in a range of 3% to 3.5%; when we spoke in April that was more in the 3.5% to 4% range, so we do see some in full-year benefit. As you mentioned we’re not really affected by corn in Europe.
Having said that, it's little too early to project into 2013. We would do that as we normally would in our December outlook call. But as you’re thinking about the puts and takes for 2013 cost of goods sales, going back to the sweetener element we are subject to the EU sugar regime in all of our markets with the exception of Norway and that’s a little bit of an anomaly outlier firm, as compared to some of the other recent commodity trends, i.e. it’s been going up."

And regularly we see period of planned promotional activity and as you stated the first half of the year has been no different, it has been quite heavy in term of competitive activity, to say the truth especially through the end of the quarter. Possibly influenced by the weather our marketing calendar, which is not in full swing, was more aided into the Olympics and more aided into July-August.
What we now expect for the second half of the year is a more rational pricing environment. We have taken our price increase, as has been stated, in the beginning of the year and listening to our competitor Britvic in the earnings call they have mentioned that they’re planning to take price as of May and June.

We’re in London in conjunction with our Board of Directors meeting and the upcoming London Olympics. I can tell you this is a city filled with excitement in anticipation of the London Olympic and Paralympic Games and we are proud to have a significant role in the games. I will have more on this in a few moments.
Turning to our second quarter results, overall the quarter was very challenging as we work through a combination of bad weather, economic and market factors as well as comparisons to strong growth in the same quarter one-year ago.
Regarding weather, while we’re always reluctant to cite it as a factor in our results, we faced extraordinary weather-related second quarter pressures in all of our territories. For example, this was the wettest second quarter in the United Kingdom in over 100 years and the wettest April in France in over 50 years. Reflecting these factors, our second quarter earnings per share totaled $0.73. Operating income was down 2% and net sales were flat, both on a comparable and currency neutral basis.
Our net sales figure also includes a 2% gain from the French excise tax increase.
Let me note that our long-term prospects for growth remained solid and the recent weather challenges are temporary. We are focused on the opportunities we see ahead, our business fundamentals remain solid and we are committed to continuing to manage each aspect of our business to deliver long-term value building growth.
In fact, despite the difficulties in the second quarter, currency translation and ongoing weak macroeconomic conditions, the full-year guidance we’re providing today for both earnings per share and operating income is essentially the same as the guidance that we initially provided last December. We plan to deliver these results by managing the levers of our business, including outstanding marketplace execution, customer service, cost control and our strong balance sheet.
Now let’s look more closely at our second quarter results and the factors that contributed to them. As you saw in our release this morning, volume declined 6%, primarily driven by overall unfavorable weather throughout the quarter as well as the impact of the French tax increase and comparison to strong growth in the same quarter a year-ago. Looking ahead we expect to return to volume growth as we have strong marketing plans and initiatives, and importantly our brands continue to provide value and resonate with both our customers and our consumers.
During the quarter, we continued to make important gains in the energy category, with our energy portfolio up more than 16% in the quarter. Our multi-brand energy strategy continues to allow us to seize opportunities with fast growing Monster brands, while gaining additional presence with Burn, Nalu, and Relentless.
The continued success of the Coke Zero brand was also evident during the quarter as the brand achieved low single-digit volume growth. The brand grew in Continental Europe during the quarter and grew an encouraging mid single-digit in Great Britain. For the quarter our cost of sales per case increased 3%, while net pricing per case increased 4%, both excluding -- - that is excluding the impact of the French excise tax increase. Operating expenses were essentially flat due to market initiatives, cost controls, volume declines and timing that Bill will discuss with you shortly.
Of course we’re now near the start of the London Olympics. For CCE, this represents a multi-year initiative. This planning and the dedication and skill of our employees will provide world class service to our customers, our consumers, and our Olympic guests.
We are also pleased with the significant steps we’ve taken to ensure that we do everything possible to make these games the cleanest, greenest ever with excellent packaging, recycling initiatives, clean fuel vehicles and a solo warehouse that will serve the games with maximum energy efficiency. In fact, our hope is that our recycling leadership will translate into a broader sustained commitment to step change recycling rates for the London marketplace.
Everyone in CCE and particularly our team in Great Britain is exceptionally proud of the planning and the effort that we have put forth to support these games. We believe our role in these games will have lasting benefit to our business and ultimately our shareowners by increasing the consumer connection to our brands and enhancing our customer relationships.
Now let’s look at the full-year. We have more closely defined our estimate for earnings per share to a range of $2.18 to $2.24. And that includes a negative currency impact of about 10%. We expect net sales growth in a mid single-digit range and mid single-digit growth in operating income. Both net sales and operating income are comparable and currency neutral. Bill will provide more detail for you in a few minutes.
Continuing to return cash to our shareowners through our ongoing share repurchase program is also an important part of our full-year plan. Under our current plan, we repurchased $375 million worth of our stock during the first half of the year and that includes $225 million in the second quarter. We now plan to repurchase at least $600 million of our shares in 2012 subject to the share limits of the plan.
The share repurchase plan continues to demonstrate that we remain intently focused on finding ways to enhance shareowner value, our single most important goal. In fact earlier this year, we increased our dividend more than 20% and we will continue to evaluate ways to drive shareowner value. In summary, although we continue to face challenges, we believe we remain well positioned to manage each element of our business to generate substantial, consistent long-term growth and in turn continue to grow value for our shareowners.
Now I will turn the call over to Bill for more detail on our financial results as well as our full-year outlook."

And we appreciate each of you taking the time to be with us this morning as we review our second quarter results from our London office. Looking at the results for the second quarter our diluted earnings per share were $0.73 on a comparable",781,"Thanks, John. And we appreciate each of you taking the time to be with us this morning as we review our second quarter results from our London office. Looking at the results for the second quarter our diluted earnings per share were $0.73 on a comparable basis and $0.67 on a reported basis.
Net sales totaled $2.2 billion, down 8.5% on a reported basis, flat on a currency neutral basis and down 2% after excluding the impact of the French excise tax increase. Comparable operating income was $328 million, or $301 million on a reported basis. On a comparable and currency neutral basis, operating income declined 2%. Currency neutral net pricing per case increased 4% for the quarter and cost of sales per case increased 3%, both excluding the impact of the French tax increase.
Comparable currency neutral operating expenses were flat as the impact of certain planned market initiatives were offset by volume decline and ongoing expense control. So overall while we are disappointed with our volume results, we view the key factors behind these results, particularly the weather, to be temporary issues that do not reflect the long-term outlook of our business.
As we look forward to the remainder of the year, as John mentioned, our guidance now calls for comparable earnings per diluted share in a range of $2.18 to $2.24, including a negative currency impact of approximately 10% for the full-year based on recent rates.
We now expect net sales growth in a mid single-digit range reflecting the business conditions that we have seen in the second quarter as well as early in the current quarter. However, we are taking the necessary steps to manage margins, control costs and deliver on our bottom line objectives and importantly continue to expect operating income growth in a mid single-digit range.
Now let me add some color around the timing of our results. As we discussed with you during our first quarter call, we have continued to expect our growth to be weighted to the back half of the year. More specifically, the majority of the operating income growth is expected to occur in the fourth quarter. This timing reflects several factors over the next 2 quarters, including the timing of operating expenses, promotional plans, cost of sales, as well as the benefit of one extra selling day in the fourth quarter.
For example, while we have benefited from our expense control initiatives in the first half of the year, we do expect an increase in third quarter operating expenses as we execute our Olympic programs. Given these factors, we expect mid single-digit comparable and currency neutral earnings per diluted share growth in the third quarter with an expected negative currency impact of approximately 12% for the third quarter at recent rates.
However, even as we work through challenging operating conditions, our earnings per share results will continue to benefit from our commitment to share repurchase. In the second quarter, we repurchased $225 million worth of shares, bringing our total share repurchase for the year to $375 million. We now expect to repurchase at least $600 million of our shares for the full-year 2012.
As you may know, the board authorization for our current and previous share repurchase program has a cumulative cap of 65 million shares. Through June 30 of this year we have repurchased a cumulative total of 51.5 million shares. Based on the recent currency rates, we now expect 2012 free cash flow in a range of $475 million to $500 million, capital expenditures in a range of $375 million to $400 million. We expect our weighted average cost of debt to be approximately 3% and an effective tax rate for the full-year in a range of 26% to 28%.
Now before I move on from our guidance discussion, it is important to highlight a key point related to our current guidance. As John mentioned, despite the challenges we have faced this year, our expectations for comparable and currency neutral operating income and earnings per share are essentially in line with what we first presented to you in December of 2011.
While we clearly have had a very difficult operating environment in the first half of the year, it is important to note that we’re successfully managing the levers of our business including cost, sales, and our balance sheet to drive overall value. We have solid operating plans in place, opportunities ahead and we look forward to sustaining the type of growth that will continue to drive increasing shareowner value.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Thanks for joining us today. And now John, Hubert, and I will be happy to open the call up for the questions."

I think it’s fair to say that, that July is broadly in line with our expectations and that some of the recent weather here is a bit better and that’s great news and that’s true throughout all of the territories and as you said the forecast looks a bit better. All honestly we’ve assumed here for the third quarter is a normal weather pattern and that’s what we would like to see it return to. And you are absolutely right that we have put in place some incredible activation programs and there is no doubt that they will be far more effective if we have some good weather. And the last few days I think are demonstrative of that. I don’t think candidly there is a huge difference in terms of weather's impact on our portfolio. We’ve got a broad portfolio, which plays across all kinds of consumer desires and honestly I think weather simply keeps people from traveling around and it’s a bit psychological. And what we’ve seen in the last few days is a very different kind of situation and we’re optimistic that, that’s going to continue."

Fair to say that the water in general are less affected because you’re looking especially on the continuance of daily heavy consumer which are less sensitive to the weather as opposed to the soft drinks. And fair to say also that the energy drinks have continued to grow despite this bad weather, but overall all categories have been impacted and I think it’s an industry issue we’re facing. Regarding the Continent and GB, I mean, it's pretty comparable even some -- in some way worse on the Continent again, because you’re with some low per capita countries where when you’re facing bad weather, the light drinkers are not coming to the category that why probably countries like France or Holland were more affected than GB."

But on top of that and related for example to the torch relay which visited 66 GB cities, we are pushing a lot, the icon glass bottle in the license trade -- the first in GB and here again we are seeing some growth and this will be for the long-term. And on top of that as you mentioned we have 3-year plan with our customer.

As you mentioned we’re not really affected by corn in Europe.
Having said that, it's little too early to project into 2013. We would do that as we normally would in our December outlook call. But as you’re thinking about the puts and takes for 2013 cost of goods sales, going back to the sweetener element we are subject to the EU sugar regime in all of our markets with the exception of Norway and that’s a little bit of an anomaly outlier firm, as compared to some of the other recent commodity trends, i.e. it’s been going up."

Year-to-date we have seen the pricing increase on the shelf in France as customers have strategically chosen to pass that increase to consumer, but they have done that on various timelines and frankly it varies by channel and it varies by pack. And today it doesn’t reflect the full impact of the tax and our tariff combine. But we still think that the elasticity of our product should in some way moderate the impact of the tariff increase.

I think that highlights sort of the big structural improvement to your operating model as you spun off the North American assets and went to a distribution light model, a non-DSD model as you moved into Europe. And I guess as we look into your consideration of the Germany business, when I think about some of the brutal de-levering quarters that I’ve seen in terms of the U.S. business in terms of what happens when volumes go south with the big DSD model. And I guess the question becomes why deal with the aggravation of that if we’re going to end up with down quarters and why not just stay with the asset light model that you’ve currently in Western Europe, what’s the advantage of bringing on a DSD business like that?"

But I think you pointed out very well what we’re so excited about and have been all along since this transaction and that is the flexibility that we have in our business model and we reflect back -- some of us to 3 to 4 years ago with some of the challenges we had in other markets, we obviously didn’t have that flexibility because volume -- the volume shortfall and the impact it has on your profitability in certain markets can be huge and so we’re not happy about the volume results we had here in the first half and we’re committed to getting it back on track. But we are pleased that we have the flexibility in our business model to tweak and turn the levers in such a way to come up with a result which is frankly a heck of a lot better than it would have been maybe under other circumstances.

As Thor said, I’m joined today by Bill Douglas and Hubert Patricot. 
In our news release this morning, we reported comparable earnings of $0.71 per share as net sales grew 2.5% on a currency neutral basis and excluding the impact of the French excise tax. Comparable currency neutral operating income declined 1%. Our results today reflect the impact of unfavorable weather early in the quarter, gross margin favorability and higher operating expenses due to the impact of promotional timing, notably for the London Olympics. They also demonstrate our ability to manage each of the levers of our business and the strength of our balance sheet to deliver sustained earnings growth.
Despite ongoing marketplace challenges, we continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver long term growth and to increase value for our share owners. We continue to focus on our key operating strategies, outstanding execution, increasing effectiveness and cost control that have enabled us to deliver growth even in a highly challenging macroeconomic environment.
A demonstration of this focus is the business transformation program that we announced today. These initiatives are designed to maximize the effectiveness of go-to-market strategies as well as back office functions and to better align our operating structure with an evolving marketplace. This program, subject to consultation with works councils, is expected to have non-recurring charges of about $200 million through 2014 and to generate about $100 million of ongoing benefits by 2015.
This focus structure will improve our platform for long term sustainable growth as we continue to strategically invest in our business. Regrettably, the program is expected to result in a reduction of our workforce, but this necessary step will ultimately position our company to deliver long term growth.
Now let’s look at the results for the third quarter. Our volume grew 0.5% with growth in sparkling flavored beverages, energy drinks and stills. Key brand results included double digit growth for Coca Cola Zero and Monster and solid growth for Capri-Sun, reformulated Nestea with Stevia, and Schweppes Abbey Well and Chaudfontaine waters. We achieved pricing per case growth of 2.5% with the cost of sales per case increase of 2%, both excluding the impact of the French excise tax. Both of these numbers are comparable and currency neutral.
Operating expenses increased 4% in the quarter as a result of timing and planned marketplace initiatives. These include our important work in the London Olympic and Paralympics games. We established several key goals for the games, including meeting the unique operational demands and opportunities, maximizing the benefits of our presence with our customers and consumers and importantly, making this the greenest Olympics games ever. We met or exceeded each of our goals in large part due to the skill and dedication of our people. Longer term, we believe our role in the Olympics will have sustained benefits for our business, including strengthened customer relationships. 
Additionally, we’ve clearly demonstrated our commitment to the environment, in the process establishing new standards and practices that will benefit our company and the communities we serve for years to come. In short, we’re proud of our work and value the opportunity to play such an important role in this once in a lifetime event.
Now looking at the full year, as you saw in our release, we now expect earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.20 to $2.24 with currency reducing comparable earnings by about 8% at recent rates. We now expect comparable and currency neutral net sales and operating income to grow in a low to mid single digit range. Bill will discuss this outlook with you in detail in a few minutes, but let me note that this modest decrease in our full year outlook is driven by a combination of factors. First, we are continuing discussions with key customers in France as we navigate through the ongoing impact of the French excise tax increase on the beverage category. Our focus remains on how to optimize the significant opportunity that our category represents over the long term in France.
Second, we’ve seen some renewed competitive pressures on category pricing in Great Britain and particularly in colas. Over the years, we have developed effective strategies to respond based on the value of our brands and our customer service and we will continue to implement and refine these strategies. Finally, as you know, overall macroeconomic conditions remain soft and we really don’t anticipate significant improvement in the short term. 
Though we expect these factors to be a headwind for operating income growth for the rest of 2012, we are able to leverage our balance sheet to drive EPS growth modestly above our long term objectives on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Importantly, longer term we continue to believe we will deliver sustained earnings per share growth in line with our long term objectives and ultimately drive shareowner value.
A key factor is our commitment to returning cash to shareowners as demonstrated by dividend increases over the past two years and our commitment to share repurchase. In the fourth quarter we will complete our current share repurchase program. Combined with our prior program completed in 2011, this represents approximately $1.8 billion or 65 million shares repurchased.
As a result, by the end of the year, we will have returned approximately $2.3 billion to shareowners since 2010 through share repurchase and regular dividends. This total increases to some $5.7 billion when cash returned as a result of the transaction of the Coca Cola Company is included.
Let’s be clear that our goal continues to be increasing value for our shareowners. We remain well positioned to achieve that goal even as we face the persistent marketplace challenges created by current macroeconomic conditions. We believe that creating value requires a sharp, consistent focus throughout our organization, coupled with teamwork, individual employee skill and dedication. Importantly, our operating framework continues to provide clarity on the key elements of our business. We continue to offer to our customers a product portfolio that meets an increasing number of consumer needs and importantly, includes the world’s most beloved beverage brands.
Also we have an extremely talented and skilled group of employees each of whom is dedicated to delivering results each day. Our brand, strategies and people create a valuable combination and we look forward to the opportunities ahead.
I also want to share with you news on our commitment to our communities and to the environment. We recently completed our annual CRS in Action week, a demonstration of our commitment to sustainability at a time when our entire category and industry is under scrutiny. As we discuss with our employees, our leadership in this area is demonstrated by us recently being named the number one beverage company for environmental, social and governance performance by Goldman Sachs. We are proud of this recognition and believe there continue to be a solid business case for our CRS work. 
We are investing in our business and the communities we serve with initiatives such as our French and Great Britain recycling joint ventures. Importantly, we’re seeing benefits in several areas, including efficiency and innovation, employee engagement and advocacy, customer service and bolstering our place in the community.
Now let me share a few final thoughts. Despite persistent difficult operating conditions, it’s important to note that we remain confident about our ability to drive long term value for our shareowners. We can and will continue to position our company for growth. We have a solid, flexible balance sheet and as you can see from today’s business transformation program announcement, we have the ability to evolve our operations to align with a dynamic marketplace. Putting it simply, we will not stand still, especially in difficult times. We remain confident in the ability of our team to manage through these challenges. We will build on our history of solid and balanced growth by managing each element of our business and executing against our strategic priorities. This will deliver growth in line with our long term objectives in creating increasing value for our shareowners.
Thank you for your time and interest and now I’ll turn it over to Bill for more detail on our financial results and our outlook.

Looking at our news release this morning, our results per volume, net sales and operating income growth continued to reflect the challenges of unfavorable weather early in the third quarter, sustained macroeconomic weakness and other marketplace issues that John just discussed. Third quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.89 or $0.71 on a comparable basis. For the quarter, net sales totaled $2.1 billion, up 2.5% over prior year on a currency neutral basis and excluding the impact of the French excise tax increase. 
Comparable operating income was $306 million, down 8.5% on a comparable basis and down 1% on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Excluding the impact of the French excise tax, net pricing per case increased 2.5% while cost of sales per case increased 3%.
Operating expenses increased 4% and reflect the impact of promotional timing, including the London Olympics and other planned marketplace initiatives. Each of the above numbers is comparable and currency neutral.
As noted in our release, having repurchased accumulative total of 59 million shares through the third quarter, we now expect to reach the board authorized cumulative cap for our current and previous share repurchase programs of 65 million shares by the end of this year.
Now, let’s look at our outlook. In the fourth quarter, we continue to expect year-over-year operating income growth with modest improvement in our outlook for cost of goods sold. For the full year, we now expect cost of goods sold per case to increase in a range of 2.5% to 3%. Additionally, while our business modestly improved during the latter part of the third quarter as a result of planned promotions and more normal weather patterns, our outlook reflects marketplace challenges, including ongoing customer discussions in France, the competitive environment in Great Britain and overall macroeconomic softness. Based on these factors, we now expect both net sales and operating income to grow in the low to mid single digit range on a comparable and currency neutral basis for the full year 2012. 
These factors, combined with our ability to leverage the strength of our balance sheet, the expected operating income growth in the fourth quarter and our revised currency translation expectations are all reflected in our updated full year EPS guidance. We now expect our EPS outlook for the year to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.24, including a negative currency impact of approximately 8% based on recent rates.
We continue to expect 2012 free cash flow in a range of $475 million to $500 million with capital expenditures in a range of $375 million to $400 million. Again both of these are on recent currency rates.
For the full year, weighted average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3% and our effective tax rate continues to be expected in a range of 26% to 28% for the full year.
Looking ahead, I would like to provide some comments on a couple of key topics. First, while our primary focus is investing in our core business to ensure we’re optimally equipped for growth, we continue to carefully evaluate our capital structure. We remain fully committed to driving shareowner value through a combination of business growth, dividends and share repurchases. Our business continues to generate significant free cash flow that is essential to returning cash to shareowners and we will continue to evaluate the best method for accomplishing this goal.
Whether we ultimately invest in value creating M&A, return cash to shareowners or a combination of the two, the route we choose will be focused on driving maximum value for our shareowners.
Next, given the current marketplace conditions already highlighted, we are working closely with our customers and are focused on long term category growth. Though we see some of these factors as a headwind, we continue to leverage our balance sheet to drive EPS growth in line with or modestly above our long term objectives. 
Finally, we expect to continue to face a tough commodities environment and expect a rate of commodity or cogs inflation in 2013 to be above that in recent years, driven principally by the cost of European sugar. We look forward to providing more detail on these factors in our 2013 outlook in mid December.
As we work to create value, it is vital that our company’s operating model continue to adapt to current economic and marketplace conditions. To this end, we have announced a business transformation program which is designed to enable us to accomplish three key goals. First, to restructure our sales and marketing organization to better align central and field sales into standardized channel focus organizations across each of our territories. Second, to streamline and reduce the cost structure of our finance support functions, including the establishment of a new centralized shared services center; and third, to continue improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of certain aspects of our operations, including service activities related to our cold drink equipment.
These programs are subject to consultation with the works council and is expected to incur some $200 million in restructuring charges. Of these charges, approximately 10% or $20 million are expected to be non-cash. Importantly, we expect this effort to create ongoing benefits of approximately $100 million by 2015. While any prospect of reducing our workforce is difficult to contemplate, this program is a necessary step for our business that will allow us to build on our platform for growth and optimize the marketplace opportunities before us. This program will allow us to continue to provide high levels of customer service and support the priorities of our global operating framework, including being our customers most valued supplier.
It also reinforces our belief that we could continue to generate the sustained profitable growth necessary to enhance shareowner value. We remain committed to our long term growth targets and we look forward to sharing with you more details about our long term plans and specifically our 2013 outlook on our normal call in mid December.
Thanks again for joining us and now John, Hubert and I will be happy to open the line up for questions. Operator?

That said, as you mentioned, specifically in the cola segment, competitive promotional activity has been quite volatile and what we saw during the Olympics is that the price were increasing from the competition in particular and we were kind of expecting that that would continue in the full and post the event. It's fair to say that it has not materialized and we see again pretty intense competitive promotional activity in the cola segment for the moment. But as we say, our focus remains on the value creation journey and we are engaging our customer along this line. So I think for the moment we see it continuing this quarter. I’m not sure it will continue for the long term. I think at the end of the day what is essential is to have both the topline and bottom line growth.

You’re right, there are a lot of moving parts here. The two items that we have specifically noted that have caused us to have a revised outlook are in fact the competitive activity, promotional activity, particularly on colas and specifically in Great Britain. That’s very real and we’ve noted that. The other is the fact that we have some ongoing issues and challenges with our customers in France, largely the result of the excise tax. But again we’re managing through those challenges also because France has historically been as you know what we call the land of opportunity. We have consistently grown our business in France over the last several years. 2012 has been a challenge largely because of those two items I just mentioned. Those really are the two things that are different. The macroeconomic environment we continue to monitor it. Obviously we’d like to see some improvement, but we wouldn’t characterize it as any worse than it’s been. We managed through the downturn in 2008 just fine and frankly the macroeconomics we’re looking at today and that we’re looking at in the fourth quarter are not any worse. They’re just not any better and we’re obviously guardedly optimistic that the macroeconomics will improve over time. But again, to answer your question, there are two principle differences and that’s cola competitive activity in GB and the customer challenges that we’ve had to deal with in France.

Let me first qualify by saying all of these initiatives that we’re talking about are proposed initiatives which will certainly go through consultation, appropriate consultation with the works councils. And so it’s important for us to always remember that. We have been studying this situation for a number of months. This is not any kind of an immediate reaction. Frankly we have known that there are a number of opportunities for us as well as challenges and what has emerged here is a series of initiatives as a result of a very in depth and long term study. The first part of it was a finance transformation again which Bill can give you more details on, but which we announced earlier and then separately we have some field sales and marketing and sales organization changes that we’re making which are based in many ways of what we’ve done in Belgium and Luxembourg several years ago, very successfully by moving to instead of a geographic organization, moving to much more of a channel focus in our selling organization. 
So we’ve done it successfully in Belgium and Luxembourg and now we’re doing it in our other territories. So we’ve also moved to a European-wide supply chain. Again that was a significant transformation. We did it successfully several years ago. And so in many ways what you’re seeing here that we’re doing today is based on studies, but also patterns which we established in previous moves that we made. Bill, let me ask you to comment on the numbers.

But in the tax arena we have some recently proposed amendments which would talk about an excise tax on energy drinks. We’re obviously monitoring that carefully and there have been some other discussions about increased taxes in France. So we are well aware of those and dealing we think effectively with them. In Belgium there have been some discussions of a packaging tax. There have been in the past on packaging, but we don’t think there’s anything right now that is an issue. And then in Norway, as part of their annual budget discussion there is some discussion about a tax on a variety of product categories which could impact us. So those are issues that we’re effectively dealing with and again that’s why we want to make sure we’ve got state of the art public affairs team that’s dealing with those. We and the Coca-Cola company are working hand in hand or doing that. 
Are there other issues? Certainly there continues to be items from time to time like questions around aspartame, or BPA. But again we are very vigilant and remain very focused on making sure that proper science is understood and in fact it was pretty interesting to see the results yesterday of a study that was indicating that there was problem with aspartame and then this affiliate of Harvard concluded that the study was not scientifically done and in fact aspartame is not implicated by this study. I think aspartame is the most widely studied and tested ingredient honestly in history. We remain very convinced of its total safety, but we have to be very clear and communicate. So, I guess that’s a bit of a walk around the forest. It’s taxes, regulatory issues and then occasional issues around ingredients that are the focus of most of our efforts.

And this unprecedented price increase and this is really from the category, our price was more in the 5% to 6%. And this unprecedented price increase combined with adverse weather and very challenging macroeconomic environment has been as you imagine a significant challenge for our customers and this is what is driving the situation where we are discussing. So we are continuing to work with them because as John said, the potential for growth in France is huge and we need to resume our value creation model with them. 
Once we have, I would say absorbed and once the tax will have been normalized in the retail selling price, which is not the case yet but should I think in the coming months evaluate in the right direction. We know that back to school period is always a very active period in terms of price activity for our retailers. We hope that in the next months it will be more normalized and then building on that we are going to resume our value creation story. But again, it has been a very tough period, it is still a very tough period for our retailers as the market is not growing in volume as you can imagine. We are getting share on the sparking market.

I’ll start with the second part of your question. Our current credit ratings are generally based on what we’ve been articulating consistently for the past couple of years that we intend to operate within the two and a half to three times net debt to EBITDA. So while we’ve been operating below that, generally the conversation with the credit rating agencies are based on the fact that over time we are going up into that range. So individually, they treat the actual versus the targets slightly differently but I think it’s safe to say that generally we envision operating in the triple B plus range. With the first part of your question, I didn’t follow it completely but again we’ve stated that our long term net debt to EBITDA range is two and half to three times and we would like to get to that by the end of 2013. We would operate within that range over time if we had a meaningful M&A opportunity, could we exceed that three times for a short period of time and then let the cash flow from the business inclusive of the acquisition bring us back down into that range? That would be the way we would envision that. We don’t see it as a hard cap but neither do we see ourselves exceeding that three times and then just staying above it and continuing to grow for a meaningful period of time.

So it’s always around that negotiation but I think the bulk of the pricing should have been absorbed now in the next three to six months. It doesn’t mean that we will not have some discretion with the trade because again, the market has been tough so far. But it would be a bit of a combination of them having taken I hope and it’s based on the latest figures, you can see the market some more pricing but it is about to resuming. There is a joint value creation story on the market which still has a huge potential. We really think the consumer are ready to accept some higher level of pricing as long as we come with the right marketing activity which we plan to do for next year. So, yes as always the round of negotiation with the French trade with probably a difficult moment to pass but I think we have the right plan and the right innovations to come to overcome this period

Quite frankly, it was a little bit of an opportunistic situation of third quarter both with Schweppes Abbey Well being highlighted in the Olympic activity in GB. It obviously got boost there, and as I mentioned Capri Sun did very well in GB also because of the market disruption at the product proof sheets being pulled from market for a number of weeks. So, are we going to be able to benefit from that same level of opportunity in the fourth quarter in 2013? I think not. Having said that, I think it’s an opportunity for consumers to have experienced our product and hopefully it will be an opportunity that we can leverage going forward to maintain some growth but to extrapolate double-digit growth going forward probably a little aggressive.

As Thor said, I’m joined today by Bill Douglas and Hubert Patricot.
In our news release this morning, we reported comparable earnings of $0.71 per share as net sales grew 2.5% on a currency neutral basis and excluding the impact of the French excise tax. Comparable currency neutral operating income declined 1%. Our results today reflect the impact of unfavorable weather early in the quarter, gross margin favorability and higher operating expenses due to the impact of promotional timing, notably for the London Olympics. They also demonstrate our ability to manage each of the levers of our business and the strength of our balance sheet to deliver sustained earnings growth.
Despite ongoing marketplace challenges, we continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver long term growth and to increase value for our share owners. We continue to focus on our key operating strategies, outstanding execution, increasing effectiveness and cost control that have enabled us to deliver growth even in a highly challenging macroeconomic environment.
A demonstration of this focus is the business transformation program that we announced today. These initiatives are designed to maximize the effectiveness of go-to-market strategies as well as back office functions and to better align our operating structure with an evolving marketplace. This program, subject to consultation with works councils, is expected to have non-recurring charges of about $200 million through 2014 and to generate about $100 million of ongoing benefits by 2015.
This focus structure will improve our platform for long term sustainable growth as we continue to strategically invest in our business. Regrettably, the program is expected to result in a reduction of our workforce, but this necessary step will ultimately position our company to deliver long term growth.
Now let’s look at the results for the third quarter. Our volume grew 0.5% with growth in sparkling flavored beverages, energy drinks and stills. Key brand results included double digit growth for Coca Cola Zero and Monster and solid growth for Capri-Sun, reformulated Nestea with Stevia, and Schweppes Abbey Well and Chaudfontaine waters. We achieved pricing per case growth of 2.5% with the cost of sales per case increase of 2%, both excluding the impact of the French excise tax. Both of these numbers are comparable and currency neutral.
Operating expenses increased 4% in the quarter as a result of timing and planned marketplace initiatives. These include our important work in the London Olympic and Paralympics games. We established several key goals for the games, including meeting the unique operational demands and opportunities, maximizing the benefits of our presence with our customers and consumers and importantly, making this the greenest Olympics games ever. We met or exceeded each of our goals in large part due to the skill and dedication of our people. Longer term, we believe our role in the Olympics will have sustained benefits for our business, including strengthened customer relationships.
Additionally, we’ve clearly demonstrated our commitment to the environment, in the process establishing new standards and practices that will benefit our company and the communities we serve for years to come. In short, we’re proud of our work and value the opportunity to play such an important role in this once in a lifetime event.
Now looking at the full year, as you saw in our release, we now expect earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.20 to $2.24 with currency reducing comparable earnings by about 8% at recent rates. We now expect comparable and currency neutral net sales and operating income to grow in a low to mid single digit range. Bill will discuss this outlook with you in detail in a few minutes, but let me note that this modest decrease in our full year outlook is driven by a combination of factors. First, we are continuing discussions with key customers in France as we navigate through the ongoing impact of the French excise tax increase on the beverage category. Our focus remains on how to optimize the significant opportunity that our category represents over the long term in France.
Second, we’ve seen some renewed competitive pressures on category pricing in Great Britain and particularly in colas. Over the years, we have developed effective strategies to respond based on the value of our brands and our customer service and we will continue to implement and refine these strategies. Finally, as you know, overall macroeconomic conditions remain soft and we really don’t anticipate significant improvement in the short term.
Though we expect these factors to be a headwind for operating income growth for the rest of 2012, we are able to leverage our balance sheet to drive EPS growth modestly above our long term objectives on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Importantly, longer term we continue to believe we will deliver sustained earnings per share growth in line with our long term objectives and ultimately drive shareowner value.
A key factor is our commitment to returning cash to shareowners as demonstrated by dividend increases over the past two years and our commitment to share repurchase. In the fourth quarter we will complete our current share repurchase program. Combined with our prior program completed in 2011, this represents approximately $1.8 billion or 65 million shares repurchased.
As a result, by the end of the year, we will have returned approximately $2.3 billion to shareowners since 2010 through share repurchase and regular dividends. This total increases to some $5.7 billion when cash returned as a result of the transaction with the Coca Cola Company is included.
Let’s be clear that our goal continues to be increasing value for our shareowners. We remain well positioned to achieve that goal even as we face the persistent marketplace challenges created by current macroeconomic conditions. We believe that creating value requires a sharp, consistent focus throughout our organization, coupled with teamwork, individual employee skill and dedication. Importantly, our operating framework continues to provide clarity on the key elements of our business. We continue to offer to our customers a product portfolio that meets an increasing number of consumer needs and importantly, includes the world’s most beloved beverage brands.
Also we have an extremely talented and skilled group of employees each of whom is dedicated to delivering results each day. Our brands, strategies and people create a valuable combination and we look forward to the opportunities ahead.
I also want to share with you news on our commitment to our communities and to the environment. We recently completed our annual CRS in Action week, a demonstration of our commitment to sustainability at a time when our entire category and industry is under scrutiny. As we discuss with our employees, our leadership in this area is demonstrated by us recently being named the number one beverage company for environmental, social and governance performance by Goldman Sachs. We are proud of this recognition and believe there continue to be a solid business case for our CRS work.
We are investing in our business and the communities we serve with initiatives such as our French and Great Britain recycling joint ventures. Importantly, we’re seeing benefits in several areas, including efficiency and innovation, employee engagement and advocacy, customer service and bolstering our place in the community.
Now let me share a few final thoughts. Despite persistent difficult operating conditions, it’s important to note that we remain confident about our ability to drive long term value for our shareowners. We can and will continue to position our company for growth. We have a solid, flexible balance sheet and as you can see from today’s business transformation program announcement, we have the ability to evolve our operations to align with a dynamic marketplace. Putting it simply, we will not stand still, especially in difficult times. We remain confident in the ability of our team to manage through these challenges. We will build on our history of solid and balanced growth by managing each element of our business and executing against our strategic priorities. This will deliver growth in line with our long term objectives in creating increasing value for our shareowners.
Thank you for your time and interest and now I’ll turn it over to Bill for more detail on our financial results and our outlook."
109130811,222592808,372248,"Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC","Executives","Thanks, John and thanks to each of you for taking the time to be with us this morning on what I’m sure is a busy day for a lot of you and we’re happy to talk about our third quarter results as well as other developments in our business.Looking at ou",1066,"Thanks, John and thanks to each of you for taking the time to be with us this morning on what I’m sure is a busy day for a lot of you and we’re happy to talk about our third quarter results as well as other developments in our business.
Looking at our news release this morning, our results per volume, net sales and operating income growth continued to reflect the challenges of unfavorable weather early in the third quarter, sustained macroeconomic weakness and other marketplace issues that John just discussed. Third quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.89 or $0.71 on a comparable basis. For the quarter, net sales totaled $2.1 billion, up 2.5% over prior year on a currency neutral basis and excluding the impact of the French excise tax increase.
Comparable operating income was $306 million, down 8.5% on a comparable basis and down 1% on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Excluding the impact of the French excise tax, net pricing per case increased 2.5% while cost of sales per case increased 2%.
Operating expenses increased 4% and reflect the impact of promotional timing, including the London Olympics and other planned marketplace initiatives. Each of the above numbers is comparable and currency neutral.
As noted in our release, having repurchased a cumulative total of 59 million shares through the third quarter, we now expect to reach the board authorized cumulative cap for our current and previous share repurchase programs of 65 million shares by the end of this year.
Now, let’s look at our outlook. In the fourth quarter, we continue to expect year-over-year operating income growth with modest improvement in our outlook for cost of goods sold. For the full year, we now expect cost of goods sold per case to increase in a range of 2.5% to 3%. Additionally, while our business modestly improved during the latter part of the third quarter as a result of planned promotions and more normal weather patterns, our outlook reflects marketplace challenges, including ongoing customer discussions in France, the competitive environment in Great Britain and overall macroeconomic softness. Based on these factors, we now expect both net sales and operating income to grow in a low to mid single digit range on a comparable and currency neutral basis for the full year 2012.
These factors, combined with our ability to leverage the strength of our balance sheet, the expected operating income growth in the fourth quarter and our revised currency translation expectations are all reflected in our updated full year EPS guidance. We now expect our EPS outlook for the year to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.24, including a negative currency impact of approximately 8% based on recent rates.
We continue to expect 2012 free cash flow in a range of $475 million to $500 million with capital expenditures in a range of $375 million to $400 million. Again both of these are on recent currency rates.
For the full year, weighted average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3% and our effective tax rate continues to be expected in a range of 26% to 28% for the full year.
Looking ahead, I would like to provide some comments on a couple of key topics. First, while our primary focus is investing in our core business to ensure we’re optimally equipped for growth, we continue to carefully evaluate our capital structure. We remain fully committed to driving shareowner value through a combination of business growth, dividends and share repurchases. Our business continues to generate significant free cash flow that is essential to returning cash to shareowners and we will continue to evaluate the best method for accomplishing this goal.
Whether we ultimately invest in value creating M&A, return cash to shareowners or a combination of the two, the route we choose will be focused on driving maximum value for our shareowners.
Next, given the current marketplace conditions already highlighted, we are working closely with our customers and are focused on long-term category growth. Though we see some of these factors as a headwind, we continue to leverage our balance sheet to drive EPS growth in line with or modestly above our long term objectives.
Finally, we expect to continue to face a tough commodities environment and expect a rate of commodity or cogs inflation in 2013 to be above that in recent years, driven principally by the cost of European sugar. We look forward to providing more detail on these factors in our 2013 outlook in mid December.
As we work to create value, it is vital that our company’s operating model continue to adapt to current economic and marketplace conditions. To this end, we have announced a business transformation program which is designed to enable us to accomplish 3 key goals. First, to restructure our sales and marketing organization to better align central and field sales into standardized channel focus organizations across each of our territories. Second, to streamline and reduce the cost structure of our finance support functions, including the establishment of a new centralized shared services center; and third, to continue improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of certain aspects of our operations, including service activities related to our cold drink equipment.
These programs are subject to consultation with the Works Council and is expected to incur some $200 million in restructuring charges. Of these charges, approximately 10% or $20 million are expected to be non-cash. Importantly, we expect this effort to create ongoing benefits of approximately $100 million by 2015. While any prospect of reducing our workforce is difficult to contemplate, this program is a necessary step for our business that will allow us to build on our platform for growth and optimize the marketplace opportunities before us. This program will allow us to continue to provide high levels of customer service and support the priorities of our global operating framework, including being our customers most valued supplier.
It also reinforces our belief that we could continue to generate the sustained profitable growth necessary to enhance shareowner value. We remain committed to our long term growth targets and we look forward to sharing with you more details about our long term plans and specifically our 2013 outlook on our normal call in mid December.

It's fair to say that it has not materialized and we see again pretty intense competitive promotional activity in the cola segment for the moment. But as we say, our focus remains on the value creation journey and we are engaging our customer along this line. So I think for the moment we see it continuing this quarter. I’m not sure it will continue for the long term. I think at the end of the day what is essential is to have both the topline and bottom line growth."

But also the macro environment seemingly softening, market conditions in France as consumers adjust to the tax affected pricing as well as the competitive conditions in Great Britain that you just talked about.

You’re right, there are a lot of moving parts here. The 2 items that we have specifically noted that have caused us to have a revised outlook are in fact the competitive activity, promotional activity, particularly on colas and specifically in Great Britain. That’s very real and we’ve noted that. The other is the fact that we have some ongoing issues and challenges with our customers in France, largely the result of the excise tax. But again we’re managing through those challenges also because France has historically been as you know what we call the land of opportunity. We have consistently grown our business in France over the last several years. 2012 has been a challenge largely because of those 2 items I just mentioned. Those really are the 2 things that are different. The macroeconomic environment we continue to monitor it. Obviously we’d like to see some improvement, but we wouldn’t characterize it as any worse than it’s been. We managed through the downturn in 2008 just fine and frankly the macroeconomics we’re looking at today and that we’re looking at in the fourth quarter are not any worse. They’re just not any better and we’re obviously guardedly optimistic that the macroeconomics will improve over time. But again, to answer your question, there are 2 principle differences and that’s cola competitive activity in GB and the customer challenges that we’ve had to deal with in France."

Let me first qualify by saying all of these initiatives that we’re talking about are proposed initiatives which will certainly go through consultation, appropriate consultation with the Works Councils. And so it’s important for us to always remember that. We have been studying this situation for a number of months. This is not any kind of an immediate reaction. Frankly we have known that there are a number of opportunities for us as well as challenges and what has emerged here is a series of initiatives as a result of a very in depth and long term study. The first part of it was a finance transformation again which Bill can give you more details on, but which we announced earlier and then separately we have some field sales and marketing and sales organization changes that we’re making which are based in many ways off what we’ve done in Belgium and Luxembourg several years ago, very successfully by moving to instead of a geographic organization, moving to much more of a channel focus in our selling organization.
So we’ve done it successfully in Belgium and Luxembourg and now we’re doing it in our other territories. So we’ve also moved to a European-wide supply chain. Again that was a significant transformation. We did it successfully several years ago. And so in many ways what you’re seeing here that we’re doing today is based on studies, but also patterns which we established in previous moves that we made. Bill, let me ask you to comment on the numbers."

But in the tax arena we have some recently proposed amendments which would talk about an excise tax on energy drinks. We’re obviously monitoring that carefully and there have been some other discussions about increased taxes in France. So we are well aware of those and dealing we think effectively with them. In Belgium there have been some discussions of a packaging tax. There have been in the past on packaging, but we don’t think there’s anything right now that is an issue. And then in Norway, as part of their annual budget discussion there is some discussion about a tax on a variety of product categories which could impact us. So those are issues that we’re effectively dealing with and again that’s why we want to make sure we’ve got state of the art public affairs team that’s dealing with those. We and the Coca-Cola company are working hand in hand or doing that.
Are there other issues? Certainly there continues to be items from time to time like questions around aspartame, or BPA. But again we are very vigilant and remain very focused on making sure that proper science is understood and in fact it was pretty interesting to see the results yesterday of a study that was indicating that there was problem with aspartame and then this affiliate of Harvard concluded that the study was not scientifically done and in fact aspartame is not implicated by this study. I think aspartame is the most widely studied and tested ingredient honestly in history. We remain very convinced of its total safety, but we have to be very clear and communicate. So, I guess that’s a bit of a walk around the forest. It’s taxes, regulatory issues and then occasional issues around ingredients that are the focus of most of our efforts."

And this unprecedented price increase combined with adverse weather and very challenging macroeconomic environment has been as you imagine a significant challenge for our customers and this is what is driving the situation where we are discussing. So we are continuing to work with them because as John said, the potential for growth in France is huge and we need to resume our value creation model with them.
Once we have, I would say absorbed and once the tax will have been normalized in the retail selling price, which is not the case yet but should I think in the coming months evaluate in the right direction. We know that back to school period is always a very active period in terms of price activity for our retailers. We hope that in the next months it will be more normalized and then building on that we are going to resume our value creation story. But again, it has been a very tough period, it is still a very tough period for our retailers as the market is not growing in volume as you can imagine. We are getting share on the sparkling market. But again, we look forward to a more normalized pricing situation to resume the value creation story in prompt."

So, just kind of going back to the broader question about your outlook and then just kind of thinking about BTP, or the Business Transformation Program, within that context. So John, when you laid your targets when CC became purely a European company. I am sure some of the challenging conditions, whether it’s from a macro perspective or tax perspective or others, probably weren’t foreseen when you laid out the 46% revenue growth, 68% kind of operating profit growth target. So, when you kind of kind of think about sort of medium term targets for CCE. You’ve got some of these cost savings that are coming through. Are they basically viewed - should we view them as prepensely giving your cushion to get to that 6% to 8% or given some of the changes that we’ve seen from a macro perspective is it really necessary for you to kind of get to that 6% to 8%."

To achieve the results that we think are pretty attractive in what is a very challenging market place. So we remain committed to the long term financial objectives. Those don’t change at all. In terms of the near term, I think what this business transformation project will do is frankly make us first and foremost more effective. It is obviously an efficiency move also but it will make our sales and marketing teams much more effective at doing what they do and working with our customers both locally and nationally to drive value for us mutually. We will receive some savings from this project and as I said earlier, I think it does one thing, it allows us to invest in some of these initiatives that are so important to our future, importantly, digital. Does it also give us a bit of a de-risking of our program going forward? The answer is absolutely yes. And it will be up to us to figure out how to manage exactly where the money is invested."

Our current credit ratings are generally based on what we’ve been articulating consistently for the past couple of years that we intend to operate within the 2.5x to 3x net debt to EBITDA. So while we’ve been operating below that, generally the conversation with the credit rating agencies are based on the fact that over time we are going up into that range. So individually, they treat the actual versus the targets slightly differently but I think it’s safe to say that generally we envision operating in the triple B plus range. With the first part of your question, I didn’t follow it completely but again we’ve stated that our long term net debt to EBITDA range is 2.5x to 3x and we would like to get to that by the end of 2013. We would operate within that range over time if we had a meaningful M&A opportunity, could we exceed that 3x for a short period of time and then let the cash flow from the business inclusive of the acquisition bring us back down into that range? That would be the way we would envision that. We don’t see it as a hard cap but neither do we see ourselves exceeding that 3x and then just staying above it and continuing to grow for a meaningful period of time. Did that address your question?"

So it’s always around that negotiation but I think the bulk of the pricing should have been absorbed now in the next 3 to 6 months. It doesn’t mean that we will not have some discretion with the trade because again, the market has been tough so far. But it would be a bit of a combination of them having taken I hope and it’s based on the latest figures, you can see the market some more pricing but it is about to resuming. There is a joint value creation story on the market which still has a huge potential. We really think the consumers are ready to accept some higher level of pricing as long as we come with the right marketing activity which we plan to do for next year. So, yes as always the round of negotiation with the French trade will be probably a difficult moment to pass but I think we have the right plan and the right innovations to come to overcome this period."

As Thor said, I’m joined today by Bill Douglas and Hubert Patricot.
In our news release this morning, we reported comparable earnings of $0.71 per share as net sales grew 2.5% on a currency neutral basis and excluding the impact of the French excise tax. Comparable currency neutral operating income declined 1%. Our results today reflect the impact of unfavorable weather early in the quarter, gross margin favorability and higher operating expenses due to the impact of promotional timing, notably for the London Olympics. They also demonstrate our ability to manage each of the levers of our business and the strength of our balance sheet to deliver sustained earnings growth.
Despite ongoing marketplace challenges, we continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver long term growth and to increase value for our share owners. We continue to focus on our key operating strategies, outstanding execution, increasing effectiveness and cost control that have enabled us to deliver growth even in a highly challenging macroeconomic environment.
A demonstration of this focus is the business transformation program that we announced today. These initiatives are designed to maximize the effectiveness of go-to-market strategies as well as back office functions and to better align our operating structure with an evolving marketplace. This program, subject to consultation with works councils, is expected to have non-recurring charges of about $200 million through 2014 and to generate about $100 million of ongoing benefits by 2015.
This focus structure will improve our platform for long term sustainable growth as we continue to strategically invest in our business. Regrettably, the program is expected to result in a reduction of our workforce, but this necessary step will ultimately position our company to deliver long term growth.
Now let’s look at the results for the third quarter. Our volume grew 0.5% with growth in sparkling flavored beverages, energy drinks and stills. Key brand results included double digit growth for Coca Cola Zero and Monster and solid growth for Capri-Sun, reformulated Nestea with Stevia, and Schweppes Abbey Well and Chaudfontaine waters. We achieved pricing per case growth of 2.5% with the cost of sales per case increase of 2%, both excluding the impact of the French excise tax. Both of these numbers are comparable and currency neutral.
Operating expenses increased 4% in the quarter as a result of timing and planned marketplace initiatives. These include our important work in the London Olympic and Paralympics games. We established several key goals for the games, including meeting the unique operational demands and opportunities, maximizing the benefits of our presence with our customers and consumers and importantly, making this the greenest Olympics games ever. We met or exceeded each of our goals in large part due to the skill and dedication of our people. Longer term, we believe our role in the Olympics will have sustained benefits for our business, including strengthened customer relationships.
Additionally, we’ve clearly demonstrated our commitment to the environment, in the process establishing new standards and practices that will benefit our company and the communities we serve for years to come. In short, we’re proud of our work and value the opportunity to play such an important role in this once in a lifetime event.
Now looking at the full year, as you saw in our release, we now expect earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.20 to $2.24 with currency reducing comparable earnings by about 8% at recent rates. We now expect comparable and currency neutral net sales and operating income to grow in a low to mid single digit range. Bill will discuss this outlook with you in detail in a few minutes, but let me note that this modest decrease in our full year outlook is driven by a combination of factors. First, we are continuing discussions with key customers in France as we navigate through the ongoing impact of the French excise tax increase on the beverage category. Our focus remains on how to optimize the significant opportunity that our category represents over the long term in France.
Second, we’ve seen some renewed competitive pressures on category pricing in Great Britain and particularly in colas. Over the years, we have developed effective strategies to respond based on the value of our brands and our customer service and we will continue to implement and refine these strategies. Finally, as you know, overall macroeconomic conditions remain soft and we really don’t anticipate significant improvement in the short term.
Though we expect these factors to be a headwind for operating income growth for the rest of 2012, we are able to leverage our balance sheet to drive EPS growth modestly above our long term objectives on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Importantly, longer term we continue to believe we will deliver sustained earnings per share growth in line with our long term objectives and ultimately drive shareowner value.
A key factor is our commitment to returning cash to shareowners as demonstrated by dividend increases over the past two years and our commitment to share repurchase. In the fourth quarter we will complete our current share repurchase program. Combined with our prior program completed in 2011, this represents approximately $1.8 billion or 65 million shares repurchased.
As a result, by the end of the year, we will have returned approximately $2.3 billion to shareowners since 2010 through share repurchase and regular dividends. This total increases to some $5.7 billion when cash returned as a result of the transaction with the Coca Cola Company is included.
Let’s be clear that our goal continues to be increasing value for our shareowners. We remain well positioned to achieve that goal even as we face the persistent marketplace challenges created by current macroeconomic conditions. We believe that creating value requires a sharp, consistent focus throughout our organization, coupled with teamwork, individual employee skill and dedication. Importantly, our operating framework continues to provide clarity on the key elements of our business. We continue to offer to our customers a product portfolio that meets an increasing number of consumer needs and importantly, includes the world’s most beloved beverage brands.
Also we have an extremely talented and skilled group of employees each of whom is dedicated to delivering results each day. Our brands, strategies and people create a valuable combination and we look forward to the opportunities ahead.
I also want to share with you news on our commitment to our communities and to the environment. We recently completed our annual CRS in Action week, a demonstration of our commitment to sustainability at a time when our entire category and industry is under scrutiny. As we discuss with our employees, our leadership in this area is demonstrated by us recently being named the number one beverage company for environmental, social and governance performance by Goldman Sachs. We are proud of this recognition and believe there continue to be a solid business case for our CRS work.
We are investing in our business and the communities we serve with initiatives such as our French and Great Britain recycling joint ventures. Importantly, we’re seeing benefits in several areas, including efficiency and innovation, employee engagement and advocacy, customer service and bolstering our place in the community.
Now let me share a few final thoughts. Despite persistent difficult operating conditions, it’s important to note that we remain confident about our ability to drive long term value for our shareowners. We can and will continue to position our company for growth. We have a solid, flexible balance sheet and as you can see from today’s business transformation program announcement, we have the ability to evolve our operations to align with a dynamic marketplace. Putting it simply, we will not stand still, especially in difficult times. We remain confident in the ability of our team to manage through these challenges. We will build on our history of solid and balanced growth by managing each element of our business and executing against our strategic priorities. This will deliver growth in line with our long term objectives in creating increasing value for our shareowners.
Thank you for your time and interest and now I’ll turn it over to Bill for more detail on our financial results and our outlook."
109130811,222592808,372378,"Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC","Executives","Thanks, John, and thanks to each of you for taking the time to be with us this morning on what I’m sure is a busy day for a lot of you and we’re happy to talk about our third quarter results as well as other developments in our business.Looking at o",1066,"Thanks, John, and thanks to each of you for taking the time to be with us this morning on what I’m sure is a busy day for a lot of you and we’re happy to talk about our third quarter results as well as other developments in our business.
Looking at our news release this morning, our results per volume, net sales and operating income growth continued to reflect the challenges of unfavorable weather early in the third quarter, sustained macroeconomic weakness and other marketplace issues that John just discussed. Third quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.89 or $0.71 on a comparable basis. For the quarter, net sales totaled $2.1 billion, up 2.5% over prior year on a currency neutral basis and excluding the impact of the French excise tax increase.
Comparable operating income was $306 million, down 8.5% on a comparable basis and down 1% on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Excluding the impact of the French excise tax, net pricing per case increased 2.5% while cost of sales per case increased 2%.
Operating expenses increased 4% and reflect the impact of promotional timing, including the London Olympics and other planned marketplace initiatives. Each of the above numbers is comparable and currency neutral.
As noted in our release, having repurchased a cumulative total of 59 million shares through the third quarter, we now expect to reach the board authorized cumulative cap for our current and previous share repurchase programs of 65 million shares by the end of this year.
Now, let’s look at our outlook. In the fourth quarter, we continue to expect year-over-year operating income growth with modest improvement in our outlook for cost of goods sold. For the full year, we now expect cost of goods sold per case to increase in a range of 2.5% to 3%. Additionally, while our business modestly improved during the latter part of the third quarter as a result of planned promotions and more normal weather patterns, our outlook reflects marketplace challenges, including ongoing customer discussions in France, the competitive environment in Great Britain and overall macroeconomic softness. Based on these factors, we now expect both net sales and operating income to grow in a low to mid single digit range on a comparable and currency neutral basis for the full year 2012.
These factors, combined with our ability to leverage the strength of our balance sheet, the expected operating income growth in the fourth quarter and our revised currency translation expectations are all reflected in our updated full year EPS guidance. We now expect our EPS outlook for the year to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.24, including a negative currency impact of approximately 8% based on recent rates.
We continue to expect 2012 free cash flow in a range of $475 million to $500 million with capital expenditures in a range of $375 million to $400 million. Again both of these are on recent currency rates.
For the full year, weighted average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3% and our effective tax rate continues to be expected in a range of 26% to 28% for the full year.
Looking ahead, I would like to provide some comments on a couple of key topics. First, while our primary focus is investing in our core business to ensure we’re optimally equipped for growth, we continue to carefully evaluate our capital structure. We remain fully committed to driving shareowner value through a combination of business growth, dividends and share repurchases. Our business continues to generate significant free cash flow that is essential to returning cash to shareowners and we will continue to evaluate the best method for accomplishing this goal.
Whether we ultimately invest in value creating M&A, return cash to shareowners or a combination of the two, the route we choose will be focused on driving maximum value for our shareowners.
Next, given the current marketplace conditions already highlighted, we are working closely with our customers and are focused on long-term category growth. Though we see some of these factors as a headwind, we continue to leverage our balance sheet to drive EPS growth in line with or modestly above our long term objectives.
Finally, we expect to continue to face a tough commodities environment and expect a rate of commodity or cogs inflation in 2013 to be above that in recent years, driven principally by the cost of European sugar. We look forward to providing more detail on these factors in our 2013 outlook in mid December.
As we work to create value, it is vital that our company’s operating model continue to adapt to current economic and marketplace conditions. To this end, we have announced a business transformation program which is designed to enable us to accomplish 3 key goals. First, to restructure our sales and marketing organization to better align central and field sales into standardized channel focus organizations across each of our territories. Second, to streamline and reduce the cost structure of our finance support functions, including the establishment of a new centralized shared services center; and third, to continue improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of certain aspects of our operations, including service activities related to our cold drink equipment.
These programs are subject to consultation with the Works Council and is expected to incur some $200 million in restructuring charges. Of these charges, approximately 10% or $20 million are expected to be non-cash. Importantly, we expect this effort to create ongoing benefits of approximately $100 million by 2015. While any prospect of reducing our workforce is difficult to contemplate, this program is a necessary step for our business that will allow us to build on our platform for growth and optimize the marketplace opportunities before us. This program will allow us to continue to provide high levels of customer service and support the priorities of our global operating framework, including being our customers most valued supplier.
It also reinforces our belief that we could continue to generate the sustained profitable growth necessary to enhance shareowner value. We remain committed to our long term growth targets and we look forward to sharing with you more details about our long term plans and specifically our 2013 outlook on our normal call in mid December.

You’re right, there are a lot of moving parts here. The 2 items that we have specifically noted that have caused us to have a revised outlook are in fact the competitive activity, promotional activity, particularly on colas and specifically in Great Britain. That’s very real and we’ve noted that. The other is the fact that we have some ongoing issues and challenges with our customers in France, largely the result of the excise tax. But again we’re managing through those challenges also because France has historically been as you know what we call the land of opportunity. We have consistently grown our business in France over the last several years. 2012 has been a challenge largely because of those 2 items I just mentioned. Those really are the 2 things that are different. The macroeconomic environment we continue to monitor it. Obviously we’d like to see some improvement, but we wouldn’t characterize it as any worse than it’s been. We managed through the downturn in 2008 just fine and frankly the macroeconomics we’re looking at today and that we’re looking at in the fourth quarter are not any worse. They’re just not any better and we’re obviously guardedly optimistic that the macroeconomics will improve over time. But again, to answer your question, there are 2 principle differences and that’s cola competitive activity in GB and the customer challenges that we’ve had to deal with in France."

Let me first qualify by saying all of these initiatives that we’re talking about are proposed initiatives which will certainly go through consultation, appropriate consultation with the Works Councils. And so it’s important for us to always remember that. We have been studying this situation for a number of months. This is not any kind of an immediate reaction. Frankly we have known that there are a number of opportunities for us as well as challenges and what has emerged here is a series of initiatives as a result of a very in depth and long term study. The first part of it was a finance transformation again which Bill can give you more details on, but which we announced earlier and then separately we have some field sales and marketing and sales organization changes that we’re making which are based in many ways off what we’ve done in Belgium and Luxembourg several years ago, very successfully by moving to instead of a geographic organization, moving to much more of a channel focus in our selling organization. So we’ve done it successfully in Belgium and Luxembourg and now we’re doing it in our other territories. So we’ve also moved to a European-wide supply chain. Again that was a significant transformation. We did it successfully several years ago. And so in many ways what you’re seeing here that we’re doing today is based on studies, but also patterns which we established in previous moves that we made. Bill, let me ask you to comment on the numbers."

But in the tax arena we have some recently proposed amendments which would talk about an excise tax on energy drinks. We’re obviously monitoring that carefully and there have been some other discussions about increased taxes in France. So we are well aware of those and dealing we think effectively with them. In Belgium there have been some discussions of a packaging tax. There have been in the past on packaging, but we don’t think there’s anything right now that is an issue. And then in Norway, as part of their annual budget discussion there is some discussion about a tax on a variety of product categories which could impact us. So those are issues that we’re effectively dealing with and again that’s why we want to make sure we’ve got state of the art public affairs team that’s dealing with those. We and the Coca-Cola company are working hand in hand or doing that. Are there other issues? Certainly there continues to be items from time to time like questions around aspartame, or BPA. But again we are very vigilant and remain very focused on making sure that proper science is understood and in fact it was pretty interesting to see the results yesterday of a study that was indicating that there was problem with aspartame and then this affiliate of Harvard concluded that the study was not scientifically done and in fact aspartame is not implicated by this study. I think aspartame is the most widely studied and tested ingredient honestly in history. We remain very convinced of its total safety, but we have to be very clear and communicate. So, I guess that’s a bit of a walk around the forest. It’s taxes, regulatory issues and then occasional issues around ingredients that are the focus of most of our efforts."

As you remember very well we took a price increase on January 1 to cover the excise tax in addition to our new all price increase in 1Q. Regarding the impact on share price, as you know the resell price is fixed by our retailer but we can note that year to date, at the end of September, the pricing per liter for the category was up almost 9%. And this unprecedented price increase and this is really from the category, our price was more in the 5% to 6%. And this unprecedented price increase combined with adverse weather and very challenging macroeconomic environment has been as you imagine a significant challenge for our customers and this is what is driving the situation where we are discussing. So we are continuing to work with them because as John said, the potential for growth in France is huge and we need to resume our value creation model with them. Once we have, I would say absorbed and once the tax will have been normalized in the retail selling price, which is not the case yet but should I think in the coming months evaluate in the right direction. We know that back to school period is always a very active period in terms of price activity for our retailers. We hope that in the next months it will be more normalized and then building on that we are going to resume our value creation story. But again, it has been a very tough period, it is still a very tough period for our retailers as the market is not growing in volume as you can imagine. We are getting share on the sparkling market. But again, we look forward to a more normalized pricing situation to resume the value creation story in prompt."

I am sure some of the challenging conditions, whether it’s from a macro perspective or tax perspective or others, probably weren’t foreseen when you laid out the 46% revenue growth, 68% kind of operating profit growth target. So, when you kind of kind of think about sort of medium term targets for CCE. You’ve got some of these cost savings that are coming through.

It is obviously an efficiency move also but it will make our sales and marketing teams much more effective at doing what they do and working with our customers both locally and nationally to drive value for us mutually. We will receive some savings from this project and as I said earlier, I think it does one thing, it allows us to invest in some of these initiatives that are so important to our future, importantly, digital.

So it’s a case for investment but it’s also about working with them better. At the same time, we are functionalizing the same way we did supply chain. We are functionalizing our cooler services department.

Our current credit ratings are generally based on what we’ve been articulating consistently for the past couple of years that we intend to operate within the 2.5x to 3x net debt to EBITDA. So while we’ve been operating below that, generally the conversation with the credit rating agencies are based on the fact that over time we are going up into that range. So individually, they treat the actual versus the targets slightly differently but I think it’s safe to say that generally we envision operating in the triple B plus range. With the first part of your question, I didn’t follow it completely but again we’ve stated that our long term net debt to EBITDA range is 2.5x to 3x and we would like to get to that by the end of 2013. We would operate within that range over time if we had a meaningful M&A opportunity, could we exceed that 3x for a short period of time and then let the cash flow from the business inclusive of the acquisition bring us back down into that range? That would be the way we would envision that. We don’t see it as a hard cap but neither do we see ourselves exceeding that 3x and then just staying above it and continuing to grow for a meaningful period of time. Did that address your question?"

So it’s always around that negotiation but I think the bulk of the pricing should have been absorbed now in the next 3 to 6 months. It doesn’t mean that we will not have some discretion with the trade because again, the market has been tough so far. But it would be a bit of a combination of them having taken I hope and it’s based on the latest figures, you can see the market some more pricing but it is about to resuming. There is a joint value creation story on the market which still has a huge potential. We really think the consumers are ready to accept some higher level of pricing as long as we come with the right marketing activity which we plan to do for next year. So, yes as always the round of negotiation with the French trade will be probably a difficult moment to pass but I think we have the right plan and the right innovations to come to overcome this period."
