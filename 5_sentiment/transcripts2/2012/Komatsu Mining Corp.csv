Thank you for participating in today's conference call and for your continued interest in our company. Joining me on the call this morning is Mike Sutherlin, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Major, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary.
This morning, I will begin with some brief comments which expand upon our press release and which provide some additional background on the results for our first quarter of our 2012 fiscal year. Mike Sutherlin will then provide an overview of our operations and our market outlook. After Mike's comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] 
During the call today, we'll be making forward-looking statements. These statements should be considered along with the various risk factors detailed on our press release and other SEC filings. We encourage you to read and become familiar with these risk factors.
We may also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures, which we believe are important to understanding our business. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP metrics to GAAP, as well as for other investor information, we refer you to our website at www.joyglobal.com.
Now let's spend a few moments reviewing the first quarter results. As was the case in our fourth quarter, the first quarter operating results includes the performance of our legacy surface and underground mining equipment businesses, along with the impact of the LeTourneau and IMM acquisition. The LeTourneau results are fairly straightforward while the IMM impact on the first quarter is far more complicated.
In connection with the IMM, the first quarter started off with Joy Global owning approximately 29% of the IMM outstanding shares which we acquired in open market transaction in 2011 at HKD $8 per share. At the end of December, we received approval of the IMM acquisition from the Hong Kong regulatory authorities and we completed the previously announced acquisition of the 41% of the IMM shares owned by the Jordan Group for HKD $8.50 per share. This transaction triggered 2 things: first, a shift to consolidating the IMM results for the month of January, offset by the minority interest in the IMM January net income associated with the 30% of the share which Joy Global did not own; and second, the recording of a $19.4 million gain associated with the difference between the HKD $8 per share we paid for the shares Joy Global acquired in 2011, and the approximate market value of HKD $8.50 per share at the end of the first quarter for the shares that were acquired in 2011.
To summarize, the first quarter, in connection with IMM, included 2 months of equity income, 1 month of consolidating the IMM result offset by minority interest and $19.4 million gain associated with the shared purchase in 2011 and additional interest expense associated with the IMM acquisition. If these items did not add sufficient confusion to the first quarter results, the Chinese New Year came in January this year compared to February last year, and 1 one month that the IMM results were consolidated with Joy Global was significantly impacted by the Chinese New Year holiday.
Finally, on February 10, we successfully concluded our tender offer for the IMM shares that we did not already own by receiving an approximately 29% of the 30% that we did not own. This success will allow us to delist IMM from the Hong Kong Exchange sometime in our third quarter.
Turning to LeTourneau, the first quarter was the second full quarter of including LeTourneau results with Joy Global. In the current quarter, bookings, net sales and operating income were all below our expectations. A quality issue identifying -- identified during 2011 proved more difficult to resolve than originally expected, and the distractions at the production floor as the LeTourneau long-haul Longview facility as a result of the drilling equipment business also had an unfavorable impact on OE shipments.
The product's quality issue affected bookings, shipments and operating process. The good news is that both issues have been addressed and we expect the LeTourneau results will be back on track beginning in the second quarter.
Returning to the legacy surface and underground mining equipment businesses, the financial results were very favorable. Bookings in the current quarter were up 9% from a year ago and equal $1.3 billion bookings recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in new order bookings was led by a 40% increase for surface mining equipment with flat bookings for underground mining equipment. The underground equipment bookings were the second highest first quarter bookings on record. However, the highest first quarter booking on record was in the first quarter last year, when orders were received for long-haul systems in Australia.
The 40% increase in surface equipment bookings in the current quarter was made up of an 81% increase in original equipment orders and a 20% increase in aftermarket bookings. The original equipment increase was led by strong performance in the South African and South American markets.
The aftermarket favorable booking trend, which we have seen recently, continued in the current market, with the underground and surface mining equipment businesses reporting 26% and 20% bookings increases, respectively. Both business units had book-to-book -- book-to-bill ratio was in excess of 1.0, and backlog increased from $3.3 billion at the beginning of the quarter to $3.6 billion at the end of the quarter.
Net sales for the legacy businesses increased by 21% in the first quarter with OE shipments up 37% while aftermarket revenue increased 10%. OE shipments for both businesses benefited from the strong OE bookings received in 2011, while the underground equipment segment had a 17% increase in aftermarket net sales, while the surface equipment business had an increase in aftermarket revenue of 4%.
Operating profit of $204 million in the current quarter exceeded last year by $50 million with both the surface and underground mining equipment units having return on sales percentages in excess of 20% and an overall incremental profitability percentage of 28%. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to the increase in net sales and favorable manufacturing overhead absorption.
Net income in the current quarter was $1.33 per fully diluted share compared to $0.96 per share last year. The table included in the press release and on our website provide a summary of the various items which impacted the current quarter. The effective tax rate was 27.9% in the current quarter compared to 31.6% last year. Excluding favorable discrete tax items and a tax treatment for acquisition cost and the IMM stocking, the tax rate would've been approximately 31% in the current quarter. For the full year, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 29.5% and 31.5%.
On a final note, the revised guidance included in the press release does include all of the actual results reported through the first quarter and assumed full-year, fully diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 108 million.
Let me stop now and turn the discussion over to Mike Sutherlin."

I was really pleased with our first quarter because we continued to deliver strong results from our core legacy businesses that are our foundation and we made good progress on the investments in our future. That balance performance will allow us to navigate through the volatility that has become almost normal for our industry, and this balance is also the basis for long term, sustainable performance.
Our legacy businesses delivered 28% operating leverage on 20% revenue growth. I'll take that any time. We have several items related to M&A activities that were outside of our guidance but these were neutral in operating profit and a slight drag on EPS. The EPS drag was from the interest on the bonds that we placed early to ensure that we had funding in place the IMM tender.
The order bookings for our legacy businesses displayed a typical lumpy nature this quarter. Orders for underground original equipment were down but this is somewhat influenced by last year's record first quarter. In fact, if it was not for last year, this will be our best first quarter for underground original equipment. More importantly, we had very strong order growth for surface equipment and for aftermarket parts and services for both surface and underground. I believe that those orders and financial results for the first quarter position us well to deliver on expectations for the remainder of 2012.
This quarter, we had to work through the legacy work issue on the  large wheel loaders. Effective the articulation there used to connect the 2 body halves of the machine and are used in the lifting arms. We have identified the root cause this problem and have a retrofit program underway. Although customer concerns rightfully slowed both orders and deliveries this quarter, we expect both to catch up as machines in the field go back to work.
Our customers still see the LeTourneau loader to be far superior to  loaders and as an alternative to hydraulic excavators and some service volume applications. So we continue to be very, very positive by the LeTourneau acquisition.
This quarter, we were successful in reaching ownership level in IMM that enables us to get a compulsory tender for the remaining shares. As a result, we expect IMM to be delisted the early June.
Starting in January, IMM is reported into our Joy underground business. Although it will remain a separate business unit to better serve the midtier mines and use these domestic Chinese equipment, we are planning to upgrade IMM through technology transfers and Operational Excellence programs. The objective is to make IMM the technology leader while keeping the price and performance differential to our comparable Joy-branded products and to bring IMM factories up to the Joy Global operational standards. We believe both will bring significant incremental value to IMM.
by markets We're overall positive on our markets but that is a mixture of strong sentiment for the international markets, offset by expectation of weakening in the U.S. coal market. So let's get to the heart of the matter and deal with U.S. coal market first.
Although there are longer-term regulatory headwinds, turning point U.S. coal demand came from a window that didn't arrived. An unusually warm winter has significantly reduced the demand for electricity and coupled with excess supply, natural gas prices have dropped to sub-$3 during the winter heating season for the first time this century. Both factors are reducing the demand for thermal coal in the U.S. federal customers are reducing production and announcing mine closures. At the same time, we know that the weather will change and our customers are making investments, investments to lower the fleet average cost from their mines and to expand export capacity.
In fact, they're investing in expanding production from their bigger, lower cost mines as they reduce production more close, smaller, higher cost mines. And their expansion to the export facilities is based on their view that seaborne markets will be increasingly undersupplied in the years ahead.
So our view of the U.S. coal market weakness is a near-term issue. We have repeatedly said that we do not expect the U.S. coal market to be high growth but we do expect it to be as a stable base from which to grow our international businesses. This is not the first time we have gone through mild weather conditions in the U.S. and based on past experience we can see declines in demand from the U.S. impact our total revenues by as much as 4% to 6%.
However, we believe there is enough upside in the international markets to more than offset this. In addition, some of the declines been factored in to our guidance for 2012 and some of it was in our first quarter results.
We are already adjusting our cost by using U.S. resources to assist in international projects. And as a result, we don't expect the U.S. coal market to undermine our guidance for 2012. Conversely, we are very positive about the international markets. These markets largely depend on demand from the emerging markets and especially China and India. China weakened into the final months of 2011 and has been quiet so far this year due to an early Chinese New Year. However, there are positive signs. Inflation peaked in Beijing has already taken the first trip to reduce the real rate of return which should ease lending requirements. China's export markets, including the U.S. and Japan should be stronger in 2012. And most importantly, Beijing will do what it takes to deliver the GDP growth rate that it forecasted.
Electricity demand in China increased by 14% last year and domestic coal production did not keep pace and imports reached record levels. Thermal coal imports into China or structural because Australia-landed prices are competitive with coal from Inner Mongolia because of the long train runs that had a high transportation to the domestic cost. The Newco base it and driven for the rest, which will increase the competitiveness of Australian coal and the buildout of electricity grid in  province should keep industry demand growth and import into China high. Steel is an important part of China's GDP and Chinese steel makers have continued to stock imported iron ore in anticipation of production returns. They're doing this because iron ore market is highly concentrated and increased demand that brings high-cost Chinese iron ore back into production raises the price point. Because met coal has a more diversified supplier base, its stock levels have declined and restocking will add to metallurgical coal demand in 2012.
China is also short of supply for copper and this should lead to restocking in 2012. But even the demand for copper is slow, the market will continue to be short of supply. This is due to declining ore grades and disruptions that have reduced output by a consistent 5% to 6% each year for over the past 5 years.
In fact, copper production was forecast increased by 1 million tonnes at the beginning of 2011, but actually increase was only 1/10 of that. Supply shortages in demand upside are already being reflected in copper price, which has moved up over 12% from the first year. India has become a major importer of thermal coal as electricity demand grew by 9% in 2011 but domestic coal production was flat. As a result, imports grew faster than India than in China and we expect that to continue.
Our customers condensed in the upset from international markets, and this is reflected in the cap expenditure plans for 2012. Not only is demand expected to improve, but global mining is already near full capacity. In addition, international commodity prices remain at incentive levels but more upside than down. As a result, our customers have capital budgets by over 15% for 2012 and this includes a drag from U.S. coal producers. For example, the major diversified mining houses have raised their capital budgets by over 20%. I believe this is real because the customers are getting board approvals to proceed and we are seeing them begin to apply resources to these projects. As a result of these overall factors, we are comfortable with our basic guidance for 2012. We also expect 2012 to be a year in which we build backlogs in both our surface and underground businesses, excluding the addition of course.
We are upgrading our guidance for both IMM and for the items that were not covered in our prior guidance. We expect IMM to add $300 million to revenues on the remaining 3 quarters of our fiscal 2012. This will add $0.50 to earnings per share over the same period, excluding excess purchase accounting charges related to the first year. This will be offset by $0.16 of interest expense, of which $0.04 was incurred in the first quarter.
In our first quarter, we also had $0.12 of acquisition cost and $0.19 gain on the IMM share that we prior to the tender. And these items was in our prior guidance. But that's all rolled in, we are moving our guidance for 2012 earnings per fully diluted share of $7.40 to $7.80 on revenues of $5.6 million to $5.8 billion. Again, this does not include the excess first year purchase accounting charges for either IMM or LeTourneau. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Roxanne for questions."

Some of this is, I think, is catch-up from the projects that were started in 2008 put on hold in 2009 and the customers are have been pushing hard to get those projects back on schedule. So 2011 strong bookings rate was partially due to a catch-up  and the reason we've indicated we expect the order growth to moderate in 2012. As that catch-up works through the system, we'll go back to a normal 15% to 20% a year order rate growth. So we don't see -- the distribution is pretty broad distribution. It's stock really tied to a single project and it's across several product lines. So there's nothing really unusual with about the surface equipment for the bookings."

But certainly, we run a business that has -- we have a strong belief that we can continue to deliver incremental margins of 25%. The businesses that we purchased at LeTourneau and IMM have the same characteristics as our legacy business. And so we would expect them to be the same thing. The introduction of Operational Excellence, if I go back to the start of Operational Excellence in Joy Global, we started that program when we were at about 1 year of start-up costs associated with them. We actually had some cost headwinds in the early days since we started up those programs. And eventually got the gains we're getting or paying for the next couple of program to become self funding. And that eventually in turn to net additions. Over about a 3 to 4 year period, we went from a net drag on expenses to net mutual to net positive. It expect those both LeTourneau and IMM to do the same thing. So we don't see it to reduce our -- the results neutral in the early years but probably the first year, we wouldn't see a lot of incremental additions to our earnings performance, but we expect to starting the year to see some improvement in that really sort of pick up steam from here in the second year. But Mike's been a bit close to those -- Michael's bit close to those programs. So Mike, you can add about a bit more granularity."

And we would expect that the LeTourneau results would drive, become very, very similar to the results that we see for our surface mining equipment business. As you look at the IMM results, if you've been tracking their public results during the 2011 year, what you would've seen is that they began to incur some purchase accounting charges that were associated with the IPO that they did at the beginning of 2011. We'll have some purchase accounting charges as we go through our valuation of IMM. And then the other thing, I believe, that we'll see with the IMM business is some investment in improving the technology associated with their product. We intend to make them the leading China equipment manufacturer in that marketplace and that will in fact require some investments. But in connection with IMM, we would expect them to also have operating results at least equal to the results that we see for our underground equipment business going forward. And then also with IMM, we also have the opportunity to increase their service aftermarket businesses as well as part of the longer-term strategy."

When we had an earnings call in December for our fourth quarter, we were more cautious about the market outlook. At that time, our customers were telling us that they were proceeding with their capital expansion projects. They had a priority to -- for organic growth, we saw that as the highest return on their investments. And they didn't plan M&A activities, they didn't plan dividends and other capital returns, organic growth first. Having said that, we also know that our customers will act quickly to keep supply and demand in balance. They did that at the end of 2008 and it was remarkable how quickly they adjusted their production to meet the client demand over a period of time. So I was a little bit skeptical about their intent versus what their actions would be if the economy kept struggling long and showing no signs of improvement. We've been in the latter part of 2011. There still was a lot of certainly, a lot of headwind that was driven by the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, for example. It's still unclear what that outcome is going to be. So I was much more cautious at that point since it  for the first year, we saw the capital budgets gets set and approved by the board in late December so we know what those numbers are now. But more importantly, we see them going through their boards with projects -- their boards approving, so this not just the project to be approved leader but the board is -- their boards are on online with them to invest now for the longer-term future the demand they in the commodity market. Everybody believes that the amended commodity markets is to be stronger in 3 or 4 years and we are supply-constrained today and we need more capacity. So the difference is the budgets were set. The difference is the boards were continuing to approve those projects for our customers and the difference is that the outlook is starting to reindicate that we may be reaching the end the of a bumpy road of phase and start to see a slow climb out in the global economy. Certainly the U.S. is showing signs -- starting to slowly get better, Japan should be out there with just because of getting past the tsunami effect. And Europe is neutral. We still, I think, are good overall."

A shift in Queensland, the in Queensland, where surface mines are starting to go underground and we're seeing that activity increase in others. So as our surface mines reach -- actually stripping ratios, they began to -- on the grant. Certainly, there are number of things that I think are the upside to underground. It's because weak as the U.S. is, it's really extraordinary how many projects are underway. In Australia, for example. Australia is a number of projects, some of those are but by the majors, some of those are by the junior mining companies. But there's a massive number of projects in the pipeline. Not all those are the now, although we did equipment selection in the near term. But yes, there's quite a bit of activity. And a lot of that is underground. As we look at our outlook for surface equipment, the surface equipment is going to be continue to be strong as well. So we actually see over the next 3 or 4 years. We don't see a change shifting from one to the other. We think the ratio is going to be fairly similar. We do see our surface equipment within to see a little bit later cycle than our underground equipment. So we saw strength in the underground and then it began to level off here over the last couple of quarters, start taking through there then we see some positives going forward. The surface equipment has continued to be strong but we expect the growth rate in orders for surface equipment to taper, sort of tap the wheel back  just as you get deeper into the cycle, you can't maintain those same year-over-year growth rates. So we'll see what the underground equipment is a little bit more of a catch-up later in 2012 and we'll see the service will begin to moderate a little bit. So those 2 will come back in the normal ratios."

It's just been when we renew that, that was a problem a problem but was much smaller at the time of the acquisition and it has grown and as we've done research, we've gone back far enough now that we probably over -- that were actually affected. So we feel pretty good that we've got this captured. I think that the supply chain issues we don't have other major hiccups in supply chain. Probably our#1 issue that we deal with as we have a transition manufacturing agreement with Cameron and their market is increasing as well.

We also -- in those Life Cycle Management programs, we increased the services that we do and we expand right now in our business, we're adding a lot of consumables to those Life Cycle Management contracts things like filters and fluids. We've got some fluids now that our Joy-branded fluids that they'll have monitoring. And we keep expanding what goes into those contracts. But the capture rates the Life Cycle Management capture rates are both 100% we get everything that goes almost machined. They give you sort of a dimension in what the improvement is. Right now in terms of Life Cycle Management,we're  -- as a percentage of our aftermarket, we're in the 30%, a little bit more 30%, 33% something like that of revenue along those lines Life Cycle Management contracts. So we do have some contract that are long-term part supply contracts where we agreed to provide parts for contracted price for -- and I'm not including those -- including things that have parts and labor associated with the Life Cycle Management. That could be full maintenance of machines including rebuilds and repairs -- it could be a machine exchange programs where we've build machines after every panel and we'll take those machines back to the customers' fleet. So those programs will add up to about 1/3 of our aftermarket revenues. So we do have quite a real upside and we think as far as parts services will be seen a strong response our customers as far as services. The South Africa deliver real results and we're seeing improvement in production rates. We're seeing improvements in availability, increases in lead time between repairs and we're getting this information for our customers. So they're  as well.

There generally is an adjustment for salaries that take place for the business in January. So there would be some of that. That would increase in the remaining 3 quarters. And then the other issue is a fairly significant portion of the compensation for the employees of the company, ranging all the way from senior management all the way down to the workers on the shop floor is variable compensation that's tied to performance. And because our business is so seasonal, the percent of that variable bonus-related compensation will tend to be higher in the second, third, fourth quarters than they were in the first quarter. So relative to corporate expense, I would expect that number to be up slightly from the number that we received, we achieved in the first quarter."

Mike Sutherlin will then provide an overview of our operations and our market outlook. After Mike's comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] 
During the call today, we'll be making forward-looking statements. These statements should be considered along with the various risk factors detailed on our press release and other SEC filings. We encourage you to read and become familiar with these risk factors.
We may also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures, which we believe are important to understanding our business. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP metrics to GAAP, as well as for other investor information, we refer you to our website at www.joyglobal.com.
Now let's spend a few moments reviewing the first quarter results. As was the case in our fourth quarter, the first quarter operating results includes the performance of our legacy surface and underground mining equipment businesses, along with the impact of the LeTourneau and IMM acquisitions. The LeTourneau results are fairly straightforward, while the IMM impact on the first quarter is far more complicated.
In connection with IMM, the first quarter started off with Joy Global owning approximately 29% of the IMM outstanding shares, which we acquired in open market transaction in 2011 at HKD $8 per share. At the end of December, we received approval of the IMM acquisition from the Hong Kong regulatory authorities and we completed the previously announced acquisition of the 41% of the IMM shares owned by the Jordan Group for HKD $8.50 per share. 
This transaction triggered 2 things: first, a shift to consolidating the IMM results for the month of January, offset by the minority interest and the IMM January net income associated with the 30% of the share which Joy Global did not own; and second, the recording of a $19.4 million gain associated with the difference between the HKD $8 per share we paid for the shares Joy Global acquired in 2011 and the approximate market value of HKD $8.50 per share at the end of the first quarter for the shares that were acquired in 2011.
To summarize, the first quarter, in connection with IMM, included 2 months of equity income, 1 month of consolidating the IMM results offset by minority interest, a $19.4 million gain associated with the shared purchase in 2011 and additional interest expense associated with the IMM acquisition. If these items did not add sufficient confusion to the first quarter results, the Chinese New Year came in January this year compared to February last year and 1 one month that the IMM results were consolidated with Joy Global was significantly impacted by the Chinese New Year holiday.
Finally, on February 10, we successfully concluded our tender offer for the IMM shares that we did not already own by receiving approximately 29% of the 30% that we did not own. This success will allow us to delist IMM from the Hong Kong Exchange sometime in our third quarter.
Turning to LeTourneau. The first quarter was the second full quarter of including LeTourneau results with Joy Global. In the current quarter, bookings, net sales and operating income were all below our expectations. A product quality issue identifying during -- identified during 2011 proved more difficult to resolve than originally expected, and the distractions on the production floor at the LeTourneau long-haul Longview facility as a result of the drilling equipment business also had an unfavorable impact on OE shipments.
The product's quality issue affected bookings, shipments and operating process. The good news is that both issues have been addressed, and we expect the LeTourneau results will be back on track beginning in the second quarter.
Returning to the legacy surface and underground mining equipment businesses, the financial results were very favorable. Bookings in the current quarter were up 9% from a year ago and equaled $1.3 billion bookings recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in new order bookings was led by a 40% increase for surface mining equipment, with flat bookings for underground mining equipment. 
The underground equipment bookings were the second highest first quarter bookings on record. However, the highest first quarter booking on record was in the first quarter last year, when orders were received for long-haul systems in Australia. The 40% increase in surface equipment bookings in the current quarter was made up of an 81% increase in original equipment orders and a 20% increase in aftermarket bookings. The original equipment increase was led by strong performance in the South African and South American markets.
The aftermarket favorable booking trend, which we have seen recently, continued in the current quarter, with the underground and surface mining equipment businesses reporting 26% and 20% bookings increases, respectively. Both business units had book-to-book -- book-to-bill ratios in excess of 1.0, and backlog increased from $3.3 billion at the beginning of the quarter to $3.6 billion at the end of the quarter.
Net sales for the legacy businesses increased by 21% in the first quarter with OE shipments up 37%, while aftermarket revenue increased 10%. OE shipments for both businesses benefited from the strong OE bookings received in 2011, while the underground equipment segment had a 17% increase in aftermarket net sales, while the surface equipment business had an increase in aftermarket revenue of 4%.
Operating profit of $204 million in the current quarter exceeded last year by $50 million with both the surface and underground mining equipment units having return on sales percentages in excess of 20% and an overall incremental profitability percentage of 28%. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to the increase in net sales and favorable manufacturing overhead absorption.
Net income in the current quarter was $1.33 per fully diluted share compared to $0.96 per share last year. The table included in the press release and on our website provides a summary of the various items which impacted the current quarter. The effective tax rate was 27.9% in the current quarter compared to 31.6% last year. Excluding favorable discrete tax items and a tax treatment for acquisition cost and the IMM stocking, the tax rate would have been approximately 31% in the current quarter. For the full year, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 29.5% and 31.5%.
On a final note, the revised guidance included in the press release does include all of the actual results reported for the first quarter and assumed full year fully diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 108 million.
Let me stop now and turn the discussion over to Mike Sutherlin."
277517,170237424,267054,"Joy Global, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 29, 2012",2012-02-29,"Earnings Calls","Komatsu Mining Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and I'd like to add my welcome to those on this call. I was really pleased with our first quarter because we continued to deliver strong results from our core legacy businesses that are our foundation and we made good progress on the investm",1609,"Thanks, Mike, and I'd like to add my welcome to those on this call. I was really pleased with our first quarter because we continued to deliver strong results from our core legacy businesses that are our foundation and we made good progress on the investments in our future. That balanced performance will allow us to navigate through the volatility that has become almost normal for our industry, and this balance is also the basis for long-term sustainable performance.
Our legacy businesses delivered 28% operating leverage on 20% revenue growth, and I'll take that any time. We had several items related to M&A activities that were outside of our guidance, but these were neutral in operating profit and a slight drag on EPS. The EPS drag was from the interest on the bonds that we've placed early to ensure that we had funding in place for the IMM tender.
The order bookings for our legacy businesses displayed a typical lumpy nature this quarter. Orders for underground original equipment were down, but this is somewhat influenced by last year's record first quarter. In fact, if it was not for last year, this would be our best first quarter for underground original equipment. More importantly, we had very strong order growth for surface original equipment and for aftermarket parts and services for both surface and underground. I believe that those orders and financial results for the first quarter position us well to deliver on expectations for the remainder of 2012.
This quarter, we had to work through the legacy warranty issue on LeTourneau's large wheel loaders. Core heat affected the articulation balls there used to connect the 2 body halves of the machine and are used in the lifting arms. We have identified the root cause this problem and have a retrofit program underway. Although customer concerns rightfully slowed both orders and deliveries this quarter, we expect both to catch up as machines in the field go back to work. Our customers still see the LeTourneau loader to be far superior to competitive loaders and as an alternative to hydraulic excavators and some service volume applications, so we continue to be very, very positive on the LeTourneau acquisition.
This quarter, we were successful in reaching ownership level in IMM that enables us to get a compulsory tender for the remaining shares. As a result, we expect IMM to be delisted by early June.
Starting in January, IMM is reported into our Joy underground business. Although it will remain a separate business unit to better serve the mid-tier mines that use these domestic Chinese equipment, we are planning to upgrade IMM through technology transfers and Operational Excellence programs.
The objective is to make IMM the technology leader while keeping the price and performance differential to our comparable Joy-branded products and to bring IMM factories up to the Joy Global operational standards. We believe both will bring significant incremental value to IMM.
Now let's shift to our markets. We are overall positive on our markets, but that is a mixture of strong sentiment for the international markets, offset by expectation of weakening in the U.S. coal market. So let's get to the heart of the matter and deal with U.S. coal market first.
Although there are longer-term regulatory headwinds, turning point in U.S. coal demand came from a winter that didn't arrived. An unusually warm winter has significantly reduced the demand for electricity, and coupled with excess supply, natural gas prices have dropped to sub-$3 during the winter heating season for the first time this century. Both factors are reducing the demand for thermal coal in the U.S. and our customers are reducing production and announcing mine closures. 
At the same time, they know that the weather will change and our customers are making investments, investments to lower the fleet average cost from their mines and to expand export capacity. In fact, they're investing in expanding production from their bigger, lower cost mines as they reduce production from or close smaller, higher cost mines. And their expansion to the export facilities is based on their view that seaborne markets will be increasingly undersupplied in the years ahead.
So I view of the U.S. coal market weakness as a near-term issue. We have repeatedly said that we do not expect the U.S. coal market to be high growth, but we do expect it to be a stable base from which to grow our international businesses. This is not the first time we have gone through mild weather conditions in the U.S., and based on past experience we could see declines in demand from the U.S. impact our total revenues by as much as 4% to 6%.
However, we believe there is enough upside in the international markets to more than offset this. In addition, some of the decline has been factored in to our guidance for 2012 and some of it was in our first quarter results. We are already adjusting our cost by using U.S. resources to assist in international projects. And as a result, we do not expect the U.S. coal market to undermine our guidance for 2012. 
Conversely, we are very positive about the international markets. These markets largely depend on demand from the emerging markets, and especially China and India. China weakened into the final months of 2011 and has been quiet so far this year due to an early Chinese New Year. However, there are positive signs. Inflation peak in Beijing has already taken the first step to reduce the real rate of return, which should ease lending requirements. China's export markets, including the U.S. and Japan should be stronger in 2012. And most importantly, Beijing will do what it takes to deliver the GDP growth rate that it forecasted.
Electricity demand in China increased by 14% last year and domestic coal production did not keep pace, and imports reached record levels. Thermal coal imports into China are structural because Australian-landed prices are competitive with coal from Inner Mongolia because of the long train runs that had a high transportation commodities to the domestic cost. 
The new coal, based and driven further West, which will increase the competitiveness of Australian coal, and the build-out of electricity grid into   western provinces should keep power demand growth and imports into China high. Steel is an important part of China's GDP, and Chinese steel makers have continued to stock the imported iron ore in anticipation of production returns. They're doing this because iron ore market is highly concentrated and increased demand that brings high-cost Chinese iron ore back into production raises the price point. Because met coal has a more diversified supply base, its stock levels have declined, and restocking will add to metallurgical coal demand in 2012.
China has also a shorter of supply for copper, and this should lead to restocking in 2012. But even the 2012 demand for copper is low, the market will continue to be short of supply. This is due to declining ore grades and disruptions that have reduced output by a consistent 5% to 6% each year for over the past 5 years. In fact, copper production was forecast to increase by 1 million tonnes at the beginning of 2011, but the actual increase was only 1/10 of that. 
Supply shortages and demand upside are already being reflected in copper price, which has moved up over 12% from the first year. India has become a major importer of thermal coal as electricity demand grew by 9% in 2011, but domestic coal production was flat. As a result, imports grew faster in India than in China, and we expect that to continue.
Our customers are convinced in the upside from the international markets, and this is reflected in the cap expenditure plans for 2012. Not only is demand expected to improve, but global mining is already near full capacity. In addition, international commodity prices remain at incentive levels but more upside than down. As a result, our customers have raised their capital budgets by over 15% for 2012, and this includes a drag from U.S. coal producers. 
For example, the major diversified mining houses have raised their capital budgets by over 20%. I believe this is real because our customers are getting board approvals to proceed, and we are seeing them begin to apply resources to these projects. As a result of these overall factors, we are comfortable with our basic guidance for 2012. We also expect 2012 to be a year in which we build backlogs in both our surface and underground businesses, excluding the addition of the IMM backlog, of course.
We are upgrading our guidance for both IMM and for the items that were not covered in our prior guidance. We expect IMM to add $300 million to revenues on the remaining 3 quarters of our fiscal 2012. This will add $0.50 to earnings per share over the same period, excluding excess purchase accounting charges related to the first year. This will be offset by $0.16 of interest expense, of which $0.04 was incurred in the first quarter.
In our first quarter, we also had $0.12 of acquisition cost and $0.19 of gain on the IMM share that we  own to the tender. And neither of these 2 items was in our prior guidance. When that is all rolled in, we are moving our guidance for 2012 earnings per fully diluted share of $7.40 to $7.80 on revenues of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion.

Some of this is, I think, is catch-up from the projects that were started in 2008, put on hold in 2009, and our customers are have been pushing hard to get these projects back on schedule. So 2011 strong bookings rate was partially due to a catch-up factor, and one of the reasons we've indicated we expect the order growth to moderate in 2012 as that catch-up works through the system, we'll go back to a normal 15% to 20% a year order rate growth. So we don't see -- the distribution is pretty broad distribution. It's not really tied to a single project, and it's across several product lines. So there's nothing really unusual about the surface equipment bookings."

The businesses that we purchased, LeTourneau and IMM, have the same characteristics as our legacy business, and so we would expect them to be the same thing. The introduction of Operational Excellence, if I go back to the start of Operational Excellence in Joy Global, we started that program, and we had about 1 year of start-up costs associated with them. We actually had some cost headwinds in the early days since we started up those programs. And we eventually got to where the gains we're getting or paying for the next step in the program, so it become self-funding. And that, eventually, then turned to net additions. Over about a 3 to 4 year period, we went from a net drag on expenses to net mutual to net positive. And we would expect both LeTourneau and IMM to do the same thing. So we don't see it to reduce our -- the results in the early years, but we don't -- probably the first year, we wouldn't see a lot of incremental additions to our earnings performance, but we would expect starting the year to see some improvement, and then really sort of pick up steam from in the second year. But Mike's been a little bit close to those -- Michael's a little bit closer to those programs. So Mike, if you can add a little bit more granularity."

As you look at the IMM results, if you've been tracking their public results during the 2011 year, what you would have seen is that they began to incur some purchase accounting charges that were associated with the IPO that they did at the beginning of 2011. We'll have some purchase accounting charges as we go through our valuation of IMM. And then the other thing, I believe, that we'll see with the IMM business is some investment in improving the technology associated with their product. We intend to make them the leading China equipment manufacturer in that marketplace, and that will, in fact, require some investments. But in connection with IMM, we would expect them to also have operating results at least equal to the results that we see for our underground equipment business going forward. And then also with IMM, we also have the opportunity to increase their service aftermarket businesses as well as part of the longer-term strategy."

When we had earnings call in December for our fourth quarter, we were more cautious about the market outlook. At that time, our customers were telling us that they were proceeding with their capital expansion projects. They had a priority to -- for organic growth. They saw that as the highest returns on their investments. And they didn't plan M&A activities, they didn't plan dividends and other capital returns. There was organic growth first. Having said that, we also know that our customers will act quickly to keep supply and demand in balance. They did that at the end of 2008, and it was remarkable how quickly they adjusted their production to meet the client demand over that period of time. So I was a little bit skeptical about their intent versus what their actions would be if the economy kept struggling long and showing no signs of improvement. As we went into those latter part of 2011, there still was a lot of uncertainty, a lot of headwind that was driven by the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, for example. It was still unclear what that outcome was going to be. So I was much more cautious at that point. Since as we rolled into the first year, we saw their  capital budgets gets set and approved by the boards in late December, so we know what those numbers are now. But more importantly, we see them going through their boards with projects, their board's approving projects. So this is not just a budget to be approved later, but the board is -- their boards are on online with them to invest now for the longer-term future, the demand that they see in the commodity market. I think everybody believes that the amended commodity markets is going to be stronger in 3 or 4 years and we are supply-constrained today and we need more capacity. So the difference is the budgets were set. The difference is the boards were continuing to approve those projects for our customers and the difference is that the outlook is starting to indicate that we may be sort of reaching the end of the bumping along the bottom phase and start to see a slow climb-out in the global economy. Certainly the U.S. is showing signs of  starting to slowly get better. Japan should be a lot better than last year just because their getting past the tsunami effect. And if Europe is neutral, we still, I think, are good overall."

We're seeing a shift in Queensland, the Bowen basin in Queensland, where surface mines are starting to go underground, and we're seeing that activity increase in others. So as those surface mines reach their maximum stripping ratios, they begin to follow streams underground. So certainly, there are number of things that I think are the upside to underground. It's fully -- as weak as the U.S. is, it's really extraordinary how many projects are underway in Australia. For example, Australia got a huge a number of projects, some of those are by the majors, some of those are by the junior mining companies. But there's a massive number of projects in the pipeline. Not all those are going to come all the way to equipment selection in the near term. But yes, there's quite a bit of activity, and a lot of that is underground. As we look at our outlook for surface equipment, that surface equipment is going to be continue to be strong as well. So we don't actually see -- over the next 3 or 4 years, we don't see a change shifting from one to the other. We think the ratio is going to be fairly similar. We do see our surface equipment business to be a little bit later cycle than our underground equipment business. So we saw strength in the underground and then it began to just level off here over the last couple of quarters, start taking them through there, and then we see some positives going forward. The surface equipment has continued to be strong, but we expect the growth rate in orders for surface equipment to taper, sort of grab the wheel back kind of effect. Just as you get deeper into the cycle, you can't maintain those same year-over-year growth rates. So we'll see what the underground equipment is a little bit more of a catch-up later in 2012, and we'll see the surface equipment begin to moderate a little bit. So those 2 will come back in their normal ratios."

So we feel pretty good that we've got control of those processes. And we had just a different approach when we made the process changes. We have a much more controlled procedure to do that.

Just when we knew, when we acquired LeTourneau, we knew that, that was a problem, but as you mentioned the problem was much smaller at the time of the acquisition and has grown. And as we've done the research, we've gone back far enough now that we probably overcovered the number of machines that are actually affected. So we feel pretty good that we got this captured. I think that the supply chain issues, we don't have other major hiccups in supply chain. Probably our#1 issue that we deal with LaTourneau is we have a transition manufacturing agreement with Cameron, and their markets are increasing as well. And so we're trying to manage their -- our commitments on those -- that transition manufacturing agreement and our own demand, and that's created a little complication because so both us and Cameron are in territories that we don't normally get into and has -- managing through a contractual supply arrangement rather than a supplier who's looking for more of new business.

So we think the U.S. is currently -- from a production standpoint, it's going to be -- continue to be a solid market, not a high-growth market, maybe not much of a growth market, but a solid market. And we don't see -- really, we don't see a real decline or even met coal in Central App. We -- it's  difficult mining, and it's high cost but it's some of the best quality met coal in the world, and it's priced accordingly. So yes, in Central App will turn more into a met coal basin and less than to a thermal coal basin. Illinois basin will pick up some volume as a result of that. Export volumes will offset a smaller decline. We're looking at maybe 40 to 60 gigawatts of old legacy power generating capacity in the U.S. coming offline because of the new emission regulations. So that's not a huge number when you look at the upside potential we have in export. So all in all, we're looking -- all of our plans are basically around the U.S. being flat, and anything we get about that is good for us. But our plan is always around the U.S. being a flat market."

We can't compare some mines where we have all the equipment under Life Cycle Management contract versus other mines where we do everything on transactional basis. And so to those comparisons, and we looked at our parts capture rates, and those parts capture rates are in the mid-70% range. So, as we look at those 2 factors, we can see that we have 30%-ish kind of upside as we continue to build out our Life Cycle Management programs. We also -- in those Life Cycle Management programs, we increased the services that we do, and we expand a lot right now in our business. We're adding consumables to those Life Cycle Management contracts, things like filters and fluids. We have some fluids now that our Joy-branded fluids that have tracer capability for monitoring. And we keep expanding what goes into those most contracts. But the capture rates, Life Cycle Management capture rates go to 100% because we get everything that goes on those machines. So they give you a sort of a dimension in what the improvement is. Right now in terms of Life Cycle Management,we're -- as a percentage of our aftermarket, we're in the 30%, a little bit more 38%, 33% something like that of revenues are on those Life Cycle Management contracts. So we do have some contracts that are long-term parts supply contracts where we agreed to provide parts for a contracted price for the best player cost us,  and I'm not including those. We are including things that have parts and labor associated with the Life Cycle Management. So it could be full maintenance of machines including rebuilds and repairs, it could be a machine exchange program where we rebuild machines after every panel and we'll take those machines back into the customers' fleet. So those kind of programs will add up to about 1/3 of our aftermarket revenues. So we do have quite a real upside, and we think that as far as services, we'll be a really pull. We've really seen those strong response from our customers as far as services. The applications we have in South Africa deliver real results. I mean, we're seeing improvement in production rates. We're seeing improvements in availability, increases in mean time between repairs and mean time between failures. And we're getting this information for our customers. So they're seeing it as well. So we think that, that's probably going to be an accelerator for the adoption of Life Cycle Management programs."

This morning, I will begin with some brief comments which expand upon our press release and which provide some additional background on the results for the first quarter of our 2012 fiscal year. Mike Sutherlin will then provide an overview of our operations and our market outlook. After Mike's comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] 
During the call today, we'll be making forward-looking statements. These statements should be considered along with the various risk factors detailed in our press release and other SEC filings. We encourage you to read and become familiar with these risk factors.
We may also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures, which we believe are important to understanding our business. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP metrics to GAAP, as well as for other investor information, we refer you to our website at www.joyglobal.com.
Now let's spend a few moments reviewing the first quarter results. As was the case in our fourth quarter, the first quarter operating results includes the performance of our legacy surface and underground mining equipment businesses, along with the impact of the LeTourneau and IMM acquisitions. The LeTourneau results are fairly straightforward, while the IMM impact on the first quarter is far more complicated.
In connection with IMM, the first quarter started off with Joy Global owning approximately 29% of the IMM outstanding shares, which we acquired in open market transaction in 2011 at HKD $8 per share. At the end of December, we received approval of the IMM acquisition from the Hong Kong regulatory authorities and we completed the previously announced acquisition of the 41% of the IMM shares owned by the Jordan Group for HKD $8.50 per share. 
This transaction triggered 2 things: first, a shift to consolidating the IMM results for the month of January, offset by the minority interest and the IMM January net income associated with the 30% of the share which Joy Global did not own; and second, the recording of a $19.4 million gain associated with the difference between the HKD $8 per share we paid for the shares Joy Global acquired in 2011 and the approximate market value of HKD $8.50 per share at the end of the first quarter for the shares that were acquired in 2011.
To summarize, the first quarter, in connection with IMM, included 2 months of equity income, one month of consolidating the IMM results offset by minority interest, a $19.4 million gain associated with the shared purchase in 2011 and additional interest expense associated with the IMM acquisition. If these items did not add sufficient confusion to the first quarter results, the Chinese New Year came in January this year compared to February last year and the one month that the IMM results were consolidated with Joy Global was significantly impacted by the Chinese New Year holiday.
Finally, on February 10, we successfully concluded our tender offer for the IMM shares that we did not already own by receiving approximately 29% of the 30% that we did not own. This success will allow us to delist IMM from the Hong Kong Exchange sometime in our third quarter.
Turning to LeTourneau. The first quarter was the second full quarter of including LeTourneau results with Joy Global. In the current quarter, bookings, net sales and operating income were all below our expectations. A product quality issue identifying during -- identified during 2011 proved more difficult to resolve than originally expected, and the distractions on the production floor at the LeTourneau longwall -- Longview facility as a result of the drilling equipment business also had an unfavorable impact on OE shipments.
The product's quality issue affected bookings, shipments and operating process. The good news is that both issues have been addressed, and we expect the LeTourneau results will be back on track beginning in the second quarter.
Returning to the legacy surface and underground mining equipment businesses, the financial results were very favorable. Bookings in the current quarter were up 9% from a year ago and equaled $1.3 billion bookings recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in new order bookings was led by a 40% increase for surface mining equipment, with flat bookings for underground mining equipment. 
The underground equipment bookings were the second highest first quarter bookings on record. However, the highest first quarter booking on record was in the first quarter last year, when orders were received for longwall systems in Australia. The 40% increase in surface equipment bookings in the current quarter was made up of an 81% increase in original equipment orders and a 20% increase in aftermarket bookings. The original equipment increase was led by strong performance in the South African and South American markets.
The aftermarket favorable booking trend, which we have seen recently, continued in the current quarter, with the underground and surface mining equipment businesses reporting 26% and 20% bookings increases, respectively. Both business units had book-to-book -- book-to-bill ratios in excess of 1.0, and backlog increased from $3.3 billion at the beginning of the quarter to $3.6 billion at the end of the quarter.
Net sales for the legacy businesses increased by 21% in the first quarter with OE shipments up 37%, while aftermarket revenue increased 10%. OE shipments for both businesses benefited from the strong OE bookings received in 2011, while the underground equipment segment had a 17% increase in aftermarket net sales, while the surface equipment business had an increase in aftermarket revenue of 4%.
Operating profit of $204 million in the current quarter exceeded last year by $50 million with both the surface and underground mining equipment units having return on sales percentages in excess of 20% and an overall incremental profitability percentage of 28%. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to the increase in net sales and favorable manufacturing overhead absorption.
Net income in the current quarter was $1.33 per fully diluted share compared to $0.96 per share last year. The table included in the press release and on our website provides a summary of the various items which impacted the current quarter. The effective tax rate was 27.9% in the current quarter compared to 31.6% last year. Excluding favorable discrete tax items and a tax treatment for acquisition cost and the IMM stocking, the tax rate would have been approximately 31% in the current quarter. For the full year, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 29.5% and 31.5%.
On a final note, the revised guidance included in the press release does include all of the actual results reported for the first quarter and assumed full year fully diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 108 million.
Let me stop now and turn the discussion over to Mike Sutherlin."
277517,170237424,267346,"Joy Global, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 29, 2012",2012-02-29,"Earnings Calls","Komatsu Mining Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and I'd like to add my welcome to those on this call.

I was really pleased with our first quarter because we continued to deliver strong results from our core legacy businesses that are our foundation, and we made good progress on the investments in our future. That balanced performance will allow us to navigate through the volatility that has become almost normal for our industry, and this balance is also the basis for long-term sustainable performance.
Our legacy businesses delivered 28% operating leverage on 20% revenue growth, and I'll take that any time. We had several items related to M&A activities that were outside of our guidance, but these were neutral in operating profit and a slight drag on EPS. The EPS drag was from the interest on the bonds that we placed early to ensure that we had funding in place for the IMM tender.
The order bookings for our legacy businesses displayed a typical lumpy nature this quarter. Orders for underground original equipment were down, but this is somewhat influenced by last year's record first quarter. In fact, if it was not for last year, this would be our best first quarter for underground original equipment. More importantly, we had very strong order growth for surface original equipment and for aftermarket parts and services for both surface and underground. I believe that those orders and financial results for the first quarter position us well to deliver on expectations for the remainder of 2012.
This quarter, we had to work through the legacy warranty issue on LeTourneau's large wheel loaders. Core heat affected the articulation balls that are used to connect the 2 body halves of the machine and are used in the lifting arms. We have identified the root cause of this problem and have a retrofit program underway. Although customer concerns rightfully slowed both orders and deliveries this quarter, we expect both to catch up as machines in the field go back to work. Our customers still see the LeTourneau loader to be far superior to competitive loaders and as an alternative to hydraulic excavators and some service volume applications, so we continue to be very, very positive on the LeTourneau acquisition.
This quarter, we were successful in reaching ownership level in IMM that enables us to get a compulsory tender for the remaining shares. As a result, we expect IMM to be delisted by early June.
Starting in January, IMM is reported into our Joy underground business. Although it will remain a separate business unit to better serve the mid-tier mines that use these domestic Chinese equipment, we are planning to upgrade IMM through technology transfers and Operational Excellence programs.
The objective is to make IMM the technology leader while keeping the price and performance differential to our comparable Joy-branded products and to bring IMM factories up to the Joy Global operational standards. We believe both will bring significant incremental value to IMM.
Now let's shift to our markets. We are overall positive on our markets, but that is a mixture of strong sentiment for the international markets, offset by expectation of weakening in the U.S. coal market. So let's get to the heart of the matter and deal with the U.S. coal market first.
Although there are longer-term regulatory headwinds, turning point in U.S. coal demand came from a winter that didn't arrived. An unusually warm winter has significantly reduced the demand for electricity, and coupled with excess supply, natural gas prices have dropped to sub-$3 during the winter heating season for the first time this century. Both factors are reducing the demand for thermal coal in the U.S., and our customers are reducing production and announcing mine closures. 
At the same time, they know that the weather will change and our customers are making investments, investments to lower the fleet average cost from their mines and to expand export capacity. In fact, they're investing in expanding production from their bigger, lower cost mines as they reduce production from or close smaller, higher cost mines. And their expansion to the export facilities is based on their view that seaborne markets will be increasingly undersupplied in the years ahead.
So I view of the U.S. coal market weakness as a near-term issue. We have repeatedly said that we do not expect the U.S. coal market to be high growth, but we do expect it to be a stable base from which to grow our international businesses. This is not the first time we have gone through mild weather conditions in the U.S., and based on past experience, we could see declines in demand from the U.S. impact our total revenues by as much as 4% to 6%.
However, we believe there is enough upside in the international markets to more than offset this. In addition, some of the decline has been factored in to our guidance for 2012 and some of it was in our first quarter results. We are already adjusting our cost by using U.S. resources to assist in international projects. And as a result, we do not expect the U.S. coal market to undermine our guidance for 2012. 
Conversely, we are very positive about the international markets. These markets largely depend on demand from the emerging markets, and especially China and India. China weakened into the final months of 2011 and has been quiet so far this year due to an early Chinese New Year. However, there are positive signs. Inflation peak in Beijing has already taken the first step to reduce the real rate of return, which should ease lending requirements. China's export markets, including the U.S. and Japan, should be stronger in 2012. And most importantly, Beijing will do what it takes to deliver the GDP growth rate that it forecasted.
Electricity demand in China increased by 14% last year and domestic coal production did not keep pace, and imports reached record levels. Thermal coal imports into China are structural because Australian-landed prices are competitive with coal from Inner Mongolia because of the long train runs that add a high transportation component to the domestic cost. 
The new coal basins are even further west, which will increase the competitiveness of Australian coal, and the build-out of electricity grid into western provinces should keep power demand growth and imports into China high. Steel is an important part of China's GDP, and Chinese steel makers have continued to stock imported iron ore in anticipation of production returns. They're doing this because iron ore market is highly concentrated and increased demand that brings high-cost Chinese iron ore back into production raises the price point. Because met coal has a more diversified supply base, its stock levels have declined, and restocking will add to metallurgical coal demand in 2012.
China is also short of supply for copper, and this should lead to restocking in 2012. But even if the 2012 demand for copper is low, the market will continue to be short of supply. This is due to declining ore grades and disruptions that have reduced output by a consistent 5% to 6% each year for over the past 5 years. In fact, copper production was forecast to increase by 1 million tonnes at the beginning of 2011, but the actual increase was only 1/10 of that. 
Supply shortages and demand upside are already being reflected in copper price, which has moved up over 12% from the first of the year. India has become a major importer of thermal coal as electricity demand grew by 9% in 2011, but domestic coal production was flat. As a result, imports grew faster in India than in China, and we expect that to continue.
Our customers are convinced in the upside from the international markets, and this is reflected in the capital expenditure plans for 2012. Not only is demand expected to improve, but global mining is already near full capacity. In addition, international commodity prices remain at incentive levels with more upside than down. As a result, our customers have raised their capital budgets by over 15% for 2012, and this includes a drag from the U.S. coal producers. 
For example, the major diversified mining houses have raised their capital budgets by over 20%. I believe this is real because our customers are getting board approvals to proceed, and we are seeing them begin to apply resources to these projects. As a result of these overall factors, we are comfortable with our basic guidance for 2012. We also expect 2012 to be a year in which we build backlogs in both our surface and underground businesses, excluding the addition of the IMM backlog, of course.
We are upgrading our guidance for both IMM and for the items that were not covered in our prior guidance. We expect IMM to add $300 million to revenues on the remaining 3 quarters of our fiscal 2012. This will add $0.50 to earnings per share over the same period, excluding excess purchase accounting charges related to the first year. This will be offset by $0.16 of interest expense, of which $0.04 was incurred in the first quarter.
In our first quarter, we also had $0.12 of acquisition cost and $0.19 of gain on the IMM shares that we got prior to the tender. And neither of these 2 items was in our prior guidance. When that is all rolled in, we are moving our guidance for 2012 earnings per fully diluted share of $7.40 to $7.80 on revenues of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion. Again, this does not include the excess first year purchase accounting charges for either IMM or LeTourneau. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Roxanne for questions."

Some of this is, I think, is catch-up from the projects that were started in 2008, put on hold in 2009, and our customers are have been pushing hard to get these projects back on schedule. So 2011's strong bookings rate was partially due to a catch-up factor, and one of the reasons we've indicated we expect the order growth to moderate in 2012. As that catch-up bonus [ph] works through the system, we'll go back to a more normal 15% to 20% a year order rate growth. So we don't see -- the distribution is pretty broad distribution. It's not really tied to a single project, and it's across several product lines. So there's nothing really unusual about the surface equipment bookings."

The businesses that we purchased, LeTourneau and IMM, have the same characteristics as our legacy business, and so we would expect them to do the same thing. The introduction of Operational Excellence, if I go back to the start of Operational Excellence in Joy Global, we started that program, and we had about 1 year of start-up costs associated with them. We actually had some cost headwinds in the early days as we started up those programs. And we eventually got to where the gains we were getting were paying for the next step in the program, so it become self-funding. And that, eventually, then turned to net additions. Over about a 3 to 4 year period, we went from a net drag on expenses to net mutual to net positive. And we expect both LeTourneau and IMM to do the same thing. So we don't see it to reduce our -- the results in the early years, but we don't -- probably in the first year, we wouldn't see a lot of incremental additions to our earnings performance, but we would expect starting the year to see some improvement, and then really sort of pick up steam from then end of the second year. But Mike's been a little bit close to those -- Mike Olsen's been closer to those programs. So maybe, Mike, you can add a little bit more granularity."

As you look at the IMM results, if you've been tracking their public results during the 2011 year, what you would have seen is that they began to incur some purchase accounting charges that were associated with the IPO that they did at the beginning of 2011. We'll have some purchase accounting charges as we go through our valuation of IMM. And then the other thing, I believe, that we'll see with the IMM business is some investment in improving the technology associated with their product. We intend to make them the leading China equipment manufacturer in that marketplace, and that will, in fact, require some investment. But in connection with IMM, we would expect them to also have operating results at least equal to the results that we see for our underground equipment business going forward. And then also with IMM, we also have the opportunity to increase their service aftermarket businesses as well as part of the longer-term strategy."

When we had our earnings call in December for our fourth quarter, we were more cautious about the market outlook. At that time, our customers were telling us that they were proceeding with their capital expansion projects. They had a priority to -- for organic growth. They saw that as the highest returns on their investments. And they didn't plan M&A activities, they didn't plan dividends and other capital returns. There was organic growth first. Having said that, we also know that our customers will act quickly to keep supply and demand in balance. They did that at the end of 2008, and it was remarkable how quickly they adjusted their production to meet the client demand over that period of time. So I was a little bit skeptical about their intent versus what their actions would be if the economy kept struggling long and showing no signs of improvement. As we went into the latter part of 2011, there still was a lot of uncertainty, a lot of headwind that was driven by the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, for example. It was still unclear what that outcome was going to be. So I was much more cautious at that point. Since then, as we rolled into the first of the year, we saw their capital budgets get set and approved by the boards in late December, so we know what those numbers are now. But more importantly, we see them going through their boards with projects and their boards approving projects. So this is not just a budget to be approved later, but the board is -- their boards are on online with them to invest now for the longer-term future, the demand that they see in the commodity market. I think everybody believes the demand in commodity markets is going to be stronger in 3 or 4 years and we are supply-constrained today and we need more capacity. So the difference is the budgets were set. The difference is the boards were continuing to approve those projects for our customers and the difference is that the outlook is starting to really indicate that we may be sort of reaching the end of the bumping along the bottom phase and start to see a slow climb-out in the global economy. Certainly the U.S. is showing signs of starting to slowly get better. Japan should be a lot better than last year just because of getting past the tsunami effect. And if Europe is neutral, we still, I think, are good overall."

And then as a follow-on, just based on the conversations you're having, the prospect lists and how those are evolving, when we think about maybe 2013 and beyond, how do you encourage us to think about the relative growth prospects for underground versus surface? If you become less reliant or exposed to U.S. coal and global mining companies expand production commodities and I think, more often than not, get thought about in an open pit kind of context, do you think it would be fair to assume that surface potentially performs better in that 2013 time frame? Or is that probably -- I guess, that would be the question."

We're seeing",384,"Well, the -- I think long term, growth is more predisposed to the underground just because we have a lot of surface mines that are reaching the limit of their surface mineable capacity, getting to stripping ratios that are no longer economic. We're seeing a shift in Queensland, the Bowen Basin in Queensland, where surface mines are starting to go underground, and we're seeing that activity increase in numbers. So as those surface mines reach their maximum stripping ratios, they begin to follow things underground. So certainly, there are number of things that I think are the upside to underground. It's fully -- as weak as the U.S. is, it's really extraordinary how many projects are underway in Australia. For example, Australia got a huge a number of projects, some of those are by the majors, some of those are by the junior mining companies. But there's a massive number of projects in the pipeline. Not all those are going to come all the way to equipment selection in the near term. But yes, there's quite a bit of activity, and a lot of that is underground. As we looked at our outlook for surface equipment, that surface equipment is going to be continue to be strong as well. So we don't actually see -- over the next 3 or 4 years, we don't see a change shifting from one to the other. We think the ratio is going to be fairly similar. We do see our surface equipment business to be a little bit later cycle than our underground equipment business. So we saw strength in the underground and then it began to just level off here over the last couple of quarters, start taking them through there, and then we see some positives going forward. The surface equipment has continued to be strong, but we expect the growth rate in orders for surface equipment to taper, sort of have a wheel back [ph] kind of effect. Just as you get deeper into the cycle, you can't maintain those same year-over-year growth rates. So we'll see what the underground equipment is a little bit more of a catch-up later in 2012, and we'll see the surface equipment begin to moderate a little bit. So those 2 will come back in their normal ratios."

So we feel pretty good that we've got control of those processes. And we had just a different approach when we make the process changes. We have a much more controlled procedure to do that. So we don't see anything else out there. We've gone through a lot of extra due diligence on the machines to make sure we don't have other surprises out there. Just when we knew, when we acquired LeTourneau, we knew that, that was a problem. But as you mentioned, the problem was much smaller at the time of the acquisition and has grown. And as we've done the research, we've gone back far enough now that we probably overcovered the number of machines that are actually affected. So we feel pretty good that we've got this captured. I think that the supply chain issues, we don't have other major hiccups in supply chain. Probably our #1 issue that we deal with LaTourneau is we have a transition manufacturing agreement with Cameron, and their markets are increasing as well. And so we're trying to manage their -- our commitments on the -- that transition manufacturing agreement and our own demand, and that's created a little complication because so both us and Cameron are in territories that we don't normally get into and has -- managing through a contractual supply arrangement rather than a supplier who's looking for more of your business. So -- but we feel pretty good that we've got the team down in LeTourneau. We've added some people from Milwaukee down there to supplement the resources they have on-site, and we feel pretty good that we've got the situation under control.

And we identified that this thing actually went back for quite some time and affected a larger number of machines. So we weren't surprised by the issue. We knew about that. We were surprised by how far back the issue went, and frankly, so we probably overcorrected because we went back to the point of a significant change in the manufacturing process and made sure that we've included everything from now all the way back to that point in time.

We have a lot of work we're involved in, in Australia, a lot of project work we're involved in, and we're moving resources off of U.S.-based projects on to Australian-based projects. They're staying in the U.S., but we're doing basically around the world, engineering on those Australian projects, which has really given us the opportunity to move faster on those projects and at the same time, not add resources -- add resource cost to Australia, use what we already have. So we have ways to manage the volatility. We do quite a bit of outsourcing in our businesses. At this point in the cycle, we're probably in the mid to upper 20% of our production is outsourced. So we have some flex in that we can use. We did that in 2009, and we can do that again. The long term, I think the long term, we follow what our customers are doing. Our customers are preparing for the long term to involve a lot more exports in their revenue base than we have today, and they're building capacity in the West Coast. They're building capacity in the port of New Orleans. They're building capacity on the East Coast to increase exports. So we think the U.S. is currently -- from a production standpoint, it's going to be -- continue to be a solid market, not a high-growth market, maybe not much of a growth market, but a solid market. And we don't see -- really, we don't see a real decline. Even met coal in Central App. We -- it's  difficult mining, and it's high cost but it's some of the best quality met coal in the world, and it's priced accordingly. So yes, Central App will turn more into a met coal basin and less into a thermal coal basin. Illinois basin will pick up some volume as a result of that. Export volumes will offset at a smaller decline. We're looking at maybe 40 to 60 gigawatts of old legacy power generating capacity in the U.S. coming off-line because of the new emission regulations. So that's not a huge number when you look at the upside potential we have in export. So all in all, we're looking -- all of our plans are basically around the U.S. being flat, and anything we get above that is good for us.

We can compare some mines where we have all the equipment under Life Cycle Management contract versus other mines where we do everything on transactional basis. And so through those comparisons, and we looked at our parts capture rates, and those parts capture rates are in the mid-70% range. So, as we look at those 2 factors, we can see that we have 30%-ish kind of upside as we continue to build out our Life Cycle Management programs. We also -- in those Life Cycle Management programs, we increased the services that we do, and we expand, like right now in our business, we're adding consumables to those Life Cycle Management contracts, things like filters and fluids. We have some fluids now that our Joy-branded fluids that have tracer capability for monitoring. And we keep expanding what goes into those contracts. But the capture rates, Life Cycle Management capture rates go to 100% because we get everything that goes on those machines. So that gives you a sort of a dimension in what the improvement is. Right now in terms of Life Cycle Management, we're -- as a percentage of our aftermarket, we're in the 30%, a little bit more than 30%. 33%, something like that of revenues are on those Life Cycle Management contracts. So we do have some contracts that are long-term parts supply contracts where we agreed to provide parts for a contracted price for the best player cost us,  and I'm not including those. We are including things that have parts and labor associated with the Life Cycle Management. So it could be full maintenance of machines including rebuilds and repairs, it could be a machine exchange programs where we rebuild machines after every panel, and we'll take those machines back into the customers' fleet. So those kind of programs will add up to about 1/3 of our aftermarket revenues. So we do have quite a bit of upside, and we think that as far as services, we'll be a real pull. We've really seen a strong response from our customers as far as services. The applications we have in South Africa are delivering real results. I mean, we're seeing improvement in production rates. We're seeing improvements in availability, increases in mean time between repairs and mean time between failure. And we're getting this information from our customers. So they're seeing it as well. So we think that, that's probably going to be an accelerator for the adoption of Life Cycle Management programs."

We've been doing that on the surface. In fact, we were dealers for LeTourneau before we acquired them, and we were dealers for Terex in a few markets for trucks -- hydraulic excavators. So that's been a part of our surface equipment program. We're moving that underground. In our surface equipment, we probably have too many programs, too many OEMs in our alliance program. Some of those are small and not very material. We're looking for products that can be very complementary and have a significant impact on not only our business, but our customers see it is a significant addition to our product range as well. And ultimately, we looked at those as potential future acquisitions. So if they wouldn't be a potential acquisition, we wouldn't be interested in acting as a dealer. Fletcher makes a product line that's very complementary to us. It's got a great reputation and it works very well with our underground business.

So we think there's a real advantage in a process of keeping IMM at the lead of technology among its peer Chinese equipment manufacturers, but maintaining a differential with our Joy-branded products. And so a lot of this will be basically technology transfers, and it will be human resources to walk through their machines and show them where they can improve the liability, add some feature functionality that will be advantageous based upon our own.

Now let's spend a few moments reviewing the second quarter results. As a reminder, operating results includes performance of our legacy surface and underground mining equipment business units, combined with the results of the LeTourneau and IMM acquisitions. Both acquisitions contributed favorably to the results for the quarter. Additionally, there is considerably less noise from the acquisition of IMM during the current quarter compared to our first quarter. 
During the second quarter, we increased our ownership of IMM to approximately 99% and expect to settle the remaining outstanding shares during our third quarter. We also anticipate the Hong Kong exchange will approve our request to delist IMM during our third quarter. 
During the second quarter, IMM recorded bookings of $98 million, while recognizing $87 million of revenue and $21 million of operating profit before excess purchase accounting charges. The excess purchase accounting charges related to the amortization of the write-up of acquired inventories and totaled $17 million in the current quarter. We also expect to record an additional and final $5 million of excess purchase accounting charges related to IMM during our third quarter based on our current acquisition valuation estimates.
Despite the economic slowdown in China, the IMM second quarter results were substantially in line with our expectations. 
With regard to LeTourneau, their performance rebounded nicely from the product quality issue and the divested business distractions experienced in our first quarter. LeTourneau recorded bookings of $128 million during the second quarter, while recognizing $133 million of revenue and $26 million of operating profit before excess purchase accounting charges. These charges were related also to the write-up of acquired inventory and backlog and totaled $6 million. 
During our third quarter, we expect to record an additional and final $2 million of excess purchase accounting amortization related to the LeTourneau acquisition.
Turning to the legacy service and underground mining equipment businesses, from a financial results was tempered by moderation and our bookings for the quarter. Bookings of $1 billion in the current quarter were down 34% from a year ago and below the $1.3 billion recorded last quarter. The decrease in new order bookings was comprised of a 20% decrease for surface mining equipment and a 38% decrease for underground mining equipment.
The 20% decrease in surface equipment bookings in the current quarter was primarily made up of a 42% decrease in original equipment orders, as aftermarket bookings remain flat. Original equipment orders continue to be strong for corporate customers in South America and for coal and iron ore customers in Australia, but were more than offset by decreases in our original equipment orders in North America, South Africa and Russia. 
Service aftermarket orders in the current quarter increased in South America and Australia, but were offset by a decrease in aftermarket bookings in China, India, Russia and South Africa. The 38% decrease in the second quarter in underground mining equipment bookings was attributable to a 62% decline in original equipment orders and a 12% decrease in aftermarket bookings. 
The original equipment bookings decline compared to the second quarter of last year is attributable to a week U.S. coal market and high comparables due to a major longwall system order received in Australia in 2011. The decrease in aftermarket orders was due to the reduced underground coal production in the United States, which is a result of a mild winter and low natural gas pricing and a larger impact due to the unusually high level of service orders received in Australia in the second quarter last year, which were associated with the longwall system orders previously mentioned and which were not repeated in the current quarter.
The backlog of the legacy businesses was $2.8 billion at the end of the second quarter compared to $3.3 billion at the end of the first quarter. 
In addition to lower bookings recorded during the quarter, we have removed $119 million in underground equipment backlog scheduled for U.S. market, as we believe there is a reasonable risk of deferral or cancellation of these orders. It is important to note that these orders have not been canceled, but we believe the reduction in backlog to be prudent, given current market conditions.
Backlog attributable to the IMM and LeTourneau businesses remained at $300 million, the same level as of the end of the first quarter. 
Despite the soft bookings recorded in the second quarter, the company expects the book-to-bill ratio to the 2012 fiscal year to exceed 1.0 for the legacy businesses. Net sales for the legacy businesses increased by 24% in the first quarter with surface mining equipment shipments up 27%, while underground mining machinery revenue increased 23%. OE shipments and surface equipment increased 57%, while the underground mining equipment original equipment increased 43%. 
Aftermarket shipments of the OE of surface mining equipment increased 12% and shipments of aftermarket underground mining equipment increased 10% compared to the second quarter last year, primarily driven by strong part sales in the current quarter.
Legacy business operating profit of $311 million in the current quarter exceeded last year by $75 million, with both the surface and underground mining equipment units having return on sales percentages in excess of 24% and an overall incremental profitability percentage of 29%. 
The increase in operating profit was primarily due to the increase in net sales. Income from continuing operations in the current quarter were $2.04 per fully diluted share, compared to $1.52 per share last year. The table included in the press release and on our website provides a summary of the various items, which impacted the current quarter. 
The most significant item, which was new in the current quarter, was the $14.8 million or a $0.14 per share decrease in net income due to the excess purchase accounting amortization associated with IMM previously mentioned. The second quarter also included a $40 million increase in net interest expense compared to last year, due to the financing of the LeTourneau and IMM acquisitions. 
The effective tax rate in the current quarter was 31.1% compared to 29.8% last year. The increase in the effective tax rate is attributable to a nonrecurring tax planning benefit, net of discrete items, realized in the second quarter last year. 
The full year effective tax rate for this year is expected to be between 30% and 31.5%. On a final note, the revised guidance included in the press release includes all of the actual results reported to the second quarter and assumes full year of fully diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $108 million. Now let me turn the discussion over to Mike Sutherlin."
277517,207005867,315564,"Joy Global, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, May 31, 2012",2012-05-31,"Earnings Calls","Komatsu Mining Corp.","Executives","Yes, thanks, Mike. And let me add my welcome to those on the call. This quarter extends the pattern of uncertainty in our end markets overshadowing the exceptional performance that we continue to deliver. It was a record quarter for revenues, margins an",1619,"Yes, thanks, Mike. And let me add my welcome to those on the call. This quarter extends the pattern of uncertainty in our end markets overshadowing the exceptional performance that we continue to deliver. 
It was a record quarter for revenues, margins and earnings. Our legacy Joy underground and P&H surface businesses delivered exceptional performance by using cycle time reductions accelerate machine deliveries and high operating leverage translated into record levels of profitability. Both LeTourneau and IMM made strong contributions with their combined margins over 21%, excluding excess purchase accounting charges. 
Compared of this result, I think, the strongest performance prepares us to better deal with the uncertainty in our end markets. The extended duration of the uncertainty weighs on the market in both data messages can be inconsistent and confusing. I will provide our views of our end markets and our customer activities and then how we expect that to impact our business.
The U.S. coal market is at the epicenter of the market corrections, so let's address that first. The winter that did not come reduced power generation in the U.S. by about 5.5% below last year, which is beyond the decline experienced in 2009. About 65 million tonnes of annual coal production was taken off-line in the first quarter and the accelerating trend was over 100 million tonnes of annual production by April. 
However, coal utilities has increased over 200 million pounds, resulting in a 40 million to  50 million pounds of stock pile depletion that will become headwinds in the light coal production recovery. 
We estimate that after 40 million tonnes of the overall reduction as a result of accelerated compliance with the regulations that will require closure of the oldest, unscrubbed coal fired units. The remaining reduction is driven by a combination of the significant decline in electricity demand and the loss of dispatch to natural gas, as its price remains in the mid-$2 per million BTU range. 
Shale gas joint programs require $4 to $5 gas to return our cost of capital and coals should begin the us gas prices moved above $3. However, natural gas storage has hit all-time highs, and this must be worked through before drilling for dry gas increases. This was reflected in the forward strip for natural gas, which gets to $4, but not until 2014. 
In the meantime, upside in the U.S. coal market will come from exports and met coal. Upside will also come from increased electricity demand, since most of the unutilized excess generating capacity is in coal fired units. We expect aftermarket demand from the U.S. underground coal to be reduced by about 12%, in line with production reductions.
Aftermarket orders in the U.S. underground could drop more than that for the next quarter or so, as inventories held at mine site are depleted. Orders for underground original equipment are expected to be depressed until the market stabilizes, which may not be until next year. Then we expect to return to normal replacement cycle for underground equipment, plus upgrade as new technologies improves productivity and reduces costs. 
Although U.S. coal will become structurally smaller market, it will continue to provide a strong base in which to leverage our investments into the international markets.
International coal markets are dominated by demand from China and India, and imports for both the running well ahead of last year on an annualized basis. Electricity demand in China has slowed from 12% last year to 7%. Although demand for thermal coal has slowed as well, current pricing provides an advantage imported over domestic coal and imports were increasing while domestic stock piles are reaching historically, high levels. The import tonnage per April is estimated 21 million tonnes, close to record set last November and up on a run rate basis from the 58 million tonnes imported in the first quarter. 
With most of China's new production coming from the Western provinces, increased rail transportation costs will keep seaborne coal demand strong and growing. Although China's economy continues to show signs of slowing, the central government has started to take steps to stimulate by cutting interest rates and the ring the bank required loan reserve ratio and further steps in both areas are expected.
The nation oil also start, and I quote here, a serious of key infrastructure projects that are vital to the overall economy and can facilitate growth. And therefore, we expect turn to bottom in the near term and return to higher growth.
Seaborne coal demand is growing at even faster rate in India, which continues to struggle with increased, excuse me, struggle to increase as domestic coal production. India's largest power producers increased imports added 33% rate over last year. And although just over half of India's power is generated from coal today, almost 85% of the 76 gigawatts of plant capacity increases will be coal fired. Excuse me, global steel production continues at a 6% growth rate over last year and steel production in China have recovered and is running 20% of although last November. Although steel production is expected to remain flat for the rest of this year, it should provide support for both met coal and iron ore or. China steel mills have destock met coal and iron ore and both raw materials are anecdotally at about a month of supply on hand. Restocking should provide additional support to steelmaking raw materials. 
In addition, steelmaking in other met coal importing countries, excluding China, is up 12% from a low point late last year. As a result, we believe met coal has been deficit. For example, one of our customers as indicated that met coal demand is running ahead of its annual guidance and another brought the met coal mine back into production after being idle for only a few weeks. 
Production challenges and project delays will keep copper supply in deficit this year. For example, one of our major delay in miners to production down 10% on the first quarter. And this is in line with the general trend of producers who continue missing production targets by 5% to 6%. 
We entered this year expecting our order rate to moderate from the exceptionally strong growth in orders last year. If you remember, our original equipment orders last year were up over 7% and our total orders were up over 40%. And this was because last year had a catch-up factors customers rush to get equipment books for projects that were put on hold in 2008 and we started in 2010. 
However, with strong momentum from projects underway and a stagnating global economy, our customers no longer have a great sense of urgency to bring new projects forward. Although some of the largest diversified mining companies have indicated their slowing CapEx and reevaluating their large Greenfield projects, that is not a broad trend. 
In fact, we continue to see new projects added to our prospect list, but at a slower rate. Customers are focusing their resources on completing the projects actively underway and on brownfield expansions that have lower risk and a shorter time horizon. We expect this condition to continue as customer see demand, excuse me, we expect this condition to continue until our customers see demand improvement that were adjust by acceleration of projects. 
We see the commodity markets of copper, iron ore and met coal to be solid with list to be upside. Seaborne thermal core have supply surplus that is considered near-term and longer-term they still justifies capacity expansion. The U.S. coal market should stabilize later this year, but has to reduce excess coal stockpiles and deplete high natural gas storage levels before can expect meaningful improvement. We expect this to translate into slowing order rate and flattening revenues for the next few quarters. This compares in May to our first half run rate rather than to our second quarter. 
Despite this expectation, we are preparing for a wide range of possible outcomes. In addition to trimming and focusing our cost, the efforts we made over the past several years to streamline our processes and reduce cycle times will allow us to adapt to market conditions faster and more effectively. 
We're also taking steps to increase the alignment of our service and underground businesses to better leverage coming processes and overlapping cost structures through initiatives we call, One Joy Global. These are all directive in making us a more efficient business and they will allow us to prepare for slowing market growth while maintaining key investments in selected R&D programs and in the rollout of our service excellence programs. We are adjusting and this year's guidance for 2 factors: The combination of backlog reduction and the impact of reduced volumes on aftermarket orders for U.S. underground coal market will begin to be felt in our second half. 
Despite earlier expectations, the slowing and the international markets will no longer enable them to fully offset the reductions in the U.S. coal market. That reduces our net revenue expectations for 2012 by about $100 million. This $100 million reduction of revenues will reduce earnings per share for 2012 by $0.18 after some cost mitigation. 
In addition, prior guidance excluded the excess share purchases accounting charges for IMM. This have now been determined to be $0.17 per share for 2012, of which $0.14 was recorded in our second quarter. The combination of these 2 factors reduces 2012 revenues by $100 million and our top end earnings per share by $0.35.
Therefore, our updated guidance for 2012 is for revenues to be between $5.5 billion and $5.7 billion and for earnings per fully diluted share to be between $7.15 and $7.45. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jake for questions."

The downside and upside all translates into the international markets, and we have customers that are growing a little bit more cautious, they feel they have enough stuff in the pipeline and they have time to ramp up and therefore are waiting to see a little bit more certainty out of the global economies. So downside would occur if we continue to see slowing in the international markets and upside would come from that as well. Right now, though, we continue to see signs and evidence that there is strength in the international markets. Like I said, steel production is up, and we will go through a restocking phase from met coal and that will create some upside demand there. Iron ore imports look really good trying to production cost exceptionally high. And iron ore, in fact, despite some really high level of iron ore imports, the stockpiles at the ports in China starting to come down. So we believe that there's more risk in the international markets to the upside than there is the downside. I think the variable here is the timing. Is the upside going to be later is it going to be near end? And that's the unknown. But certainly, we believe that the international markets have more upside than downside at this point."

We have seen that with some of the major diversified mining houses, but those are mega greenfield projects.

They're like our continuous minus this chart alike of the standard of the industry. And sometimes, you try other people. You find out that machine performances is good and you start to get back to the core equipment that you've always had. And then we believe that that's one of the trends we're getting into right now is that as people, the mine production in China is slowing then we expect coal production in China to grow at somewhere half or 2/3 of the rate we seen historically. We see stockpiles building up right now and if prices below $100 a metric tonne, we're seeing the imported coal continue to have a price advantage.

What we see out of the international markets that we don't see out of the U.S. is there's more of a tendency to buy in a large amount of parts with some original equipment order carry higher levels of mine stocks. And so we get a little bit more lumpiness as a result of that. And in some areas, particularly out of places like China and India, we will get their parts demand for those markets will come in 3 or 4 large orders a year rather than monthly or weekly. So we do get more lumpiness in the international markets.

So those who drive higher levels of aftermarket activity, parts and labor and the aftermarket activities, and we have that modeled in. Some of that will come in lumpy form because some of the parts legacy delivered with the projects upfront. Some of it gets lumped by the nature.

And with our customers, we really had a real, strong effort around being very predictable. And we tell them upfront what we're going to do and why regard to do it. And we don't play games. We don't go into projects that cuts our discount the plea at and by the fact do order. In 2009, when, I think, we've only like 5 shovels all of 2009. And yet, we raised parts price in 2009 because we were still -- we're trying to catch up from getting behind the curve in 2007 and 2008. And that went down, okay, we explained it to our customers, we explained why we're going it and they accepted that. So we've been pretty disciplined about keeping price, positive price realization and our equipment. Having said that, in an up market, you have the ability to get a little bit above neutral in price realization and soft market, those increments are going to get squeezed. But we don't see any significant reduction to margins. We think that the margins will hold. They may not see strong margin growth year-over-year, but we think we definitely plan to margins to hold, and we look at margins and backlog. Look at margins in the quotations and we continue to compare those each one of those increments to be positive. Sometimes by a small number, sometimes by bigger number. But we've been pretty good about maintaining those margins through difficult times, as well as better times. And we think we'll do the same thing now. We do have no expectation that we're going to see margin erosion in our equipment pricing."

What the adjustment to the backlog that we were referencing, the 119, about $100 million of that was in fact associated with original equipment shipments with about $18 million associated with aftermarket really complete machine refurbishment. A chunk of that backlog would in fact be scheduled for deliveries outside of this fiscal year, so would not have impacts on the current year revenue. The aftermarket, the $100 million reduction that's baked into the guidance, a big chunk of that really is associated with softness that we had in the guidance that we issued at the end of the first quarter. At that time, we indicated that we expected that the U.S. may have as much as 4% to 6% impact in our business. But at that point in time, we felt that, that softness would in fact be mitigated by strength outside of the U.S. What we're seeing now is that a portion of that softness will still be mitigated by activity levels were seeing outside of the U.S. But won't be able to offset all of it.

As we've talked really down through the years when we first starting talking back in really the fourth quarter of 2008, we consistently work through scenario planning, where each of the businesses are taking a look at cost structures, taking a look at various scenarios of volume levels. And we, in fact, have various tiers of cost reduction initiatives. But some of those initiatives are really just bite, belt-tightening, where you're eliminating discretionary expenditures. And then they accelerate all the way up, if the markets get extraordinary soft to the point where we begin to close some of the higher cost facilities and begun to put more volume into our lower cost facilities. The first phase, the belt tightening pipetting phase has been underway really form couple of quarters now. But at same time, what we want to make sure of is that we don't take cost and resources away from those projects that really are going to be driving our future. So those process -- projects associated with our service excellence initiatives, those projects that are associated with our new product developments, those, in fact, are sacred. So we will in fact find additional costs in order to maintain our spending levels for those activities.

We do expect the savings to cover the cost of the things we'll do in the second half of the year. Now I think the other things to note is that, we, as the cycle matures, we, excuse me, we did increase the amount of outsourcing we do, particularly around structural fabrications, which tends to be more skewed to the cycle, less replacement demand for those. And in 2008, we are outsourcing has guided to around 35% of our production hours. Today, that number is just a little bit over 30%. But as we did in 2009, fully that work back in-house, does a significant amount of cost mitigation for us and maintains overhead structures. So we have that as part of our plans as well. So we have to -- we want to maintain our network of outsource suppliers that we use. But we did leverage that down in 2009. And if we need to, we can leverage that down, which is a big part of the overall cost reduction plans we have."

And then as the business volumes ramped up in 2011, we began the -- to do more outsourcing. And so we're now in a position somewhat similar to 2008 where that outsourcing variable cross settlement is up around round that 30% level, which gives us an opportunity to allow this cost to flex with any softness in volume that we might see going forward."

But it also gives us from a big to deal with escalation and other kind of cost is because we have been our crosses over that period of time. So capacities effectively fully utilized. Right now we don't have a lot of excess capacity. We do a little bit on underground in some machine areas, but it's not very significant. As we look forward, we look for our business to flatten. And we do have some more capacity coming online. And in China, that will be ready to come online some time early next year. So the capacity utilization, as we look at right now, that excess capacity is going to come out of that additional investment in factory capacity China rather than the clients in the market at this point. So that's where our planning is. We haven't gone into the outsourced that we just talked about. But we'd be prepared to if we needed to. But right now, we think we can all things steady. We are moving some things around to get better utilization, for example, remove these omissions that would have otherwise been built in Australia. We just don't have the capacity there. So the lead times that extended we're moving that production back to the U.S., and we're using that to backfill some of the delays we expect out of Central Appalachia.

I think that we have not seen any negatives in the international markets. So we're not mine delays that we're seeing are normal stuff, like permitting delays or other kind of things that are fairly normal with major projects. We're not seeing people just starting to get cautious and flowing back on their plans. What we do see is a focus on completing what they have in the pipeline. And we do see them looking at brownfield expansions, which are quicker and more predictable. But what we need to see slowing down is their rush to bring the next big greenfield project into the pipeline. And some of that allows them to work within their existing resources, which is more efficient than subcontracting out engineering and more cost-effective. And so with the view of the global economy right now, the customers feel more comfortable if they have enough stuff in the pipeline at the rate that they're going to dig imitate the face of their growing to be find it won't over the projects. They won't get ahead of them. So there'll be able to do that more cost efficiently because to be working within their own internal resources. So that is a more satisfaction that they're going to right pace less of a rush to step it up or not less opportunistic that I need to get my mind in production now so I could take advantage of market opportunities. A lot of that rush and timing issues have sort of worked the way out of the systems. So we see a lot of stability in their international markets. We do see upside. Some of the major headlines we get comes from a couple of our major customers. But some of that is fairly large CapEx plans around some really large projects that are multiyear projects summarize in the first production is we've been talking about one of the Australian  projects now for 4 or 5 years and still probably 6 or 7 years from production. So I think there's a lot more concern about those big mega projects. Most of our other projects are continuing with the projects as they have planned, we see new products coming to the pipeline. They're not mega projects. They're not 4 draglines and 12 shovels. They're are like 5 shovels here and 3 shovels there. And we continue to see those things coming to the pipeline. Certainly longwall in Australia for underground coal, we see those coming into the pipeline as well. So the smaller management projects are okay. The Brownfield projects are a priority. And things that are underway are in fine shape. We don't see any pressure on those. But we see you see the pressures of the big mega greenfield projects. But that's -- those are further out and we'd never put those too much on our plans because those have always had timing issues and permitting delays and they're generally all part prospect list and out of the horizon that any all."

This morning, I will begin with some brief comments, which expand upon our press release and which provide some additional background on the results for the second quarter of our 2012 fiscal year. Mike Sutherlin will then provide an overview of our operations and our market outlook. After Mike's comments, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
During the call today, we will be making forward-looking statements. These statements should be considered along with the various risk factors detailed in our press release and other SEC filings. We encourage you to read and become familiar with these risk factors.
We may also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures, which we believe are important to understanding our business. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP metrics to GAAP, as well as for other investor information, we refer you to our website at www.joyglobal.com.
Now let's spend a few moments reviewing the second quarter results. As a reminder, operating results includes performance of our legacy surface and underground mining equipment business units, combined with the results of the LeTourneau and IMM acquisitions. Both acquisitions contributed favorably to the results for the quarter. Additionally, there is considerably less noise from the acquisition of IMM during the current quarter compared to our first quarter. 
During the second quarter, we increased our ownership of IMM to approximately 99% and expect to settle the remaining outstanding shares during our third quarter. We also anticipate the Hong Kong exchange will approve our request to delist IMM during our third quarter. 
During the second quarter, IMM recorded bookings of $98 million, while recognizing $87 million of revenue and $21 million of operating profit before excess purchase accounting charges. The excess purchase accounting charges related to the amortization of the write-up of acquired inventories and totaled $17 million in the current quarter. We also expect to record an additional and final $5 million of excess purchase accounting charges related to IMM during our third quarter, based on our current acquisition valuation estimates.  Despite the economic slowdown in China, the IMM second quarter results were substantially in line with our expectations. 
With regard to LeTourneau, their performance rebounded nicely from the product quality issue and the divested business distractions experienced in our first quarter. LeTourneau recorded bookings of $128 million during the second quarter, while recognizing $133 million of revenue and $26 million of operating profit before excess purchase accounting charges. These charges were related also to the write-up of acquired inventory and backlog, and totaled $6 million. During our third quarter, we expect to record an additional and final $2 million of excess purchase accounting amortization related to the LeTourneau acquisition.
Turning to the legacy surface and underground mining equipment businesses. Strong financial results were tempered by moderation in our bookings for the quarter. Bookings of $1 billion in the current quarter were down 34% from a year ago and below the $1.3 billion recorded last quarter. The decrease in new order bookings was comprised of a 20% decrease for surface mining equipment and a 38% decrease for underground mining equipment.
The 20% decrease in surface equipment bookings in the current quarter was primarily made up of a 42% decrease in original equipment orders, as aftermarket bookings remain flat. Original equipment orders continue to be strong for corporate customers in South America and for coal and iron ore customers in Australia, but were more than offset by decreases in original equipment orders in North America, South Africa and Russia. 
Surface aftermarket orders in the current quarter increased in South America and Australia, but were offset by a decrease in aftermarket bookings in China, India, Russia and South Africa. The 38% decrease in the second quarter in underground mining equipment bookings was attributable to a 62% decline in original equipment orders and a 12% decrease in aftermarket bookings. 
The original equipment bookings decline, compared to the second quarter of last year, is attributable to a weak U.S. coal market and high comparables due to a major longwall system order received in Australia in 2011. The decrease in aftermarket orders was due to the reduced underground coal production in the United States, which is a result of a mild winter and low natural gas pricing and a larger impact due to the unusually high level of service orders received in Australia in the second quarter last year, which were associated with the longwall system orders previously mentioned, and which were not repeated in the current quarter.
The backlog of the legacy businesses was $2.8 billion at the end of the second quarter compared to $3.3 billion at the end of the first quarter. In addition to lower bookings recorded during the quarter, we have removed $119 million in underground equipment backlog scheduled for U.S. market, as we believe there is a reasonable risk of deferral or cancellation of these orders. It is important to note that these orders have not been canceled, but we believe the reduction in backlog to be prudent, given current market conditions.  Backlog attributable to the IMM and LeTourneau businesses remained at $300 million, the same level as of the end of the first quarter. 
Despite the soft bookings recorded in the second quarter, the company expects the book-to-bill ratio to the 2012 fiscal year to exceed 1.0 for the legacy businesses. Net sales for the legacy businesses increased by 24% in the first quarter with surface mining equipment shipments up 27%, while underground mining machinery revenue increased 23%. OE shipments of surface equipment increased 57%, while the underground mining equipment, original equipment, increased 43%. 
Aftermarket shipments of OE -- of surface mining equipment increased 12% and shipments of aftermarket underground mining equipment increased 10% compared to the second quarter last year, primarily driven by strong part sales in the current quarter.
Legacy business operating profit of $311 million in the current quarter exceeded last year by $75 million, with both the surface and underground mining equipment units having return on sales percentages in excess of 24% and an overall incremental profitability percentage of 29%. 
The increase in operating profit was primarily due to the increase in net sales. Income from continuing operations in the current quarter were $2.04 per fully diluted share, compared to $1.52 per share last year. The table included in the press release and on our website provides a summary of the various items, which impacted the current quarter. 
The most significant item, which was new in the current quarter, was the $14.8 million or a $0.14 per share decrease in net income due to the excess purchase accounting amortization associated with IMM previously mentioned. The second quarter also included a $40 million increase in net interest expense compared to last year, due to the financing of the LeTourneau and IMM acquisitions. 
The effective tax rate in the current quarter was 31.1% compared to 29.8% last year. The increase in the effective tax rate is attributable to a nonrecurring tax planning benefit, net of discrete items, realized in the second quarter last year.  The full year effective tax rate for this year is expected to be between 30% and 31.5%. 
On a final note, the revised guidance included in the press release includes all of the actual results reported to the second quarter and assumes full year of fully diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $108 million. 
Now let me turn the discussion over to Mike Sutherlin."
277517,207005867,315717,"Joy Global, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, May 31, 2012",2012-05-31,"Earnings Calls","Komatsu Mining Corp.","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Mike. And let me add my welcome to those on the call. This quarter extends the pattern of uncertainty in our end markets overshadowing the exceptional performance that we continue to deliver.

This quarter extends the pattern of uncertainty in our end markets overshadowing the exceptional performance that we continue to deliver.  It was a record quarter for revenues, margins and earnings. 
Our legacy Joy underground and P&H surface businesses delivered exceptional performance by using cycle time reduction to accelerate machine deliveries and high-operating leverage translated into record levels of profitability. Both LeTourneau and IMM made strong contributions with their combined margins over 21%, excluding excess first year purchase accounting charges. 
We're proud of these results and I think the strong base performance prepares us to better deal with the uncertainty in our end markets. The extended duration of the uncertainty weighs on the market and both data and messages can be inconsistent and confusing. I will provide our views of our end markets and our customer activities, and then how we expect that to impact our business.
The U.S. coal market is at the epicenter of the market corrections, so let's address that first. The winter that did not come reduced power generation in the U.S. by about 5.5% below last year, which is beyond the decline experienced in 2009. About 65 million tons of annual coal production was taken off-line in the first quarter and the accelerating trend reached over 100 million tons of annual production by April. 
However, coal at utilities has increased over 200 million tons, resulting in a 40 million to  50 million tons of stockpile depletion that will become headwinds in the like [ph] coal production recovery. 
We estimate that up to 40 million tons of the overall reduction as a result of accelerated compliance with the regulations that will require closure of the oldest, unscrubbed coal-fired units. The remaining reduction is driven by a combination of the significant decline in electricity demand and the loss of dispatch to natural gas, as its price remains in the mid-$2 per million BTU range. 
Shale gas joint programs require $4 to $5 gas to return the cost of capital and coal should begin to regain lost tons as gas prices moved above $3. However, natural gas storage is at all-time highs, and this must be worked through before drilling for dry gas increases. This was reflected in the forward strip for natural gas which gets to $4, but not until 2014. 
In the meantime, upside in the U.S. coal market will come from exports and met coal. Upside will also come from increased electricity demand, since most of the unutilized excess generating capacity is in coal-fired units. We expect aftermarket demand from the U.S. underground coal to be reduced by about 12%, in line with production reductions.
Aftermarket orders in the U.S. underground could drop more than that for the next quarter or so, as inventories held at mine site are depleted. Orders for underground original equipment are expected to be depressed until the market stabilizes, which may not be until next year. Then we expect to return to normal replacement cycle for underground equipment, plus upgrades as new technology improves productivity and reduces costs. Although U.S. coal will become a structurally smaller market, it will continue to provide a strong base from which to leverage our investments into the international markets.
International coal markets are dominated by demand from China and India, and imports for both are running well ahead of last year on an annualized basis. Electricity demand in China has slowed from 12% last year to 7%. Although demand for thermal coal has slowed as well, current pricing provides an advantage to imported over domestic coal and imports were increasing, while domestic stockpiles are reaching historically high levels. The import tonnage for April is estimated at 21 million tons, close to the record set last November and up on a run rate basis from the 58 million tons imported in the first quarter. 
With most of China's new production coming from the Western provinces, increased rail transportation costs will keep seaborne coal demand strong and growing. Although China's economy continues to show signs of slowing, the central government has started to take steps to stimulate growth by cutting interest rates and lowering the banks required loan reserve ratio, and further steps in both areas are expected.
The nation will also start, and I quote here, ""a series of key infrastructure projects that are vital to the overall economy and can facilitate growth."" And therefore, we expect China to bottom in the near term and return to higher growth.
Seaborne coal demand is growing at even faster rate in India, which continues to struggle with increased -- excuse me, struggle to increase its domestic coal production. India's largest power producer is increasing imports at a 33% rate over last year. And although just over half of India's power is generated from coal today, almost 85% of the 76 gigawatts of plant capacity increases will be coal fired. 
Global steel production continues at a 6% growth rate over last year and steel production in China has recovered and is running 20% above its low last November. Although steel production is expected to remain flat for the rest of this year, it should provide support for both met coal and iron ore. China steel mills had destock met coal and iron ore, and both raw materials are anecdotally at about a month of supply on hand. Restocking should provide additional support to the steelmaking raw materials. 
In addition, steelmaking in other met coal importing countries, excluding China, is up 12% from a low point late last year. As a result, we believe met coal is in deficit. For example, one of our customers has indicated that met coal demand is running ahead of its annual guidance, and another brought a met coal mine back into production after being idle for only a few weeks. 
Production challenges and project delays will keep copper supply in deficit this year. For example, one of our major Chilean miners starts production down 10% in the first quarter. And this is in line with the general trend of producers routinely missing production targets by 5% to 6%. 
We entered this year expecting our order rate to moderate from the exceptionally strong growth in orders last year. If you remember, our original equipment orders last year were up over 70% and our total orders were up over 40%. And this was because last year had a catch-up factor as customers rush to get equipment booked for projects that were put on hold in 2008 and we've started in 2010. However, with strong momentum from projects underway and a stagnating global economy, our customers no longer have a great sense of urgency to bring new projects forward. 
Although some of the largest diversified mining companies have indicated their slowing CapEx and reevaluating their large greenfield projects, that is not a broad trend. In fact, we continue to see new projects added to our prospect list, but at a slower rate. Customers are focusing their resources on completing the projects actively underway and on brownfield expansions that have lower risk and a shorter time horizon. We expect this condition to continue as our customer see demand -- excuse me, we expect this condition to continue until our customers see demand improvement that will justify acceleration of projects. 
We see the commodity markets of copper, iron ore and met coal to be solid with risk to the upside. Seaborne thermal core had supply surplus that is considered near term, and longer-term view still justifies capacity expansion. The U.S. coal market should stabilize later this year, but has to reduce excess coal stockpiles and deplete high-natural gas storage levels before we can expect meaningful improvement. We expect this to translate into slowing order rates and flattening revenues for the next few quarters with this comparison made to our first half run rate rather than to our second quarter. 
Despite this expectation, we are preparing for a wide range of possible outcomes. In addition to trimming and focusing our cost, the efforts we made over the past several years to streamline our processes and reduce cycle times will allow us to adapt to market conditions faster and more effectively. 
We're also taking steps to increase the alignment of our service and underground businesses to better leverage common processes and overlapping cost structures through an initiative we call, One Joy Global. These are all directed in making us a more efficient business and they will allow us to prepare for slowing market growth, while maintaining key investments in selected R&D programs and in the rollout of our service excellence program. 
We are adjusting this year's guidance for 2 factors: The combination of backlog reduction and the impact of reduced mine volumes on aftermarket orders for U.S. underground coal market will begin to be felt in our second half. Despite earlier expectations, the slowing in the international markets will no longer enable them to fully offset the reductions in the U.S. coal market. That reduces our net revenue expectations for 2012 by about $100 million. This $100 million reduction of revenues will reduce earnings per share for 2012 by $0.18 after some cost mitigation. 
In addition, prior guidance excluded the excess first year purchase accounting charges for IMM. This have now been determined to be $0.17 per share for 2012, of which $0.14 was recorded in our second quarter. The combination of these 2 factors reduces 2012 revenues by $100 million and our top end earnings per share by $0.35. Therefore, our updated guidance for 2012 is for revenues to be between $5.5 billion and $5.7 billion and for earnings for fully diluted share to be between $7.15 and $7.45. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jake for questions."

I think we've got a -- based upon the experience of 2009, we've got a pretty good feel for what to expect in the U.S. coal markets. The downside and upside all  translates into the international markets. And we have customers that are growing a little bit more cautious, they feel they have enough stuff in the pipeline and they have time to ramp up and therefore, waiting to see a little bit more certainty out of the global economies. So downside would occur if we continue to see slowing in the international markets and upside would come from that as well. Right now, though, we continue to see signs and evidence that there is some strength in the international markets. Like I said, steel production is up, and we will go through a restocking phase from met coal and that will create some upside demand there. Iron ore imports look really good. China production cost are exceptionally high. And iron ore, in fact, despite some really high levels of iron ore imports, the stockpiles at the ports in China are starting to come down. So we believe that there is more risk in the international markets to the upside than there is to the downside. I think the variable here is the timing. Is the upside going to be later or is it going to be nearer in? And that's the unknown. But certainly, we believe that the international markets have more upside than downside at this point."

It wasn't projects that were put on hold or indefinite deferral, it was just permitting delays and other kind of things, infrastructure build delays and they were just a little bit behind on the projects. Because those projects are still moving forward, we expect those to become orders in the second half, for example. So we're not seeing this put-on-hold kind of mentality among customers. We have seen that with some of the major diversified mining houses, but those are mega greenfield projects. They -- if you look at the economics, those didn't have overly compelling economics and slowing those things down is different than what we see in most of our other markets. Most of our other customers are continuing with their projects. We don't see any evidence of slowing. And some of the stuff we're hearing from the major diversifieds is a little bit to appease shareholders that they want some returns rather than spending all the money on these mega greenfield projects. And some of that is rhetoric to deal with the increased cost pressures coming from Australia from taxes in different forms and fashion.

And we've had discussions with customers, we see -- we all know in the press that some customers are struggling more than others to sort of get their financial balance sheets in order. But in the meantime, we think there's going to be some deferral of equipment deliveries going into the Central Appalachia. Some of that is stuff that we had in backlog. The uncertainty around all that, which is -- we felt it was better to recognize that now and we would do a risk assessment. It's not necessarily equipment for any one customer, we just looked at customers applications, thermal versus met coal, a lot of different factors. And we believe that, that represents what we believe is the risk we have for U.S. underground. Other markets we test and we just don't have a risk in the other markets. We continue to deliver machines. We don't see any push back and we have a pretty tight contracts, particularly in the international markets.

We -- the roadheader market in China has been a really good market for IMM as one of their core-based markets. But one of our Chinese competitors has been, a new entrant into the market, primarily construction equipment company that's moved into mining and they've been very, very aggressive over the last couple of years. And they've taken market share and they've been aggressive and the way that they've gone to market and structure deals. I think what we're seeing in IMM is more stability than what we're hearing out of the competitor reports. And I think some of that gets back to baselevel performance, the machines at IMM do a great job. They're well recognized. They're like our continuous miners. They're sort of like the standard of the industry. And sometimes, you try other people. You find out that the machine performance is this good and you start to get back to the core equipment that you've always had. And then we believe that that's one of the trends we'll get into right now is that as people -- the mine production in China is slowing and then we expect the coal production in China to grow at somewhere like 1/2 or 2/3 of the rate we've seen historically. We see stockpiles building up right now and at prices below $100 a metric tonne, we're seeing the imported coal continue to have a price advantage. So there is some slowing in the market in China, but we also believe that share issues, particularly around roadheaders, are stabilizing and will provide a more effective base for us to grow back that market for IMM.

We have the same visibility on the international aftermarket as we do on the U.S. I mean, we run cost -- our life cycle management programs in those mines, we're close with customers. What we see out of the international markets that we don't see out of the U.S. is there's more of a tendency to buy in a large amount of parts with some original equipment order. They sort of carry higher levels of mine stocks. And so we get a little bit more lumpiness as a result of that. And in some areas, particularly out of places like China and India, we will get their parts demand for those markets will come in 3 or 4 large orders a year rather than monthly or weekly. So we do get more lumpiness in the international markets. But certainly, as we look at the equipment, a typical shovel will start to go into the first year or 2. Most of the parts that are required are limited because the machine's new. Some of those are covered under warranty. But year 3, we start to see significant parts demand and then the first major rebuild occurs at year 5. So we're getting up to the point where year 3 and year 5 come into play for all the machines we've delivered in 2009 and in '11 for sure. Underground, the rebuild cycle is a little bit quicker, but it's typical to rebuild a minor every couple of years and ensuring machines come in after every panel or sometimes the minor, sometimes a major rebuild. So those will drive higher levels of aftermarket activity, parts and labor in the aftermarket activities, and we have that modeled in. Some of that will come in lumpy form because some of the parts, like I say, are delivered with the projects upfront. Some of it gets lumped by the nature of some of the larger international companies and how that business gets translated in areas like China and India, for example. So more lumpiness in the aftermarket out of international markets and less predictability on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And that's just one of the things we'll have to work with you guys, so I'm giving a little bit more granularity around."

And we -- in our underground business, for example, we booked one longwall order this year, which is quite a bit below where we normally do. And that longwall order was a U.S. longwall, smaller equipment and smaller price point. We do have some things on the table in Australia that are the bigger longwall systems. A lot bigger, a lot more complex and then a lot of redundant -- they'll buy multiple shearing machines and multiple ASCs to facilitate the longwall move. So we see some of that in the pipeline ahead of us. In the second quarter, we didn't have any of that. In the second quarter shovel bookings were the lowest we've seen since probably the early first quarter of 2011. And again, that's the timing of the number of projects and just the timing of how orders come in. So that's why we noted the comparisons of softening orders and flattening revenues, we want to compare that in the first half because we think that's a better base for that comparison in the second quarter. So if you translate that out, the other second half should look a little like the first half. And therefore, that would get us to a book-to-bill of one for the year.

A chunk of that backlog would in fact be scheduled for deliveries outside of this fiscal year, so would not have impacts on the current year revenue. The aftermarket, the $100 million reduction that's baked into the guidance, a big chunk of that really is associated with softness that we had in the guidance that we issued at the end of the first quarter. At that time, we indicated that we expected that the U.S. may have as much as 4% to 6% impact on our business.

And we, in fact, have various tiers of cost reduction initiatives. But some of those initiatives are really just bite -- belt-tightening, where you're eliminating discretionary expenditures. And then they accelerate all the way up, if the markets get extraordinarily soft to the point where we begin to close some of the higher cost facilities and begin to put more volume into our lower cost facilities. The first phase, the belt tightening phase has been underway really for a couple of quarters now.

And in 2008, with outsourcing had gotten to around 35% of our production hours. Today, that number is just a little bit over 30%. But as we did in 2009, pulling that work back in-house, does a significant amount of cost mitigation for us and maintains overhead absorption. So we have that as part of our plans as well.

And if we need to, we can leverage that down, which is a big part of the overall cost reduction plans we have."

If anything, we try to get ahead of that and we try to -- we probably have been a little conservative in the number, making sure that we caught everything that we think is at risk. Now some of that may not be canceled, it hasn't been canceled yet and some of it may not be canceled.

Some of it was, in fact, driven by new manufacturing capacity being brought online. The 35% was what existed in 2008. As you look at our volumes over '09 and '10, our volumes really didn't changed that much. But what we did do is we brought some additional capacity online in Tianjin with some additional capacity for transmissions for the surface business. So that was a natural decline in outsourcing. And then as the business volumes ramped up in 2011, we began to do more outsourcing. And so we're now in a position, somewhat similar to 2008, where that outsourcing variable cost element is up around that 30% level, which gives us an opportunity to allow this cost to flex with any softness in volume that we might see going forward."

We like that because it keeps us from -- it allows us to not have delivery become impediment to market share and booking orders. But it also keeps us from having to deal with escalation and other kind of clauses because we've been locking our supplies over that period of time. So capacity is effectively fully utilized. Right now we don't have a lot of excess capacity. We do a little bit in underground and some machine areas, but it's not very significant. As we look forward, we look for our business to flatten. And we do have some more capacity coming online and in China that will be ready to come online some time early next year. So the capacity utilization, as we look at right now, the excess capacity is going to come out of that additional investment in factory capacity in China rather than declines in the market at this point. So that's where our planning is. We haven't gone into the outsourced that we've just talked about. But we'd be prepared to if we needed to. But right now, we think we can hold things pretty steady. We are moving some things around to get better utilization, for example, removing some machines that would have otherwise been built in Australia. We just don't have the capacity there. So the lead times have extended, we're moving that production back to the U.S. and we're using that to backfill some of the delays we expect out of Central Appalachia. So we're doing a number of things. The net result is we don't see a lot of reduction in capacity utilization with the current outlook that we have."

And right now, what we -- in our discussions with our customers, I think that we've not seen any negatives in the international markets. So we're not -- mine delays that we're seeing are normal stuff, like permitting delays or other kind of things that are fairly normal with major projects. We're not seeing people just starting to get cautious and holding back on their plans. What we do see is a focus on completing what they have in the pipeline. And we do see them looking at brownfield expansions, which are quicker and more predictable. But what we do see slowing down is there are rush to bring the next big greenfield project into the pipeline. And some of that allows them to work within their existing resources, which is more efficient than subcontracting out engineering and they're more cost effective. And so with the view of the global economy right now, the customers feel more comfortable if they have enough stuff in the pipeline at the rate that they're going if they could maintain the pace that they're going. They will find -- they won't overbill projects, they won't get ahead of themselves and they'll be able to do that more cost efficiently because they'll be working mostly within their own internal resources. So there is a more satisfaction that they're going at the right pace, less of a rush to step it up a notch or 2 or less opportunistic, like I need to get my mine on production now so I could take advantage of market opportunities. A lot of that rush and timing issues have sort of worked their way out of the system. So we see a lot of stability in the international markets. We do see upside. Some of the major headlines we get comes from a couple of our major customers. But some of that is fairly large CapEx plans around some really large projects that are multiyear projects. Time horizon to first production is -- we've been talking about one of the Australian  projects now for 4 or 5 years and they're still probably 6 or 7 years from production. So I think there's a lot more concern about those big mega projects. Most of our other customers are continuing with their projects as they have planned, we see new projects coming into the pipeline. They're not mega projects. They're not 4 draglines and 12 shovels. They're like 5 shovels here and there's 3 shovels there. And we continue to see those things come into the pipeline. Certainly longwalls in Australia for underground coal, we see those coming into the pipeline as well. So the smaller, more manageable projects are okay. The brownfield projects are a priority. And things that are underway are in fine shape. We don't see any pressure on those. But we do see the pressures on the big mega greenfield projects. But that hasn't -- those are further out and we've never put those too much on our plans because those have always had timing issues and permitting delays and they're generally off our prospect list and out of the horizon for that anyhow."

Now let's spend a few moments reviewing the second quarter results. As a reminder, operating results include performance of our legacy surface and underground mining equipment business units, combined with the results of the LeTourneau and IMM acquisitions. Both acquisitions contributed favorably to the results for the quarter. Additionally, there is considerably less noise from the acquisition of IMM during the current quarter compared to our first quarter. 
During the second quarter, we increased our ownership of IMM to approximately 99% and expect to settle the remaining outstanding shares during our third quarter. We also anticipate the Hong Kong exchange will approve our request to delist IMM during our third quarter. 
During the second quarter, IMM recorded bookings of $98 million, while recognizing $87 million of revenue and $21 million of operating profit before excess purchase accounting charges. The excess purchase accounting charges related to the amortization of the write-up of acquired inventories and totaled $17 million in the current quarter. We also expect to record an additional and final $5 million of excess purchase accounting charges related to IMM during our third quarter, based on our current acquisition valuation estimates. Despite the economic slowdown in China, the IMM second quarter results were substantially in line with our expectations. 
With regard to LeTourneau, their performance rebounded nicely from the product quality issue and the divested business distractions experienced in our first quarter. LeTourneau recorded bookings of $128 million during the second quarter, while recognizing $133 million of revenue and $26 million of operating profit before excess purchase accounting charges. These charges were related also to the write-up of acquired inventory and backlog, and totaled $6 million. During our third quarter, we expect to record an additional and final $2 million of excess purchase accounting amortization related to the LeTourneau acquisition.
Turning to the legacy surface and underground mining equipment businesses. Strong financial results were tempered by moderation in our bookings for the quarter. Bookings of $1 billion in the current quarter were down 34% from a year ago and below the $1.3 billion recorded last quarter. The decrease in new order bookings was comprised of a 20% decrease for surface mining equipment and a 38% decrease for underground mining equipment.
The 20% decrease in surface equipment bookings in the current quarter was primarily made up of a 42% decrease in original equipment orders, as aftermarket bookings remain flat. Original equipment orders continue to be strong for copper customers in South America and for coal and iron ore customers in Australia, but were more than offset by decreases in original equipment orders in North America, South Africa and Russia. Surface aftermarket orders in the current quarter increased in South America and Australia, but were offset by a decrease in aftermarket bookings in China, India, Russia and South Africa.
The 38% decrease in the second quarter in underground mining equipment bookings was attributable to a 62% decline in original equipment orders and a 12% decrease in aftermarket bookings. The original equipment bookings decline, compared to the second quarter of last year, is attributable to a weak U.S. coal market and high comparables due to a major longwall system order received in Australia in 2011. The decrease in aftermarket orders was due to the reduced underground coal production in the United States, which is a result of a mild winter and low natural gas pricing, and a larger impact due to the unusually high level of service orders received in Australia in the second quarter last year, which were associated with the longwall system orders previously mentioned, and which were not repeated in the current quarter.
The backlog of the legacy businesses was $2.8 billion at the end of the second quarter compared to $3.3 billion at the end of the first quarter. In addition to lower bookings recorded during the quarter, we have removed $119 million in underground equipment backlog scheduled for U.S. market, as we believe there is a reasonable risk of deferral or cancellation of these orders. It is important to note that these orders have not been canceled, but we believe the reduction in backlog to be prudent given current market conditions. Backlog attributable to the IMM and LeTourneau businesses remained at $300 million, the same level as of the end of the first quarter. 
Despite the soft bookings recorded in the second quarter, the company expects the book-to-bill ratio for the 2012 fiscal year to exceed 1.0 for the legacy businesses. Net sales for the legacy businesses increased by 24% in the first quarter, with surface mining equipment shipments up 27%, while underground mining machinery revenue increased 23%. OE shipments of surface equipment increased 57%, while the underground mining equipment -- original equipment increased 43%. 
Aftermarket shipments of OE -- of surface mining equipment increased 12% and shipments of aftermarket underground mining equipment increased 10% compared to the second quarter last year, primarily driven by strong part sales in the current quarter.
Legacy business operating profit of $311 million in the current quarter exceeded last year by $75 million, with both the surface and underground mining equipment units having return-on-sales percentages in excess of 24% and an overall incremental profitability percentage of 29%. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to the increase in net sales.
Income from continuing operations in the current quarter were $2.04 per fully diluted share, compared to $1.52 per share last year. The table included in the press release and on our website provides a summary of the various items which impacted the current quarter. The most significant item, which was new in the current quarter, was the $14.8-million or $0.14-per-share decrease in net income due to the excess purchase accounting amortization associated with IMM previously mentioned. The second quarter also included a $14-million increase in net interest expense compared to last year, due to the financing of the LeTourneau and IMM acquisitions. 
The effective tax rate in the current quarter was 31.1% compared to 29.8% last year. The increase in the effective tax rate is attributable to a nonrecurring tax planning benefit, net of discrete items, realized in the second quarter last year. The full year effective tax rate for this year is expected to be between 30% and 31.5%. 
On a final note, the revised guidance included in the press release includes all of the actual results reported through the second quarter and assumes full year fully diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 108 million. 
Now let me turn the discussion over to Mike Sutherlin."
277517,207005867,315768,"Joy Global, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, May 31, 2012",2012-05-31,"Earnings Calls","Komatsu Mining Corp.","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Mike. And let me add my welcome to those on the call. This quarter extends the pattern of uncertainty in our end markets overshadowing the exceptional performance that we continue to deliver.  It was a record quarter for revenues, margins a",1633,"Yes. Thanks, Mike. And let me add my welcome to those on the call. This quarter extends the pattern of uncertainty in our end markets overshadowing the exceptional performance that we continue to deliver.  
It was a record quarter for revenues, margins and earnings. Our legacy Joy underground and P&H surface businesses delivered exceptional performance by using cycle-time reduction to accelerate machine deliveries, and high-operating leverage translated into record levels of profitability. Both LeTourneau and IMM made strong contributions with their combined margins over 21%, excluding excess first year purchase accounting charges. We're proud of these results, and I think this strong base performance prepares us to better deal with the uncertainty in our end markets.
The extended duration of the uncertainty weighs on the market, and both data and messages can be inconsistent and confusing. I will provide our views of our end markets and our customer activities, and then how we expect that to impact our business.
The U.S. coal market is at the epicenter of the market corrections, so let's address that first. A winter that did not come reduced power generation in the U.S. by about 5.5% below last year, which is beyond the decline experienced in 2009. About 65 million tons of annual coal production was taken off-line in the first quarter and the accelerating trend reached over 100 million tons of annual production by April. 
However, coal at utilities had increased to over 200 million tons, resulting in 40 million to 50 million tons of stockpile depletion that will become headwinds in delayed coal production recovery. We estimate that up to 40 million tons of the overall reduction is a result of accelerated compliance with the regulations that will require closure of the oldest, un-scrubbed coal-fired units. The remaining reduction is driven by a combination of the significant decline in electricity demand and the loss of dispatch to natural gas, as its price remains in the ""mid-$2 per million BTU"" range. 
Shale gas drilling programs require $4 to $5 gas to return the cost of capital and coal should begin to regain lost tons as gas prices move above $3. However, natural gas storage is at all-time highs, and this must be worked through before drilling for dry gas increases. This is reflected in a forward strip for natural gas which gets to $4, but not until 2014. 
In the meantime, upside in the U.S. coal market will come from exports and met coal. Upside will also come from increased electricity demand, since most of the unutilized excess generating capacity is in coal-fired units.
We expect aftermarket demand from the U.S. underground coal to be reduced by about 12%, in line with production reductions. Aftermarket orders in the U.S. underground could drop more than that for the next quarter or so, as inventories held at mine site are depleted. Orders for underground original equipment are expected to be depressed until the market stabilizes, which may not be until next year. Then we expect to return to normal replacement cycle for underground equipment, plus upgrades as new technology improves productivity and reduces costs. Although U.S. coal will become a structurally smaller market, it will continue to provide a strong base from which to leverage our investments into the international markets.
International coal markets are dominated by demand from China and India, and imports for both are running well ahead of last year on an annualized basis. Electricity demand in China has slowed from 12% last year to 7%. Although demand for thermal coal has slowed as well, current pricing provides an advantage to imported over domestic coal, and imports are increasing while domestic stockpiles are reaching historically high levels. The import tonnage for April is estimated at 21 million tons, close to the record set last November and up on a run rate basis from the 58 million tons imported in the first quarter. With most of China's new production coming from the Western provinces, increased rail transportation costs will keep seaborne coal demand strong and growing.
Although China's economy continues to show signs of slowing, the central government has started to take steps to stimulate growth by cutting interest rates and lowering the banks' required loan reserve ratio, and further steps in both areas are expected. The nation will also start, and I quote here, ""a series of key infrastructure projects that are vital to the overall economy and can facilitate growth."" And therefore, we expect China to bottom in the near term and return to higher growth.
Seaborne coal demand is growing at even faster rate in India, which continues to struggle with increased -- excuse me, struggle to increase its domestic coal production. India's largest power producer is increasing imports at a 33% rate over last year. And although just over half of India's power is generated from coal today, almost 85% of the 76 gigawatts of planned capacity increases will be coal fired. 
Global steel production continues at a 6% growth rate over last year, and steel production in China has recovered and is running 20% above its low last November. Although steel production is expected to remain flat for the rest of this year, it should provide support for both met coal and iron ore. China's steel mills had destocked met coal and iron ore, and both raw materials are anecdotally at about a month of supply on hand. Restocking should provide additional support to the steelmaking raw materials. 
In addition, steelmaking in other met coal importing countries, excluding China, is up 12% from a low point late last year. As a result, we believe met coal is in deficit. For example, one of our customers has indicated that met coal demand is running ahead of its annual guidance, and another brought a met coal mine back into production after being idled for only a few weeks. 
Production challenges and project delays will keep copper supply in deficit this year. For example, one of our major Chilean miners saw its production down 10% in the first quarter. And this is in line with the general trend of producers routinely missing production targets by 5% to 6%. 
We entered this year expecting our order rate to moderate from the exceptionally strong growth in orders last year. If you remember, our original equipment orders last year were up over 70% and our total orders were up over 40%. And this was because last year had a catch-up factor as customers rushed to get equipment booked for projects that were put on hold in 2008 and restarted in 2010. However, with strong momentum from projects underway and a stagnating global economy, our customers no longer have a great sense of urgency to bring new projects forward. 
Although some of the largest diversified mining companies have indicated they are slowing CapEx and reevaluating their large greenfield projects, that is not a broad trend. In fact, we continue to see new projects added to our prospect list, but at a slower rate. Customers are focusing their resources on completing the projects actively underway and on brownfield expansions that have lower risk and a shorter time horizon. We expect this condition to continue as our customers see demand -- excuse me, we expect this condition to continue until our customers see demand improvement that will justify acceleration of projects. 
We see the commodity markets of copper, iron ore and met coal to be solid with risk to the upside. Seaborne thermal core had supply surplus that is considered near term, and longer-term view still justifies capacity expansion. The U.S. coal market should stabilize later this year, but has to reduce excess coal stockpiles and deplete high natural gas storage levels before we can expect meaningful improvement. We expect this to translate into slowing order rates and flattening revenues for the next few quarters, with this comparison made to our first half run rate rather than to our second quarter. 
Despite this expectation, we are preparing for a wide range of possible outcomes. In addition to trimming and focusing our cost, the efforts we made over the past several years to streamline our processes and reduce cycle times will allow us to adapt to market conditions faster and more effectively. We're also taking steps to increase the alignment of our surface and underground businesses, to better leverage common processes and overlapping cost structures through an initiative we call One Joy Global. These are all directed in making us a more efficient business and they will allow us to prepare for slowing market growth, while maintaining key investments in selected R&D programs and in the rollout of our service excellence program. 
We are adjusting this year's guidance for 2 factors: the combination of backlog reduction and the impact of reduced mine volumes on aftermarket orders for U.S. underground coal market will begin to be felt in our second half. Despite earlier expectations, the slowing in the international markets will no longer enable them to fully offset the reductions in the U.S. coal market. That reduces our net revenue expectations for 2012 by about $100 million. This $100-million reduction in revenues will reduce earnings per share for 2012 by $0.18 after some cost mitigation. 
In addition, prior guidance excluded the excess first year purchase accounting charges for IMM. These have now been determined to be $0.17 per share for 2012, of which $0.14 was recorded in our second quarter. The combination of these 2 factors reduces 2012 revenues by $100 million and our top-end earnings per share by $0.35. Therefore, our updated guidance for 2012 is for revenues to be between $5.5 billion and $5.7 billion and for earnings for fully diluted share to be between $7.15 and $7.45. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jake for questions."

The downside and upside all translates into the international markets. And we have customers that are growing a little bit more cautious. They feel they have enough stuff in the pipeline and they have time to ramp up and therefore, waiting to see a little bit more certainty out of the global economy. So downside would occur if we continue to see slowing in the international markets, and upside would come from that as well. Right now, though, we continue to see signs and evidence that there is some strength in the international markets. Like I said, steel production is up, and we will go through a restocking phase for met coal and that will create some upside demand there. Iron ore imports look really good. China production costs are exceptionally high. And iron ore -- in fact, despite some really high levels of iron ore imports, the stockpiles at the ports in China are starting to come down. So we believe that there is more risk in the international markets to the upside than there is to the downside. I think the variable here is the timing. Is the upside going to be later? Or is it going to be nearer in? And that's the unknown. But certainly, we believe that the international markets have more upside than downside at this point."

The international markets tend to be lumpier with original equipment demand just on the timing of projects. We saw that in our second quarter order rate. It wasn't projects that were put on hold or indefinite deferral. It was just permitting delays and other kind of things, infrastructure build delays, and they were just a little bit behind on the project. They're still -- the projects are still moving forward. We expect those to become orders in the second half, for example. So we're not seeing this put-on-hold kind of mentality among customers. We have seen that with some of the major diversified mining houses, but those are mega-greenfield projects. They -- if you look at the economics, those didn't have overly compelling economics and slowing those things down is different than what we see in most of our other markets. Most of our other customers are continuing with their projects. We don't see any evidence of slowing. And some of the stuff we're hearing from the major diversifieds is a little bit to appease shareholders, that they want some returns rather than spending all the money on these mega-greenfield projects. And some of that is rhetoric to deal with the increased cost pressures coming from Australia from taxes in different forms and fashion. So for us, that looks more like an exception to the norm than the trend in the international markets."

The machines at IMM do a great job. They're well recognized. They're like -- our continuous miners, they're sort of like the standard of the industry. And sometimes, you try other people. You find out that the machine performance is this good and you sort of get back to the core equipment that you've always had. And then we believe that, that's one of the trends we'll get into right now, is that as people -- the mine production in China is slowing. I mean, we expect coal production in China to grow at somewhere like half or 2/3 of the rate we've seen historically. We see stockpiles building up right now, and at prices below $100 a metric tonne, we're seeing the imported coal continue to have a price advantage. So there is some slowing in the market in China, but we also believe that share issues, particularly around roadheaders, are stabilizing and will provide a more effective base for us to grow back that market for IMM.

What we see out of the international markets that we don't see out of the U.S. is there's more of a tendency to buy a large amount of parts with some original equipment order. They sort of carry higher levels of mine stocks, and so we get a little bit more lumpiness as a result of that. And in some areas, particularly out of places like China and India, we will get their -- parts demand for those markets will come in 3 or 4 large orders a year rather than monthly or weekly. So we do get more lumpiness in the international markets. But certainly, as we look at the equipment, a typical shovel will start to go into the first year or 2. Most of the parts that are required are limited because the machine's new. Some of those are covered under warranty. But year 3, we start to see significant parts demand and then the first major rebuild occurs at year 5. So we're getting up to the point where year 3 and year 5 come into play for the machines we've delivered in 2009 and '10 and '11 for sure. Underground, the rebuild cycle is a little bit quicker, but it's typical to rebuild a minor every couple of years and the shearing machines come in after every panel for sometimes a minor, sometimes a major rebuild. So those will drive higher levels of aftermarket activity, parts and labor in the aftermarket activities, and we have that modeled in. Some of that will come in lumpy form because some of the parts, like I say, are delivered with the projects upfront. Some of it gets lumped by the nature of some of the larger international companies and how that business gets translated in areas like China and India, for example. So more lumpiness in the aftermarket out of the international markets and less predictability on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And that's just one of the things we'll have to work with you guys on, getting you a little bit more granularity around."

And we -- in our underground business, for example, we booked one longwall order this year, which is quite a bit below where we normally do. And that longwall order was a U.S. longwall, smaller equipment and smaller price point. We do have some things on the table in Australia that are the bigger longwall systems. A lot bigger, a lot more complex and then a lot of redundant -- they'll buy multiple shearing machines and multiple AFCs to facilitate the longwall move. So we see some of that in the pipeline ahead of us. In the second quarter, we didn't have any of that. In the second quarter, shovel bookings were the lowest we've seen since probably the early first quarter of 2011. And again, that's the timing of the number of projects and just the timing of how orders come in. So that's why we noted the comparisons of softening orders and flattening revenues. We wanted to compare that to the first half because we think that's a better base for that comparison than the second quarter. So if you translate that out, yes, the second half should look a little like the first half. And therefore, that would get us to a book-to-bill of 1 for the year. And if you translate out the second quarter, you're not going to get there. And so there is a definite inference in that."

We explained it to our customers, we explained why we're going it and they accepted that. So we've been pretty disciplined about keeping price -- positive price realization in our equipment. Having said that, in an up market, you have the ability to get a little bit above neutral on positive price realization. In a soft market, you're going to -- those increments are going to get squeezed. But we don't see any significant reduction in margins. We think that the margins will hold. They may not see strong margin growth year-over-year, but we think -- we definitely plan the margins to hold. And when you look at margins and backlog, when you look at margins and the quotations, and we continue to compare those and we want each one of those increments to be positive, sometimes by a small number, sometimes by a bigger number.

A chunk of that backlog would in fact be scheduled for deliveries outside of this fiscal year, so would not have impacts on the current year revenue. The aftermarket, the $100-million reduction that's baked into the guidance, a big chunk of that really is associated with softness that we had in the guidance that we issued at the end of the first quarter. At that time, we indicated that we expected that the U.S. may have as much as 4% to 6% impact on our business. But at that point in time, we felt that, that softness would in fact be mitigated by strength outside of the U.S. What we're seeing now is that a portion of that softness will still be mitigated by activity levels we're seeing outside of the U.S., but won't be able to offset all of it.

As we've talked, really, down through the years, when we first started talking about it back in really the fourth quarter of 2008, we consistently worked through scenario planning, where each of the businesses are taking a look at cost structures, taking a look at various scenarios of volume levels. And we, in fact, have various tiers of cost reduction initiatives. Some of those initiatives are really just bite -- belt-tightening, where you're eliminating discretionary expenditures. And then they accelerate all the way up, if the markets get extraordinarily soft, to the point where we begin to close some of the higher-cost facilities and begin to more -- put more volume into our lower-cost facilities. The first phase, the belt-tightening phase, has been underway really for a couple of quarters now. But at same time, what we want to make sure of is that we don't take cost and resources away from those projects that really are going to be driving our future.

And in 2008, we'd -- outsourcing had gotten to around 35% of our production hours. Today, that number is just a little bit over 30%. But as we did in 2009, pulling that work back in-house does a significant amount of cost mitigation for us and maintains overhead absorption. So we have that as part of our plans as well. So if we have to -- we want to maintain our network of outsource suppliers that we use. But we did leverage that down in 2009.

For example, shovels are still booking out in that 12-month range. We like that because it keeps us from -- it allows us to not have delivery become an impediment to market share and booking orders. But it also keeps us from having to deal with escalation and other kind of clauses because we can lock in our supplies over that period of time. So capacity is effectively fully utilized right now. We don't have a lot of excess capacity. We do a little bit in underground and some machine areas, but it's not very significant. As we look forward, we look for our business to flatten. And we do have some more capacity coming online in China that will be ready to come online sometime early next year. So the capacity utilization, as we look at right now, the excess capacity is going to come out of that additional investment in factory capacity in China rather than declines to the market at this point. So that's where our planning is. We haven't gone into the outsourced that we've just talked about. But we'd be prepared to if we needed to. For right now, we think we can hold things pretty steady. We are moving some things around to get better utilization. For example, we're moving some machines that would have otherwise been built in Australia. We just don't have the capacity there. So the lead times have extended, we're moving that production back to the U.S. and we're using that to backfill some of the delays we expect out of Central Appalachia.

And right now, what we -- in our discussions with our customers, I think that we've not seen any negatives in the international markets. So we're not -- mine delays that we're seeing are normal stuff, like permitting delays or other kind of things that are fairly normal with major projects. We're not seeing people just starting to get cautious and pulling back on their plans. What we do see is a focus on completing what they have in the pipeline. And we do see them looking at brownfield expansions, which are quicker and more predictable. But what we do see slowing down is their rush to bring the next big greenfield project into the pipeline. And some of that allows them to work within their existing resources, which is more efficient than subcontracting out engineering and more cost effective. And so with the view of the global economy right now, our customers feel more comfortable that they have enough stuff in the pipeline, at the rate that they're going, that they could maintain the pace that they're going, they'll be fine. They won't overbill projects, they won't get ahead of themselves and they'll be able to do that more cost efficiently because they'll be working mostly within their own internal resources. So there is more satisfaction that they're going at the right pace; less of a rush to step it up a notch or 2; less opportunistic, like I need to get my mine on production now so I could take advantage of market opportunities. A lot of that rush and timing issues have sort of worked their way out of the system. So we see a lot of stability in the international markets. We do see upside. Some of the major headlines we get comes from a couple of our major customers. But some of that is fairly large CapEx plans around some really large projects that are multiyear projects. Time horizon to first production is -- we've been talking about one of the Australian projects now for 4 or 5 years and it's still probably 6 or 7 years from production. So I think there's a lot more concern about those big mega-projects. Most of our other customers are continuing with the projects as they have planned. We see new projects coming into the pipeline. They're not mega-projects. They're not 4 draglines and 12 shovels. They're like 5 shovels here and there are 3 shovels there. And we continue to see those things come into the pipeline. Certainly longwalls in Australia for underground coal, we see those coming into the pipeline as well. So the smaller, more manageable projects are okay. The brownfield projects are a priority. And things that are underway are in fine shape. We don't see any pressure on those. But we do see the pressures on the big mega-greenfield projects. But that hasn't -- those are further out and we've never put those too much in our plans because those have always had timing issues and permitting delays, and so they're generally off our prospect list and out of the horizon for that anyhow."

Mike Sutherlin will then provide an overview of our operations and our market outlook. After Mike's comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
During the call today, we will be making forward-looking statements. These statements should be considered along with the various risk factors detailed in our press release and other SEC filings. We encourage you to read and become familiar with these risk factors.
We may also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures, which we believe are important to understanding our business. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP metrics to GAAP, as well as for other investor information, we refer you to our website at www.joyglobal.com.
Now let's spend a few moments reviewing the second quarter results. As a reminder, operating results include performance of our legacy surface and underground mining equipment business units, combined with the results of the LeTourneau and IMM acquisitions. Both acquisitions contributed favorably to the results for the quarter. Additionally, there is considerably less noise from the acquisition of IMM during the current quarter compared to our first quarter. 
During the second quarter, we increased our ownership of IMM to approximately 99% and expect to settle the remaining outstanding shares during our third quarter. We also anticipate the Hong Kong exchange will approve our request to delist IMM during our third quarter. 
During the second quarter, IMM recorded bookings of $98 million, while recognizing $87 million of revenue and $21 million of operating profit before excess purchase accounting charges. The excess purchase accounting charges related to the amortization of the write-up of acquired inventories and totaled $17 million in the current quarter. We also expect to record an additional and final $5 million of excess purchase accounting charges related to IMM during our third quarter, based on our current acquisition valuation estimates. Despite the economic slowdown in China, the IMM second quarter results were substantially in line with our expectations. 
With regard to LeTourneau, their performance rebounded nicely from the product quality issue and the divested business distractions experienced in our first quarter. LeTourneau recorded bookings of $128 million during the second quarter, while recognizing $133 million of revenue and $26 million of operating profit before excess purchase accounting charges. These charges were related also to the write-up of acquired inventory and backlog, and totaled $6 million. During our third quarter, we expect to record an additional and final $2 million of excess purchase accounting amortization related to the LeTourneau acquisition.
Turning to the legacy surface and underground mining equipment businesses. Strong financial results were tempered by moderation in our bookings for the quarter. Bookings of $1 billion in the current quarter were down 34% from a year ago and below the $1.3 billion recorded last quarter. The decrease in new order bookings was comprised of a 20% decrease for surface mining equipment and a 38% decrease for underground mining equipment.
The 20% decrease in surface equipment bookings in the current quarter was primarily made up of a 42% decrease in original equipment orders, as aftermarket bookings remain flat. Original equipment orders continue to be strong for copper customers in South America and for coal and iron ore customers in Australia, but were more than offset by decreases in original equipment orders in North America, South Africa and Russia. Surface aftermarket orders in the current quarter increased in South America and Australia, but were offset by a decrease in aftermarket bookings in China, India, Russia and South Africa.
The 38% decrease in the second quarter in underground mining equipment bookings was attributable to a 62% decline in original equipment orders and a 12% decrease in aftermarket bookings. The original equipment bookings decline, compared to the second quarter of last year, is attributable to a weak U.S. coal market and high comparables due to a major longwall system order received in Australia in 2011. The decrease in aftermarket orders was due to the reduced underground coal production in the United States, which is a result of a mild winter and low natural gas pricing, and a larger impact due to the unusually high level of service orders received in Australia in the second quarter last year, which were associated with the longwall system orders previously mentioned, and which were not repeated in the current quarter.
The backlog of the legacy businesses was $2.8 billion at the end of the second quarter compared to $3.3 billion at the end of the first quarter. In addition to lower bookings recorded during the quarter, we have removed $119 million in underground equipment backlog scheduled for U.S. market, as we believe there is a reasonable risk of deferral or cancellation of these orders. It is important to note that these orders have not been canceled, but we believe the reduction in backlog to be prudent given current market conditions. Backlog attributable to the IMM and LeTourneau businesses remained at $300 million, the same level as of the end of the first quarter. 
Despite the soft bookings recorded in the second quarter, the company expects the book-to-bill ratio for the 2012 fiscal year to exceed 1.0 for the legacy businesses. Net sales for the legacy businesses increased by 24% in the first quarter, with surface mining equipment shipments up 27%, while underground mining machinery revenue increased 23%. OE shipments of surface equipment increased 57%, while the underground mining equipment -- original equipment increased 43%. 
Aftermarket shipments of OE -- of surface mining equipment increased 12% and shipments of aftermarket underground mining equipment increased 10% compared to the second quarter last year, primarily driven by strong part sales in the current quarter.
Legacy business operating profit of $311 million in the current quarter exceeded last year by $75 million, with both the surface and underground mining equipment units having return-on-sales percentages in excess of 24% and an overall incremental profitability percentage of 29%. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to the increase in net sales.
Income from continuing operations in the current quarter were $2.04 per fully diluted share, compared to $1.52 per share last year. The table included in the press release and on our website provides a summary of the various items which impacted the current quarter. The most significant item, which was new in the current quarter, was the $14.8-million or $0.14-per-share decrease in net income due to the excess purchase accounting amortization associated with IMM previously mentioned. The second quarter also included a $14-million increase in net interest expense compared to last year, due to the financing of the LeTourneau and IMM acquisitions. 
The effective tax rate in the current quarter was 31.1% compared to 29.8% last year. The increase in the effective tax rate is attributable to a nonrecurring tax planning benefit, net of discrete items, realized in the second quarter last year. The full year effective tax rate for this year is expected to be between 30% and 31.5%. 
On a final note, the revised guidance included in the press release includes all of the actual results reported through the second quarter and assumes full year fully diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 108 million. 
Now let me turn the discussion over to Mike Sutherlin."
277517,207005867,324804,"Joy Global, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, May 31, 2012",2012-05-31,"Earnings Calls","Komatsu Mining Corp.","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Mike. And let me add my welcome to those on the call. This quarter extends the pattern of uncertainty in our end markets overshadowing the exceptional performance that we continued to deliver.  It was a record quarter for revenues, margins",1635,"Yes. Thanks, Mike. And let me add my welcome to those on the call. This quarter extends the pattern of uncertainty in our end markets overshadowing the exceptional performance that we continued to deliver.  
It was a record quarter for revenues, margins and earnings. Our legacy Joy underground and P&H surface businesses delivered exceptional performance by using cycle-time reduction to accelerate machine deliveries and high operating leverage translated into record levels of profitability. Both LeTourneau and IMM made strong contributions with their combined margins over 21%, excluding excess per share purchase accounting charges. We're proud of these results, and I think this strong base performance prepares us to better deal with the uncertainty in our end markets.
The extended duration of the uncertainty weighs on the market, and both data and messages can be inconsistent and confusing. I will provide our views of our end markets and our customer activities, and then how we expect that to impact our business.
The U.S. coal market is at the epicenter of the market correction, so let's address that first. A winter that did not come reduced power generation in the U.S. by about 5.5% below last year, which is beyond the decline experienced in 2009. About 65 million tons of annual coal production was taken off-line in the first quarter and the accelerating trend reached over 100 million tons of annual production by April. 
However, coal at utilities had increased to over 200 million tons, resulting in 40 million to 50 million tons of stockpile depletion that will become headwinds and delay coal production recovery. We estimate that up to 40 million tons of the overall reduction is a result of accelerated compliance with the regulations that will require closure of the oldest, un-scrubbed coal-fired units. The remaining reduction is driven by a combination of the significant decline in electricity demand and the loss of dispatch to natural gas, as its price remains in the mid-$2 per million BTU range.
Shale gas drilling programs require $4 to $5 gas to return the cost of capital and coal should begin to regain lost tons as gas prices move above $3. However, natural gas storage is at all-time highs, and this must be worked through before drilling for dry gas increases. This is reflected in a forward strip for natural gas which gets to $4, but not until 2014. 
In the meantime, upside in the U.S. coal market will come from exports and met coal. Upside will also come from increased electricity demand, since most of the unutilized excess generating capacity is in coal-fired units.
We expect aftermarket demand from the U.S. underground coal to be reduced by about 12%, in line with production reductions. Aftermarket orders in the U.S. underground could drop more than that for the next quarter or so, as inventories held at mine site are depleted. Orders for underground original equipment are expected to be depressed until the market stabilizes, which may not be until next year. Then we expect to return to normal replacement cycle for underground equipment, plus upgrades as new technology improves productivity and reduces costs. Although U.S. coal will become a structurally smaller market, it will continue to provide a strong base from which to leverage our investments into the international markets.
The international coal markets are dominated by demand from China and India, and imports for both are running well ahead of last year on an annualized basis. Electricity demand in China has slowed from 12% last year to 7%. Although demand for thermal coal has slowed as well, current pricing provides an advantage to imported over domestic coal, and imports are increasing while domestic stockpiles are reaching historically high levels. The import tonnage for April is estimated at 21 million tons, close to the record set last November and up on a run rate basis from the 58 million tons imported in the first quarter. With most of China's new production coming from the Western provinces, increased rail transportation cost will keep seaborne coal demand strong and growing.
Although China's economy continues to show signs of slowing, the central government has started to take steps to stimulate growth by cutting interest rates and lowering the banks' required loan reserve ratio, and further steps in both areas are expected. The nation will also start, and I quote here, ""a series of key infrastructure projects that are vital to the overall economy and can facilitate growth."" And therefore, we expect China to bottom in the near term and return to higher growth.
Seaborne coal demand is growing at even faster rate in India, which continues to struggle with increased -- excuse me, struggle to increase its domestic coal production. India's largest power producer is increasing imports at a 33% rate over last year. And although just over half of India's power is generated from coal today, almost 85% of the 76 gigawatts of planned capacity increases will be coal fired. 
Global steel production continues at a 6% growth rate over last year, and steel production in China has recovered and is running 20% above its low last November. Although steel production is expected to remain flat for the rest of this year, it should provide support for both met coal and iron ore. China's steel mills had destocked met coal and iron ore, and both raw materials are anecdotally at about a month of supply on hand. Restocking should provide additional support to the steelmaking raw materials. 
In addition, steelmaking in other met coal importing countries, excluding China, is up 12% from a low point late last year. As a result, we believe met coal is in deficit. For example, one of our customers has indicated that met coal demand is running ahead of its annual guidance, and another brought a met coal mine back into production after being idle for only a few weeks. 
Production challenges and project delays will keep copper supply in deficit this year. For example, one of our major Chilean miners saw its production down 10% in the first quarter. And this is in line with the general trend of producers routinely missing production targets by 5% to 6%. 
We entered this year expecting our order rate to moderate from the exceptionally strong growth in orders last year. If you remember, our original equipment orders last year were up over 70% and our total orders were up over 40%. And this was because last year had a catch-up factor as customers rushed to get equipment booked for projects that were put on hold in 2008 and restarted in 2010. However, with strong momentum from projects underway and a stagnating global economy, our customers no longer have a great sense of urgency to bring new projects forward. 
Although some of the largest diversified mining companies have indicated they are slowing CapEx and reevaluating their large greenfield projects, that is not a broad trend. In fact, we continue to see new projects added to our prospect list, but at a slower rate. Customers are focusing their resources on completing the projects actively underway and on brownfield expansions that have lower risk and a shorter time horizon. We expect this condition to continue as our customers see demand -- excuse me, we expect this condition to continue until our customers see demand improvement that will justify acceleration of projects. 
We see the commodity markets of copper, iron ore and met coal to be solid with risk to the upside. Seaborne thermal core had supply surplus that is considered near term, and longer-term view still justifies capacity expansion. The U.S. coal market should stabilize later this year, but has to reduce excess coal stockpiles and deplete high natural gas storage levels before we can expect meaningful improvement. We expect this to translate into slowing order rates and flattening revenues for the next few quarters, with this comparison made to our first half run rate rather than to our second quarter. 
Despite this expectation, we are preparing for a wide range of possible outcomes. In addition to trimming and focusing our cost, the efforts we made over the past several years to streamline our processes and reduce cycle times will allow us to adapt to market conditions faster and more effectively. We're also taking steps to increase the alignment of our surface and underground businesses, to better leverage common processes and overlapping cost structures through an initiative we call One Joy Global. These are all directed in making us a more efficient business and they will allow us to prepare for slowing market growth, while maintaining key investments in selected R&D programs and in the rollout of our service excellence program. 
We are adjusting this year's guidance for 2 factors: the combination of backlog reduction and the impact of reduced mine volumes on aftermarket orders for U.S. underground coal market will begin to be felt in our second half. Despite earlier expectations, the slowing in the international markets will no longer enable them to fully offset the reductions in the U.S. coal market. That reduces our net revenue expectations for 2012 by about $100 million. This $100-million reduction in revenues will reduce earnings per share for 2012 by $0.18 after some cost mitigation. 
In addition, prior guidance excluded the excess first year purchase accounting charges for IMM. These have now been determined to be $0.17 per share for 2012, of which $0.14 was recorded in our second quarter. The combination of these 2 factors reduces 2012 revenues by $100 million and our top-end earnings per share by $0.35.

The downside and upside all translates into the international markets. And we have customers that are growing a little bit more cautious. They feel they have enough stuff in the pipeline and they have time to ramp up and therefore, waiting to see a little bit more certainty out of the global economy. So downside would occur if we continue to see slowing in the international markets, and upside would come from that as well. Right now, though, we continue to see signs and evidence that there is some strength in the international markets. Like I said, steel production is up, and we will go through a restocking phase for met coal and that will create some upside demand there. Iron ore imports look really good. China production costs are exceptionally high. And iron ore -- in fact, despite some really high levels of iron ore imports, the stockpiles at the ports in China are starting to come down. So we believe that there is more risk in the international markets to the upside than there is to the downside. I think the variable here is the timing. Is the upside going to be later? Or is it going to be nearer in? And that's the unknown. But certainly, we believe that the international markets have more upside than downside at this point."

It was just permitting delays and other kind of things, infrastructure build delays, and they were just a little bit behind on the project. They're still -- the projects are still moving forward. We expect those to become orders in the second half, for example. So we're not seeing this put-on-hold kind of mentality among customers. We have seen that with some of the major diversified mining houses, but those are mega-greenfield projects. They -- if you look at the economics, those didn't have overly compelling economics and slowing those things down is different than what we see in most of our other markets. Most of our other customers are continuing with their projects. We don't see any evidence of slowing. And some of the stuff we're hearing from the major diversifieds is a little bit to appease shareholders, that they want some returns rather than spending all the money on these mega-greenfield projects. And some of that is rhetoric to deal with the increased cost pressures coming from Australia from taxes in different forms and fashion. So for us, that looks more like an exception to the norm than the trend in the international markets."

And we've had discussions with customers. We see -- we all know in the press that some customers are struggling more than others to sort of get their financial balance sheets in order. But in the meantime, we think there's going to be some deferral of equipment deliveries going into Central Appalachia. Some of that is stuff that we had in backlog. The uncertainty around all that, which is -- we felt it was better to recognize that now and we would do a risk assessment. It's not necessarily equipment for any one customer. We just looked at customers' applications, thermal versus met coal, a lot of different factors. And we believe that, that represents what we believe is the risk we have for U.S. underground.

But one of our Chinese competitors has been -- a new entrant into the market, primarily a construction equipment company that's moved into mining, and they've been very, very aggressive over the last couple of years. And they've taken market share and they've been aggressive in the way that they've gone to market and structured deals. I think what we're seeing in IMM is more stability than what we're hearing out of the competitor reports. And I think some of that gets back to base level performance. The machines at IMM do a great job. They're well recognized. They're like -- our continuous miners, they're sort of like the standard of the industry. And sometimes, you try other people. You find out that the machine performance is this good and you sort of get back to the core equipment that you've always had. And then we believe that, that's one of the trends we'll get into right now, is that as people -- the mine production in China is slowing. I mean, we expect coal production in China to grow at somewhere like half or 2/3 of the rate we've seen historically. We see stockpiles building up right now, and at prices below $100 a metric tonne, we're seeing the imported coal continue to have price advantage. So there is some slowing in the market in China, but we also believe that share issues, particularly around roadheaders, are stabilizing and will provide a more effective base for us to grow back that market for IMM. So a lot of things are moving there, but we're not seeing the same issues at IMM that we hear from other competitors.

We have the same visibility on the international aftermarket as we do on the U.S. I mean, we run cost -- or life-cycle management programs in those mines. We're close with customers. What we see out of the international markets that we don't see out of the U.S. is there's more of a tendency to buy a large amount of parts with some original equipment order. They sort of carry higher levels of mine stocks, and so we get a little bit more lumpiness as a result of that. And in some areas, particularly out of places like China and India, we'll get their -- parts demand for those markets will come in 3 or 4 large orders a year rather than monthly or weekly. So we do get more lumpiness in the international markets. But certainly, as we look at the equipment, a typical shovel will start to go into the first year or 2. Most of the parts that are required are limited because the machine's new. Some of those are covered under warranty. But by year 3, we start to see significant parts demand and then the first major rebuild occurs at year 5. So we're getting up to the point where year 3 and year 5 come into play for the machines we've delivered in 2009 and '10 and '11 for sure. Underground, the rebuild cycle is a little bit quicker, but it's typical to rebuild a minor every couple years and the shearing machines come in after every panel for sometimes a minor, sometimes a major rebuild. So those will drive higher levels of aftermarket activity, parts and labor in the aftermarket activities, and we have that modeled in. Some of that will come in lumpy form because some of the parts, like I say, are delivered with the projects upfront. Some of it gets lumped by the nature of some of the larger international companies and how that business gets translated in areas like China and India, for example. So more lumpiness in the aftermarket out of the international markets and less predictability on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And that's just one of the things we'll have to work with you guys on, getting you a little bit more granularity around."

And we -- in our underground business, for example, we booked one longwall order this year, which is quite a bit below where we normally do. And that longwall order was a U.S. longwall, smaller equipment and smaller price point. We do have some things on the table in Australia that are the bigger longwall systems. A lot bigger, a lot more complex and then a lot of redundant -- they'll buy multiple shearing machines and multiple AFCs to facilitate the longwall move. So we see some of that in the pipeline ahead of us. The second quarter didn't have any of that. In the second quarter, shovel bookings were the lowest we've seen since probably the early first quarter of 2011. And again, that's the timing of the number of projects and just the timing of how orders come in. So that's why we noted the comparisons of softening orders and flattening revenues. We wanted to compare that to the first half because we think that's a better base for that comparison than the second quarter. So if you translate that out, yes, the second half should look a little like the first half. And therefore, that would get us to a book-to-bill of 1 for the year.

It's -- in fact, I think you partially alluded to it. What the adjustment to the backlog that we were referencing, the $119 million, about $100 million of that was in fact associated with original equipment shipments, with about $18 million associated with aftermarket, really complete machine refurbishment. A chunk of that backlog would in fact be scheduled for deliveries outside of this fiscal year, so would not have impacts on the current year revenue. The aftermarket, the $100-million reduction that's baked into the guidance, a big chunk of that really is associated with softness that we had in the guidance that we issued at the end of the first quarter. At that time, we indicated that we expected that the U.S. may have as much as 4% to 6% impact on our business. But at that point in time, we felt that, that softness would in fact be mitigated by strength outside of the U.S. What we're seeing now is that a portion of that softness will still be mitigated by activity levels we're seeing outside of the U.S., but won't be able to offset all of it. And that's the reason for the additional guidance reduction of the $100 million."

Yes, we have. As we've talked, really, down through the years, when we first started talking about it back in really the fourth quarter of 2008, we consistently worked through scenario planning, where each of the businesses are taking a look at cost structures, taking a look at various scenarios of volume levels. And we, in fact, have various tiers of cost reduction initiatives. Some of those initiatives are really just bite -- belt-tightening, where you're eliminating discretionary expenditures. And then they accelerate all the way up, if the markets get extraordinarily soft, to the point where we begin to close some of the higher-cost facilities and begin to more -- put more volume into our lower-cost facilities. The first phase, the belt-tightening phase, has been underway really for a couple of quarters now. But at same time, what we want to make sure of is that we don't take cost and resources away from those projects that really are going to be driving our future. So those projects associated with our service excellence initiatives, those projects that are associated with our new product development, those in fact are sacred. So we will, in fact, find additional cost in order to maintain our spending levels for those activities. But to answer your question -- that was probably more information than you were looking for, but to answer your question, we have begun the cost reduction initiative.

We do expect the savings to cover the cost of the things we'll do in the second half of the year. And I think the other thing to note is that we, as the cycle matures, we did increase the amount of outsourcing we do, particularly around structural fabrications, which tend to be more skewed to the cycle, less replacement demand for those. And in 2008, we'd -- outsourcing had gotten to around 35% of our production hours. Today, that number is just a little bit over 30%. But as we did in 2009, pulling that work back in-house does a significant amount of cost mitigation for us and maintains overhead absorption. So we have that as part of our plans as well. So if we have to -- we want to maintain our network of outsource suppliers that we use. But we did leverage that down in 2009. And if we need to, we can leverage that down, which is a big part of the overall cost reduction plans we have."

But what we did do is we brought some additional capacity online in Tianjin with some additional capacity for transmissions for the surface business. So that was a natural decline in outsourcing. And then as the business volumes ramped up in 2011, we began to do more outsourcing. And so we're now in a position, somewhat similar to 2008, where that outsourcing variable-cost element is up around that 30% level, which gives us an opportunity to allow those costs to flex with any softness in volume that we might see going forward."

For example, shovels are still booking out in that 12-month range. We like that because it keeps us from -- it allows us to not have delivery become an impediment to market share and booking orders. But it also keeps us from having to deal with escalation and other kind of clauses because we can lock in our supplies over that period of time. So capacity is effectively fully utilized right now. We don't have a lot of excess capacity. We do a little bit in underground and some machine areas, but it's not very significant. As we look forward, we look for our business to flatten. And we do have some more capacity coming online in China that will be ready to come online sometime early next year. So the capacity utilization, as we look at right now, the excess capacity is going to come out of that additional investment in factory capacity in China rather than declines to the market at this point. So that's where our planning is. We haven't gone into the outsourced that we've just talked about. But we'd be prepared to if we needed to. For right now, we think we can hold things pretty steady. We are moving some things around to get better utilization. For example, we're moving some machines that would have otherwise been built in Australia. We just don't have the capacity there. So the lead times have extended, we're moving that production back to the U.S. and we're using that to backfill some of the delays we expect out of Central Appalachia. So we're doing a number of things. The net result is we don't see a lot of reduction in capacity utilization with the current outlook that we have."

And right now, what we -- in our discussions with our customers, I think that we've not seen any negatives in the international markets. So we're not -- mine delays that we're seeing are normal stuff, like permitting delays or other kind of things that are fairly normal with major projects. We're not seeing people just starting to get cautious and pulling back on their plans. What we do see is a focus on completing what they have in the pipeline. And we do see them looking at brownfield expansions, which are quicker and more predictable. But what we do see slowing down is their rush to bring the next big greenfield project into the pipeline. And some of that allows them to work within their existing resources, which is more efficient than subcontracting out engineering and more cost effective. And so with the view of the global economy right now, our customers feel more comfortable that they have enough stuff in the pipeline, at the rate that they're going, that they could maintain the pace that they're going, they'll be fine. They won't overbill projects, they won't get ahead of themselves and they'll be able to do that more cost efficiently because they'll be working mostly within their own internal resources. So there is more satisfaction that they're going at the right pace; less of a rush to step it up a notch or 2; less opportunistic, like I need to get my mine on production now so I could take advantage of market opportunities. A lot of that rush and timing issues have sort of worked their way out of the system. So we see a lot of stability in the international markets. We do see upside. Some of the major headlines we get comes from a couple of our major customers. But some of that is fairly large CapEx plans around some really large projects that are multiyear projects. Time horizon to first production is -- we've been talking about one of the Australian projects now for 4 or 5 years and it's still probably 6 or 7 years from production. So I think there's a lot more concern about those big mega-projects. Most of our other customers are continuing with the projects as they have planned. We see new projects coming into the pipeline. They're not mega-projects. They're not 4 draglines and 12 shovels. They're like 5 shovels here and there are 3 shovels there. And we continue to see those things come into the pipeline. Certainly longwalls in Australia for underground coal, we see those coming into the pipeline as well. So the smaller, more manageable projects are okay. The brownfield projects are a priority. And things that are underway are in fine shape. We don't see any pressure on those. But we do see the pressures on the big mega-greenfield projects. But that hasn't -- those are further out and we've never put those too much in our plans because those have always had timing issues and permitting delays, and so they're generally off our prospect list and out of the horizon for that anyhow."

This morning, I will begin with some brief comments, which expand upon our press release and which provide some additional background on the results for the third quarter of our 2012 fiscal year. Mike Sutherlin will then provide an overview of our operations and our market outlook. After Mike's comments, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
During the call today, we will be making forward-looking statements. These statements should be considered along with the various risk factors detailed in our press release and other SEC filings. We encourage you to read and become familiar with these risk factors.
We may also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures, which we believe are important to the understanding of our business. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP metrics to GAAP, as well as for other investor information, we refer you to our website at www.joyglobal.com.
Now let's spend a few moments reviewing the third quarter results.
As a reminder, in our 10-Q and 10-K filings for business segment reporting, the operating results for the Surface Mining Equipment segment include the legacy PNH mining equipment results, plus LeTourneau acquisition results. While the Underground Mining Equipment segment operating results include the legacy Joy mining machinery results, plus the IMM acquisition results. Both acquisitions continue to contribute favorably to the results of the quarter although the general economic slowdown in China impacted IMM's performance.
During the third quarter, we settled the remaining 1% of outstanding IMM shares and our request to delist IMM from the Hong Kong exchange was approved. In the third quarter, IMM recorded bookings of $64.6 million, while recognizing $69.1 million of revenue and $10.5 million of operating profit before excess purchase accounting charges. The excess purchase accounting charges totaled $7.7 million in the current quarter, a result of continued refinement of our acquisition valuation estimates for IMM. We expect the final charge of $2 million for excess purchase accounting in our fourth quarter.
Since the IMM acquisition was completed, IMM results have been unfavorably affected by softness in the Chinese coal market and increased competition from local Chinese equipment manufacturers. At the same time, during the periods since the completion of the acquisition, the work our teams have done with IMM has reconfirmed the strength and potential of their businesses and the significant opportunities which exist for Joy Global to provide product improvements and operational efficiencies.
Actions are already in motion to begin to achieve these benefits and to differentiate the IMM products in the Chinese market and to increase market share. 
In the third quarter, LeTourneau continued to deliver strong operating results. The wheel load business recorded bookings of $91.7 million in the current quarter, while recognizing $110.9 million of revenue and $22.2 million of operating profit before excess purchase accounting charges. During the third quarter, we amortized the final $2.1 million of excess purchase accounting related to the LeTourneau acquisition while finalizing our acquisition valuation.
Now moving to the legacy surface and underground mining equipment businesses. All financial results continue to be tempered by moderation in our bookings for the quarter. Bookings of $928 million in the current quarter were down 35% from a year ago. The decrease in new order bookings compared to the prior year was comprised of a 39% decrease for surface mining equipment and a 26% decrease for underground mining equipment. The 39% decrease in surface equipment bookings in the current quarter was primarily made up of a 66% decrease in original equipment orders from the record level of OE bookings received in the third quarter last year. Aftermarket bookings fared better and were substantially flat with the aftermarket orders received a year ago.
Original equipment orders were down in all regions with the exception of Australia. The increase in aftermarket bookings in Eurasia and South America were offset by a decrease in aftermarket bookings in North America, Australasia and Africa. 
Current quarter of legacy surface orders, original equipment and the aftermarket were reduced by foreign exchange impacts of $5 million and $11 million, respectively. The 26% decrease in the third quarter in underground mining equipment bookings was attributable to a 55% decrease in original equipment orders, while aftermarket bookings were substantially flat with a 2% increase. 
The original equipment bookings decline in the -- compared to the third quarter of last year was due to weak demand for room and pillar equipment in the U.S. coal market and high comparables due to a new support system ordered in Russia in 2011.
Increase in aftermarket orders was due to increased bookings in South Africa, Australia and China, which were substantially offset by fewer orders in the U.S. and Eurasia. Orders for legacy underground original equipment and the aftermarket were negatively impacted by foreign exchange by $25 million and $21 million, respectively.
The backlog of the legacy businesses was $2.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, a decrease of 10% from the second quarter. 
As you may recall, we removed $190 million in underground equipment orders scheduled for the U.S. coal market last quarter as we believe there was a reasonable risk of deferral or cancellation of these orders. During the third quarter, $64 million of these orders were canceled, while $68 million were completed and shipped under their original terms. Backlog attributable to IMM and LeTourneau businesses remained stable at $300 million, consistent with the second quarter.
Net sales for the legacy businesses increased by 11% compared to the third quarter last year, with surface mining equipment shipments up 32%, while underground mining machinery revenue were substantially flat. OE shipments of surface mining equipment increased 47%, while underground mining equipment orders decreased 3%, as a result of several shipments slipping out of the third quarter. 
Aftermarket shipments of surface mining equipment increased 8% and shipments of aftermarket underground mine equipment increased 7% compared to year ago, primarily driven by strong part sales to the surface mining equipment business and favorable machinery rebuild shipments for the underground mining equipment business in the current quarter.
Legacy business operating profit of $277 million in the current quarter exceeded last year by $35 million, with both the surface and underground mining equipment units having return on sales percentages just below 24% and incremental profitability of 30%. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to increase in net sales and a decrease in variable compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in period cost.
Income from continuing operations in the current quarter was $1.82 per fully diluted share compared to $1.61 last year. The table included in the press release in our website provides a summary of the various items which impacted the current quarter. 
The 2 most significant items recite the after-tax earnings of our acquisitions for the $7.5 million or $0.07 per share decrease in net income due to increased net interest expense related to the financing of the LeTourneau and IMM acquisitions and to the excess purchase accounting amortization associated with IMM of $5.8 million or $0.05 per share net of tax.
The effective tax rate was 31.2% in the current quarter, compared to 25.3% last year. The effective income tax rate, excluding discrete tax adjustments, was 31% -- I'm sorry, 31.5% in the current quarter compared to 30.6% in the third quarter of 2011.
The full year effective tax rate is expected to be between 31% and 31.5%. As noted in our press release, we have continued to implement our downside planning scenarios and expect to incur $20 million of restructuring cost during the fourth quarter. These actions will result in approximately $40 million of annualized savings in the 2013 fiscal year. 
Cash provided from operations was $157 million in the current quarter, compared to $96 million a year ago. This improvement was due to the increase in net income and a reduction in cash used for accounts receivable and inventories, partially offset by less cash received from advanced payments due to the decline in original equipment bookings. 
Capital expenditures were $55 million in the current quarter and are on target to reach approximately $250 million for the full year. And finally, the revised guidance included in the press release assumes full year fully diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 107 million.
Now let me turn the discussion over to Mike Sutherlin."

This quarter has been defined by effective execution versus slowing demand in the commodity end markets. Mike has covered our third quarter performance very well and our press release had an extensive analysis of the current status and trends in the commodity markets. 
With these as reference, glad like to take a few minutes to tell you where we see the markets going and how we're going to position to our global to drive maximum value. 
The big 2 market factors for us are the decline in U.S. coal and the continued slowdown in China. The U.S. coal market has played out pretty much as we had projected. If anything, it's correct and a little faster than we had expected. Coal exports have continued to be strong and coal a second back some power generating market share's natural gas prices moved about $2.50. The combination of these factors supported an increasing coal production for the first time in 6 months during July. This indicates that U.S. coal has reached the bottom. 
The upside is from natural gas prices that are expected to continue moving up based on the forward strip and analyst forecast. And therefore, economics will progressively see coal recover some, but not all of its share power generation in the U.S. 
We continue to expect older coal-fired units to be retired even with the recent quarterly and eventually, they will be replaced as natural gas units are permitted and built, which takes years. 
Until then, most of the excess generating capacities now in coal-fired units, we should provide some additional upside. Overall, we see the U.S. Power Generation market to be structurally limited with longer-term upside to the U.S. coal market coming from exports. This has changed in the U.S. market for us. 
Investments in the West Coast port facilities will give PR vehicle access to the Pacific seaboard market, expansion of gulf coast ports and the widening of the Panama Canal will benefit the basin. Conversely, we do not expect loss production from Central Appalachia to come back and this region will increasingly rely on that coal. This is very consistent with the investments that our U.S. customers are making. They're investing heavily in expanded port capacity, mainly on the West and Gulf Coast, and investing in lowering their fleet cost by expanding lower costs longwall operations.
The impact for us will be twofold. First, the need to size our U.S. underground business for a market that will be structurally smaller going forward. 
Secondly, we need to prepare for a shift in production volumes from Central Appalachia to the Illinois Basin and from Roland Fuller to longwall equipment. 
In China held fairly well in the first half of this year, but it's deceleration has blown to the surface the last few months. Although the U.S. coal market moved as expected, we were surprised by how quickly and deeply the China affect has been felt. Since then our investment, industrial production and electricity demand have all slowed to around half their prior year's growth rates. Fuel output is up 2% over last year, but all of that occurred in the first half and steel production has since been essentially flat. 
Most recently, we have been encouraged by signs of China stabilizing. The domestic coal stockpiles at the Qinhuangdao transfer point have come down 25% since early July and this delayed to modestly recovery in coal prices. Domestic production search and opposed by Beijing will result in more moderate, but more sustainable production going forward. 
The long-term outlook for the emerging markets remains very much intact. Seaboard commodity pockets will continue to benefit strongly from the industrialization of China and India. For example, there's almost 375 gigawatts of power generating capacity under construction worldwide with 90% of that in developing Asia. 90 gigawatts will come online in the next year and add 300 million tons to coal demand. These events indicate that China is a high-cost producer of iron ore, thermal coal and net coal, and this provides a base for long-term growth of the seaboard demand. 
India is also increasing its dependence on seaborne coal because it's production repetitively fails to make its targets. Despite the long-term positives we much first word to the near term softness. Totaling China been a smooth all the commodities toward our in 2 supply surplus. That's supply are now chasing demand, prices have been pushed down this year bear up to 30% or more. This has reduced customer cash flow in the resource exporting countries, which our major markets for us. 
With cash flows down and supply in surplus, customers are rationalizing their mine expansion projects. Projects underway are preceding, but the next projects are being reevaluated. Customers should reporting that the extra round of engineering and planning are improving project economics. 
As a result of this process, new projects have been slower than the pipeline will be getting smaller, but more viable. But to be clear, new projects are continuing to move forward. In fact, we are heavily engaged in 4 projects in which we expect will become equipment decisions in the next few months. 
Although we believe that commodity demand has reached bottom, planning the upside remains uncertain. As a result, we are adjusting our business to be in line with current conditions. The need to reduce our cost base, simplify our organizational structure and improve our leverage to the upside. 
We've already been working on streamlining our organizational structure and its related costs to be a One Joy Global initiative, and that will take on added importance going forward. We also need to adjust the major shifts in our market. Although we will get a net cost reduction, it will be the result of more significant reductions in some areas, offset by increases where we have upside. 
We've been doing extensive scenario planning and we'll begin implementing those plans in our fourth quarter. The First stage will be volume-based cost reductions, with the heaviest exposure in the U.S. We will incur up to $20 million of restructuring cost in the fourth quarter to take $40 million out of our annualized cost in fiscal 2013. 
The payback on these reductions are expected to average about 6 months. The second stage will occur in our fiscal 2013 and is effectively accelerating the implementation of our longer-term operation strategy and will involve facility rationalization. It will integrate and consult a processes across our global factory network and will increase concentration and lower-cost operations. These actions will serve us well in the range of market outcomes. They will enhance our leverage to the upside in the best case and they will make us a stronger, more efficient business if current market conditions persist. So now let's refocus on the near term.
We expect our revenues to be up in our fourth quarter from the third quarter. This incorporates weaker market conditions that are affecting our aftermarket order rates, which were mostly booked and shipped in the same quarter and we expect aftermarket revenues to be flat in our fourth quarter. In addition, some of our original shipments are behind schedule and may not make the fourth quarter. Some of this is due to subcontracts is that a late and some is due to additional changes that are requested is a new product introductions. As a result, we now expect our fiscal 2012 revenues to be down another $100 million from our previous guidance. 
We are also narrowing our guidance range for the year. We now expect fiscal 2012 revenues to be between $5,450,000,000 and $5,550,000,000. Adjusted for expected detrimental margins in rounding we now expect earnings for fully diluted share for our fiscal 2012 to be between $7.05 and $7.20. This does not include the $20 million of restructuring cost, which will reduce reported earnings by another $0.13 per share. 
So with that overview, I'd like to turn the call back to Brian for questions."

There are some implications as you look at our recent order rates and cost reductions and a number of things. We are expecting our 2013 to be difficult year for us. So we think it will be flat to down slightly. When I say slightly, probably single-digit range at this point. In our second and third quarters, our bookings have not included any major projects, which is very unusual for us. It's not that they're not major projects in the pipeline, but customers are just been slower, more methodical. And as I said in my comments, we've got 4 projects that we're actively working on, have been working on, and they're getting closer to decision phase right now. So we've seen in the pipeline are some projects that are or more viable projects will stay in. But it'll be an lower number that we've been looking at historically. Plus, we look at our recent order rates, our second quarter order rates probably with a good reference point to third quarter order rates are down a little bit from the second quarter. Some of that is a dip effect, particularly in the U.S. since we take production out of the U.S. Customers, has been customers will naturally deplete some parts that they hold at mine site, And that equation of those parts inventory of mine site takes parts down another notch for a quarter or so and then sort of normalizes a little bit higher level. So if we look at that average, we extend that out to 2013 and then we add some projects to that, that's how the data those sort of within single-digit range of what we're looking out for 2012. And that's the way we are looking at our business today. Obviously, 2013 will involve some backlog depletion. I don't have the backlog numbers, but I think we're carrying about 60% of 2013 is in backlog. And we expect to be in backlog at the end of the year. So a good portion of that. And that not so much on aftermarket the Kerry about 6 weeks of aftermarket. So you can sort of adjust that for the regional equipment versus the aftermarket. So we have quite a bit of backlog going into 2013. Just right now, we're more worried about the upside. We're -- if we look at 2013 the upside of the biggest factor because of that backlog and the run rates we're seeing right now we feel pretty good that we're going to be within striking distance of 2012. But don't see any catalyst for upside until we see some more strength in the end use commodity demand."

We believe that that's the right thing to do and that's our finding range right now. Some of that requires restructuring cost to keep those detrimental margins in that range, so that's excluding the restructuring costs associated with that. As we -- part of the reason we have those kind of detrimental margins, as we really, really believe we're going to get some good revenue growth, not in the next quarter, but in the next few years out of some new product development programs we have underway, and we've really want to maintain those programs. With think it's important for expanding our product line and adding revenue streams to our top line. So that somewhat limits the amount on the detrimental side. And we think that's an investment in the future. As we look at our margins, we just going to really, really good job doing 2008, 2009 and holding our margins during that period, we stuck to our guidance that we've been very consistent and predicable with our customers. So we were aware, our plans, our expectations are not to see overall margin degradation and our products. We think that products for will deliver great value a they will price. We want to hold where we are on right now. We've may not have given the lots of price realization in 2013 that may be down fair, like decimal place of price realization.

We have a strategy to get the U.S. pension plans fully funded by about this time next year once that takes place, they'll be in the order of magnitude of 75 plus million dollars worth of contributions that will no longer be required. So our the cash for our outlook for this year does in fact include the $220 million of CapEx, plus $180 million worth of voluntary pension contributions."

If we look at our business, we have about $100 million of CapEx that keeps the business sustainable at a given level. And there's some CapEx therefore normal replacement. There's also some CapEx programs and things like OpEx programs and things like that, that have improved the impact on the business. So as we get above the $100 million, that additional CapEx is in 2 categories. One is in catch-up or under capitalizing our business historically, and that's largely in service centers that needed to be upgraded for expanded. And then the other part of that is to fund growth. And so as we look at a slower growth environment, we're naturally begin to pull back our overall CapEx numbers to reflect that. We still have -- we had to upgrade service centers in Mesa, Arizona because guys were doing structural welding outside in the 100 degrees heat. We're have the new service center in the Minnesota because guys were outside doing structural welding in 3 feet of snow. So we just have some historically facilities and our guys said in a wonderful almost amazing job of making those Greg despite that some of the facilities period. So we've been systematically going through cleaning those up and upgrading those up to first-class facilities in those regions. So some of it is growth, some of it is catch-up. The catch-up I mean, we're getting probably in the seventh inning or something on the facility catch-up part of that. And then it'll be driven by growth. So as we look forward in our business, we expect CapEx to come down to probably $150 million on an average basis as we get the Tianjin complex completed and we get a couple of more of the service centers finished that we have underway, like in Russia and India, then we will see 150 probably more of an average CapEx level."

And you see so much of the growth coming up and developing Asia, and we will continue to move our focus in that direction. More importantly right now is that we want to get more leverage out of our Operational Excellence programs. And the way to get leverage is to move to words centers of technical excellence. And I'll give you a couple of examples. We make gearing components transmissions in 4, 5 different factories around the world. We don't get the economy to scale nor do we get the level of testing support and building trace line database that we use for our condition and things like that. The to make those investments and to invest in the process is to improve the cycle time in our processes get limited because we've got to make those investments in 5 different facilities. So as we begin to look at centers of technical excellence, we get a concentration of the gear manufacturing processes. We are able to, make that investments speed the process is up and prove the after assembly phase and like that. So that's going to do a lot of our business near-term, long-term. And you can make a couple of other example like controls and the control we use at our machines as well. So there's a number of things that are there technical excellence category. It's not automatic that those centers of technical excellence will be moved to the emerging markets. So there's a balance between concentration, where we have critical mass expertise and can still achieve load production costs and also, beginning to move our footprint in the direction where we see the longer-term market growth. So that's the way we're looking at it. So part of it is much granularity you should like. But us as much we want to go to. You can have 2, Jerry, was the second part of your question was."

The businesses is to, the legacy business is do a good job managing accounts receivable. And we expect that to, in fact, continue. We do in fact, just begin to see modest improvement in inventory management. But keep in mind, this is a very inventory intensive business and customer service levels are significantly important as it relates to keeping that equipment operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. And that actually becomes a fair the significant barrier to entry into our business. So we will improve inventory management, but it will fact be a gradual process. Relative to the acquisitions, IMM will present a challenge charge for us on the accounts receivable side. We have teams established addressing that issue. And we anticipate making progress there. But in China, in general, receivables are an issue. In LeTourneau, we expect that their inventory and receivables will in fact be consistent with the management that we see on the surface business. Going forward, as you look back over history, our business from a working capital perspective has in fact been able to generate cash, both during periods of increasing market conditions and also softening of market conditions. And really, the big swing factor has been the advanced payments that help to fund some of the working capital growth when the markets are increasing. And then the receivables and inventory cash flow helps to mitigate the softening of advanced payments when the markets are softening. So we pay a lot of attention to working capital management. And in fact, the key element of the variable performance-based compensation of every person in the company is driven off of that inventory management. So it gets a lot of management attention."

We saw -- we have seen a tendency imports up in China and industrial production is down. The economy slowing. Fixed assets come investments that. Electricity demand is actually has been done in the second quarter to go we saw adjusted demand in China down from the first quarter a bit. So on a sequential basis, we saw softening demand, like demand. That's actually picked up pretty nicely in the month of July. So from the second quarter, the first month of the third quarter, we've got a good pickup of electricity demand. But because of all that, we saw stockpiles build up, which is the part of which they transfer production from the North and West and barge it down to Shanghai area, where the population centers are. As a result -- but the imports continued on. And so we saw, as the prices came down below $100, it actually strengthened imports. So it gave us a pretty good data point on where the domestic price levels are versus imports and the competitive advantage that imports have that low price levels. And also, we saw production come offline. Before it was mandated by Beijing. And then it also tells us that some of that production is high cost lines. So we see, in the seaboard markets right now, because of oversupply, Australia has bought some production back online. The U.S. has excess production looking for the home of the seaboard markets. Because of that, because of slowing electricity demand, we ended up with supply surplus in China, and that demand reduction has affected the local domestic market and affected IMM. I'm not aware of any change in competitive factors as much as just volumes have come down. And everybody has cut back production in the second quarter as the stockpiles buildup. The outlook right now is for that, the soft come down by 25%, the sort of back down to normalized levels, price levels have come back up. So we feel pretty good that, that things are going to sort of get back to normal. We also believe that the domestic production in China is probably going to see growth rates in the mid-single-digits rather than in 9%, 10%, 11% growth rates are probably more like 4%, 5%, 6% year-over-year vehicle production."

Thank you for participating in today's conference call and for your continued interest in our company. Joining me on the call this morning is Mike Sutherlin, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Major, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary.
This morning, I will begin with some brief comments, which expand upon our press release and which provide some additional background on the results for the third quarter of our 2012 fiscal year. Mike Sutherlin will then provide an overview of our operations and our market. After Mike's comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
During the call today, we will be making forward-looking statements. These statements should be considered along with the various risk factors detailed in our press release and other SEC filings. We encourage you to read and become familiar with these risk factors.
We may also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures, which we believe are important to the understanding of our business. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP metrics to GAAP, as well as for other investor information, we refer you to our website at www.joyglobal.com.
Now let's spend a few moments reviewing the third quarter results. As a reminder, in our 10-Q and 10-K filings for business segment reporting, the operating results for the surface mining equipment segment include the legacy P&H Mining Equipment results, plus LeTourneau acquisition results. While the underground mining equipment segment operating results include the legacy Joy mining machinery results, plus the IMM acquisition results. Both acquisitions continue to contribute favorably to the results of the quarter although the general economic slowdown in China impacted IMM's performance.
During the third quarter, we settled the remaining 1% of outstanding IMM shares and our request to delist IMM from the Hong Kong exchange was approved. In the third quarter, IMM recorded bookings of $64.6 million, while recognizing $69.1 million of revenue and $10.5 million of operating profit before excess purchase accounting charges. The excess purchase accounting charges totaled $7.7 million in the current quarter, a result of continued refinement of our acquisition valuation estimates for IMM. We expect a final charge of $2 million for excess purchase accounting in our fourth quarter. 
Since the IMM acquisition was completed, IMM results have been unfavorably affected by softness in the Chinese coal market and increased competition from local Chinese equipment manufacturers. At the same time, during the period since the completion of the acquisition, the work our teams have done with IMM has reconfirmed the strength and potential of their businesses and the significant opportunities which exist for Joy Global to provide product improvements and operational efficiencies. Actions are already in motion to begin to achieve these benefits and to differentiate the IMM products in the Chinese market and to increase market share. 
In the third quarter, LeTourneau continued to deliver strong operating results. The wheel loader business recorded bookings of $91.7 million in the current quarter, while recognizing $110.9 million of revenue and $22.2 million of operating profit before excess purchase accounting charges. During the third quarter, we amortized the final $2.1 million of excess purchase accounting related to the LeTourneau acquisition while finalizing our acquisition valuation.
Now moving to the legacy surface and underground mining equipment businesses, strong financial results continued to be tempered by moderation in our bookings for the quarter. Bookings of $928 million in the current quarter were down 35% from a year ago. The decrease in new order bookings compared to the prior year was comprised of a 39% decrease for surface mining equipment and a 26% decrease for underground mining equipment. The 39% decrease in surface equipment bookings in the current quarter was primarily made up of a 66% decrease in original equipment orders from the record level of OE bookings received in the third quarter last year. Aftermarket bookings fared better and were substantially flat with the aftermarket orders received a year ago.
Original equipment orders were down in all regions with the exception of Australia. The increase in aftermarket bookings in Eurasia and South America were offset by a decrease in aftermarket bookings in North America, Australasia and Africa. 
Current quarter legacy surface orders for original equipment and the aftermarket were reduced by foreign exchange impacts of $5 million and $11 million, respectively. The 26% decrease in the third quarter in underground mining equipment bookings was attributable to a 55% decrease in original equipment orders, while aftermarket bookings were substantially flat with a 2% increase. 
The original equipment bookings decline in the third -- compared to the third quarter of last year was due to weak demand for room and pillar equipment in the U.S. coal market and high comparables due to a roof support system ordered in Russia in 2011.
The increase in aftermarket orders was due to increased bookings in South Africa, Australia and China, which were substantially offset by fewer orders in the U.S. and Eurasia. Orders for legacy underground original equipment and the aftermarket were negatively impacted by foreign exchange by $25 million and $21 million, respectively. The backlog of the legacy businesses was $2.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, a decrease of 10% from the second quarter. 
As you may recall, we removed $119 million in underground equipment orders scheduled for the U.S. coal market last quarter as we believe there was a reasonable risk of deferral or cancellation of these orders. During the third quarter, $64 million of these orders were canceled, while $68 million were completed and shipped under their original terms. Backlog attributable to IMM and LeTourneau businesses remained stable at $300 million, consistent with the second quarter.
Net sales for the legacy businesses increased by 11% compared to the third quarter last year, with surface mining equipment shipments up 22%, while underground mining machinery revenue were substantially flat. OE shipments of surface mining equipment increased 47%, while underground mining equipment orders decreased 3% as a result of several shipments slipping out of the third quarter. 
Aftermarket shipments of surface mining equipment increased 8% and shipments of aftermarket underground mine equipment increased 7% compared to a year ago, primarily driven by strong part sales to the surface mining equipment business and favorable machine rebuild shipments for the underground mining equipment business in the current quarter.
Legacy business operating profit of $277 million in the current quarter exceeded last year by $35 million, with both the surface and underground mining equipment units having return on sales percentages just below 24% and incremental profitability of 30%. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to increase in net sales and a decrease in variable compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in period cost.
Income from continuing operations in the current quarter was $1.82 per fully diluted share compared to $1.61 per share last year. The table included in the press release in our website provides a summary of the various items which impacted the current quarter. 
The 2 most significant items besides the after-tax earnings of our acquisitions for the $7.5 million or $0.07 per share decrease in net income due to increased net interest expense related to the financing of the LeTourneau and IMM acquisitions and to the excess purchase accounting amortization associated with IMM of $5.8 million or $0.05 per share net of tax.
The effective tax rate was 31.2% in the current quarter, compared to 25.3% last year. The effective income tax rate, excluding discrete tax adjustments, was 31% -- I'm sorry, 31.5% in the current quarter compared to 30.6% in the third quarter of 2011.
The full year effective tax rate is expected to be between 31% and 31.5%. As noted in our press release, we have continued to implement our downside planning scenarios and expect to incur $20 million of restructuring cost during the fourth quarter. These actions will result in approximately $40 million of annualized savings in the 2013 fiscal year. 
Cash provided from operations was $157 million in the current quarter, compared to $96 million a year ago. This improvement was due to the increase in net income and a reduction in cash used for accounts receivable and inventories, partially offset by less cash received from advanced payments due to the decline in original equipment bookings. 
Capital expenditures were $55 million in the current quarter and are on target to reach approximately $250 million for the full year. And finally, the revised guidance included in the press release assumes full year fully diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 107 million.
Now let me turn the discussion over to Mike Sutherlin."
277517,215711309,351380,"Joy Global, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 29, 2012",2012-08-29,"Earnings Calls","Komatsu Mining Corp.","Executives","Yes, thanks, Mike.

This quarter has been defined by effective execution versus slowing demand in the commodity end markets. Mike has covered our third quarter performance very well, and our press release had an extensive analysis of the current status and trends in the commodity markets. 
With these as reference, I'd like to take a few minutes to tell you where we see the markets going and how we're going to position Joy Global to derive maximum value. 
The big 2 market factors for us are the decline in U.S. coal and the continued slowdown in China. The U.S. coal market has played out pretty much as we had projected. If anything, it's correct and a little faster than we had expected. Coal exports have continued to be strong and coal has taken back some power generating market share as natural gas prices moved above $2.50. The combination of these factors supported an increasing coal production for the first time in 6 months during July. This indicates that U.S. coal has reached the bottom. 
The upside is from natural gas prices that are expected to continue moving up based on the forward strip and analyst forecast. And therefore, economics will progressively see coal recover some, but not all, of its share power generation in the U.S. We continue to expect older coal-fired units to be retired even with the recent court ruling and eventually, they will be replaced as natural gas units are permitted and built, which takes years. 
Until then, most of the excess generating capacities now in coal-fired units, we should provide some additional upside. Overall, we see the U.S. power generation market to be structurally limited with longer-term upside to the U.S. coal market coming from exports. This is changing the U.S. market for us. 
Investments in the West Coast port facilities will give PRB coal access to the Pacific seaborne market, and expansion of Gulf Coast ports and the widening of the Panama Canal will benefit the Illinois Basin. Conversely, we do not expect lost production from Central Appalachia to come back, and this region will increasingly rely on met coal. This is very consistent with the investments that our U.S. customers are making. They're investing heavily in expanding port capacity, mainly on the West and Gulf Coast, and investing in lowering their fleet cost by expanding lower cost longwall operations.
The impact for us will be twofold. First, we need to size our U.S. underground business for a market that will be structurally smaller going forward. Secondly, we need to prepare for a shift in production volumes from Central Appalachia to the Illinois Basin and from room and pillar to longwall equipment. 
China held up fairly well in the first half of this year, but its deceleration has blown to the surface the last few months. Although the U.S. coal market moved as expected, we were surprised by how quickly and deeply the China effect has been felt. Fixed asset investment, industrial production and electricity demand have all slowed to around half their prior year's growth rates. Fuel output is up 2% over last year, but all of that occurred in the first half, and steel production has since been essentially flat. 
Most recently, we have been encouraged by signs of China stabilizing. The domestic coal stockpiles at the Qinhuangdao transfer point have come down 25% since early July and this has lead to modest recovering coal prices. Domestic production restriction opposed by Beijing will result in more moderate but more sustainable production going forward. 
The long-term outlook for the emerging markets remains very much intact. The seaborne commodity markets will continue to benefit strongly from the industrialization of China and India. For example, there's almost 375 gigawatts of power generating capacity under construction worldwide, with 90% of that in developing Asia. 90 gigawatts will come online in the next year and add 300 million tons to coal demand. Recent events indicate that China is a high-cost producer of iron ore, thermal coal and met coal, and this provides the base for the long-term growth of the seaborne demand. 
India is also increasing its dependence on seaborne coal because its production repetitively fails to make its targets. Despite the long-term positives, we must first work to the near-term softness. Growing China demand has moved all the commodities toward or into supply surplus. With supply now chasing demand, prices have been pushed down this year by up to 30% or more. This has reduced customer cash flow in the resource exporting countries, which are major markets for us. 
With cash flows down and supply in surplus, customers are rationalizing their mine expansion projects. Projects underway are proceeding, but the next projects are being reevaluated. Customers are reporting that the extra round of engineering and planning are improving project economics. As a result of this process, new projects are being slowed, and the pipeline will be getting smaller, but more viable. But to be clear, new projects are continuing to move forward. In fact, we are heavily engaged in 4 projects in which we expect will become equipment decisions in the next few months. 
Although we believe that commodity demand has reached bottom, timing of the upside remains uncertain. And as a result, we are adjusting our business to be in line with current conditions. We need to reduce our cost base, simplify our organizational structure and improve our leverage to the upside. 
We have already been working on streamlining our organizational structure and its related costs via the One Joy Global initiative, and that will take on added importance going forward. We also need to adjust to major shifts in our markets. Although we will get a net cost reduction, it will be the result of more significant reductions in some areas, offset by increases where we have upside. 
We have been doing extensive scenario planning, and we'll begin implementing those plans in our fourth quarter. The first stage will be volume-based cost reductions, with the heaviest exposure in the U.S. We will incur up to $20 million of restructuring cost in the fourth quarter to take $40 million out of our annualized cost in fiscal 2013. The payback on these reductions are expected to average about 6 months. 
The second stage will occur in our fiscal 2013 and is effectively accelerating the implementation of our longer-term operation strategy and will involve facility rationalization. It will integrate and consolidate processes across our global factory network and will increase concentration and lower-cost operations. These actions will serve us well in a range of market outcomes. They will enhance our leverage to the upside in the best case, and they will make us a stronger and more efficient business if current market conditions persist. So now let's refocus on the near term.
We expect our revenues to be up in our fourth quarter from the third quarter. This incorporates weaker market conditions that are affecting our aftermarket order rates, which were mostly booked and shipped in the same quarter, and we expect aftermarket revenues to be flat in our fourth quarter. In addition, some of our original equipment shipments are behind schedule and may not make the fourth quarter. Some of this is due to subcontractors that are late, and some is due to additional changes that are requested on some new product introductions. As a result, we now expect our fiscal 2012 revenues to be down another $100 million from our previous guidance. 
We are also narrowing our guidance range for the year. We now expect fiscal 2012 revenues to be between $5,450,000,000 and $5,550,000,000. Adjusted for expected decremental margins in rounding, we now expect earnings for fully diluted share for our fiscal 2012 to be between $7.05 and $7.20. This does not include the $20 million of restructuring cost, which will reduce reported earnings by another $0.13 per share. 
So with that overview, I'd like to turn the call back to Brian for questions."

And we think it will be flat to down slightly. When I say slightly, probably single-digit range still at this point. Our second and third quarters, our bookings have not included any major projects, which is very unusual for us. It's not that there are not major projects in the pipeline, but customers are just being slower and more methodical. And as I said in my comments, we've got 4 projects that we're actively working on, have been working on, and they're getting closer to decision stage right now. So what we've seen in the pipeline are some projects -- the better, more viable projects will stay in. But it'll be a lower number than we've been looking at historically.

Some of that is a dip effect, particularly in the U.S. since we take production out of the U.S. Customers will naturally deplete some parts that they hold at mine site, and that depletion of those parts inventory at mine site takes parts down another notch for a quarter or so and then it sort of normalizes at a little bit higher level. So if we look at that average, and we extend that out to 2013 and we add some projects to that, that's how we get to those sort of -- within single-digit range of what we're looking out for 2012. And that's the way we are looking at our business today. Obviously, 2013 will involve some backlog depletion. I don't have the backlog numbers, but I think we're carrying about 60% of 2013 is in backlog. And we expect to be in backlog at the end of the year, so a good portion of that. And that not so much on the aftermarket, we carry about 6 weeks of aftermarket. So you can sort of adjust that for the original equipment versus the aftermarket. So we have quite a bit of backlog going into 2013. Just right now, we're more worried about the upside. We're -- as we look at 2013, the upside is a bigger factor because of that backlog and the run rates we're seeing right now, we feel pretty good that we're going to be within striking distance of 2012. But we don't see any catalyst for upside until we see some more strength in the end use commodity demand."

Well, we believe that that's the right thing to do and that's our finding range right now. Some of that requires restructuring cost to keep those decremental margins in that range, so that's excluding the restructuring costs associated with that. As we -- part of the reason we have those kind of decremental margins is we really, really believe we're going to get some good revenue growth, not in the next quarter, but in the next few years out of some new product development programs we have underway. And we really want to maintain those programs. We think is important for expanding our product line and adding revenue streams to our top line. So that somewhat limits the amount on the decremental side. And we think that's an investment in the future. As we look at our margins, we just done a really, really good job doing 2008, '09 and holding our margins during that period. We stuck to our guidance and we have been very consistent and predicable with our customers. So we are where -- our plans, our expectations are not to see overall margin degradation in our products. And we think that products will deliver great value. They are well priced. We want to hold where we are on right now. We may not give a lot of price realization in 2013, that may be down to like decimal points of price realization. But we don't plan or foresee given any margin way either.

Our view currently is that free cash flow will be in the range of $250 million, maybe slightly above that. for the full year this year. We would expect that our capital expenditures would be about $220 million this year, and that free cash flow would be after a reduction for pension contributions of about $180 million. Now a significant portion of those pension contributions are voluntary. We have both our U.S. and U.K. pension plans in a very favorable funded position.

If we look at our business, we have about $100 million of CapEx that keeps the business sustainable at a given level. And there's some CapEx there for normal replacement. There's also some CapEx supply, things like OpEx programs and things like that, that have improved the impact on the business. So as we get above the $100 million, that additional CapEx is in 2 categories. One is in catch-up or under capitalizing our business historically, and that's largely in all the service centers that needed to be upgraded or expanded. And then the other part of that is to fund growth. And so as we look at a slower growth environment, we'll naturally begin to pull back our overall CapEx numbers to reflect that. We still have -- we had to upgrade service centers in Mesa, Arizona because guys were doing structural welding outside in the 110 degree heat. We're putting in new service center in the Minnesota Iron Range because guys were outside doing structural welding in 3 feet of snow. So we just have some -- have had historically some facilities that our guys did a wonderful, almost amazing job of making those work despite the pathetic condition in some the facilities we're in. So we've been systematically going through and cleaning those up and upgrading those to first-class facilities in those regions. So some of it is growth, some of it is catch-up. The catch-up, I mean, we're getting probably in the seventh inning or something on the facility catch-up part of that. And then it'll be driven by growth. So as we look forward in our business, we expect CapEx to come down to probably $150 million on an average basis as we get the Tianjin complex completed, and we get a couple of more of the service centers finished that we have underway, like in Russia and India. Then we will see -- $150 million is probably more of an average CapEx level."

We, as a company, have really focused on making our pricing predictable. And with our customers, we're really pretty transparent with them on pricing and how we arrive with that. We're not a company that tries to keep our prices high and then cave in at the last stage of their project. We give them good price at front end and stay with that. And that predictability, I think, has helped our creditability and reliability perception with the customer. On the projects we're working on, they're, as our customers, pick their better projects and look at the projects driven by value enhancement and productivity improvements. They tend to focus much more on the better equipment. The price point goes away because they're looking at the contribution their equipment gives to their operating cost. And in those environments, we actually do really well. So we're moving into an environment where the value proposition is a stronger element of the project economics. And it works to our favor. So we're not seeing nor do we expect us to have to go in and do some deep discounting and breakeven pricing just to get volume into our business.

But generally and thematically, we talked about moving in the directions where we see our market growth coming and you look at the seaborne markets and you see so much of the growth coming out of developing Asia, and we will continue to move our focus in that direction. More importantly right now is that we want to get more leverage out of our operational excellence programs. And the way to get leverage is to move toward Centers of Technical Excellence. And I'll give you a couple of examples. We make gearing components, transmissions in 4 or 5 different factories around the world. And we don't get the economy of scale, nor do we get the level of testing support and building trades-like database that we use for our commission monitoring and things like that. So the ability to make those investments and to invest in the processes to improve the cycle time in our processes gets limited because we've got to make those investments in 5 different facilities. So as we begin to look at Centers of Technical Excellence, we get a concentration of the gear manufacturing processes. We are able to make the investments to speed the processes up, improve the after-assembly test and things like that. So that's going to do a lot for our business near-term and long-term, and then we can make a couple of other examples like controls, the controls we use on our machines as well. So there's a number things that are in that Center of Technical Excellence category. It's not automatic, that those Centers of Technical Excellence will be moved to the emerging markets, so there is a balance between concentration where we have critical mass, expertise and can still achieve low production cost and also beginning to move our footprint in the direction where we see the longer-term market growth. So that's why we are looking at this so there is probably not as much granularities you'd like, but that's as much as we want to go to.

One is the $20 million that we'll work on right now will occur largely in our fourth quarter and may not get all of those, but we'll get most of those in the fourth quarter. We'll get a 6 month pay back on the savings, and so we expect to see those savings primarily in our first half of 2013. The 2013 restructuring will be spread over the course of the year, and therefore, the savings on a nine month pay back cycle will spread into 2014. And you will see most of the savings in 2014, but again, spread mostly over the year rather than concentrated in a quarter or even in the half."

As the business ramps up during the second half of 2011 and the first quarter or so of 2012, there were significant increases in inventory in anticipation of those increase in sales. The businesses do -- or the legacy businesses do a good job managing accounts receivable. And we expect that to, in fact, continue. We do, in fact, begin to see a modest improvement in inventory management. But keep in mind, this is a very inventory-intensive business and customer service levels are significantly important as it relates to keeping that equipment operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. And that actually becomes a fairly significant barrier to entry into our business. So we will improve inventory management, but it will, in fact, be a gradual process. Relative to the acquisitions, IMM will present a challenge for us on the accounts receivable side. We have teams established addressing that issue. And we anticipate making progress there. But in China, in general, receivables are an issue. In LeTourneau, we expect that their inventory and receivables will, in fact, be consistent with the management that we see on the surface business. Going forward, as you look back over history, our business from a working capital perspective has, in fact, been able to generate cash, both during periods of increasing market conditions and also softening of market conditions. And really, the big swing factor has been the advanced payments that help to fund some of the working capital growth when the markets are increasing. And then the receivables and inventory cash flow helps to mitigate the softening of advanced payments when the markets are softening. So we pay a lot of attention to working capital management. And in fact, the key element of the variable performance-based compensation of every person in the company is driven off of that inventory management. So it gets a lot of management attention."

We saw -- we have seen and continue to see imports up in China, and industrial production is down. economy is slowing, fixed asset investment is down, electricity demand is actually -- went down in the second quarter. We saw electricity demand in China down from the first quarter a bit, so on a sequential basis we saw softening in electricity demand. That's actually picked up pretty nicely in the month of July. So from the second quarter to the first month of the third quarter, they had a good pick-up in electricity demand. But because of all that, we saw stockpiles build up at Qinhuangdao, which is the port at which they transfer production from the North and West and barge it down to the Shanghai area where the population centers are. As a result, the imports continued on. And so we saw as the prices came down below $100, it actually strengthened the imports and that it gave us a pretty good data point on where the domestic price levels are versus imports and the competitive advantage that imports have at lower price levels. And also we saw product come offline before it was mandated by Beijing, and it also tells us that some of that production is high-cost line. So we see in the seaborne markets right now because of over supply, Australia has brought some production back online. The U.S. has excess production looking for the home on the seaborne markets. Because of that and because of slowing electricity demand, we ended up with supply surplus in China. And that demand reduction has affected the local domestic market and it affected IMM. I am not aware of any change in competitive factors as much as just the volumes have come down, and everybody has to cut back production in the second quarter as those stockpiles build up. The outlook right now is for that -- the stockpiles have come down by 25% to sort of back down to normalized levels, price levels have come back up. So, we feel pretty good that, that things are going to sort of get back to normal. But we also believe that the domestic production in China is probably going to see growth rates in the mid-single digits rather than 10 -- 9%, 10%, 11% growth rates are probably going to be more like 4%, 5%, 6% year-over-year growth rates in coal production."

We're looking at operational excellence programs to improve the efficiency lower cost in their factories.

This morning, I will begin with some brief comments, which expand upon our press release and which provide some additional background on the results for the third quarter of our 2012 fiscal year. Mike Sutherlin will then provide an overview of our operations and our markets. After Mike's comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
During the call today, we will be making forward-looking statements. These statements should be considered along with the various risk factors detailed in our press release and other SEC filings. We encourage you to read and become familiar with these risk factors.
We may also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures, which we believe are important to the understanding of our business. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP metrics to GAAP, as well as for other investor information, we refer you to our website at www.joyglobal.com.
Now let's spend a few moments reviewing the third quarter results. As a reminder, in our 10-Q and 10-K filings for business segment reporting, the operating results for the surface mining equipment segment include the legacy P&H Mining Equipment results, plus LeTourneau acquisition results. While the underground mining equipment segment operating results include the legacy Joy mining machinery results, plus the IMM acquisition results. Both acquisitions continue to contribute favorably to the results of the quarter although the general economic slowdown in China impacted IMM's performance.
During the third quarter, we settled the remaining 1% of outstanding IMM shares and our request to delist IMM from the Hong Kong exchange was approved. In the third quarter, IMM recorded bookings of $64.6 million, while recognizing $69.1 million of revenue and $10.5 million of operating profit before excess purchase accounting charges. The excess purchase accounting charges totaled $7.7 million in the current quarter, a result of continued refinement of our acquisition valuation estimates for IMM. We expect a final charge of $2 million for excess purchase accounting in our fourth quarter. 
Since the IMM acquisition was completed, IMM results have been unfavorably affected by softness in the Chinese coal market and increased competition from local Chinese equipment manufacturers. At the same time, during the period since the completion of the acquisition, the work our teams have done with IMM has reconfirmed the strength and potential of their businesses and the significant opportunities which exist for Joy Global to provide product improvements and operational efficiencies. Actions are already in motion to begin to achieve these benefits and to differentiate the IMM products in the Chinese market and to increase market share. 
In the third quarter, LeTourneau continued to deliver strong operating results. The wheel loader business recorded bookings of $91.7 million in the current quarter, by recognizing $110.9 million of revenue and $22.2 million of operating profit before excess purchase accounting charges. During the third quarter, we amortized the final $2.1 million of excess purchase accounting related to the LeTourneau acquisition while finalizing our acquisition valuation.
Now moving to the legacy surface and underground mining equipment businesses, strong financial results continued to be tempered by moderation in our bookings for the quarter. Bookings of $928 million in the current quarter were down 35% from a year ago. The decrease in new order bookings compared to the prior year was comprised of a 39% decrease for surface mining equipment and a 26% decrease for underground mining equipment. The 39% decrease in surface equipment bookings in the current quarter was primarily made up of a 66% decrease in original equipment orders from the record level of OE bookings received in the third quarter last year. Aftermarket bookings fared better and were substantially flat with the aftermarket orders received a year ago.
Original equipment orders were down in all regions with the exception of Australia. The increase in aftermarket bookings in Eurasia and South America were offset by a decrease in aftermarket bookings in North America, Australasia and Africa. 
Current quarter legacy surface orders for original equipment and the aftermarket were reduced by foreign exchange impacts of $5 million and $11 million, respectively. The 26% decrease in the third quarter in underground mining equipment bookings was attributable to a 55% decrease in original equipment orders, while aftermarket bookings were substantially flat with a 2% increase. 
The original equipment bookings decline in the third -- compared to the third quarter of last year was due to weak demand for room and pillar equipment in the U.S. coal market and high comparables due to a roof support system ordered in Russia in 2011.
The increase in aftermarket orders was due to increased bookings in South Africa, Australia and China, which were substantially offset by fewer orders in the U.S. and Eurasia. Orders for legacy underground original equipment and the aftermarket were negatively impacted by foreign exchange by $25 million and $21 million, respectively. The backlog of the legacy businesses was $2.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, a decrease of 10% from the second quarter. 
As you may recall, we removed $119 million in underground equipment orders scheduled for the U.S. coal market last quarter as we believed there was a reasonable risk of deferral or cancellation of these orders. During the third quarter, $64 million of these orders were canceled, while $68 million were completed and shipped under their original terms. Backlog attributable to IMM and LeTourneau businesses remained stable at $300 million, consistent with the second quarter.
Net sales for the legacy businesses increased by 11% compared to the third quarter last year, with surface mining equipment shipments up 22%, while underground mining machinery revenue were substantially flat. OE shipments of surface mining equipment increased 47%, while underground mining equipment orders decreased 3% as a result of several shipments slipping out of the third quarter. 
Aftermarket shipments of surface mining equipment increased 8% and shipments of aftermarket underground mining equipment increased 7% compared to a year ago, primarily driven by strong part sales to the surface mining equipment business and favorable machine rebuild shipments for the underground mining equipment business in the current quarter.
Legacy business operating profit of $277 million in the current quarter exceeded last year by $35 million, with both the surface and underground mining equipment units having return on sales percentages just below 24% and incremental profitability of 30%. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to increase in net sales and a decrease in variable compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in period cost.
Income from continuing operations in the current quarter was $1.82 per fully diluted share compared to $1.61 per share last year. The table included in the press release and in our website provides a summary of the various items which impacted the current quarter. 
The 2 most significant items besides the after-tax earnings of our acquisitions were the $7.5 million or $0.07 per share decrease in net income due to increased net interest expense related to the financing of the LeTourneau and IMM acquisitions and to the excess purchase accounting amortization associated with IMM of $5.8 million or $0.05 per share net of tax.
The effective tax rate was 31.2% in the current quarter, compared to 25.3% last year. The effective income tax rate, excluding discrete tax adjustments, was 31% -- I'm sorry, 31.5% in the current quarter compared to 30.6% in the third quarter of 2011.
The full year effective tax rate is expected to be between 31% and 31.5%. As noted in our press release, we have continued to implement our downside planning scenarios and expect to incur $20 million of restructuring cost during the fourth quarter. These actions will result in approximately $40 million of annualized savings in the 2013 fiscal year. 
Cash provided from operations was $157 million in the current quarter, compared to $96 million a year ago. This improvement was due to the increase in net income and a reduction in cash used for accounts receivable and inventories, partially offset by less cash received from advanced payments due to the decline in original equipment bookings. 
Capital expenditures were $55 million in the current quarter and are on target to reach approximately $250 million for the full year. And finally, the revised guidance included in the press release assumes full year fully diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 107 million.
Now let me turn the discussion over to Mike Sutherlin."

This quarter has been defined by effective execution versus slowing demand in the commodity end markets. Mike has covered our third quarter performance very well, and our press release had an extensive analysis of the current status and trends in the commodity markets. 
With these as reference, I'd like to take a few minutes to tell you where we see the markets going and how we're going to position Joy Global to derive maximum value. 
The big 2 market factors for us are the decline in U.S. coal and the continued slowdown in China. The U.S. coal market has played out pretty much as we had projected. If anything, it's correcting a little faster than we had expected. Coal exports have continued to be strong and coal has taken back some power generating market share as natural gas prices moved above $2.50. The combination of these factors supported an increase in coal production for the first time in 6 months during July. This indicates that U.S. coal has reached the bottom. 
The upside is from natural gas prices that are expected to continue moving up based on the forward strip and analyst forecast. And therefore, economics will progressively see coal recover some, but not all, of its share of power generation in the U.S. We continue to expect older coal-fired units to be retired even with the recent court ruling and eventually, they will be replaced as natural gas units are permitted and built, which takes years. 
Until then, most of the excess generating capacity is now in coal-fired units, which should provide some additional upside. Overall, we see the U.S. power generation market to be structurally limited with longer-term upside to the U.S. coal market coming from exports. This is changing the U.S. market for us. 
Investments in the West Coast port facilities will give PRB coal access to the Pacific seaborne market, and expansion of Gulf Coast ports and the widening of the Panama Canal will benefit the Illinois Basin. Conversely, we do not expect lost production from Central Appalachia to come back, and this region will increasingly rely on met coal. This is very consistent with the investments that our U.S. customers are making. They're investing heavily in expanding port capacity, mainly on the West and Gulf Coast, and investing in lowering their fleet cost by expanding lower cost longwall operations.
The impact for us will be twofold. First, we need to size our U.S. underground business for a market that will be structurally smaller going forward. Secondly, we need to prepare for a shift in production volumes from Central Appalachia to the Illinois Basin and from room and pillar to longwall equipment. 
China held up fairly well in the first half of this year, but its deceleration has blown to the surface in the last few months. Although the U.S. coal market moved as expected, we were surprised by how quickly and deeply the China effect has been felt. Fixed asset investment, industrial production and electricity demand have all slowed to around half their prior year's growth rates. Fuel output is up 2% over last year, but all of that occurred in the first half, and steel production has since been essentially flat. 
Most recently, we have been encouraged by signs that China is stabilizing. The domestic coal stockpiles at the Qinhuangdao transfer point have come down 25% since early July and this has lead to modest recovering coal prices. Domestic production restriction opposed by Beijing will result in more moderate but more sustainable production going forward. 
The long-term outlook for the emerging markets remains very much intact. The seaborne commodity markets will continue to benefit strongly from the industrialization of China and India. For example, there's almost 375 gigawatts of power generating capacity under construction worldwide, with 90% of that in developing Asia. 90 gigawatts will come online in the next year and add 300 million tons to coal demand. Recent events indicate that China is a high-cost producer of iron ore, thermal coal and met coal, and this provides the base for the long-term growth of the seaborne demand. 
India is also increasing its dependence on seaborne coal because its production repetitively fails to make its targets. Despite the long-term positives, we must first work through near-term softness. Growing China demand has moved all the commodities toward or into supply surplus. With supply now chasing demand, prices have been pushed down this year by up to 30% or more. This has reduced customer cash flow in the resource exporting countries, which are major markets for us. 
With cash flows down and supply in surplus, customers are rationalizing their mine expansion projects. Projects underway are proceeding, but the next projects are being reevaluated. Customers are reporting that the extra round of engineering and planning are improving project economics. As a result of this process, new projects are being slowed, and the pipeline will be getting smaller, but more viable. But to be clear, new projects are continuing to move forward. In fact, we are heavily engaged in 4 projects in which we expect will become equipment decisions in the next few months. 
Although we believe that commodity demand has reached bottom, timing of the upside remains uncertain. As a result, we are adjusting our business to be aligned with current conditions. We need to reduce our cost base, simplify our organizational structure and improve our leverage to the upside. 
We have already been working on streamlining our organizational structure and its related costs via the One Joy Global initiative, and that will take on added importance going forward. We also need to adjust to major shifts in our markets. Although we will get a net cost reduction, it will be the result of more significant reductions in some areas, offset by increases where we have upside. 
We have been doing extensive scenario planning, and we'll begin implementing those plans in our fourth quarter. The first stage will be volume-based cost reductions, with the heaviest exposure in the U.S. We will incur up to $20 million of restructuring cost in the fourth quarter to take $40 million out of our annualized cost in fiscal 2013. The payback on these reductions is expected to average about 6 months. 
The second stage will occur in our fiscal 2013 and is effectively accelerating the implementation of our longer-term operation strategy and will involve facility rationalization. It will integrate and consolidate processes across our global factory network and will increase concentration and lower-cost operations. These actions will serve us well in a range of market outcomes. They will enhance our leverage to the upside in the best case, and they will make us a stronger and more efficient business if current market conditions persist. So now let's refocus on the near term.
We expect our revenues to be up in our fourth quarter from the third quarter. This incorporates weaker market conditions that are affecting our aftermarket order rates, which were mostly booked and shipped in the same quarter, and we expect aftermarket revenues to be flat in our fourth quarter. In addition, some of our original equipment shipments are behind schedule and may not make the fourth quarter. Some of this is due to subcontractors that are late, and some is due to additional changes that are requested on some new product introductions. As a result, we now expect our fiscal 2012 revenues to be down another $100 million from our previous guidance. 
We are also narrowing our guidance range for the year. We now expect fiscal 2012 revenues to be between $5,450,000,000 and $5,550,000,000. Adjusted for expected decremental margins in rounding, we now expect earnings per fully diluted share for our fiscal 2012 to be between $7.05 and $7.20. This does not include the $20 million of restructuring cost, which will reduce reported earnings by another $0.13 per share. 
So with that overview, I'd like to turn the call back to Brian for questions."

But there are some implications as you look at our recent order rates and cost reductions and a number of things. We are expecting our 2013 to be a more difficult year for us. And we think it will be flat to down slightly. When I say slightly, probably single-digit range still at this point. Our second and third quarters, our bookings have not included any major projects, which is very unusual for us. It's not that there are not major projects in the pipeline, but customers are just being slower and more methodical. And as I said in my comments, we've got 4 projects that we're actively working on, have been working on, and they're getting closer to decision stage right now. So what we see in the pipeline are some projects -- the better, more viable projects will stay in. But it'll be a lower number than we've been looking at historically. So as we look at our recent order rates, our second quarter order rate is probably with a good reference point to -- or third quarter order rates are down a little bit from the second quarter. Some of that is a dip effect, particularly in the U.S. as we take production out of the U.S. Customers will naturally deplete some parts that they hold at mine site, and that depletion of those parts inventory at mine site takes parts down another notch for a quarter or so and then it sort of normalizes at a little bit higher level. So if we look at that average, and we extend that out to 2013 and we add some projects to that, that's how we get to those sort of -- within single-digit range of what we're looking at for 2012. And that's the way we are looking at our business today. Obviously, 2013 will involve some backlog depletion. I don't have the backlog numbers, but I think we're carrying about 60% of 2013 is in backlog. And we expect to be in backlog at the end of the year, so a good portion of that. And that, not so much on the aftermarket, we carry about 6 weeks of aftermarket. So you can sort of adjust that for the original equipment versus the aftermarket. So we have quite a bit of backlog going into 2013. Just right now, we're more worried about the upside. We're -- as we look at 2013, the upside is a bigger factor because of that backlog and the run rates we're seeing right now, we feel pretty good that we're going to be within striking distance of 2012. But we don't see any catalyst for upside until we see some more strength in the end use commodity demand."

We believe that that's the right thing to do and that's our planning range right now. Some of that requires restructuring cost to keep those decremental margins in that range, so that's excluding the restructuring costs associated with that. As we -- part of the reason we have those kind of decremental margins is we really, really believe we're going to get some good revenue growth, not in the next quarter, but in the next few years out of some new product development programs we have underway. And we really want to maintain those programs. We think it’s important for expanding our product line and adding revenue streams to our top line. So that somewhat limits the amount on the decremental side. And we think that's an investment in the future. As we look at our margins, we just done a really, really good job during 2008, '09 and holding our margins during that period. We stuck to our guns and we have been very consistent and predicable with our customers. So we are where -- our plans, our expectations are not to see overall margin degradation in our products. And we think that products will deliver great value. They are well priced. We want to hold where we are on right now. We may not get a lot of price realization in 2013, that may be down to like decimal points of price realization. But we don't plan or foresee given any margin way either. So, Mike, I don't know if you want to give any more background."

And as Mike indicated, we believe that there are programs that are very, very important for the future growth of the business.

And we, early on, had talked about free cash flow in that $300 million range. Our view currently is that free cash flow will be in the range of $250 million, maybe slightly above that, for the full year this year. We would expect that our capital expenditures would be about $220 million this year, and that free cash flow would be after a reduction for pension contributions of about $180 million. Now a significant portion of those pension contributions are voluntary. We have both our U.S. and U.K. pension plans in a very favorable funded position. We have a strategy to get the U.S. pension plans fully funded by about this time next year.

If we look at our business, we have about $100 million of CapEx that keeps the business sustainable at a given level. And there's some CapEx there for normal replacement, but there's also some CapEx supply, things like OpEx programs and things like that, that have improved the impact on the business. So as we get above the $100 million, that additional CapEx is in 2 categories. One is in catch-up or under capitalizing our business historically, and that's largely in old service centers that needed to be upgraded or expanded. And then the other part of that is to fund growth. And so as we look at a slower growth environment, we'll naturally begin to pull back our overall CapEx numbers to reflect that. We still have -- we had to upgrade service centers in Mesa, Arizona because guys were doing structural welding outside in the 110 degree heat. We're putting in new service center in the Minnesota Iron Range because guys were outside doing structural welding in 3 feet of snow. So we just have some -- have had historically some facilities that our guys did a wonderful, almost amazing job of making those work despite the pathetic condition some of those facilities we're in. So we've been systematically going through and cleaning those up and upgrading those to first-class facilities in those regions. So some of it is growth, some of it is catch-up. The catch-up, I mean, we're getting probably in the seventh inning or something on the facility catch-up part of that. And then it'll be driven by growth. So as we look forward in our business, we expect CapEx to come down to probably $150 million on an average basis as we get the Tianjin complex completed, and we get a couple of more of the service centers finished that we have underway, like in Russia and India. Then we will see $150 million as probably more of an average CapEx level."

A lot of this -- we've had in our strategic plans. The next step of operational excellence is to get more integration of certain processes and more critical mass around those processes in our factories as we move to Centers of Technical Excellence. Our ability to do that in some market conditions has been constrained because we just full out on production. We didn't have the breathing room to be able to start and make those moves. And these moves require puts and takes. So you got to have some -- a little excess capacity to work with. As we look at 2013, we see a window that allows us to accelerate and move forward on these projects.

We think that, that is also -- can be done without being a distraction to the day-to-day working of our business and making revenues and -- for our investors and making deliveries for our customers. So that's the range we are looking at right now."

So we probably will be sort of around that where we'll see the aftermarket flattish, maybe a little below, but maybe a little above here for a couple of quarters until the U.S. market begins to normalize, and we start to see a little bit more gain back of coal for power generation, a little bit more momentum in the export markets."

They are delicate issues that we haven't actually made final decisions on. We're still looking at some of the final decisions, certainly haven't made specific with our own people on those issues. But generally, thematically, we talked about moving in the directions where we see our market growth coming and you look at the seaborne markets and you see so much of the growth coming out of developing Asia, and we will continue to move our focus in that direction. More importantly right now is that we want to get more leverage out of our operational excellence programs. And the way to get leverage is to move toward Centers of Technical Excellence. And I'll give you a couple of examples. We make gearing, gearing components, transmissions in 4 or 5 different factories around the world. And we don't get the economy of scale, nor do we get the level of testing support and building traits like database that we use for our commission monitoring and things like that. The ability to make those investments and to invest in the processes to improve the cycle time in our processes gets limited because we've got to make those investments in 5 different facilities. So as we begin to look at Centers of Technical Excellence, we get a concentration of the gear manufacturing processes. We are able to make the investments to speed the processes up, improve the after-assembly test and things like that. So that's going to do a lot for our business near-term, long-term. And then we can make a couple of other examples like controls, the controls we use on our machines as well. So there's a number things that are in that Center of Technical Excellence category. It's not automatic, that those Centers of Technical Excellence will be moved to the emerging markets, so there is a balance between concentration where we have critical mass, expertise and can still achieve low production cost and also beginning to move our footprint in the direction where we see the longer-term market growth. So that's the way we are looking at them. So, probably not as much granularity as you'd like, but that's as much as we want to go into. And then you're going to have to, Jerry, remind me again what the second part of your question was?"

As the business ramps up during the second half of 2011 and the first quarter or so of 2012, there were significant increases in inventory in anticipation of those increases in sales. The businesses do -- or the legacy businesses do a good job managing accounts receivable. And we expect that to, in fact, continue. We do, in fact, begin to see a modest improvement in inventory management. But keep in mind, this is a very inventory-intensive business and customer service levels are significantly important as it relates to keeping that equipment operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. And that actually becomes a fairly significant barrier to entry into our business. So we will improve inventory management, but it will, in fact, be a gradual process. Relative to the acquisitions, IMM will present a challenge for us on the accounts receivable side. We have teams established addressing that issue. And we anticipate making progress there. But in China, in general, receivables are an issue. In LeTourneau, we expect that their inventory and receivables will, in fact, be consistent with the management that we see on the surface business. Going forward, if you look back over history, our business from a working capital perspective has, in fact, been able to generate cash, both during periods of increasing market conditions and also softening of market conditions. And really, the big swing factor has been the advanced payments that help to fund some of the working capital growth when the markets are increasing. And then the receivables and inventory cash flow helps to mitigate the softening of advanced payments when the markets are softening. So we pay a lot of attention to working capital management. And in fact, the key element of the variable performance-based compensation of every person in the company is driven off of that inventory management. So it gets a lot of management attention."

We saw -- we have seen and continue to see imports up in China, and industrial production is down. economy is slowing, fixed asset investment is down, electricity demand has actually been down. In the second quarter we saw electricity demand in China down from the first quarter a bit, so on a sequential basis we saw softening in electricity demand. That's actually picked up pretty nicely in the month of July. So from the second quarter to the first month of the third quarter, they had a good pick-up in electricity demand. But because of all that, we saw stockpiles build up at Qinhuangdao, which is the port at which they transfer production from the North and West and barge it down to the Shanghai area where the population centers are. As a result -- but the imports continued on. And so we saw as the prices came down below $100, it actually strengthened the imports and then it gave us a pretty good data point on where the domestic price levels are versus imports of the competitive advantage that imports have at lower price levels. And also we saw production come offline before it was mandated by Beijing, and that also tells us that some of that production is high-cost mine. So we see in the seaborne markets right now because of oversupply, Australia has brought some production back online. The U.S. has excess production looking for the home on the seaborne markets. Because of that and because of slowing electricity demand, we ended up with supply surplus in China. And that demand reduction has affected the local domestic market and it affected IMM. I am not aware of any change in competitive factors as much as just the volumes have come down, and everybody has cut back production in the second quarter as those stockpiles build up. The outlook right now is for that -- the stockpiles have come down by 25% to sort of back down to normalized levels, price levels have come back up. So, we feel pretty good that things are going to sort of get back to normal. But we also believe that the domestic production in China is probably going to see growth rates in the mid-single digits rather than 10 -- 9%, 10%, 11% growth rates are probably going to be more like 4%, 5%, 6% year-over-year growth rates in coal production."

That's not normal in that mid-tier market in China, but we think we can make some gains. Small at first, and build momentum. We're looking at operational excellence programs to improve the efficiency and lower cost in their factories. And we're also working with them on how to build a more direct aftermarket infrastructure, which is a big part of our overall profitability in our other global businesses. So we think that there's ways we can improve revenues and improve profitability in IMM despite the market.

We believe our Operational Excellence programs have delivered some really good cycle time reductions, and it makes us a more responsive and adaptive business. And that's really important as we go through market changes. And then we also believe that we've seen markets begin to bottom out or stabilize, particularly in the U.S. and China and the commodity end markets will begin to shift their focus to the upside. So as a result, we continue to believe that Joy Global remains an attractive investment mechanism.

Thank you for participating in today's conference call and for your continued interest in our company. Joining me on the call this morning is Mike Sutherlin, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Major, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary.
This morning, I will begin with some brief comments, which expand upon our press release and which provide some additional background on the results for the third quarter of our 2012 fiscal year. Mike Sutherlin will then provide an overview of our operations and our markets. After Mike's comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
During the call today, we will be making forward-looking statements. These statements should be considered along with the various risk factors detailed in our press release and other SEC filings. We encourage you to read and become familiar with these risk factors.
We may also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures, which we believe are important to the understanding of our business. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP metrics to GAAP, as well as for other investor information, we refer you to our website at www.joyglobal.com.
Now let's spend a few moments reviewing the third quarter results. As a reminder, in our 10-Q and 10-K filings for business segment reporting, the operating results for the surface mining equipment segment include the legacy P&H Mining Equipment results, plus LeTourneau acquisition results. While the underground mining equipment segment operating results include the legacy Joy mining machinery results, plus the IMM acquisition results. Both acquisitions continue to contribute favorably to the results of the quarter although the general economic slowdown in China impacted IMM's performance.
During the third quarter, we settled the remaining 1% of outstanding IMM shares and our request to delist IMM from the Hong Kong exchange was approved. In the third quarter, IMM recorded bookings of $64.6 million, while recognizing $69.1 million of revenue and $10.5 million of operating profit before excess purchase accounting charges. The excess purchase accounting charges totaled $7.7 million in the current quarter, a result of continued refinement of our acquisition valuation estimates for IMM. We expect a final charge of $2 million for excess purchase accounting in our fourth quarter. 
Since the IMM acquisition was completed, IMM results have been unfavorably affected by softness in the Chinese coal market and increased competition from local Chinese equipment manufacturers. At the same time, during the period since the completion of the acquisition, the work our teams have done with IMM has reconfirmed the strength and potential of their businesses and the significant opportunities which exist for Joy Global to provide product improvements and operational efficiencies. Actions are already in motion to begin to achieve these benefits and to differentiate the IMM products in the Chinese market and to increase market share. 
In the third quarter, LeTourneau continued to deliver strong operating results. The wheel loader business recorded bookings of $91.7 million in the current quarter, by recognizing $110.9 million of revenue and $22.2 million of operating profit before excess purchase accounting charges. During the third quarter, we amortized the final $2.1 million of excess purchase accounting related to the LeTourneau acquisition while finalizing our acquisition valuation.
Now moving to the legacy surface and underground mining equipment businesses, strong financial results continued to be tempered by moderation in our bookings for the quarter. Bookings of $928 million in the current quarter were down 35% from a year ago. The decrease in new order bookings compared to the prior year was comprised of a 39% decrease for surface mining equipment and a 26% decrease for underground mining equipment. The 39% decrease in surface equipment bookings in the current quarter was primarily made up of a 66% decrease in original equipment orders from the record level of OE bookings received in the third quarter last year. Aftermarket bookings fared better and were substantially flat with the aftermarket orders received a year ago.
Original equipment orders were down in all regions with the exception of Australia. The increase in aftermarket bookings in Eurasia and South America were offset by a decrease in aftermarket bookings in North America, Australasia and Africa. 
Current quarter legacy surface orders for original equipment and the aftermarket were reduced by foreign exchange impacts of $5 million and $11 million, respectively. The 26% decrease in the third quarter in underground mining equipment bookings was attributable to a 55% decrease in original equipment orders, while aftermarket bookings were substantially flat with a 2% increase. 
The original equipment bookings decline in the third -- compared to the third quarter of last year was due to weak demand for room and pillar equipment in the U.S. coal market and high comparables due to a roof support system ordered in Russia in 2011.
The increase in aftermarket orders was due to increased bookings in South Africa, Australia and China, which were substantially offset by fewer orders in the U.S. and Eurasia. Orders for legacy underground original equipment and the aftermarket were negatively impacted by foreign exchange by $25 million and $21 million, respectively. The backlog of the legacy businesses was $2.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, a decrease of 10% from the second quarter. 
As you may recall, we removed $119 million in underground equipment orders scheduled for the U.S. coal market last quarter as we believed there was a reasonable risk of deferral or cancellation of these orders. During the third quarter, $64 million of these orders were canceled, while $68 million were completed and shipped under their original terms. Backlog attributable to IMM and LeTourneau businesses remained stable at $300 million, consistent with the second quarter.
Net sales for the legacy businesses increased by 11% compared to the third quarter last year, with surface mining equipment shipments up 22%, while underground mining machinery revenue was substantially flat. OE shipments of surface mining equipment increased 47%, while underground mining equipment orders decreased 3% as a result of several shipments slipping out of the third quarter. 
Aftermarket shipments of surface mining equipment increased 8% and shipments of aftermarket underground mining equipment increased 7% compared to a year ago, primarily driven by strong part sales to the surface mining equipment business and favorable machine rebuild shipments for the underground mining equipment business in the current quarter.
Legacy business operating profit of $277 million in the current quarter exceeded last year by $35 million, with both the surface and underground mining equipment units having return on sales percentages just below 24% and incremental profitability of 30%. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to increase in net sales and a decrease in variable compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in period cost.
Income from continuing operations in the current quarter was $1.82 per fully diluted share compared to $1.61 per share last year. The table included in the press release and in our website provides a summary of the various items which impacted the current quarter. 
The 2 most significant items besides the after-tax earnings of our acquisitions were the $7.5 million or $0.07 per share decrease in net income due to increased net interest expense related to the financing of the LeTourneau and IMM acquisitions and to the excess purchase accounting amortization associated with IMM of $5.8 million or $0.05 per share net of tax.
The effective tax rate was 31.2% in the current quarter, compared to 25.3% last year. The effective income tax rate, excluding discrete tax adjustments, was 31% -- I'm sorry, 31.5% in the current quarter compared to 30.6% in the third quarter of 2011.
The full year effective tax rate is expected to be between 31% and 31.5%. As noted in our press release, we have continued to implement our downside planning scenarios and expect to incur $20 million of restructuring cost during the fourth quarter. These actions will result in approximately $40 million of annualized savings in the 2013 fiscal year. 
Cash provided from operations was $157 million in the current quarter, compared to $96 million a year ago. This improvement was due to the increase in net income and a reduction in cash used for accounts receivable and inventories, partially offset by less cash received from advanced payments due to the decline in original equipment bookings. 
Capital expenditures were $55 million in the current quarter and are on target to reach approximately $250 million for the full year. And finally, the revised guidance included in the press release assumes full year fully diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 107 million.
Now let me turn the discussion over to Mike Sutherlin."
277517,215711309,351807,"Joy Global, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 29, 2012",2012-08-29,"Earnings Calls","Komatsu Mining Corp.","Executives","Yes, thanks, Mike.

This quarter has been defined by effective execution versus slowing demand in the commodity end markets. Mike has covered our third quarter performance very well, and our press release had an extensive analysis of the current status and trends in the commodity markets. 
With these as reference, I'd like to take a few minutes to tell you where we see the markets going and how we're going to position Joy Global to derive maximum value. 
The big 2 market factors for us are the decline in U.S. coal and the continued slowdown in China. The U.S. coal market has played out pretty much as we had projected. If anything, it's correcting a little faster than we had expected. Coal exports have continued to be strong and coal has taken back some power generating market share as natural gas prices moved above $2.50. The combination of these factors supported an increase in coal production for the first time in 6 months during July. This indicates that U.S. coal has reached the bottom. 
The upside is from natural gas prices that are expected to continue moving up based on the forward strip and analyst forecast. And therefore, economics will progressively see coal recover some, but not all, of its share of power generation in the U.S. We continue to expect older coal-fired units to be retired even with the recent court ruling and eventually, they will be replaced as natural gas units are permitted and built, which takes years. 
Until then, most of the excess generating capacity is now in coal-fired units, which should provide some additional upside. Overall, we see the U.S. power generation market to be structurally limited with longer-term upside to the U.S. coal market coming from exports. This is changing the U.S. market for us. 
Investments in the West Coast port facilities will give PRB coal access to the Pacific seaborne market, and expansion of Gulf Coast ports and the widening of the Panama Canal will benefit the Illinois Basin. Conversely, we do not expect lost production from Central Appalachia to come back, and this region will increasingly rely on met coal. This is very consistent with the investments that our U.S. customers are making. They're investing heavily in expanding port capacity, mainly on the West and Gulf Coast, and investing in lowering their fleet cost by expanding lower cost longwall operations.
The impact for us will be twofold. First, we need to size our U.S. underground business for a market that will be structurally smaller going forward. Secondly, we need to prepare for a shift in production volumes from Central Appalachia to the Illinois Basin and from room and pillar to longwall equipment. 
China held up fairly well in the first half of this year, but its deceleration has blown to the surface in the last few months. Although the U.S. coal market moved as expected, we were surprised by how quickly and deeply the China effect has been felt. Fixed asset investment, industrial production and electricity demand have all slowed to around half their prior year's growth rates. Fuel output is up 2% over last year, but all of that occurred in the first half, and steel production has since been essentially flat. 
Most recently, we have been encouraged by signs that China is stabilizing. The domestic coal stockpiles at the Qinhuangdao transfer point have come down 25% since early July and this has lead to modest recovering coal prices. Domestic production restriction opposed by Beijing will result in more moderate but more sustainable production going forward. 
The long-term outlook for the emerging markets remains very much intact. The seaborne commodity markets will continue to benefit strongly from the industrialization of China and India. For example, there's almost 375 gigawatts of power generating capacity under construction worldwide, with 90% of that in developing Asia. 90 gigawatts will come online in the next year and add 300 million tons to coal demand. Recent events indicate that China is a high-cost producer of iron ore, thermal coal and met coal, and this provides the base for the long-term growth of the seaborne demand. 
India is also increasing its dependence on seaborne coal because its production repetitively fails to make its targets. Despite the long-term positives, we must first work through near-term softness. Growing China demand has moved all the commodities toward or into supply surplus. With supply now chasing demand, prices have been pushed down this year by up to 30% or more. This has reduced customer cash flow in the resource exporting countries, which are major markets for us. 
With cash flows down and supply in surplus, customers are rationalizing their mine expansion projects. Projects underway are proceeding, but the next projects are being reevaluated. Customers are reporting that the extra round of engineering and planning are improving project economics. As a result of this process, new projects are being slowed, and the pipeline will be getting smaller, but more viable. But to be clear, new projects are continuing to move forward. In fact, we are heavily engaged in 4 projects in which we expect will become equipment decisions in the next few months. 
Although we believe that commodity demand has reached bottom, timing of the upside remains uncertain. As a result, we are adjusting our business to be aligned with current conditions. We need to reduce our cost base, simplify our organizational structure and improve our leverage to the upside. 
We have already been working on streamlining our organizational structure and its related costs via the One Joy Global initiative, and that will take on added importance going forward. We also need to adjust to major shifts in our markets. Although we will get a net cost reduction, it will be the result of more significant reductions in some areas, offset by increases where we have upside. 
We have been doing extensive scenario planning, and we'll begin implementing those plans in our fourth quarter. The first stage will be volume-based cost reductions, with the heaviest exposure in the U.S. We will incur up to $20 million of restructuring cost in the fourth quarter to take $40 million out of our annualized cost in fiscal 2013. The payback on these reductions is expected to average about 6 months. 
The second stage will occur in our fiscal 2013 and is effectively accelerating the implementation of our longer-term operation strategy and will involve facility rationalization. It will integrate and consolidate processes across our global factory network and will increase concentration and lower-cost operations. These actions will serve us well in a range of market outcomes. They will enhance our leverage to the upside in the best case, and they will make us a stronger and more efficient business if current market conditions persist. So now let's refocus on the near term.
We expect our revenues to be up in our fourth quarter from the third quarter. This incorporates weaker market conditions that are affecting our aftermarket order rates, which were mostly booked and shipped in the same quarter, and we expect aftermarket revenues to be flat in our fourth quarter. In addition, some of our original equipment shipments are behind schedule and may not make the fourth quarter. Some of this is due to subcontractors that are late, and some is due to additional changes that are requested on some new product introductions. As a result, we now expect our fiscal 2012 revenues to be down another $100 million from our previous guidance. 
We are also narrowing our guidance range for the year. We now expect fiscal 2012 revenues to be between $5,450,000,000 and $5,550,000,000. Adjusted for expected decremental margins in rounding, we now expect earnings per fully diluted share for our fiscal 2012 to be between $7.05 and $7.20. This does not include the $20 million of restructuring cost, which will reduce reported earnings by another $0.13 per share. 
So with that overview, I'd like to turn the call back to Brian for questions."

But there are some implications as you look at our recent order rates and cost reductions and a number of things. We are expecting our 2013 to be a more difficult year for us. And we think it will be flat to down slightly. When I say slightly, probably single-digit range still at this point. Our second and third quarters, our bookings have not included any major projects, which is very unusual for us. It's not that there are not major projects in the pipeline, but customers are just being slower and more methodical. And as I said in my comments, we've got 4 projects that we're actively working on, have been working on, and they're getting closer to decision stage right now. So what we see in the pipeline are some projects -- the better, more viable projects will stay in. But it'll be a lower number than we've been looking at historically. So as we look at our recent order rates, our second quarter order rate is probably with a good reference point to -- or third quarter order rates are down a little bit from the second quarter. Some of that is a dip effect, particularly in the U.S. as we take production out of the U.S. Customers will naturally deplete some parts that they hold at mine site, and that depletion of those parts inventory at mine site takes parts down another notch for a quarter or so and then it sort of normalizes at a little bit higher level. So if we look at that average, and we extend that out to 2013 and we add some projects to that, that's how we get to those sort of -- within single-digit range of what we're looking at for 2012. And that's the way we are looking at our business today. Obviously, 2013 will involve some backlog depletion. I don't have the backlog numbers, but I think we're carrying about 60% of 2013 is in backlog. And we expect to be in backlog at the end of the year, so a good portion of that. And that, not so much on the aftermarket, we carry about 6 weeks of aftermarket. So you can sort of adjust that for the original equipment versus the aftermarket. So we have quite a bit of backlog going into 2013. Just right now, we're more worried about the upside. We're -- as we look at 2013, the upside is a bigger factor because of that backlog and the run rates we're seeing right now, we feel pretty good that we're going to be within striking distance of 2012. But we don't see any catalyst for upside until we see some more strength in the end use commodity demand."

We believe that that's the right thing to do and that's our planning range right now. Some of that requires restructuring cost to keep those decremental margins in that range, so that's excluding the restructuring costs associated with that. As we -- part of the reason we have those kind of decremental margins is we really, really believe we're going to get some good revenue growth, not in the next quarter, but in the next few years out of some new product development programs we have underway. And we really want to maintain those programs. We think it’s important for expanding our product line and adding revenue streams to our top line. So that somewhat limits the amount on the decremental side. And we think that's an investment in the future. As we look at our margins, we just done a really, really good job during 2008, '09 and holding our margins during that period. We stuck to our guns and we have been very consistent and predicable with our customers. So we are where -- our plans, our expectations are not to see overall margin degradation in our products. And we think that products will deliver great value. They are well priced. We want to hold where we are on right now. We may not get a lot of price realization in 2013, that may be down to like decimal points of price realization. But we don't plan or foresee given any margin way either.

But the $40 million that we've targeted are, in fact, structural fixed costs. And as Mike indicated, we believe that there are programs that are very, very important for the future growth of the business. So as we move into an uncertain market, what we want to do is we want to make sure that we position ourselves in a cost structure perspective to be able to continue to fund those projects for product development and aftermarket service. So we would anticipate, as we go into 2013, that we would continue to manage to 25% incremental profitability and about 32% to 34% decremental profitability, and also being in a position to continue to fund the projects that will drive future growth."

Once that takes place, they'll be in the order of magnitude of $75-plus-million worth of contributions that will no longer be required. So our free cash for -- outlook for this year does, in fact, include the $220 million of CapEx, plus $180 million worth of voluntary pension contributions."

If we look at our business, we have about $100 million of CapEx that keeps the business sustainable at a given level. And there's some CapEx there for normal replacement, but there's also some CapEx supply, things like OpEx programs and things like that, that have improved the impact on the business. So as we get above the $100 million, that additional CapEx is in 2 categories. One is in catch-up or under capitalizing our business historically, and that's largely in old service centers that needed to be upgraded or expanded. And then the other part of that is to fund growth. And so as we look at a slower growth environment, we'll naturally begin to pull back our overall CapEx numbers to reflect that. We still have -- we had to upgrade service centers in Mesa, Arizona because guys were doing structural welding outside in the 110 degree heat. We're putting in new service center in the Minnesota Iron Range because guys were outside doing structural welding in 3 feet of snow. So we just have some -- have had historically some facilities that our guys did a wonderful, almost amazing job of making those work despite the pathetic condition some of those facilities we're in. So we've been systematically going through and cleaning those up and upgrading those to first-class facilities in those regions. So some of it is growth, some of it is catch-up. The catch-up, I mean, we're getting probably in the seventh inning or something on the facility catch-up part of that. And then it'll be driven by growth. So as we look forward in our business, we expect CapEx to come down to probably $150 million on an average basis as we get the Tianjin complex completed, and we get a couple of more of the service centers finished that we have underway, like in Russia and India. Then we will see $150 million as probably more of an average CapEx level."

Their core parts of our customers' expansion or upgrading of their portfolios. We, as a company, have really focused on making our pricing predictable. And with our customers, we're really pretty transparent with them on pricing and how we arrive with that. We're not a company that tries to keep our prices high and then cave in at the last stage of the project. We give them good price at front end and stay with that. And that predictability, I think, has helped our creditability and reliability perception with the customer. On the projects we're working on, they're, as our customers, pick their better projects and look at the projects driven by value enhancement and productivity improvements. They tend to focus much more on the better equipment. The price point goes away because they're looking at the contribution their equipment gives to their operating cost. And in those environments, we actually do really well. So we're moving into an environment where the value proposition is a stronger element of the project economics. And it works to our favor. So we're not seeing nor do we expect us to have to go in and do some deep discounting and breakeven pricing just to get volume into our business.

A lot of this -- we've had in our strategic plans. The next step of operational excellence is to get more integration of certain processes and more critical mass around those processes in our factories as we move to Centers of Technical Excellence. Our ability to do that in some market conditions has been constrained because we just full out on production. We didn't have the breathing room to be able to start and make those moves. And these moves require puts and takes. So you got to have some -- a little excess capacity to work with. As we look at 2013, we see a window that allows us to accelerate and move forward on these projects.

They are delicate issues that we haven't actually made final decisions on. We're still looking at some of the final decisions, certainly haven't made specific with our own people on those issues. But generally, thematically, we talked about moving in the directions where we see our market growth coming and you look at the seaborne markets and you see so much of the growth coming out of developing Asia, and we will continue to move our focus in that direction. More importantly right now is that we want to get more leverage out of our operational excellence programs. And the way to get leverage is to move toward Centers of Technical Excellence. And I'll give you a couple of examples. We make gearing, gearing components, transmissions in 4 or 5 different factories around the world. And we don't get the economy of scale, nor do we get the level of testing support and building traits like database that we use for our commission monitoring and things like that. The ability to make those investments and to invest in the processes to improve the cycle time in our processes gets limited because we've got to make those investments in 5 different facilities. So as we begin to look at Centers of Technical Excellence, we get a concentration of the gear manufacturing processes. We are able to make the investments to speed the processes up, improve the after-assembly test and things like that. So that's going to do a lot for our business near-term, long-term. And then we can make a couple of other examples like controls, the controls we use on our machines as well. So there's a number things that are in that Center of Technical Excellence category. It's not automatic, that those Centers of Technical Excellence will be moved to the emerging markets, so there is a balance between concentration where we have critical mass, expertise and can still achieve low production cost and also beginning to move our footprint in the direction where we see the longer-term market growth. So that's the way we are looking at them. So, probably not as much granularity as you'd like, but that's as much as we want to go into.

As the business ramps up during the second half of 2011 and the first quarter or so of 2012, there were significant increases in inventory in anticipation of those increases in sales. The businesses do -- or the legacy businesses do a good job managing accounts receivable. And we expect that to, in fact, continue. We do, in fact, begin to see a modest improvement in inventory management. But keep in mind, this is a very inventory-intensive business and customer service levels are significantly important as it relates to keeping that equipment operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. And that actually becomes a fairly significant barrier to entry into our business. So we will improve inventory management, but it will, in fact, be a gradual process. Relative to the acquisitions, IMM will present a challenge for us on the accounts receivable side. We have teams established addressing that issue. And we anticipate making progress there. But in China, in general, receivables are an issue. In LeTourneau, we expect that their inventory and receivables will, in fact, be consistent with the management that we see on the surface business. Going forward, if you look back over history, our business from a working capital perspective has, in fact, been able to generate cash, both during periods of increasing market conditions and also softening of market conditions. And really, the big swing factor has been the advanced payments that help to fund some of the working capital growth when the markets are increasing. And then the receivables and inventory cash flow helps to mitigate the softening of advanced payments when the markets are softening. So we pay a lot of attention to working capital management. And in fact, the key element of the variable performance-based compensation of every person in the company is driven off of that inventory management. So it gets a lot of management attention."

277517,215711309,351807,"Joy Global, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 29, 2012",2012-08-29,"Earnings Calls","Komatsu Mining Corp.","Executives","Yes, China is going through -- there's an interesting phenomenon going on in China. We saw -- we have seen and continue to see imports up in China, and industrial production is down.

We saw -- we have seen and continue to see imports up in China, and industrial production is down. Economy is slowing, fixed asset investment is down, electricity demand has actually been down. In the second quarter we saw electricity demand in China down from the first quarter a bit, so on a sequential basis we saw softening in electricity demand. That's actually picked up pretty nicely in the month of July. So from the second quarter to the first month of the third quarter, they had a good pick-up in electricity demand. But because of all that, we saw stockpiles build up at Qinhuangdao, which is the port at which they transfer production from the North and West and barge it down to the Shanghai area where the population centers are. As a result -- but the imports continued on. And so we saw as the prices came down below $100, it actually strengthened the imports and then it gave us a pretty good data point on where the domestic price levels are versus imports of the competitive advantage that imports have at lower price levels. And also we saw production come offline before it was mandated by Beijing, and that also tells us that some of that production is high-cost mine. So we see in the seaborne markets right now because of oversupply, Australia has brought some production back online. The U.S. has excess production looking for the home on the seaborne markets. Because of that and because of slowing electricity demand, we ended up with supply surplus in China. And that demand reduction has affected the local domestic market and it affected IMM. I am not aware of any change in competitive factors as much as just the volumes have come down, and everybody has cut back production in the second quarter as those stockpiles build up. The outlook right now is for that -- the stockpiles have come down by 25% to sort of back down to normalized levels, price levels have come back up. So, we feel pretty good that things are going to sort of get back to normal. But we also believe that the domestic production in China is probably going to see growth rates in the mid-single digits rather than 10 -- 9%, 10%, 11% growth rates are probably going to be more like 4%, 5%, 6% year-over-year growth rates in coal production."

But we also were -- we have a series of programs we're working through with IMM. One of those is a technology transfer to upgrade their products and sort of drive them down the path of higher performance, higher price like we have with other products. That's not normal in that mid-tier market in China, but we think we can make some gains. Small at first, and build momentum. We're looking at operational excellence programs to improve the efficiency and lower cost in their factories. And we're also working with them on how to build a more direct aftermarket infrastructure, which is a big part of our overall profitability in our other global businesses. So we think that there's ways we can improve revenues and improve profitability in IMM despite the market. And certainly, if the market comes back, we end up with a higher base that we're working with, with a lot of programs. But expectation is reducing their cost and improving their profitability. And we want to use that to gain market share and then the volumes we get will be given to us by the market. And we think that those will come back in the second half, or mostly come back in the second half anyhow."

This morning, I will begin with some brief comments, which expand upon our press release and which provide some additional background on the results for the fourth quarter of our 2012 fiscal year. Mike Sutherlin will then provide an overview of our operations and our markets. After Mike's comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
During the call today, we'll be making forward-looking statements. These statements should be considered along with the various risk factors detailed in our press release and other SEC filings. We encourage you to read and become familiar with these risk factors.
We may also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures, which we believe are important to the understanding of our business. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP metrics to GAAP, as well as other investor information, we refer you to our website at www.joyglobal.com.
Now, let's spend a few moments reviewing the fourth quarter of the 2012 fiscal year.
In our press release, we include tables that provide information which makes it easier to compare the current period results to the prior year on a consistent basis. These tables provide the results for the surface and underground mining equipment businesses on a historical basis and list the LeTourneau and IMM results separately, along with an usual charges included in the calculation of operating profit. My comments this morning will focus on the legacy historical results for the company's surface and underground mining equipment businesses, excluding unusual charges listed individually in the press release and will break out separately the LeTourneau and IMM results.
Legacy bookings in the fourth quarter were $1.1 billion and were 15% lower than they were last year. The decrease in bookings was a result of a 5% decrease in aftermarket orders and a 27% decrease in original equipment bookings. Aftermarket equipment bookings for the Underground Mining Equipment business were approximately $0.09 less than they were a year ago due to fewer rebuilds in parts in the U.S. coal market and lower order rates in China where parts orders are typically very large and sporadic in their timing, and in Eurasia. The decrease in underground market orders was partially offset as surface mining equipment aftermarket bookings increased 3% with small increases from the prior year and aftermarket orders in South America, Australia and Africa.
The decrease in original equipment bookings was attributable to a 47% decrease in the Surface Mining Equipment business from on exceptionally strong OE bookings quarter last year, which was partially offset by a 21% increase for underground mining equipment business.
Surface original equipment orders were down in all regions except Africa and Australia. Underground original equipment orders were up in China, Africa and Australia where an order for longwall equipment was received during the quarter, partially offset by lower orders in the U.S. due to the soft coal market.
LeTourneau recorded $191 million of bookings in the quarter a 65% increase from the prior year. This increase in new orders included a large order for loaders from a customer in South America. IMM recorded $40 million of bookings in the quarter reflecting the soft demand for their product in that midtier market in China. Approximately $23 million of the $70 million overall decrease in bookings in the current quarter compared to year ago was due to the translation impact of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates.
Our investor website contains 2 graphs which track rolling fourth quarter new order trends for our legacy businesses for both original equipment and aftermarket. The graph reflect a continued increase in aftermarket orders for both businesses and the softness for OE bookings reported in the 2012 fiscal year.
Net sales for the legacy businesses in the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion and were 15% higher than they were a year ago. Both legacy businesses reported revenue growth with the underground equipment business recording a 4% increase, while the surface mining equipment business had a 35% increase in net sales. The revenue growth trends for the aftermarket business continued with increased sales of 6% and 7% for the underground and surface mining equipment businesses, respectively.
Surface mining aftermarket sales were up in all regions except China and Australia where the increase in underground aftermarket sales was associated with strong parts sales in China. Underground original equipment net sales were essentially flat with the strong quarter a year ago, while original equipment revenue for the service equipment business was 90% higher than OE sales in the fourth quarter last year. Higher shipments of underground equipment to Australia and China were offset by lower shipments in the United States and Africa, while strong surface equipment OE sales were reported across all regions.
LeTourneau reported net sales of $129 million in the current quarter compared to $102 million in the fourth quarter last year, a 27% increase. IMM had net sales of $52 million in the current quarter and reported softness across 3 of their 4 product lines in a challenging Chinese midtier market. Foreign currency translation associated with changes in the foreign currency rates decreased total net sales by $7 million compared to a year ago.
Operating profit for the legacy business in the fourth quarter was $294 million with a 21% return on net sales compared to $282 million with a 23% return on net sales in the fourth quarter last year. Excluding the charges associated with restructuring initiatives and pension curtailment actions recorded in the current quarter, return on net sales for the legacy business would have been 22%. The $21 million of fourth quarter charges for restructuring and pension curtailment will result in reduction in the company's cost structure in fiscal 2013 and these charges were anticipated at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
The Underground Mining Equipment business reported a 22% return on sales, 23% excluding restructuring and pension curtailment charges compared to 25% a year ago. The underground results last year, as you will remember, were extraordinarily strong with very favorable sales mix and favorable manufacturing overhead absorption. In the current quarter, the surface mining equipment business had a 22% return on sales, 24% excluding restructuring and pension curtailment charges compared to 22% last year. The surface business benefited from higher volume and favorable sales mix, which was partially offset by unfavorable period along with an increase in SG&A expense. 
LeTourneau had operating profit of $30 million and a return to sales of 23% in the current quarter compared to $24 million and 23% return on sales in the fourth quarter last year. The integration of the LeTourneau acquisition continues on schedule and is operating at a run rate ahead of the acquisition economic model.
IMM had operating profit of $4 million for the final excess purchase accounting charge of $2 million in the fourth quarter. The IMM results reflect negatively -- were negatively affected by the low level of revenue in the current quarter. Net income from current, continuing operation, including the unusual items I've mentioned above, was $212 million and $1.99 per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter compared to $195 million or a $1.83 per fully diluted share last year. Net income from continuing operations in the current quarter benefited from the increase in operating profit described above, partially offset by the increase in net interest expense from $11 million last year to $17 million in the current quarter. The income tax rate was 31.1% this quarter to 31.7% a year ago with the improvement in the income tax rate primarily due to an increase in beneficial discrete tax items in the current quarter. For the 2013 fiscal year, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 30.5% and 31.5%, excluding discrete tax items.
Cash flow from continuing operations was $211 million in the current quarter compared to $151 million a year ago. The increase in cash provided by operations was due to an increase in net income, a decrease -- and a decrease in inventories. These benefits were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of sales in the latter part of our fourth quarter. There was also a decrease in accounts payable and a decrease in advanced payments associated with lower original equipment bookings.
Capital expenditures were $72 million in the current quarter compared to $35 million last year with capital expenditures expected to be approximately $200 million in the 2013 fiscal year as we finish up some carryover projects from the 2012 fiscal year.
With that, let me turn the discussion over to Mike Sutherlin."
277517,224674673,397518,"Joy Global, Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 12, 2012",2012-12-12,"Earnings Calls","Komatsu Mining Corp.","Executives","Yes, Thank you, Mike. And let me add my welcome to those on the call. I think Mike's done a nice job of reviewing the fourth quarter and the full year, so I'll focus more in 2013. But before doing that, I'll make a couple of observations. First, our entir",1864,"Yes, Thank you, Mike. And let me add my welcome to those on the call. I think Mike's done a nice job of reviewing the fourth quarter and the full year, so I'll focus more in 2013. But before doing that, I'll make a couple of observations. First, our entire team finished the year strong and this enabled us to catch up on some customer commitments and to deliver overall exceptional performance for the year. In fact, it was a year of record for us and in many aspects.
Secondly, our markets continually degraded during the year as we dealt with coal share loss to natural gas for power generation in the U.S., then the slowing of China that created supplies surpluses that drove commodity prices lower. This is followed by flattening of global steel production and de-stocking of met coal and iron ore mills as a consequence.
And finally, Australia began to unravel as rising cost approach weaker prices. These became cumulative impacts as the year progressed. We initially felt we could offset the drop in U.S. coal, but eventually the headwind became too strong. This then defines the market conditions as we enter our 2013.
Our fourth quarter also included quite a bit of noise as we cut production and started the process of reducing our cost base to adjust to lower volumes in 2013. Each of these items created some drag on 2012, but they will provide potential to 2013, so let me explain.
Let's start with the markets. We have already provided a lot of information on our in-commodity markets in our press release, so I won't repeat that. However, I will emphasize that those markets have generally stabilized and now have potential for upside. In the meantime, we expect them to move sideways. For example, October increase the power generation in China has continued into November. India's coal production is behind last year and was stockpiled less than a week, imports will have to increase in the second half. China's import of iron ore is up 67% in August and again in the September indicating that de-stocking at the steel mills is ending.
India has put restrictions on its export of iron ore and this will flip India from an exporter to an importer adding to seaborne demand. And copper is expected to complete a destocking facing China by year end. There are additionally some general trends that caused all of our markets and help the their overall impact on us. The slowing in demand we saw in 2012 occurred as additional production was coming online. This was often from mines that were put on hold in 2008 and restarted in 2010. In fact, this was part of the increase in orders we enjoyed in 2011 and these mines started coming into production in 2012.
Increasing supply and slowly demand created surplus that drove pricing down to the marginal cost of production. We had invested capital returns and customer CapEx has been reduced significantly during the year. This is reflected in our right of growth income in new orders for our legacy businesses, which excludes LeTourneau and IMM for consistent comparisons. This order rate is down 20% year-over-year comprised of original down 40% and aftermarket flat. The aftermarket has offset the drop in U.S. coal and we are pleased to see that.
A deeper diagnostic of the income in order rate is to separate out major projects since they or generally lumpy and even or so in the current market conditions. So if the call these base orders, that number has been pretty consistent throughout 2012. This gives us confidence to use this as a run rate going into 2013. And therefore, our 2013 outlook is set on the continuation of this base order rate plus major projects.
We had over $400 million of major project bookings in 2012, neither defined as projects of $100 million or larger. The 2012 number includes $200 million in our fourth quarter. We previously talked about 4 major projects that were in later stages. 2 of these projects and replacement Australia longwall and large order for LeTourneau orders going to Brazil were about in our fourth quarter. It's encouraging that we're finally, getting these projects across the line. The remaining couple of projects are still in process. Other projects are also in process but the predictability of timing diminishes as we look beyond our first quarter.
Although the commodity end markets have largely corrected and are poised to improve, the timing of this is uncertain. In addition, our customer do not sense urgency with the excess capacity that exist today. We believe our customers actual CapEx spend peak in the first half with the year defined by more projects finishing than starting. As a result, we expect our customers' CapEx in 2012 to be roughly flat with 2011. However, the down trend in the second have indicates a CapEx spend will be down another 10% to 15% in 2013. Much of this decline started in the second half of 2012. Some of this is also the results of caution and an unexpected delayed restart. With the cushion of excess capacity, our customers will wait until the improving trend is made clear and sustaining. Now with prices starting to recover, our customers have improved cash flows and combined with excess capacity depletion, we expect customer CapEx to stabilize at the 2013 levels. We also expect any improvement in CapEx to be backend loaded to 2013. However, we are not betting on timing and our plans for 2013 are based on current market  conditions continuing.
We have all heard that a current market is not like 2009 and it's not. However, the comparison is still informative. The rate of decline in the original equipment orders in 2012 was only half of that experience in 2009. In the previous downturn, the order rates drops suddenly and quickly from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009 and that's simplified year-over-year comparisons. This time around, we have had decline in income and orders to beginning in the second quarter of 2012 and therefore, we are effectively 3 quarters in to the current market weakening. As a result, we will not be able to use backlog depletion in 2013 like we did in 2012. This puts more emphasis on cost reduction and restructuring.
Alternatively, we carry equipment backlog into 2013 that covers about 3/4 of our production schedule giving us confidence in our plan for this coming year. We are taking our cost to size our business to the lower market we see for 2013. We incurred $20 million in charges in the fourth quarter to restructure and lower our cost base. About half of this was adjusting to lower production volumes and the other half to restructure some of our pension plans from defined benefit and defined contribution. The latter reduces our pension costs and makes them cost much more predictable. In addition, we plan to incurred another $25 million in 2013 to rebalance and optimize our manufacturing. This is a combination of adjusting to structural changes in the U.S. coal market, increasing our manufacturing capacity in China, consolidating certain satellite factories and facilities and eliminating difficult costs as we implement One Joy Global.
We have targeted decremental operating margins at 34%. This reflects the fixed cost at our manufacturing operations and allows us to retain our field service personnel and to continue funding key research and development projects that we expect the generate significant additional revenues in future years. Restructuring charges enabled this 34% decremental margin, but there's also $40 million dollars of 2012 cost that will go away, primarily excess first year purchase accounting charges that are over and above restructuring and not included in this decremental computation.
All I also want to adjust IMM, which has been disappointing in 2012, but which we expect to recover in 2013. The integration issues are always complex, but that was compounded by the slowdown in the China market. The hiatus around regime change in China did not help, in fact this made our fourth quarter look especially bad. But we are in the midst of technology transfers that will give IMM products that have competitive advantage and we're setting the big gnostics face of operational excellence. More importantly, we are changing IMM from acting like a holding company to be an operating company. The integration team, including IMM management, is digging in to every aspect of the business and we are finding more opportunity. Early indications are good with order rates starting to return.
And finally, let me address cash flow. We expect free cash flow to increase in 2013 as lower volumes allow us to monetize working capital. There are additional sources that will favorably impact free cash flow. Cash flow was reduced in 2012 by increase CapEx and the continuation of elevated pension funding. CapEx will come down in 2013 as we, like our customers, finish more projects than we start. And we expect our U.S. pensions to reach our funding targets by the end of 2013.
With increased cash, free cash flow, capital allocation becomes an issue. We continue to believe that strategic acquisitions provide the path to highest returns, but we recognize the timing is not predictable, and as a result our default value is share buybacks. However, we will not make a definitive decision until we complete cash balances that will enable us to have meaningful execution. This then gives us the basis for our 2013 guidance.
We expect and our planning for revenues to be between $4.9 billion to $5.2 billion in fiscal 2013. After capturing the benefit of completed excess purchase accounting for both LeTourneau and IMM, and applying our decremental target of 34% to the adjusted cost base, results in our expectations of earnings per fully diluted share to be between $5.90 to $6.50. This is before the cost of restructuring programs in 2013 which we said would be $25 million. Therefore, all in EPS is expected to be between $5.75 to $6.35 per share.
Before closing, I want you to remind about the seasonality that impacts our first quarter. The disproportion number of holidays have fallen into our fiscal first quarter adversely impacts revenue. Fixed cost additionally, impact operating profit and margins, and this needs to be considered and anticipated and evaluated in our first quarter. And finally, this is Mike Olsen's final earnings call. I've never had a better, more capable and more dedicated CFO. Mike's work ethic is legendary and no one is more committed to the best interest of this company. We also better knowing that Mike has blessed the numbers. He has earned the respect of the entire Joy Global team, our Board of Directors, our investors and shareholders and most of you on this call. Mike, you'll be greatly missed but never forgotten, so thank you for 33 years of excellence. There will be a big shoes to fill but there's no one more capable doing that than Jim Sullivan. So, Jim, welcome and good luck.
Anyhow, with that, I'll turn the call to questions. So, Augusta, back to you."

The flattish aftermarket we had was largely the international markets growing year-over-year and offsetting the decline we've seen in the U.S. coal markets",486,"Let me go, just touch on 2012 for just a second because I think it relates to what we see for 2013. The flattish aftermarket we had was largely the international markets growing year-over-year and offsetting the decline we've seen in the U.S. coal markets. So we've seen a pretty significant decline in the U.S. coal market not unlike that which we saw in 2009. For different reasons, but the magnitude's not all that dissimilar. So a fairly significant decline in the large sector in other regions around the world capable of offsetting that. We do have a pretty consistent aftermarket on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, we could get some lumpiness, for example from China we'll get a large aftermarket orders, 3 or 4 times a year rather than monthly. So the fact that we got a large number in our third quarter from China, that became aftermarket revenue in our fourth quarter we delivered that order. So I think you got to look at year-over-year more so than the fourth quarter just because the predictability of the aftermarket even on a quarterly basis particular the large purchase orders is not absolutely crystal clear and it's not always consistent. As we look at 2013, we've gone back and looked at our aftermarket business over long periods of time. And aftermarket has historically, in worse conditions it's flat in 2009. We saw aftermarket flatten out. And I think it demonstrates the stability there. And we're looking today -- the aftermarket is generally aligned to production rates, so we're looking at some decline at production rates but not massive declines globally in production rates. The U.S. is got to seem a little bit more severe because there are structural changes that the coal volume that the U.S. is not down all that much it's like 5% or 8% or something in production. But much more in Central Appalachia we're seeing increase in Illinois Basin. So that structural dislocation is having a bigger impact on aftermarket in the U.S. And yet through 2012, we were able to offset that out in the international aftermarkets. Those adjustments or more severe at the early stages as people de-stock inventories at mine sites and part equipment and things like that and then they begin to move that up to live at higher level where we see stabilization. So in that regard, 2012 would represent what we would expect to be probably the worst year for U.S. underground coal aftermarket. So you put all the things together and I think we still believe that the aftermarket is going to be able to stabilize over 2013 given what we see, new machines coming in to the fleet, machines moving into their first rebuild cycle, production levels internationally coming off a bit but not dramatically, and you put that into the equation, we expect our aftermarket to hold its own in 2013."

You had relatively good awards in the quarter and you've guided to 2012 order it's carrying forward into '13. I know it's early, but one of the big questions that I think we have is whether earnings should stabilize at your '13 rate as you go into '14. I mean, I think you're kind of hinting that at least at this point, you think that's possible given the stabilization of the markets. But I don't want to put words in your mouth. How do you look at sort of '14 and beyond versus '13? Is this going to be sort of the bottom in earnings and what confidence level do you have around that?"

Cash flow dropped pretty dramatically in 2012 as commodity pricing came down. And we've seen commodity prices in the second half stabilize. And in the fourth quarter, we saw the -- starting to move up and commodity price, certainly iron ore has regained a lot of its loss. We starting to see some of -- we're seeing grow roll over in a met coal, but we expect the first quarter to be better as the steel mills go back to restocking of iron ore and met coal. And with those pricing that we will see some improved cash flow. And I think that our expectation from that and talking to customers is that we'll see a stabilization of cash flow. We don't expect to see multi-year significant declines in customer cash flow. Our customers generally believe that when they start projects in 2008, we stop in 2010, that process was very inefficient. The push to catch up in 2011 created a lot of inefficiency and gave them projects that had higher cost than they had planned for. This idea of starting stopping big projects had some negative impacts on cost efficiencies. So I'm not, at this point, I don't see multi-years significant decline in CapEx. So we really do believe CapEx is going to stabilize and what we see is the 2013 level the customers are looking for the opportunity to bring new capacity back online. First, that will be their best projects with -- there'll come in low on the marginal cost curve. But they certainly don't want to be in a position where we massively undersupply the market and when we start moving the difference between supply and demand, even though there's excess supply, the difference is not a large magnitude difference. It's a relatively small magnitude of difference. So that's why we talked about the CapEx in 2013 when we start to see improvement, it'll be back-end loaded. So on our own earnings, we have been taking cost out to restructure our business. Some of this is to reflect current market conditions. Some of it is in line with our strategic plan. This is for us an opportunity to move forward on some plan that might have taken longer had we done them by the regional plan timeline. So this will allow us to accelerate with we plan to do anyhow. But those costs that we incurred in 2012 will help us -- are helping that us to take cost out in 2013. The restructure we're doing 2013 will help us take cost out in 2014. So we, under level revenue condition, we would expect 2014 to be a better year than 2013 just as those costs movement of flow through. And we do believe that the market is on the cost of starting to see some improvement and we think that, that will have a bigger impact on our 2014. Long answer to your short question."

Earlier in the year, there'll be restructuring activities that will be a continuation of some of the activities that took place in the fourth quarter of 2012. These will be the more traditional cost reduction activities where as we went to the fourth quarter and identified opportunities, we also identified some additional opportunities that would allow us to position ourselves to establish a lower overall cost structure. These actions will take place probably either at the very end of the first quarter or most likely in the second quarter. And these, as I said, would be the more traditional cost restructuring, the reduction of headcount. Then in the latter part of 2013 as a result of the timing that will be required, we would in fact look to accelerate a strategic action that Mike had identified. If you recall, part of our strategy is to move our manufacturing capacity closer to those locations where the opportunities for growth exist. So we'll take advantage of the opportunity with some softness in the markets to downsize and possibly close those higher cost facilities and migrate manufacturing footprint to the lower locations. Those activities would take place in the latter part of 2013, primarily because of the timing and planning that would be necessary to successfully execute those. So you would be looking at 2 phases and 2 different types of price reduction activities in 2013. We still anticipate that the cost of those activities will be in that $25 million ballpark and would still be looking at paybacks in that 9-month period. Most of that, of the facility restructuring, would be realized in 2014. Some of the more traditional restructuring activities would in fact benefit the second half of 2013."

As far as the outsourcing is concerned, as we've indicated in the past, we typically have our outsourcing range from 15% to 35% of our direct labor hours. We'll never get to a situation where we would bring all of those outsourced hours in-house because then that would, in most instances, put those outsourcing partners out of business and it takes years to in fact develop them. So over the last quarter or so, we've in fact, begun to bring some of that outsourced work back into our facilities and would anticipate by the end of the 2013 fiscal year, we would be at the lower end of that outsourcing range. As we look at the low-cost manufacturing facilities, that's really an evolving process. As we look at those facilities, we initially start with utilizing material that we import into those facilities in order to maintain product quality. And then we have the supply chain organization developing the supply chain network that allows us to gradually increase the amount of local content that we incorporate into those products. so there really isn't any one percentage that I could actually give you, only to say that as we move forward, the benefits from moving to those low-cost manufacturing facilities will continue to increase as we source more of the material from those local supply chains."

It's not a low-cost country for a production. So we'll start moving the manufacturing a quick original agreement out of China to free up capacity to increase our capability to rebuild. And so that out of Australia we'll probably follow up in china and be building the machines in China with the delivery to Australia and then focus in Australia capacity on aftermarket repairs and rebuilds.

We are seeing basically taking off-line in the megaprojects, the mega-greenfield projects, had high-risk or high infrastructure investment requirements. So today, we're looking at projects that are expansions. Greenfield expansions in adjacent areas where the cost are well-known where infrastructure is closer were you can even use existing infrastructure. The areas that we will get into that broad exploratory drilling, I just don't see our customers right now having a huge appetite for that. Were starting to see that in places like Mongolia. Those projects keep taking longer and longer and longer as Mongolians continue to renegotiate their share of the project revenue streams. And we see the same thing in Congo. The risk there associated with putting those future miles of infrastructure that are required. So exploratory drilling is going to go down but they probably's coming down because of the regions where, a lot of that exploration looking for them in the next major project. I just think that those are too high on the risk profile for companies to look at right now. And as long as they can continue to expand, an adjacent space, I think that they'll gravitate the preference for doing that, and that's a lot easier in terms of defining the reserves and doing the mine find permitting. So I appreciate what you're saying in the long term, but I think in the near term over the next 3, 5, 7 years, I don't think that's going to have a huge impact on the ability of the industry to deploy CapEx and increase mining capacity."

So we just -- we don't have an interest in going down that path and with IMM there's no evidence today that we need to do that."

The projects that we booked in our fourth quarter, the projects that we see closer at hand are projects that have been on our radar scope now for 6 to 9 months. So those are projects that we have been established early on. Things that would slow down in our second quarter is our customers under pressure to reevaluate the projects and turn back CapEx, excuse me. And in that process, all these projects were taken off-line for pretty intensive reevaluation. Customers were telling us that in that process, they found opportunities to improve project economics. They changed the engineering on some of the projects. That just took longer, but that's what we're dealing with now. I think the real test of 2014 will be the flow of projects that have been earlier in their status and if our customers move from finishing projects that they've already had in process to starting up the next round of projects, I think that's going to be a clear indicator on the strength or not in 2014. And we do see those projects we're working on them with our customers. We're doing a lot of engineering and project management work.

One of the things that we, as we get into the environment where still charge it and we have an industry that has got an average age in the mid-50 years old. So shortages are a serious concern for the industry going forward. Any being able to use more services to provides the capability of monitoring and detecting without having a highly skilled individual is a real plus. So that's been a real positive for us. We've seen a lot interest in Smart Services. So it is a top of our priority aftermarket right now is top of our priority to continue to build in our strength and capture more aftermarket. The program based aftermarket is certainly the highest priority we have. There'll be more aftermarket in the programs. One of the things we do with our customers on is responding to major rebuilds, shovel outages and dragline outages. It's easier for us to make those adjustments off of a steady work base than it is to start with 0 on the call out basis and put a team of 50 people of shovel out each project that may last for 3 months. So customers are starting to understand that having base level of work with them and then adjusting from that is a lot or easier and more efficient than doing call out on case-by-case basis. So we are making progress. I think that's a trend that we have in our aftermarket revenue growth. I think we'll see that continue going forward."

This morning, I will begin with some brief comments, which expand upon our press release and which provides some additional background on the results for our fourth quarter. Mike Sutherlin will then provide an overview of our operation and our market outlook. After Mike's comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]

We may also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures, which we believe are important to understanding our business. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP metrics to GAAP, as well as other investor information, we refer you to our website at www.joyglobal.com.
Now let's spend a few moments reviewing the fourth quarter of the 2012 fiscal year.
In our press release, we include tables that provide information which makes it easier to compare the current-period results to the prior year on a consistent basis. These tables provide the results for the surface and underground mining equipment businesses on a historical basis and lists the LeTourneau and IMM results separately, along with unusual charges included in the calculation of operating profit.
My comments this morning will focus on the legacy historical results for the company's Surface and underground mining equipment businesses, excluding unusual charges listed individually in the press release, and we will break out separately the LeTourneau and IMM results.
Legacy bookings in the fourth quarter were $1.1 billion and were 15% lower than they were last year. The decrease in bookings were a result of a 5% decrease in aftermarket orders and a 27% decrease in original equipment bookings.
Aftermarket equipment bookings for the underground mining equipment business were approximately $0.09 less than they were a year ago due to fewer rebuilds in parts in the U.S. coal market and lower order rates in China, where parts orders are typically very large and sporadic in their timing, and in Eurasia. The decrease in underground market orders was partially offset as surface mining equipment aftermarket bookings increased 3%, with small increases from the prior year and aftermarket orders in South America, Australia and Africa.
The decrease in original equipment bookings was attributable to a 47% decrease in the surface mining equipment business from an exceptionally strong OE bookings quarter last year, which was partially offset by a 21% increase for underground mining equipment business.
Surface original equipment orders were down in all regions except Africa and Australia. Underground original equipment orders were up in China, Africa and Australia where an order for longwall equipment was received during the current quarter, partially offset by lower orders in the U.S. due to the soft coal market.
LeTourneau recorded $191 million of bookings in the quarter, a 65% increase from the prior year. This increase in new orders included a large order for loaders from a customer in South America. IMM recorded $40 million of bookings in the quarter, reflecting the soft demand for their products in that mid-tier market in China.
Approximately $23 million of the $70 million overall decrease in bookings in the current quarter compared to a year ago was due to the translation impact of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates.
Our investor website contains 2 graphs which track rolling four quarter new order trends for our legacy businesses for both original equipment and aftermarket. The graph reflects a continued increase in aftermarket orders for both businesses and the softness for OE bookings reported in the 2012 fiscal year.
Net sales for the legacy businesses in the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion and were 15% higher than they were a year ago. Both legacy businesses reported revenue growth, with the underground equipment business recording a 4% increase, while the surface mining equipment business had a 35% increase in net sales. The revenue growth trends for the aftermarket business continued with increased sales of 6% and 7% for the underground and surface mining equipment businesses, respectively.
Surface mining aftermarket sales were up in all regions except China and Australia, where the increase in underground aftermarket sales was associated with strong parts sales in China. Underground original equipment net sales were essentially flat with the strong quarter a year ago, while original equipment revenue for the surface  equipment business was 90% higher than OE sales in the fourth quarter last year. Higher shipments of underground equipment to Australia and China were offset by lower shipments in the United States and Africa, while strong surface equipment OE sales were reported across all regions.
LeTourneau reported net sales of $129 million in the current quarter compared to $102 million in the fourth quarter last year, a 27% increase. IMM had net sales of $52 million in the current quarter and reported softness across 3 of their 4 product lines in a challenging Chinese mid-tier market. Foreign currency translation associated with changes in the foreign currency rates decreased total net sales by $7 million compared to a year ago.
Operating profit for the legacy business in the fourth quarter was $294 million, with a 21% return on net sales compared to $282 million with a 23% return on net sales in the fourth quarter last year. Excluding the charges associated with restructuring initiatives and pension curtailment actions recorded in the current quarter, return on net sales for the legacy business would have been 22%. The $21 million of fourth quarter charges for restructuring and pension curtailment will result in reduction in the company's cost structure in fiscal 2013, and these charges were anticipated at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
The underground mining equipment business reported a 22% return on sales, 23% excluding restructuring and pension curtailment charges compared to 25% a year ago. The underground results last year, as you will remember, were extraordinarily strong, with very favorable sales mix and favorable manufacturing overhead absorption.
In the current quarter, the surface mining equipment business had a 22% return on sales, 24% excluding restructuring and pension curtailment charges compared to 22% last year. The surface business benefited from higher volumes and favorable sales mix, which was partially offset by unfavorable period costs, along with an increase in SG&A expense.
LeTourneau had operating profit of $30 million and a return on sales of 23% in the current quarter compared to $24 million and 23% return on sales in the fourth quarter last year. The integration of the LeTourneau acquisition continues on schedule and is operating at a run rate ahead of the acquisition economic model.
IMM had operating profit of $4 million before the final excess purchase accounting charge of $2 million in the fourth quarter. The IMM results reflect negatively -- were negatively affected by the low level of revenue in the current quarter.
Net income from current -- continuing operations, including the unusual items I've mentioned above, was $212 million and $1.99 per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter compared to $195 million, or $1.83 per fully diluted share last year. Net income from continuing operations in the current quarter benefited from the increase in operating profit described above, partially offset by the increase in net interest expense from $11 million last year to $17 million in the current quarter.
The income tax rate was 31.1% this quarter to 31.7% a year ago, with the improvement in the income tax rate primarily due to an increase in beneficial discrete tax items in the current quarter. For the 2013 fiscal year, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 30.5% and 31.5%, excluding discrete tax items.
Cash flow from continuing operations was $211 million in the current quarter compared to $151 million a year ago. The increase in cash provided by operations was due to an increase in net income, a decrease in -- and a decrease in inventories. These benefits were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable during -- due to the timing of sales in the latter part of our fourth quarter. There was also a decrease in accounts payable and a decrease in advanced payments associated with lower original equipment bookings.
Capital expenditures were $72 million in the current quarter compared to $35 million last year, with capital expenditures expected to be approximately $200 million in the 2013 fiscal year as we finish up some carryover projects from the 2012 fiscal year.
With that, let me turn the discussion over to Mike Sutherlin."
277517,224674673,397646,"Joy Global, Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 12, 2012",2012-12-12,"Earnings Calls","Komatsu Mining Corp.","Executives","Yes. Thank you, Mike. And let me add my welcome to those on the call.I think Mike has done a nice job of reviewing the fourth quarter and the full year, so I'll focus more on 2013. But before that, I'll make a couple of observations. First, our entire t",1875,"Yes. Thank you, Mike. And let me add my welcome to those on the call.
I think Mike has done a nice job of reviewing the fourth quarter and the full year, so I'll focus more on 2013. But before that, I'll make a couple of observations. First, our entire team finished the year strong, and this enabled us to catch up on some customer commitments and to deliver overall exceptional performance for the year. In fact, it was a year of records for us and in many aspects.
Secondly, our markets continually degraded during the year as we dealt with coal share loss to natural gas for power generation in the U.S., then the slowing of China that created supply surpluses and drove commodity prices lower. This was followed by flattening of global steel production and de-stocking of met coal and iron ore mills as a consequence. And finally, Australia began to unravel as rising cost approached weaker prices. These became cumulative impacts as the year progressed. We initially felt we could offset the drop in U.S. coal, but eventually the headwinds became too strong. This then defines the market conditions as we enter our 2013.
Our fourth quarter also included quite a bit of noise as we cut production and started the process of reducing our cost base to adjust to lower volumes in 2013. Each of these items created some drag on 2012, but they will provide potential to 2013. So let me explain.
Let's start with the markets. We have already provided a lot of information on our in-commodity markets in our press release, so I won't repeat that. However, I will emphasize that those markets have generally stabilized and now have potential for upside. In the meantime, we expect them to move sideways. For example, October's increase in power generation in China has continued into November. India's coal production is behind last year and, with stockpiles less than a week, imports will have to increase in their second half. China's import of iron ore is up 67% in August and again in September, indicating that destocking at the steel mills is ending.  India has put restrictions on its export of iron ore, and this will flip India from an exporter to an importer, adding to seaborne demand. And copper is expected to complete a destocking phase in China by year end.
There are additionally some general trends that crossed all of our markets and helped define the overall impact on us. The slowing in demand we saw in 2012 occurred as additional production was coming online. This was often from mines that were put on hold in 2008 and restarted in 2010. In fact, this was part of the increase in orders we enjoyed in 2011, and these mines started coming into production in 2012.
Increasing supply and slowing demand created surplus that drove pricing down to the marginal cost of production. You add in investor pressure on capital returns, and customer CapEx has been reduced significantly during the year. This is reflected in our rate of gross income in new orders for our legacy businesses, which excludes LeTourneau and IMM for consistent comparisons. This order rate is down 20% year-over-year, comprised of original equipment down 40% and aftermarket flat. The aftermarket has offset the drop in U.S. coal, and we are pleased to see that.
A deeper diagnostic on the income and order rate is to separate out major projects since they are generally lumpy, and even more so under current market conditions. So if we call this base orders, that number has been pretty consistent throughout 2012. This gives us confidence to use this as a run rate going into 2013. And therefore, our 2013 outlook is set on the continuation of this base order rate plus major projects.
We had over $400 million of major project bookings in 2012, and these are defined as projects of $100 million or larger. The 2012 number includes $200 million in our fourth quarter. We've previously talked about 4 major projects that were in later stages. Two of these projects, a replacement Australian longwall and a large order for LeTourneau loaders going to Brazil were booked in our fourth quarter. It's encouraging that we're finally getting these projects across the line. The remaining couple of projects are still in process. Other projects are also in process, but the predictability of timing diminishes as we look beyond our first quarter.
Although the commodity end markets have largely corrected and are poised to improve, the timing of this is uncertain. In addition, our customers do not sense urgency with the excess capacity that exists today. We believe our customers' actual CapEx spend peaked in the first half, with the year defined by more projects finishing than starting. As a result, we expect our customers' CapEx in 2012 to be roughly flat with 2011. However, the down trend in the second half indicates that CapEx spend will be down another 10% to 15% in 2013. Much of this decline started in the second half of 2012. Some of this is the result -- is also the result of caution and an unexpected delayed restart. With the cushion of excess capacity, our customers will wait until the improving trend is made clear and sustaining.
So with prices starting to recover, our customers have improved cash flows. And combined with the excess capacity depletion, we expect customer CapEx to stabilize at the 2013 levels. We also expect any improvement in CapEx to be back-end loaded in 2013. However, we are not betting on timing, and our plans for 2013 are based on current market conditions continuing.
We have all heard that the current market is not like 2009, and it's not. However, the comparison is still informative. The rate of decline in original equipment orders in 2012 was only half that experienced in 2009. In the previous downturn, the order rates dropped suddenly and quickly from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009, and that simplified year-over-year comparisons. This time around, we have had decline in incoming orders beginning in the second quarter of 2012. And therefore, we are effectively 3 quarters into the current market weakening. As a result, we will not be able to use backlog depletion in 2013 like we did in 2012. This puts more emphasis on cost reduction and restructuring.
Alternatively, we carry equipment backlog into 2013 that covers about 3/4 of our production schedule, giving us confidence in our plan for this coming year. We are taking out cost to size our business to the lower market we see for 2013. We incurred $20 million in charges in the fourth quarter to restructure and lower our cost base. About half this was adjusting to lower production volumes and the other half to restructure some of our pension plans from defined benefit, defined contribution. The latter reduces our pension costs and makes them -- those costs much more predictable. In addition, we plan to incur another $25 million in 2013 to rebalance and optimize our manufacturing. This is a combination of adjusting to structural changes in the U.S. coal market, increasing our manufacturing capacity in China, consolidating certain satellite factories and dual-use facilities, and eliminating duplicate costs as we implement One Joy Global.
We have targeted decremental operating margins at 34%. This reflects the fixed cost in our manufacturing operations and allows us to retain our field service personnel and to continue funding key research and development projects that we expect to generate significant additional revenues in future years. Restructuring charges enabled this 34% decremental margin, but there's also $40 million dollars of 2012 cost that will go away, primarily excess first year purchase accounting charges that are over and above restructuring and not included in this decremental calculation.
I also want to address IMM, which has been disappointing in 2012, but which we expect to recover in 2013. The integration issues are always complex, but that was compounded by the slowdown in the China market. The hiatus around the regime change in China did not help. And in fact, this made our fourth quarter look especially bad.
But we are in the midst of technology transfers that will give IMM products that have a competitive advantage, and we are starting the diagnostic phase of operational excellence. More importantly, we are changing IMM from acting like a holding company to being an operating company. The integration team, including IMM management, is digging in to every aspect of the business, and we are finding more opportunity. Early indications are good, with order rates starting to return.
And finally, let me address cash flow. We expect free cash flow to increase in 2013 as lower volumes allow us to monetize working capital. There are additional sources that will favorably impact free cash flow. Cash flow was reduced in 2012 by increased CapEx and the continuation of elevated pension funding. CapEx will come down in 2013 as we, like our customers, finish more projects than we start. And we expect our U.S. pensions to reach our funding targets by the end of 2013.
With increased cash, free cash flow, capital allocation becomes an issue. We continue to believe that strategic acquisitions provide the path to highest returns, but we recognize that timing is not predictable. And as a result, our default value is share buybacks. However, we will not make a definitive decision till we have accumulated cash balances that will enable us to have meaningful execution. This then gives us the basis for our 2013 guidance.
We expect and are planning for revenues to be between $4.9 billion to $5.2 billion in fiscal 2013. After capturing the benefit of completing the excess purchase accounting for both LeTourneau and IMM and applying our decremental target of 34% to the adjusted cost base, results in our expectation of earnings per fully diluted share to be between $5.90 to $6.50. This is before the cost of restructuring programs in 2013, which we said would be $25 million. Therefore, all-in EPS is expected to be between $5.75 to $6.35 per share.
So before closing, I want to remind you about the seasonality that impacts our first quarter. The disproportional number of holidays that fall into our fiscal first quarter adversely impacts revenues. Fixed cost, additionally, impact operating profit and margins, and this needs to be considered and anticipated and evaluated in our first quarter.
And finally, this is Mike Olsen's final earnings call. I've never had a better, more capable and more dedicated CFO. Mike's work ethic is legendary, and no one is more committed to the best interest of this company. We ultimately better know that Mike has blessed the numbers. He has earned the respect of the entire Joy Global team, our Board of Directors, our investors and shareholders and most of you on this call. Mike, you'll be greatly missed but never forgotten. So thank you for 33 years of excellence. Yours will be big shoes to fill, but there's no one more capable of doing that than Jim Sullivan. So, Jim, welcome, and good luck.
Anyhow, with that, I'll turn the call to questions. So, Augusta, back to you."

The flattish aftermarket we had was largely the international markets growing year-over-year and offsetting the decline we've seen in the U.S. coal markets. So we've seen a pretty significant decline in the U.S. coal market, not unlike that which we saw in 2009. Different reasons, but the magnitudes are not all that dissimilar. So a fairly significant decline in a large sector for us, and we've -- saw the aftermarket in other regions around the world capable of offsetting that. We do have a pretty consistent aftermarket on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, we could get some lumpiness for -- for example, from China, we'll get large aftermarket orders, 3 or 4 times a year rather than monthly. So the fact we've got a large order in our third quarter from China, that became aftermarket revenue in our fourth quarter as we delivered that order. So I think you've got to look at the year-over-year more so than the fourth quarter, just because the predictability of aftermarket even on a quarterly basis, particularly with large parts orders, is not absolutely crystal clear and it's not always consistent. As we look at 2013, we've gone back and looked at our aftermarket business over long periods of time. And aftermarket has historically -- in worse conditions, is flat in 2009. We saw aftermarket flatten out, and I think it demonstrates the stability there. And we're looking today -- the aftermarket is generally aligned to production rates. So we're looking at some decline in production rates, but not massive declines globally in production rates. The U.S. is going to seem a little bit more severe because it's -- there are structural changes. The coal volume in the U.S. is not down all that much. It's like 5% or 8% or something in production, but much more in Central Appalachia, and we're seeing increases in Illinois Basin. So that structural dislocation is having a bigger impact on aftermarket in the U.S. And yet, through 2012, we were able to offset that out via international markets. Generally, those adjustments are more severe at the early stages as people de-stock inventories at mine sites and park equipment and things like that. And then they begin to move back up to a little bit of higher level where we see stabilization. So in that regard, 2012 would represent what we would expect to be probably the worst year for U.S. underground coal aftermarket. So you put all the things together, and I think we still believe that the aftermarket is going to be able to stabilize over 2013, given what we see: new machines coming into the fleet, machines moving into their first rebuild cycle, production levels internationally coming off a bit but not dramatically. And you put all that into the equation, and we expect our aftermarket to hold its own in 2013."

And cash flow dropped pretty dramatically in 2012 as commodity pricing came down. And we've seen commodity prices in the second half stabilize. And in the fourth quarter, we saw the -- it starting to move up in commodity price. Certainly, iron ore has regained a lot of its loss, so we're starting to see some -- well, we're seeing roll over in met coal, but we expect the first quarter to be better as the steel mills go back to restocking of iron ore and met coal. And with those pricing, that we will see some improved cash flow, and I think that our expectation from that and talking to customers is that we'll see a stabilization of cash flow. We're not -- we don't expect to see multi-year significant declines in customer cash flow. Our customers generally believe that when they stopped projects in 2008, we restarted them in 2010. That process was very inefficient. The push to catch up in 2011 created a lot of inefficiency and gave them projects that had higher cost than they had planned for. So this idea of starting/stopping big projects had some negative impacts on cost efficiencies. So I'm not -- at this point, I don't see multi-year significant declines in CapEx. So we really do believe CapEx is going to stabilize, that what we see is that 2013 level. And our customers are looking for the opportunity to bring new capacity back online. First, that will be their best projects with -- they'll come in low on the marginal cost curve, but they certainly don't want to be in a position where we massively undersupply the market. And when we start moving the difference between supply and demand, even though there's excess supply today, the difference is not a large-magnitude difference. It's a relatively small magnitude of difference. So that's why we talked about the CapEx. In 2013, when we start to see improvement, it'll be back-end loaded. So on our own earnings, we have been taking costs out to restructure our business. Some of this is to reflect current market conditions. Some of it is in line with our strategic plan. This is, for us, an opportunity to move forward on some plans that might have taken longer had we done them by the original planned time line. So this will allow us to accelerate what we plan to do anyhow. But those costs that we incurred in 2012 will help us -- are helping us to take cost out in 2013. The restructuring we're doing in 2013 will help us take more cost out in 2014. So we -- under level revenue conditions, we would expect 2014 to be a better year than 2013, just as those cost improvements flow through. And we do believe that the market is on the cusp of starting to see some improvement. And we think that, that will have -- make a bigger impact on our 2014. Long answer to a short question but..."

Earlier in the year, there'll be restructuring activities that will be a continuation of some of the activities that took place in the fourth quarter of 2012. These will be the more traditional cost reduction activities where, as we went to the fourth quarter and identified opportunities, we also identified some additional opportunities that would allow us to position ourselves to establish a lower overall cost structure. These actions will take place probably either at the very end of the first quarter or most likely in the second quarter. And these, as I said, would be the more traditional cost restructurings, the reduction of headcount. Then in the latter part of 2013, as a result of the timing that will be required, we would in fact look to accelerate a strategic action that Mike had identified. If you recall, part of our strategy is to move our manufacturing capacity closer to those locations where the opportunities for growth exist. So we'll take advantage of the opportunity with some softness in the markets to downsize and possibly close those higher-cost facilities and migrate manufacturing footprint to the lower-cost locations. Those activities would take place in the latter part of 2013, primarily because of the timing and planning that would be necessary to successfully execute those. So you would be looking at 2 phases and 2 different types of cost reduction activities in 2013. We still anticipate that the cost of those activities will be in that $25-million ballpark and would still be looking at paybacks in that 9-month period. Most of that, of the facility restructuring, would be realized in 2014. Some of the more traditional restructuring activities would, in fact, benefit the second half of 2013."

As far as the outsourcing is concerned, as we've indicated in the past, we typically have our outsourcing range from 15% to 35% of our direct labor hours. We'll never get to a situation where we will bring all of those outsourced labor hours in-house because then, that would, in most instances, put those outsourcing partners out of business. And it takes years to, in fact, develop them. So over the last quarter or so, we've, in fact, begun to bring some of that outsourced work back into our facilities and would anticipate by the end of the 2013 fiscal year, we would be at the lower end of that outsourcing range. As we look at the low-cost manufacturing facilities, that's really an evolving process. As we look at those facilities, we initially start with utilizing material that we import into those facilities in order to maintain product quality. And then we have the supply chain organization developing the supply chain network that allows us to gradually increase the amount of local content that we incorporate into those products. So there really isn't any one percentage that I could actually give you, only to say that as we move forward, the benefits from moving to those low-cost manufacturing facilities will continue to increase as we source more of the material from those local supply chains."

Some of the restructuring that we're going to do in 2013, I'll give you just an example, is we have -- in our Australian operations, we have increasing aftermarket requirements based on equipment we've been delivering over the last couple of years. It's not a low-cost country for production, so we'll start moving the manufacturing of original agreement out of China to free up capacity to increase our capabilities of doing rebuilds. And so that out of Australia, we'll probably move that to China and be building the machines in China for delivery to Australia, and then focus in on Australia capacity on aftermarket repairs and rebuilds. And there's a number of other projects that we have that are sort of similar nature, but it sort of gives you a flavor of -- so when we talk about optimizing our manufacturing facility, that's sort of what we're talking about doing, is -- that is one example of several, but they're all fairly consistent in style and the overall impact."

I think that -- over the course of 2012, I think that our customers have refocused primarily on lower cost to execute projects, things that have quicker returns to production. We're seeing basically a -- taking off-line the megaprojects, the mega-greenfield projects, particularly those that had high-risk or high infrastructure investment requirements. So today, we're looking at projects that are brownfield expansions, greenfield expansions in adjacent areas where the cost are well known, where infrastructure is closer. You could even use existing infrastructure. The areas where we get into, that broad exploratory drilling, I just don't see our customers right now having a huge appetite for that. Were starting to see that in places like Mongolia. Those projects keep taking longer and longer and longer as the Mongolians continue to renegotiate their share of the project revenue streams. And we see the same thing in Congo, the risk there associated with putting those future amounts of infrastructure that are required. So exploratory drilling is going to go down, but I think -- probably, that's coming down because of the regions where a lot of that large exploration, looking for them -- the next major project. I just think that those are too high on the risk profile for companies to look at right now. And as long as they can continue to expand in adjacent space, I think that they'll gravitate a preference for doing that, and that's a lot easier in terms of defining the reserves and doing the mine finding and permitting. So I appreciate what you're saying in the long term, but I think in the near term, over the next 3, 5, 7 years, I don't think that, that's going to have a huge impact on the ability of the industry to deploy CapEx and increase mining capacity."

IMM is -- we had a period where their management was distracted with the approval -- MOFCOM approval process and tendering process. We were a little slow to get our hands on that business and really dig in. But over and above that, we saw the weaker market conditions affect them. Certainly, if we look at some of their customers, we've seen production declines in some of their customers, consistent with the slowing we've talked about in the China market. We're starting to see that coming back. We're seeing the early stages of electricity demand improvement, which will be a driver for coal production domestically. But we expect IMM to need to reverse its path. It's not going to be jumping up to prior levels. It'll be a climb out during the year, and we think that we'll see -- the first quarter of this year, we'll start to see that improvement, but it'll be on a trend that will get us back to where we were by the end of this year.

We also believe that, that's somewhat due to us and the dealer distributor networks that they used. We haven't managed those as aggressively as we needed to, and we're getting those guys back in focus. And we're spending a lot more time in the dealer distributor network, rather than relying on them to work the market on their own initiative. I think that's a big factor. We certainly don't see -- today, we don't see pricing erosion, that we've got to go and do deep discounts to get that market share back. We think we can get that market share back on performance. So we certainly -- early on, we're starting to see the improvement in order bookings out of IMM, consistent with those expectations. So the bottom line is that, yes, there is some aggressive competition. We believe that we can hold our own and gain back market share on those product lines. And we don't believe that we need to do deep price discounting due to the fact that this industry continues to demonstrate that price elasticity is virtually vertical. So we just -- we don't have an interest in going down that path. And with IMM, there's no evidence today that we need to do that."

They changed the engineering on some of the projects. That just took longer, but that's what we're dealing with now.

As we look at our life-cycle management programs, we continually demonstrate that we can deliver better results for our customers. Those results are not necessarily lower cost, but we can deliver higher reliability in our machines, better productivity in machines, better uptime. We have a better capability of judging the remaining life in components, the need to -- time to make those changes. Smart Services is formalizing that in ways that we can connect into our customers' business systems to order parts, to have those available in a mine site when we need them. All those kind of things improves the predictability and the productivity and efficiency of those mining operations. Our customers see that in -- where we have those programs deployed, we are seeing increased use of those programs by those customers. And certainly, there is upside in doing that. One of the things that we -- as we get into an environment where skill shortages come into play, and we have an industry that's got an average age in the mid-50 years old, so skill shortages are a serious concern for the industry going forward. And being able to use more services to provide the capability of monitoring and detecting without having to have highly skilled individuals is a real plus. And so that's been a real positive for us. We've seen a lot interest in Smart Services. So it is top of our priority. Aftermarket right now is top of our priority, continue to build on our strength and capture more aftermarket. The program-based aftermarket is certainly the highest priority we have. There'll be more aftermarket in the programs. Other things we deal with our customers on is just responding to major rebuilds, shovel outages and dragline outages. It's easier for us to make those adjustments off of a steady work base than it is to start with 0 on a call-out basis and put a team of 50 people on a shovel outage project that may last for 3 months. So customers are starting to understand that having base-level work with them and then adjusting from that is a lot easier and more efficient than doing call out on a case-by-case basis. So we are making progress. I think that's in the trend that we have in our aftermarket revenue growth. And I think you'll see that continue going forward."

Mike Sutherlin will then provide an overview of our operations and our market outlook. After Mike's comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]

Now let's spend a few moments reviewing the fourth quarter of the 2012 fiscal year.
In our press release, we include tables that provide information which makes it easier to compare the current-period results to the prior year on a consistent basis. These tables provide the results for the surface and underground mining equipment businesses on an historical basis and lists the LeTourneau and IMM results separately, along with unusual charges included in the calculation of operating profit.
My comments this morning will focus on the legacy historical results for the company's surface and underground mining equipment businesses, excluding unusual charges listed individually in the press release, and we will break out separately the LeTourneau and IMM results.
Legacy bookings in the fourth quarter were $1.1 billion and were 15% lower than they were last year. The decrease in bookings was a result of a 5% decrease in aftermarket orders and a 27% decrease in original equipment bookings.
Aftermarket equipment bookings for the underground mining equipment business were approximately 9% less than they were a year ago due to fewer rebuilds and parts in the U.S. coal market; and lower order rates in China, where parts orders are typically very large and sporadic in their timing; and in Eurasia. The decrease in underground market orders was partially offset as surface mining equipment aftermarket bookings increased 3%, with small increases from the prior year in aftermarket orders in South America, Australia and Africa.
The decrease in original equipment bookings was attributable to a 47% decrease in the surface mining equipment business from an exceptionally strong OE bookings quarter last year, which was partially offset by a 21% increase for underground mining equipment business. Surface original equipment orders were down in all regions except Africa and Australia. Underground original equipment orders were up in China, Africa and Australia, where an order for longwall equipment was received during the current quarter, partially offset by lower orders in the U.S. due to the soft coal market.
LeTourneau recorded $191 million of bookings in the quarter, a 65% increase from the prior year. This increase in new orders included a large order for loaders from a customer in South America. IMM recorded $40 million of bookings in the quarter, reflecting the soft demand for their products in the mid-tier market in China.
Approximately $23 million of the $70-million overall decrease in bookings in the current quarter compared to a year ago was due to the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our investor website contains 2 graphs which track rolling 4-quarter new order trends for our legacy businesses for both original equipment and aftermarket. The graphs reflect a continued increase in aftermarket orders for both businesses and the softness for OE bookings reported in the 2012 fiscal year.
Net sales for the legacy businesses in the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion and were 15% higher than they were a year ago. Both legacy businesses reported revenue growth, with the underground equipment business recording a 4% increase, while the surface mining equipment business had a 35% increase in net sales. The revenue growth trends for the aftermarket business continued with increased sales of 6% and 7% for the underground and surface mining equipment businesses, respectively.
Surface mining aftermarket sales were up in all regions except China and Australia, where the increase in underground aftermarket sales was associated with strong parts sales in China. Underground original equipment net sales were essentially flat with the strong quarter a year ago, while original equipment revenue for the surface equipment business was 90% higher than OE sales in the fourth quarter last year. Higher shipments of underground equipment to Australia and China were offset by lower shipments in the United States and Africa, while strong surface equipment OE sales were reported across all regions.
LeTourneau reported net sales of $129 million in the current quarter compared to $102 million in the fourth quarter last year, a 27% increase. IMM had net sales of $52 million in the current quarter and reported softness across 3 of their 4 product lines in a challenging Chinese mid-tier market. Foreign currency translation associated with changes in the foreign currency rates decreased total net sales by $7 million compared to a year ago.
Operating profit for the legacy business in the fourth quarter was $294 million, with a 21% return on net sales, compared to $282 million with a 23% return on net sales in the fourth quarter last year. Excluding the charges associated with restructuring initiatives and pension curtailment actions recorded in the current quarter, return on net sales for the legacy business would have been 22%. The $21 million of fourth quarter charges for restructuring and pension curtailment will result in reduction in the company's cost structure in fiscal 2013, and these charges were anticipated at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
The underground mining equipment business reported a 22% return on sales, 23% excluding restructuring and pension curtailment charges, compared to 25% a year ago. The underground results last year, as you will remember, were extraordinarily strong, with very favorable sales mix and favorable manufacturing overhead absorption.
In the current quarter, the surface mining equipment business had a 22% return on sales, 24% excluding restructuring and pension curtailment charges, compared to 22% last year. The surface business benefited from higher volumes and favorable sales mix, which was partially offset by unfavorable period costs, along with an increase in SG&A expense.
LeTourneau had operating profit of $30 million and a return on sales of 23% in the current quarter, compared to $24 million and 23% return on sales in the fourth quarter last year. The integration of the LeTourneau acquisition continues on schedule and is operating at a run rate ahead of the acquisition economic model.
IMM had operating profit of $4 million before the final excess purchase accounting charge of $2 million in the fourth quarter. The IMM results reflect negatively -- were negatively affected by the low level of revenue in the current quarter.
Net income from current -- continuing operations, including the unusual items I've mentioned above, was $212 million and $1.99 per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter compared to $195 million, or $1.83 per fully diluted share last year. Net income from continuing operations in the current quarter benefited from the increase in operating profit described above, partially offset by the increase in net interest expense from $11 million last year to $17 million in the current quarter.
The income tax rate was 31.1% this quarter to 31.7% a year ago, with the improvement in the income tax rate primarily due to an increase in beneficial discrete tax items in the current quarter. For the 2013 fiscal year, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 30.5% and 31.5%, excluding discrete tax items.
Cash flow from continuing operations was $211 million in the current quarter compared to $151 million a year ago. The increase in cash provided by operations was due to an increase in net income, a decrease in -- and a decrease in inventories. These benefits were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable during -- due to the timing of sales in the latter part of our fourth quarter. There was also a decrease in accounts payable and a decrease in advanced payments associated with lower original equipment bookings.
Capital expenditures were $72 million in the current quarter compared to $35 million last year, with capital expenditures expected to be approximately $200 million in the 2013 fiscal year as we finish up some carryover projects from the 2012 fiscal year.
With that, let me turn the discussion over to Mike Sutherlin."
277517,224674673,397704,"Joy Global, Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 12, 2012",2012-12-12,"Earnings Calls","Komatsu Mining Corp.","Executives","Yes. Thank you, Mike. And let me add my welcome to those on the call.I think Mike's done a nice job of reviewing the fourth quarter and the full year, so I'll focus more on 2013. But before I do, I want to make a couple of observations. First, our entir",1880,"Yes. Thank you, Mike. And let me add my welcome to those on the call.
I think Mike's done a nice job of reviewing the fourth quarter and the full year, so I'll focus more on 2013. But before I do, I want to make a couple of observations. First, our entire team finished the year strong, and this enabled us to catch up on some customer commitments and to deliver overall exceptional performance for the year. In fact, it was a year of records for us and in many aspects.
Secondly, our markets continually degraded during the year, as we dealt with coal share loss to natural gas for power generation in the U.S., and a slowing of China that created supply surpluses and drove commodity prices lower. This was followed by flattening of global steel production and de-stocking of met coal and iron ore mills as a consequence. And finally, Australia began to unravel as rising costs approached weaker prices. These became cumulative impacts as the year progressed. We initially felt we could offset the drop in U.S. coal, but eventually the headwinds became too strong. This then defines the market conditions as we enter our 2013.
Our fourth quarter also included quite a bit of noise, as we cut production and started the process of reducing our cost base to adjust to lower volumes in 2013. Each of these items created some drag on 2012, but they will provide potential to 2013. So let me explain.
Let's start with the markets. We have already provided a lot of information on our end commodity markets in our press release, so I won't repeat that. However, I will emphasize that those markets have generally stabilized and now have potential for upside. In the meantime, we expect them to move sideways. For example, October's increase in power generation in China has continued into November. India's coal production is behind last year, and with stockpiles less than a week, imports will have to increase in their second half. China's import of iron ore is up 6 to 7% in August and again in September, indicating that destocking at the steel mills is ending. India has put restrictions on its export of iron ore, and this will flip India from an exporter to an importer, adding to seaborne demand. And copper is expected to complete a destocking phase in China by year end.
There are additionally some general trends that cross all of our markets and help define the overall impact on us. The slowing in demand we saw in 2012 occurred as additional production was coming online. This was often from mines that were put on hold in 2008 and restarted in 2010. In fact, this was part of the increase in orders we enjoyed in 2011, and these mines started coming into production in 2012.
Increasing supply and slowing demand created surplus that drove pricing down to the marginal cost of production. You add in investor pressure on capital returns, and customer CapEx has been reduced significantly during the year. This is reflected in our rate of gross income in new orders for our legacy businesses, which excludes LeTourneau and IMM for consistent comparisons. This order rate is down 20% year-over-year, comprised of original equipment down 40% and aftermarket flat. The aftermarket has offset the drop in U.S. coal, and we are pleased to see that.
A deeper diagnostic on the income and order rate is to separate out major projects since they are generally lumpy, and even more so under current market conditions. So if we call this base orders, that number has been pretty consistent throughout 2012. This gives us confidence to use this as a run rate going into 2013. And therefore, our 2013 outlook is set on the continuation of this base order rate plus major projects.
We had over $400 million of major project bookings in 2012, and these are defined as projects of $100 million or larger. The 2012 number includes $200 million in our fourth quarter. We've previously talked about 4 major projects that were in later stages. Two of these projects, a replacement Australian longwall and a large order for LeTourneau loaders going to Brazil, were booked in our fourth quarter. It's encouraging that we're finally getting these projects across the line. The remaining couple of projects are still in process. Other projects are also in process, but the predictability of timing diminishes as we look beyond our first quarter.
Although the commodity end markets have largely corrected and are poised to improve, the timing of this is uncertain. In addition, our customers do not sense urgency with the excess capacity that exists today. We believe our customers' actual CapEx spend peaked in the first half, with the year defined by more projects finishing than starting. As a result, we expect our customers' CapEx in 2012 to be roughly flat with 2011. However, the down trend in the second half indicates that CapEx spend will be down another 10% to 15% in 2013. Much of this decline started in the second half of 2012. Some of this is the result -- is also the result of caution and an expected delayed restart. With the cushion of excess capacity, our customers will wait until the improving trend is made clear and sustaining.
But with prices starting to recover, our customers have improved cash flows. And combined with the excess capacity depletion, we expect customer CapEx to stabilize at the 2013 levels. We also expect any improvement in CapEx to be back-end-loaded in 2013. However, we are not betting on timing, and our plans for 2013 are based on current market conditions continuing.
We have all heard that the current market is not like 2009, and it's not. However, the comparison is still informative. The rate of decline in original equipment orders in 2012 was only half that experienced in 2009. In the previous downturn, the order rate dropped suddenly and quickly from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009, and that simplified year-over-year comparisons. This time around, we have had decline in incoming orders beginning in the second quarter of 2012. And therefore, we are effectively 3 quarters into the current market weakening. As a result, we will not be able to use backlog depletion in 2013 like we did in 2012. This puts more emphasis on cost reduction and restructuring.
Alternatively, we carry equipment backlog into 2013 that covers about 3/4 of our production schedule, giving us confidence in our plan for this coming year. We are taking out costs to size our business to the lower market we see for 2013. We incurred $20 million in charges in the fourth quarter to restructure and lower our cost base. About half this was adjusting to lower production volumes and the other half to restructure some of our pension plans from defined benefit, defined contribution. The latter reduces our pension costs and makes them -- those costs much more predictable. In addition, we plan to incur another $25 million in 2013 to rebalance and optimize our manufacturing. This is a combination of adjusting to structural changes in the U.S. coal market, increasing our manufacturing capacity in China, consolidating certain satellite factories and dual-use facilities, and eliminating duplicate costs as we implement One Joy Global.
We have targeted decremental operating margins at 34%. This reflects the fixed cost in our manufacturing operations and allows us to retain our field service personnel and to continue funding key research and development projects that we expect to generate significant additional revenues in future years. Restructuring charges enabled this 34% decremental margin, but there's also $40 million dollars of 2012 cost that will go away, primarily excess first year purchase accounting charges that are over and above restructuring and not included in this decremental calculation.
I also want to address IMM, which has been disappointing in 2012, but which we expect to recover in 2013. The integration issues were always complex, but that was compounded by the slowdown in the China market. The hiatus around the regime change in China did not help. And in fact, this made our fourth quarter look especially bad.
But we are in the midst of technology transfers that will give IMM products that have a competitive advantage, and we are starting the diagnostic phase of operational excellence. More importantly, we are changing IMM from acting like a holding company to being an operating company. Our integration team, including IMM management, is digging into every aspect of the business, and we are finding more opportunity. Early indications are good, with order rates starting to return.
And finally, let me address cash flow. We expect free cash flow to increase in 2013 as lower volumes allow us to monetize working capital. There are additional sources that will favorably impact free cash flow. Cash flow was reduced in 2012 by increased CapEx and the continuation of elevated pension funding. CapEx will come down in 2013 as we, like our customers, finish more projects than we start. And we expect our U.S. pensions to reach our funding targets by the end of 2013.
With increased cash -- free cash flow, capital allocation becomes an issue. We continue to believe that strategic acquisitions provide the path to highest returns, but we recognize that timing is not predictable. And as a result, our default value is share buybacks. However, we will not make a definitive decision until we have accumulated cash balances that will enable us to have meaningful execution.
This then gives us the basis for our 2013 guidance. We expect and are planning for revenues to be between $4.9 billion to $5.2 billion in fiscal 2013. After capturing the benefit of completing the excess purchase accounting for both LeTourneau and IMM and applying our decremental target of 34% to the adjusted cost base, results in our expectation of earnings per fully diluted share to be between $5.90 to $6.50. This is before the cost of restructuring programs in 2013, which we said would be $25 million. Therefore, all-in EPS is expected to be between $5.75 to $6.35 per share.
So before closing, I want to remind you about the seasonality that impacts our first quarter. The disproportional number of holidays that fall into our fiscal first quarter adversely impact revenues. Fixed costs additionally impact operating profit and margins, and this needs to be considered and anticipated and evaluated in our first quarter.
And finally, this is Mike Olsen's final earnings call. I've never had a better, more capable and more dedicated CFO. Mike's work ethic is legendary, and no one is more committed to the best interest of this company. We all sleep better knowing that Mike has blessed the numbers. He has earned the respect of the entire Joy Global team, our Board of Directors, our investors and shareholders and most of you on this call. Mike, you'll be greatly missed but never forgotten. So thank you for 33 years of excellence. Yours will be big shoes to fill, but there's no one more capable of doing that than Jim Sullivan. So, Jim, welcome, and good luck.
Anyhow, with that, I'll turn the call to questions. So, Augusta, back to you."

The flattish aftermarket we had was largely the international markets growing year-over-year and offsetting the decline we've seen in the U.S. coal markets. So we've seen a pretty significant decline in the U.S. coal market, not unlike that which we saw in 2009. Different reasons, but the magnitudes are not all that dissimilar. So a fairly significant decline in a large sector for us, and we've -- saw the aftermarket in other regions around the world capable of offsetting that. We do have a pretty consistent aftermarket on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, we could get some lumpiness for -- for example, from China, we'll get large aftermarket orders 3 or 4 times a year rather than monthly. So the fact we got a large order in our third quarter from China, that became aftermarket revenue in our fourth quarter as we delivered that order. So I think you've got to look at the year-over-year more so than the fourth quarter, just because the predictability of aftermarket, even on a quarterly basis, particularly with large parts orders, is not absolutely crystal clear and it's not always consistent. As we look at 2013, we've gone back and looked at our aftermarket business over long periods of time. And aftermarket has historically -- in worse conditions, was flat in 2009. We saw aftermarket flatten out, and I think it demonstrates the stability there. And we're looking today -- the aftermarket is generally aligned to production rates. So we're looking at some decline in production rates, but not massive declines globally in production rates. The U.S. is going to seem a little bit more severe because it's -- there are structural changes. The coal volume in the U.S. is not down all that much. It's like 5% or 8% or something in production, but much more in Central Appalachia, and we're seeing increases in Illinois Basin. So that structural dislocation is having a bigger impact on aftermarket in the U.S. And yet, through 2012, we were able to offset that out via international markets. Generally, those adjustments are more severe at the early stages as people destock inventories at mine sites and park equipment and things like that. And then they begin to move back up to a little bit higher level where we see stabilization. So in that regard, 2012 would represent what we would expect to be probably the worst year for U.S. underground coal aftermarket. So you put all the things together, and I think we still believe that the aftermarket is going to be able to stabilize over 2013, given what we see: new machines coming into the fleet, machines moving into their first rebuild cycle, production levels internationally coming off a bit but not dramatically. And you put all that into the equation, and we expect our aftermarket to hold its own in 2013."

And cash flow dropped pretty dramatically in 2012 as commodity pricing came down. And we've seen commodity prices in the second half stabilize. And in the fourth quarter, we saw the -- it starting to move up in commodity price. Certainly, iron ore has regained a lot of its loss, so we're starting to see some -- well, we're seeing rollover in met coal, but we expect the first quarter to be better as the steel mills go back to restocking of iron ore and met coal. And with those pricing up a little, we will see some improved cash flow, and I think that our expectation from that and talking to customers is that we'll see a stabilization of cash flow. We're not -- we don't expect to see multiyear significant declines in customer cash flow. Our customers generally believe that when they stopped projects in 2008, restarted them in 2010, that process was very inefficient. The push to catch up in 2011 created a lot of inefficiency and gave them projects that had higher costs than they had planned for. So this idea of starting/stopping big projects had some negative impacts on cost efficiencies. So I'm not -- at this point, I don't see multiyear significant declines in CapEx. So we really do believe CapEx is going to stabilize, that what we see is the 2013 level. And our customers are looking for the opportunity to bring new capacity back online. First, that will be their best projects with -- they'll come in low on the marginal cost curve, but they certainly don't want to be in a position where we massively undersupply the market. And when we start moving the difference between supply and demand, even though there's excess supply today, the difference is not a large-magnitude difference. It's a relatively small magnitude of difference. So that's why we talked about the CapEx. In 2013, when we start to see improvement, it'll be back-end loaded. So on our own earnings, we have been taking costs out to restructure our business. Some of this is to reflect current market conditions. Some of it is in line with our strategic plan. This is, for us, an opportunity to move forward on some plans that might have taken longer had we done them by the original planned time line. So this will allow us to accelerate what we plan to do anyhow. But those costs that we incurred in 2012 will help us -- are helping us to take cost out in 2013. The restructuring we're doing in 2013 will help us to take more cost out in 2014. So we -- under level revenue conditions, we would expect 2014 to be a better year than 2013, just as those cost improvements flow through. And we do believe that the market is on the cusp of starting to see some improvement. And we think that, that will have -- make a bigger impact on our 2014. Long answer to a short question but..."

Earlier in the year, there'll be restructuring activities that will be a continuation of some of the activities that took place in the fourth quarter of 2012. These will be the more traditional cost reduction activities where, as we went through the fourth quarter and identified opportunities, we also identified some additional opportunities that would allow us to position ourselves to establish a lower overall cost structure. These actions will take place probably either at the very end of the first quarter or most likely in the second quarter. And these, as I said, would be the more traditional cost restructurings, the reduction of headcount. Then in the latter part of 2013, as a result of the timing that will be required, we would in fact look to accelerate the strategic actions that Mike had identified. If you recall, part of our strategy is to move our manufacturing capacity closer to those locations where the opportunities for growth exist. So we'll take advantage of the opportunity with some softness in the markets to downsize and possibly close those higher-cost facilities and migrate manufacturing footprint to the lower-cost locations. Those activities would take place in the latter part of 2013, primarily because of the timing and planning that would be necessary to successfully execute those. So you would be looking at 2 phases and 2 different types of cost reduction activities in 2013. We still anticipate that the cost of those activities will be in that $25-million ballpark and would still be looking at paybacks in that 9-month period. Most of that, of the facility restructuring, would be realized in 2014. Some of the more traditional restructuring activities would, in fact, benefit the second half of 2013."

As far as the outsourcing is concerned, as we've indicated in the past, we typically have our outsourcing range from 15% to 35% of our direct labor hours. We'll never get to a situation where we will bring all of those outsourced labor hours in-house, because then that would in most instances, put those outsourcing partners out of business. And it takes years to, in fact, develop them. So over the last quarter or so, we've in fact begun to bring some of that outsourced work back into our facilities and would anticipate by the end of the 2013 fiscal year, we would be at the lower end of that outsourcing range. As we look at the low-cost manufacturing facilities, that's really an evolving process. As we look at those facilities, we initially start with utilizing material that we import into those facilities in order to maintain product quality. And then we have the supply chain organization developing the supply chain network that allows us to gradually increase the amount of local content that we incorporate into those products. So there really isn't any one percentage that I could actually give you, only to say that as we move forward, the benefits from moving to those low-cost manufacturing facilities will continue to increase as we source more of the material from those local supply chains."

It's not a low-cost country for production, so we'll start moving the manufacturing of original equipment out of China to free up capacity to increase our capabilities of doing rebuilds. And so that -- out of Australia, we'll probably move that to China and be building the machines in China for delivery to Australia, and then focus in on Australia capacity on aftermarket repairs and rebuilds.

I think that -- over the course of 2012, I think that our customers have refocused primarily on lower cost to execute projects, things that have quicker returns to production. We're seeing basically a -- taking off-line the megaprojects, the mega-greenfield projects, particularly those that had high-risk or high infrastructure investment requirements. So today, we're looking at projects that are brownfield expansions, greenfield expansions in adjacent areas where the costs are well known, where infrastructure is closer. You could even use existing infrastructure. The areas where we get into that broad exploratory drilling, I just don't see our customers right now having a huge appetite for that. We're certainly seeing that in places like Mongolia. Those projects keep taking longer and longer and longer as the Mongolians continue to renegotiate their share of the project revenue streams. And we see the same thing in Congo, the risk there associated with putting those huge amounts of infrastructure that are required. So exploratory drilling is going to go down, but I think probably, that's coming down because of the regions where a lot of that large exploration, looking for the next major project, I just think that those are too high on the risk profile for companies to look at right now. And as long as they can continue to expand in adjacent space, I think that they'll gravitate the preference for doing that, and that's a lot easier in terms of defining the reserves and doing the mine finding and permitting. So I appreciate what you're saying in the long term, but I think in the nearer term, over the next 3, 5, 7 years, I don't think that, that's going to have a huge impact on the ability of the industry to deploy CapEx and increase mining capacity."

I don't have the specific numbers, but we're not -- we're seeing its market flatten out. The order we got from Brazil is a nice order, but it's deliverable over a period of time. So that's not necessarily taking the next production slots. It's spread out over the next 12 to 18 months. So we're looking at LeTourneau to be roughly flat year-over-year with what we saw in 2012. IMM is -- we had a period where their management was distracted with the approval -- MOFCOM approval process and tendering process. We were a little slow to get our hands on that business and really dig in. But over and above that, we saw the weaker market conditions affect them. Certainly, if we look at some of their customers, we've seen production declines in some of their customers, consistent with the slowing we've talked about in the China market. We're starting to see that coming back. We're seeing the early stages of electricity demand improvement, which will be a driver for coal production domestically. But we expect IMM to need to reverse its path. It's not going to be jumping up to prior levels. It'll be a climb out during the year, and we think that we'll see -- the first quarter of this year, we'll start to see that improvement, but it'll be on a trend that will get us back to where we were by the end of this year. So that's our outlook for IMM. Now some of that miss in 2012 was us and them, and some of it was just the market softening. I can't give you exact numbers, but probably 50-50 in that category. But we believe we can get IMM back to where we were in the first quarter of 2012. And then that resets the base that we will look at for other product line expansions in -- expansions to their product line, other ways to -- aftermarket. Other ways that have long-term growth potential."

We also believe that, that's somewhat due to us and the dealer distributor networks that they used. We haven't managed those as aggressively as we needed to, and we're getting those guys back in focus. And we're spending a lot more time in the dealer distributor network, rather than relying on them to work the market on their own initiative. I think that's a big factor. We certainly don't see -- today, we don't see pricing erosion, that we've got to go and do deep discounts to get that market share back. We think we can get that market share back on performance. So we certainly -- early on, we're starting to see the improvement in order bookings out of IMM, consistent with those expectations. So the bottom line is that, yes, there is some aggressive competition. We believe that we can hold our own and gain back market share on those product lines. And we don't believe that we need to do deep price discounting due to the fact that this industry continues to demonstrate that price elasticity is virtually vertical. So we just -- we don't have an interest in going down that path. And with IMM, there's no evidence today that we need to do that."

We -- the projects that we've booked in our fourth quarter, the projects that we see closer at hand, are projects that have been on our radar scope now for 6 to 9 months. So those are projects that have been established early on, things that slowed down in our second quarter as our customers were under pressure to reevaluate their projects and trim back CapEx, excuse me. And in that process, all these projects were taken off-line for pretty intensive reevaluation. Customers are telling us that in that process, they found opportunities to improve project economics. They changed the engineering on some of the projects. That just took longer, but that's what we're dealing with now. I think the real test of 2014 will be the flow of projects that have been earlier in their status. And if our customers move from finishing projects that they've already had in process, to starting up the next round of projects, I think that's going to be a clear indicator on the strength or not in 2014. And we do see those projects. We're working on them with our customers. We're doing a lot of engineering and project management work. We -- as I said, we -- the visibility or the predictability of timing diminishes as we get beyond our first quarter, but we do need to see some of those projects come across the line in 2013 to give us confidence that 2014 is going to be a year to start to see the first stages of improvement."

And we keep focusing on ways we can help our customer take operating cost down. For a 20-year-life mine, OpEx is much more important than CapEx. So we're not in an industry where lowering your price to book an order is the right thing to do, particularly with repeat customers. If you had a one-off project and that was -- the project was going to be done and gone, that would -- may be different. But we're not in that. We have repeat customers and multiple projects in the stream, and price elasticity is very vertical in this industry. So we just don't have an appetite to start reducing prices. We don't believe we need to, and we believe we'll just continue working on our value proposition, demonstrating that we can help them reduce operating costs, improve productivity. That has worked for us consistently over the years. I think it continues to work. Even more so, in tough times, I think it works even better."

As we look at our life-cycle management programs, we continually demonstrate that we can deliver better results for our customers. Those results are not necessarily lower cost, but we can deliver higher reliability in our machines, better productivity in the machines, better uptime. We have a better capability of judging the remaining life in components, the need -- the time to make those changes. Smart Services is formalizing that in ways that we can connect into our customers' business systems to order parts, to have those available at a mine site when we need them. All those kind of things improves the predictability and the productivity and efficiency of those mining operations. Our customers see that in -- where we have those programs deployed, we are seeing increased use of those programs by those customers. And certainly, there is upside in doing that. One of the things that we -- as we get into an environment where skill shortages could come into play, and we have an industry that's got an average age in the mid-50 years old, so skill shortages are a serious concern for the industry going forward. And being able to use more services to provide the capability of monitoring and detecting without having to have highly skilled individuals is a real plus. And so that's been a real positive for us. We've seen a lot interest in Smart Services. So it is top of our priority. Aftermarket right now is top of our priority, continued to build on our strength and capture more aftermarket. The program-based aftermarket is certainly the highest priority we have. There'll be more aftermarket in the programs. Other things we deal with our customers on is just responding to major rebuilds, shovel outages and dragline outages. It's easier for us to make those adjustments off of a steady work base than it is to start with 0 on a call-out basis and put a team of 50 people on a shovel outage project that may last for 3 months. So customers are starting to understand that having base-level work with them and then adjusting from that is a lot easier and more efficient than doing call-out on a case-by-case basis. So we are making progress. I think that's in the trend that we have in our aftermarket revenue growth. And I think you'll see that continue going forward."
