It's also our second year in a row",1151,"Thank you, Ellen, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're proud to announce another good quarter. In fact, it's our seventh quarter in a row where we've had EPS growth north of 30%. We're very proud of that. It's also our second year in a row that we've had EPS growth north of 30%. So we're feeling good about the accomplishments that the team has done, and we want to thank all the Fastenal people for a hard, a job well done. 
For the quarter, our sales, we had a very good quarter for sales coming in about the same as third quarter. And I guess the way I would describe our sales over the last 6 quarters is very consistent. If you look at it, we've been in that 20% to 22% range almost every month for the past 18 months. So they've done a nice job with just growing consistently over a long period of time.
December, a little bit of color on December. December is actually, in my view, a better month than we reported at just over 21% because we had a very strong first 3 weeks, and then we slowed down for the holidays. And my own personal opinion is every year, it seems like holidays become longer or businesses take more time off. If you look at the Fourth of July and different holidays. It's probably just a cultural thing, but it's very hard to read looking at the month. The positive is they came into the month strong and had a great 3 weeks, which led us to still having a good month even with a disappointing finish.
On the margin side, we did take a dip in the margin as you see reporting 51.2, still within our range of 51 to 53. I guess and I'd look at the numbers closely things just didn't line up for us. There were some seasonal things. There are a little bit of pressure from mix, but overall, it's a disappointing quarter on margin, but we're still very comfortable with our range and believe that some of it will snap back in the first quarter. But Dan will also give more color on the pieces of where our margin deteriorated some.
Earnings standpoint, I really feel comfortable with what we did there, nice earnings growth, and I'm very proud of the fact that we reported pretax of 20.2%. That's the first time in our history that we've ever had pretax above 20% in the fourth quarter, so that was a good achievement. For the year, our pretax came in at 20.8%, the first time that we've been over 20% in actually more than 15 years. We were there in 1995. So another good accomplishment I think and it just shows that the power of our 'pathway to profit' is working, and we're still able to get the good growth. So we're very happy with that.
From an expense standpoint, it's kind of a tale of -- there's 2 stories here. On the nonpayroll expenses, which make up about 1/3 of our SG&A, we did a great job. Those expenses grew for the quarter in low to mid-single digit and for the year, very similar numbers. The payroll, on the other hand, grew faster. For the quarter, our payroll grew 16%. For the year, it grew just under 21%. I believe it was 20.9%, which was a little higher than we had expected. So we did have some work to do on payroll. On a positive note there because of what is normally sales in the first quarter, we can work that through very quickly and be able to leverage in 2012. But we talked to other people about it. We understand where it's going on. 
Some of it is made up from the slowdown or lower bonuses in 2010, but some of it is we just have to pay a little closer attention and where do we do it here is we tell you what we think, where we have to work on and we're comfortable that we can correct that situation very quickly. 
Vending, vending was a little slower than we had expected. But we actually vending was very similar to what I've described December. We had 2 good months, October and November, and the December kind of fell on its face with vending and did not surprise us because it's very hard to get people to make decisions and sign contracts at the end of the year and around the holidays. So we're not at all discouraged by it. We knew it would be a tough quarter with December in there. 
But from an overall standpoint with industrial vending, the concept and the long-term opportunities continue to look better every day. And as we study the results, we look at all the things that are going on, the opportunities that are out there, we are more excited about what it could do for Fastenal over the next several years than we've ever been. 
Structurally, we are very well positioned with our store network, with our distribution and with our large workforce in the field out in these small communities. We're very, very well positioned to service this business and should work well for us. 
And the thing I'd like to say when I talk to people who don't really understand the concept and they're trying to understand what we're doing, very -- there's a note on my desk a little like a fortune cookie on my computer for about 10 or 15 years. And what it says is the best way to sell is make it convenient to buy. In other words, remind myself of that, and that's really the essence of the vending. Vending is a more convenient way for our customers to buy products from Fastenal. And if we can make things more convenient and more efficient, we believe we will sell more product, and it will give us long-term growth opportunities, and that's why we're so heavily invested in this project and we're so bullish on it whenever we talk to the investment community, the customer community, the supplier community and any other community that's willing to listen to us about this prospect. So very, very positive on vending and believe that have a long run there. 
So overall, I believe Fastenal had a very good year. We had a very good, excuse me, we had a very good quarter, and we had a very good year. And we believe with the strength we saw in the fourth quarter in our sales, we're well positioned to launch the business into 2012 and hopefully maintain our string of north of 30% EPS growth in quarters to come. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. Dan will give you some more color, and then we'll open up for questions."

Before I start, I'm going to touch on one housekeeping note, and that is related to a change we had to do next quarter for our first quarter release so that would be our",2432,"Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today. Before I start, I'm going to touch on one housekeeping note, and that is related to a change we had to do next quarter for our first quarter release so that would be our release scheduled in April. 
What we have done over the last -- most of our public life is that before market opens at 7:00 in the morning Central Time approximately, we publish, we publicly release our earnings for the previous quarter. And one thing I've learned over time is that you always keep your ears open for suggested improvements or changes that you could make that maybe improve the process, something we want to try in April. And in our scheduled conference call is for Thursday, April 19, I believe I wrote that date down correctly and April 12, excuse me. 
But instead of releasing at 7:00 in the morning before market opens, we're going to release the evening before. Typically, the way our process works currently is that we will queue up all our documents for release somewhere between 7 and 8 p.m. in the evening and schedule them to come out the following morning. We're going to queue them up between 7 and 8 as we've done in the past, go through our normal process but make them immediately available. We believe that will help inform the marketplace, analyst community and the marketplace in general on our quarter. And we'll add to the quality of this earnings call, potentially some of the questions and also help with the dissemination of information. So that will be a change. We'll try it next quarter. We'll do it for this year, and we'll see how it goes and continue to try to improve the process of communicating The Street. 
I will echo some comments that Will made and delve a little deeper in a couple of them. This morning at 7:00, I had my typical call with our regional vice presidents. It's basically our group of leaders, our regional CEOs, if you will, that manage our business and our a large part of the success behind our business. And some of the messages I've shared with them first and foremost was nice quarter, nice year. And we did a really nice job in a lot of fronts, and like always, we identified the things that we did well, we identified the things that we can improve on, and we'll work on those as we move into 2012. 
As Will mentioned and I would echo the comment, continue to be impressed by our top line performance. As all of you know over the last several years especially in the bottom of the 2009 dip trying to do a lot of things to try to look at our seasonal trend patterns to try to really understand and communicate what our business normally does and we use that '98 to 2003 as a benchmark for that. 
If you look at the chart we published in our press release and in our quarterly document, you can see that we have soundly been at or above that trend line now for both 2010 and 2011. So it's not about the recovery or easy comps or hard comps or all that kind of stuff you can talk about. It's really what happened from June to July, July to August, August to September are we building the fundamentals of our business every day to launch us into the next year. And that's the secret of Fastenal's top line growth for the last 40 years is we build a little bit more everyday, and we step higher. 
And when I look at that, we continue to handily outperform those numbers, which makes me feel very good if we go into 2012. And as you see in the IFM numbers, they continue to support what we're doing, and we feel very good going into the new year. 
On the expense side, Will touched on both the labor and the nonlabor side. I'll add a feel more tidbits to the nonlabor side. If I look at 2009, 2010 and 2011, our total operating expenses have gone from 35.6% of sales in 2009. Granted, that was a high number because of the recession to 32.8% in 2010 and 31.1% in 2011. So we dropped 450 basis points in 2009, probably the more meaningful comparison is we dropped 170 from 2010, 2011 because 2010 was a good number. 
If I look at that, we've always talked about labor being about 70% of operating expenses, labor and labor related. So payroll, health care, school business, those types of expenses versus all the other expenses. Our occupancy, our store fleet, our gasoline going into that fleet, all the expenses we have to operate our business day in and day out. That represents about 30% of our operating expenses. That 30% piece have performed so well in the last 2 years that 80% of our improvements in operating expenses have come there. And a big piece of that would be on the side and that's 'pathway to profit' not complicated an asset, just we're de-leveraging our store base. 
When I look at that, the good news, good news in that story is we've done a great job with that component, and I think we're poised really well coming into 2012 to have another piece, a big piece of our operating expenses that we can leverage quite attractively. And we've jumped on that midway through the fourth quarter really go into the new year and attack that well and with the rising sales and gross profit dollars because seasonality of our business it poises us well for 2012. 
The other thing that I think is real compelling when I look at that the nonpayroll piece is that nonpayroll piece also contains all of our vending expenses. So we've gone from 567 units in service at the end of 2009 or said another way, the start of 2010 to almost 7,500 machines in service at the end of 2011, a thirteen-fold increase. And all of those expenses have been observed in an area where we saw great leverage in our P&L. Everything else could even be better, and I don't want that to be lost in the whole message. 
Speaking of vending, there is one clarification I do want to make when I look at the information we've released, and this is on top of Page 6 of our earnings release. In there, we have a table of information, and that table goes through and it talks about the number of machines we added that we signed contracts on during the quarter, try to give you a current touch on what activity is happening of machines there that go online today and in the future and what those trends look like. 
If you look at machines installed, so how many machines did we end up each quarter with the machines in service, the percent of total sales vending customers. So that's customers -- total sales to that customer grew both vended and nonbranded dollars so we can measure the impact how big that business is and then the final is what's happening with that business, how fast is it growing. If you take a good close look at the numbers compared to prior quarters, you'll see some slight changes in the numbers. Really what's happened is as vending ramped up, we were compiling a lot of that information in a very manual process. We've migrated now to a more automated platform. The fact that we took another look at the data, and we slightly modified the field of definitions. 
The first group any changes there would just be cleaned up and the changes are very modest. The second group you would see some changes really what happened over the definitional change instead of the number of machines installed and scheduled at the end of the quarter, it's now very clean number. It's number of machine installed and producing revenue at the end of the quarter, which I think is a cleaner number. None of it changes the trends, but whenever you see numbers that change, I think it's worthwhile pointing it out. 
The third category slight changes very modest. The fourth category, if you look at Q2 and Q3 instead of growth in the upper 40s, it's growth in the lower 40s, still a very attractive number but slightly lower than what we previously reported and I wanted to point that out in the release. My take when I look at all 4 sets of data, unbelievable numbers and doesn't change my opinion. It only enhances our opinion of vending as we go into 2012 in the future. I think it's a very compelling growth components to our business, one of many.
As always, as I mentioned earlier, we talk internally, we talk externally about the good things in our business and some of the things that will prove more challenging or maybe the work side of the business, if you will. Two things jump out in my mind when I look at 2011, particularly fourth quarter. Our gross margin did drop about 70 basis points from 51.9 to 51.2. Hopefully, the narrative I put in the release helps explain the sum I will provide a little more insight. 
Historically, we talked about the transactional piece of our gross margin, the organizational piece of our gross margin and the vendor incentive and the transactional is about things we do every day, day in and day out. Organizational is more about leveraging our trucking network, as well as our ability to source products domestically and globally using tremendous volume capabilities to buy, as well as a dedicated focus to improve our source of supply. And the third vendor incentive while it's a smaller component of the gross margin, it's a piece that can move around some. So that's why we mention it periodically. 
If I look at those 3 pieces and I take it even a deeper dive into some components, one component of the transactional and organizational it crosses actually a little bit of both is the freight side. How are we utilizing our trucks, how are we doing charging freight, how we are doing -- how much shipping are we doing because we don't have volume on certain lanes, et cetera. And Will touched on this earlier. But when I look at that piece, one thing you see whenever you're predicting numbers coming into quarter looking at a year or you're looking at what you think you can do, you always have kind of a mind of where those pieces are. And one piece is going to be higher and one piece is going to be lower, and that's just life. What we really saw on the fourth quarter is directionally they all moved in the same direction. We gave up 6 basis points here. We gave up 7 basis points there, 12 in those about 15 another. If I look at all those pieces, we gave up about 40 basis points. 
Now a piece of that, about 1/3 of that ends up being in our ending inventories. So it doesn't hit the P&L because it's capitalized in the inventory. But most of that, 25, 27 basis points does impact our gross margin in the fourth quarter. A second piece almost equal size is the rebate number does fluctuate as that sit from quarter-to-quarter. Typically, in the fourth quarter, you have some true ups that might increase the number slightly, might lower the numbers slightly because trueing up, most programs are calendar based. Gave up about 25 basis points there. 
That's the bad news. The good news is when I look at pieces, that is a seasonal piece of our business and now the freight piece, we got to do some hard work to improve those. Some of it occurs actually because we've got to leverage our trucking networks. Our trucks have more product on them. So our relative cost is lower. Some of it takes sometimes taking a good hard look at it, taking a few people in the including ourselves and saying we need to be better at this if we go into the new year. 
The last piece I'll touch on is what we talked about our organizational gross profit. Gave up a little bit quarter. That always moves around a bit quarter-to-quarter, some natural gives and takes, things that we're doing to exclusive brands tend to improve that number over time. Our large national account program tends to grow a little bit of that number. It's a real case managing the mix over time to constantly improve it. 
Long story short, gave up some gross margin in the fourth quarter. I believe we're poised well as we go into 2012. So the last one is on the working capital. We continue to improve our working capital. That's part of the 'pathway to profit.' Our inventory utilization should improve over time. My issue there is we're just not making fast enough progress, and that's something we'll work on. 
Our internal sales relation really looks at the ending inventory and looks back in time against cost of goods a couple of days of inventory and days that they are enhanced almost working capital. Our business as everybody on this call knows historically uses quite a bit of working capital, but we get great returns on that working capital, so we can afford it. But we operate in that 220, 225 days of working capital neighborhood when you combine the 2 together. Our challenge is how do we get that sub-200 down in the 185, 190 neighborhood and how long does it take us to get there. Improve beyond that but you always have shorter and longer-term goals. 
We've made about 8 days of improvement from last year. That should have been twice that number. So that's our challenge for 2012 is continuing to improve those days and do what we think we should do and not what we did in 2011. So I think we have good opportunity there, and that just enhances our cash flow and our ability to get return as we move forward. 
I believe our operating margin and our pretax margin will continue to improve if we can improve the relative performance of our working capital, great one-two punch. 
With that, I will stop talking, and we'll open it up for some questions. Thank you."

And then just on vending, we've looked at this, we have asked this, but I'm interested in hearing your view on it. As you look at the trade-off of vending relative to outside selling sales force or other opportunities might have new store openings, et cetera, do you have an idea of what incremental growth you're driving today from vending? I guess you look at it in a vacuum but you have to consider that you're also offsetting that by not pursuing other growth avenues. Do you have an estimate for what you think, just incremental growth from vending alone is generating today?"

And so they make hundreds of calls to sell 1 or 2 machines or dozens. It's a small ratio, and the more we keep them outselling, the overall business benefits and I've actually talked to our managers about this recently. If they were to sell one machine per month, the group last week 25 managers, I said if you were to sign machine per month how many days per month would it disrupt your business? And the answer from the group was one day, it takes one day to sell it. So they have 19 to 20 days to go out and sell everything else. If we could sell one machine per month per store, you can do the math and see what it would do for us. So it would be and now I'm not saying we would, but it's a very small disruption for the game. And we are going to continue to open stores. It's not a one-to-one trade. It's probably a 9 to 1 positive."

There is a number of the machines that are going into existing customers that signed up a year ago and they want more, but I actually don't have a breakout on that. But still the majority of them are new signings. I would say at least 70%. But the importance of taking that question is that we sign up more customers, I look at our top 100 list at the end of the year of customers with -- the number of machines per customer and going for it and I think that we'll probably lose than 10% penetrated into these customers many of them big Fortune companies.

We've often talked about our average, the proverbial average store that $83,000, $84,000 a month. If top 10 customers represent about 65% of sales in that store and the other 1/3 of the customers represent about 25% and then there's some business on the tailwind. So it's a retail business. And one way I think about it real simplistically is if I think we have 2,600 stores times the top 10 customers per store, there's a group of 26,000 customers. And some of those customers that's based on account numbers. So you might have some replication in a given store. But you essentially have 26,000 customers in our business that represent a big percentage of our business and are very prime candidates for vending. As we develop the additional machines over time, that's where you start scratch your head and wonder how deep in the organization you can go with, what type of customer. And I guess I would say a lot of those 90% that are smaller customers are smaller customers because we don't do that much business with them today. They have smaller potential."

So those are available and from the reports back, they seem to be working well, the machines out there. We continue to expand the inventory in the warehouse. Actually, that's been a little slower than we planned, and part of it is a little bit of caution from our suppliers, which I appreciate because they are saying let's not put it all in until we really understand what you need because they don't want to return. So it's a lot more thoughtful process, but we continue to add every month, continue to add SKUs and continue to add suppliers.

And over a longer of time, I think we'll continue to open stores. We're still comfortable that we could open up to 3,500 in North America. It's just over what period of time that happens is what we need to do that. We want to find the most efficient growth model that we can and then stick with that."

But I would argue most of the benefit of 'pathway to profit' haven't been realized yet because if you look at what's happened from 2007 to 2011, our improvement in operating margin as I touched on earlier, we've seen nice leverage in our occupancy a but our occupancy leverage hasn't come because we raised our average store size because we have raised it. Don't get me wrong. But we haven't raised it when we started 'pathway to profit' we said 200 basis points of improvement because they go from 70,000 a month to 125. We've gone from 70 to the mid-80s, and we've taken out a meaningful piece of our operating expenses as it relates to occupancy despite lowering our rents and being smarter reapproaching how we look at it. Fourth quarter of 2009 our rent was 540 basis points. Today it's 395, and that's just the rent component. There's utilities and other things. But a lot of the improvement came from we raised our gross margin. So when I look at the 'pathway to profit', we've gotten a piece from occupancy. We've gotten a piece from labor, don't get me wrong. That's primarily in the nonselling areas when we look at the data on headcount, you really see we've done a great job managing our support headcount, a great job managing our distribution and Manufacturing headcount. We've invested in a lot of selling energy both store and nonstore. And so as the average store size grows, we still have a lot of runway left as it relates to the labor side and nice runway on the occupancy side."

It's also our second year in a row",1174,"Thank you, Ellen, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're proud to announce another good quarter. In fact, it's our seventh quarter in a row where we've had EPS growth north of 30%. We're very proud of that. It's also our second year in a row that we've had EPS growth north of 30%. So we're feeling good about the accomplishments that the team has done, and I want to thank all the Fastenal people for a hard -- a job well done.
For the quarter, our sales -- we had a very good quarter for sales, coming in about the same as third quarter. And I guess the way I would describe our sales over the last 6 quarters is very consistent. If you look at it, we've been in that 20% to 22% range almost every month for the past 18 months. So they've done a nice job with just growing it consistently over a long period of time.
December, a little bit of color on December. December is actually, in my view, a better month than we reported, at just over 21%. Because we had a very strong first 3 weeks and then we slowed down for the holidays. And my own personal opinion is, every year, it seems like holidays become longer or businesses take more time off if you look at the Fourth of July and different holidays. It's probably just a cultural thing but it's very hard to read looking at the month, but the positive is being end of the month strong and had a great 3 weeks, which led us to still having a good month even with a disappointing finish.
On the margin side, we did take a dip in the margin. As you see, reporting 51.2%, still within our range of 51% to 53%. I guess, and I'd look at the numbers closely to -- things just didn't line up for us. There was some seasonal things, there -- a little bit of pressure from mix, but overall it was a disappointing quarter on margin, but we're still very comfortable with our range and believe that some of it will snap back in the first quarter. But Dan will also give more color on the pieces of where our margin deteriorated some.
Earnings standpoint. I really feel comfortable with what we did there, nice earnings growth, and I'm very proud of the fact that we reported pretax of 20.2%. That's the first time in our history that we've ever had pretax above 20% in the fourth quarter, so that was a good achievement. For the year, our pretax came in at 20.8%, the first time that we've been over 20% in actually more than 15 years. We were there in 1995. So another good accomplishment I think and it just shows that the power of our 'pathway to profit' is working and we're still able to get the good growth. So we're very happy with that.
From an expense standpoint, it's kind of a tale of 2 -- or there's 2 stories here. On the non-payroll expenses, which make up about 1/3 of our SG&A, we did a great job. Those expenses grew, for the quarter, in the low to mid-single digits and for the year, very similar numbers. The payroll on the other hand grew faster. For the quarter, our payroll grew 16%. For the year, it grew just under 21%. I believe it was 20.9%, which was a little higher than we had expected. So we do have some work to do on payroll. On a positive note there, because of the -- what is normally cutter sales in the first quarter, we can work that through very quickly and be able to see leverage in 2012. But we talked to all people about it, we understand where it's going, and some of it is make-up from the slowdown or lower bonuses in 2010. But some of it is we just have to pay a little closer attention and the way we do it here is we tell you what we think, where we have to work on and we're comfortable that we can correct that situation very quickly.
Vending. Vending was a little slower than we had expected. But we actually -- vending was very similar to what I've described December. We had 2 good months, October and November, and then December kind of fell on its face with vending. And did not surprise us because it's very hard to get people to make decisions and sign contracts at the end of the year and around the holidays. So we're not at all discouraged by it. We knew it would be a tough quarter with December in there.
But from an overall standpoint, with industrial vending, the concept and the long-term opportunities continue to look better every day. And as we study the results, we look at all the things that are going on, the opportunities that are out there, we are more excited about what it could do for Fastenal over the next several years than we've ever been. 
Structurally, we are very well positioned with our store network, with our distribution and with our large workforce in the field out in these small communities. We're very, very well positioned to service this business and should work well for us.
And the thing I'd like to say, when I talk to people who don't really understand the concept and they're trying to understand what we're doing, very -- there's a note on my desk, a little -- it's like a fortune cookie sign, it's been on my computer for about 10 or 15 years. And what it says is, ""The best way to sell is make it convenient to buy."" And I always remind myself of that and that's really the essence of vending. Vending is a more convenient way for our customers to buy product from Fastenal. And if we can make things more convenient and more efficient, we believe we will sell more product and it will give us long-term growth opportunities, and that's why we're so heavily invested in this project and we're so bullish on it whenever we talk to the investment community, the customer community, the supplier community and any other community that's willing to listen to us about this prospect. So very, very positive on vending and believe that -- have a long run there.
So overall, I believe Fastenal had a very good year. We had a very good -- excuse me, we had a very good quarter and we had a very good year. And we believe, with the strength we saw in the fourth quarter in our sales, we're well positioned to launch the business into 2012 and hopefully maintain our string of north of 30% EPS growth in quarters to come.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. Dan will give you some more color and then we'll open it up for questions. Thank you."

Before I start, I'm going to touch on one housekeeping note, and that is related to a change we have to do next quarters -- for our first quarter release, so that would be our release scheduled in April. 
What we have done over the last, gosh -- most of our public life is that before market opens, at 7:00 in the morning Central Time approximately, we publish -- we publicly release our earnings for the previous quarter. And one thing I've learned, over time, is that you always keep your ears open for suggested improvements or changes that you could make that maybe improve the process. Something we want to try in April, and in our scheduled conference call is for Thursday, April 19, I believe I wrote that date down correctly, and -- or April 12, excuse me.
But instead of releasing at 7:00 in the morning, before market opens, we're going to release the evening before. Typically, the way our process works currently is that we will queue up all of our documents for release somewhere between 7 and 8 p.m. in the evening and schedule them to come out the following morning. We're going to queue them up between 7 and 8 as we've done in the past, go through our normal process but make them immediately available. We believe that will help inform the marketplace, the analyst community and the marketplace in general, on our quarter. And we'll add to the quality of this earnings call, potentially some of the questions and also help with the dissemination of information. So that will be a change. We'll try it next quarter. We'll do it for this year, and we'll see how it goes and continue to try to improve the process of communicating with The Street.
I will echo some comments that Will made and delve a little deeper on a couple of them. This morning at 7:00, I had my typical call with our Regional Vice President. It's basically -- it's our group of leaders, our regional CEOs if you will, that manage our business and are a large part of the success behind our business. And some of the messages I've shared with them, first and foremost, was nice quarter, nice year. And we did a really nice job in a lot of fronts and like always, we identified the things that we did well, we identified the things that we can improve on and we'll work on those as we move into 2012.
As Will mentioned, and I would echo the comment, continue to be impressed by our top line performance. As all of you know, over the last several years, especially in the bottom of the 2009 dip, trying to do a lot of things to try to look at our seasonal trend patterns, to try to really understand and communicate what our business normally does and we use that '98 to 2003 as a benchmark for that.
If you look at the chart we published in our press release and in our quarterly documents, you can see that we have soundly been at or above that trend line now for both 2010 and 2011. So it's not about the recovery or easy comps or hard comps or all that kind of stuff you can talk about. It's really what happened from June to July, July to August, August to September, are we building the fundamentals of our business every day to launch us into the next year. And that's the secret of Fastenal's top line growth for the last 40 years, is we build a little bit more everyday and we step higher. 
And when I look at that, we continue to handily outperform those numbers, which makes me feel very good if we go into 2012. And as you see in the ISM numbers, they continue to support what we're doing, and we feel very good going into the new year. 
On the expense side, Will touched on both the labor and the nonlabor side. I'll add a feel more tidbits to the nonlabor side. If I look at 2009, 2010 and 2011, our total operating expenses have gone from 35.6% of sales in 2009, granted that was a high number because of the recession, to 32.8% in 2010 and 31.1% in 2011. So we dropped 450 basis points in 2009. Probably the more meaningful comparison is we dropped 170 from 2010, 2011, because 2010 was a good number.
If I look at that, we've always talked about labor being about 70% of operating expenses, labor and labor-related. So payroll, health care, school business, those types of expenses versus all the other expenses. Our occupancy, our store fleet, our gasoline going into that fleet, all the expenses we have to operate our business day in and day out. That represents about 30% of our operating expenses. That 30% piece has performed so well in the last 2 years that 80% of our improvements in operating expenses have come there. And a big piece of that would be on the occupancy side and that's 'pathway to profit'. It's not complicated an asset, just we're leveraging our store base. 
When I look at that, the good news, good news in that story is we've done a great job with that component. And I think we're poised really well coming into 2012 to have another piece, a big piece of our operating expenses, that we can leverage quite attractively and we've jumped on that midway through the fourth quarter to really go into the new year and attack that well, and with the rising sales and gross profit dollars because seasonality of our business, it poises us well for 2012. 
The other thing that I think is real compelling when I look at that, the non-payroll piece, is that non-payroll piece also contains all of our vending expenses. So we've gone from 567 units in service at the end of 2009, or said another way, the start of 2010, to almost 7,500 machines in service at the end of 2011, a thirteen-fold increase. And all those expenses have been absorbed in an area where we saw great leverage in our P&L. Frankly, everything else could even be better and I don't want that to be lost in the whole message.
Speaking of vending, there is one clarification I do want to make when I look at the information we've released, and this is on top of Page 6 of our earnings release. In there, we have a table of information, and that table goes through -- and it talks about the number of machines we added, that we signed contracts on during the quarter. That's to try to give you a current touch on what activity is happening, of machines that'll go online today and in the future and what those trends look like. 
If you look at machines installed, so how many machines did we end up each quarter with, the machines in service, the percent of total sales to vending customers, so that's customers -- total sales to that customer group, both vended and non-vended dollars so we can measure the impact of it, how big that business is. And then the final is what's happening with that business, how fast is it growing. If you take a good close look at the numbers, compared to prior quarters, you'll see some slight changes in the numbers. Really what's happened is we've -- as vending ramped up, we were compiling a lot of that information in a very manual process. We've migrated now to a more automated platform. Decided that -- we took another look at the data, and we slightly modified the field of definitions.
The first group, any changes there would just be cleaned up and the changes are very modest. The second group you would see some changes. Really, what happened was a definitional change. Instead of the number of machines installed and scheduled at the end of the quarter, it is now very clean number. It's the number of machines installed and producing revenue at the end of the quarter, which I think is a cleaner number. None of it changes the trends, but whenever you see numbers that change, I think it's worthwhile pointing it out.
The third category slight changes very modest. The fourth category, if you look at Q2 and Q3 instead of growth in the upper 40s, it's growth in the lower 40s. Still a very attractive number but slightly lower than what we previously reported and I wanted to point that out in the release. My take, when I look at all 4 sets of data, unbelievable numbers and doesn't change my opinion, it only enhances our opinion of vending as we go into 2012, in the future. I think it's a very compelling growth components to our business, one of many.
The -- as always, as I mentioned earlier, we talk internally, we talk externally about the good things in our business and some of the things that will prove more challenging or maybe the work side of the business, if you will. Two things jump out in my mind when I look at 2011, particularly fourth quarter. Our gross margin did drop about 70 basis points from 51.9 to 51.2. Hopefully, the narrative I put in the release helps to explain the sum. I will provide a little more insight. 
Historically, we talk about the transactional piece of our gross margin, the organizational piece of our gross margin and the vendor incentive. And the transactional is about things we do every day, day in and day out. Organizational is more about leveraging our trucking network, as well as our ability to source products domestically and globally. Using tremendous volume capabilities to buy, as well as a dedicated focus to improve our source of supply. And the third vendor incentive, while it's a smaller component of the gross margin, it's a piece that can move around some. So that's why we mention it periodically. 
If I look at those 3 pieces and I take even a deeper dive into some components, one component of the transactional and organizational, it crosses actually a little bit of both, is the freight side. How are we utilizing our trucks, how are we doing charging freight, how we are doing with our -- how much LTL shipping are we doing because we don't have volume on certain lanes, et cetera. And Will touched on this earlier but when I look at that piece, one thing you see -- whenever you're predicting numbers coming into a quarter or looking at a year or you're looking at what you think you can do, you always have kind of a mind of where those pieces are. And one piece is going to be higher, one piece is going to be lower, and that's just life. What we really saw on the fourth quarter is, directionally, they all moved the same direction. We gave up 6 basis points here, we gave up 7 basis points there, 12 in another spot, 15 in other. If I look at all those pieces, we gave up about 40 basis points.
Now a piece of that, about 1/3 of that, ends up being in our ending inventory. So it doesn't hit the P&L because it's capitalized in the inventory. But most of that, 25, 27 basis points does impact our gross margin in the fourth quarter. A second piece and an almost equal size is the rebate number does fluctuate a bit from quarter-to-quarter. Typically, in the fourth quarter, you have some true-ups that might increase the number slightly, might lower the numbers slightly because you're trueing up, most programs are calendar based. Gave up about 25 basis points there.
That's the bad news. The good news is, when I look at pieces, that -- that is a seasonal piece of our business and now the freight piece, we've got to do some hard work to improve those. Some of it occurs naturally because we've got to leverage our trucking network. Our trucks have more product on them. So our relative cost is lower. Some of it takes -- sometimes taking a good hard looking at -- look at it, kicking a few people in the butt, including ourselves, and saying we need to be better at this as we go into a new year.
The last piece I'll touch on is the, what we talk about, our organizational gross profit. Gave up a little bit in the quarter. That always moves around a bit from quarter-to-quarter, some natural gives and takes. Things that we're doing to exclusive brands tend to improve that number over time. Our large national account program tends to evolve a little bit of that number. The real case is managing the mix over time to constantly improve it. 
Long story short, gave up some gross margin in the fourth quarter. I believe we're poised well as we go into 2012. So the last one is on the working capital. We continue to improve our working capital. That's part of the 'pathway to profit.' Our inventory utilization should improve over time. My issue there is we're just not making fast enough progress and that's something we'll work on. 
Our internal sales relation really looks at the ending inventory and looks back in time against cost of goods a couple of days of inventory and days that they are on hand. So how much working capital. Our business, as everybody on this call knows, historically uses quite a bit of working capital but we get great returns on that working capital, so we can afford it. But we operate in that 220, 225 days of working capital neighborhood when you combine the 2 together. Our challenge is how do we get to that sub-200, down in the 185, 190 neighborhood and how long does it take us to get there. Not saying we're going to improve beyond that but you always have shorter and longer-term goals.
We made about 8 days of improvement from last year. That should have been twice that number. So that's our challenge for 2012, is continuing to improve those days and do what we think we should do, not what we did in 2011. So I think we have good opportunity there, and that just enhances our cash flow and our ability to get returns as we move forward.
I believe our operating margin and our pretax margin will continue to improve if we can improve the relative performance of our working capital. It's a great one-two punch. 
With that, I will stop talking, and we'll open up for some questions. Thank you."

And the more we keep them out selling, the overall business benefits and I've actually talked to our managers about this recently. If they were to sell 1 machine per month, this is the group last week, 25 managers, I said if you were to sign 1 machine per month, how many days per month would it disrupt your business? And the answer from the group was 1 day, it takes one day to install it. So they have 19 to 20 days to go out and sell everything else. If we can sell 1 machine per month per store, you can do the math and see what it would do for us. So it would be -- I'm not saying we would. But it's a very small disruption for the game and we are going to continue to open stores, so it's not a one-to-one trade, it's probably a 9 to 1 positive."

And one way I think about it, real simplistically, if I think that we have 2,600 stores times the top 10 customers per store, there's a group of 26,000 customers. And some of those customers -- that's based on account numbers, you might have some replication in a given store. But you essentially have 26,000 customers in our business that represent a big percentage of our business and are very prime candidates for vending. As we develop the additional machines over time, that's where you start to scratch your head and you wonder how deep in the organization you can go with what size of customer. And I guess I would say a lot of those 90% that are smaller customers are smaller customers because we don't do that much business with them today. They don't have smaller potential."

But I would argue most of the benefit of 'pathway to profit' haven't been realized yet. Because if you look at what's happened from 2007 to 2011, our improvement in operating margin -- as I touched on earlier, we've seen nice leverage in our occupancy. But our occupancy leverage hasn't come because we raised our average store size, because we have raised it. Don't get me wrong. But we haven't raised it -- when we started 'pathway to profit' we said 200 basis points of improvement because they go from 70,000 a month to 125. We've gone from 70 to the mid-80s, and we've taken out a meaningful piece of our operating expenses, as it relates to occupancy, despite lowering our rents and being smarter, re-approaching how we look at it. Fourth quarter of 2009 our rent was 540 basis points, today it's 395. And that's just the rent component, there's utilities and other things. But a lot of the improvement came from we raised our gross margin. So when I look at the 'pathway to profit', we've gotten a piece from occupancy. We've gotten a piece from labor, don't get me wrong, but that's primarily been in the non-selling areas. If we look at the data on headcount, you really see we've done a great job managing our support headcount, a great job managing our distribution and manufacturing headcount. We've invested in a lot of selling energy, both store and non-store. And so as the average store size grows, we still have a lot of runway left as it relates to the labor side and nice runway on the occupancy side."

In fact, it's our seventh quarter in a row where we've had EPS growth north of 30%. We're very proud of that. It's also our second year in a row that we've had EPS growth north of 30%. So we're feeling good about the accomplishments that the team has done, and I want to thank all the Fastenal people for a hard -- a job well done.
For the quarter, our sales -- we had a very good quarter for sales, coming in about the same as third quarter. And I guess the way I would describe our sales over the last 6 quarters is very consistent. If you look at it, we've been in that 20% to 22% range almost every month for the past 18 months. So they've done a nice job with just growing it consistently over a long period of time.
December, a little bit of color on December. December was actually, in my view, a better month than we reported, at just over 21%, because we had a very strong first 3 weeks and then we slowed down for the holidays. And my own personal opinion is, every year, it seems like holidays become longer or businesses take more time off if you look at the Fourth of July and different holidays. It's probably just a cultural thing. But it's very hard to read looking at the month, but the positive is we came into the month strong and had a great 3 weeks, which led us to still having a good month even with a disappointing finish.
On the margin side, we did take a dip in the margin. As you see, reporting 51.2%, still within our range of 51% to 53%. I guess, and I'd look at the numbers closely to -- things just didn't line up for us. There was some seasonal things, there -- a little bit of pressure from mix, but overall it was a disappointing quarter on margin, but we're still very comfortable with our range and believe that some of it will snap back in the first quarter. But Dan will also give more color on the pieces of where our margin deteriorated some.
Earnings standpoint. I really feel comfortable with what we did there, nice earnings growth, and I'm very proud of the fact that we reported pretax of 20.2%. That's the first time in our history that we've ever had pretax above 20% in the fourth quarter, so that was a good achievement. For the year, our pretax came in at 20.8%, the first time that we've been over 20% in actually more than 15 years. We were there in 1995. So another good accomplishment, I think, and it just shows that the power of our 'pathway to profit' is working and we're still able to get the good growth. So we're very happy with that.
From an expense standpoint, it's kind of a tale of 2 -- or there's 2 stories here. On the non-payroll expenses, which make up about 1/3 of our SG&A, we did a great job. Those expenses grew, for the quarter, in the low to mid-single digits, and for the year, very similar numbers. The payroll on the other hand grew faster. For the quarter, our payroll grew 16%. For the year, it grew just under 21%. I believe it was 20.9%, which was a little higher than we had expected. So we do have some work to do on payroll. On a positive note there, because of the -- what is normally cutter sales in the first quarter, we can work that through very quickly and feel that we're going to see leverage in 2012. But we talked to all our people about it, we understand where it's going. And some of it is make-up from the slowdown or lower bonuses in 2010, but some of it is we just have to pay a little closer attention. And the way we do it here is we tell you what we think, where we have to work on, and we're comfortable that we can correct that situation very quickly.
Vending. Vending was a little slower than we had expected. But we actually -- vending was very similar to what I've described December. We had 2 good months, October and November, and then December kind of fell on its face with vending. And did not surprise us because it's very hard to get people to make decisions and sign contracts at the end of the year and around the holidays. So we're not at all discouraged by it. We knew it would be a tough quarter with December in there.
But from an overall standpoint, with industrial vending, the concept and the long-term opportunities continue to look better every day. And as we study the results, we look at all the things that are going on, the opportunities that are out there, we are more excited about what it could do for Fastenal over the next several years than we've ever been. 
Structurally, we are very well positioned with our store network, with our distribution and with our large workforce in the field out in these small communities. We're very, very well positioned to service this business and should work well for us.
And the thing I'd like to say when I talk to people who don't really understand the concept and they're trying to understand what we're doing, very -- there's a note on my desk, a little -- it's like a fortune cookie sign, it's been on my computer for about 10 or 15 years. And what it says is, ""The best way to sell is make it convenient to buy."" And I always remind myself of that and that's really the essence of vending. Vending is a more convenient way for our customers to buy product from Fastenal. And if we can make things more convenient and more efficient, we believe we will sell more product and it will give us long-term growth opportunities, and that's why we're so heavily invested in this project and we're so bullish on it whenever we talk to the investment community, the customer community, the supplier community and any other community that's willing to listen to us about this prospect. So very, very positive on vending and believe that -- have a long run there.
So overall, I believe Fastenal had a very good year. We had a very good -- excuse me, we had a very good quarter and we had a very good year. And we believe, with the strength we saw in the fourth quarter in our sales, we're well positioned to launch the business into 2012 and hopefully maintain our string of north of 30% EPS growth in quarters to come.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. Dan will give you some more color and then we'll open it up for questions. Thank you."

Before I start, I'm going to touch on one housekeeping note, and that is related to a change we plan to do next quarters -- for our first quarter release, so tha",2479,"Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for participating on our call today. Before I start, I'm going to touch on one housekeeping note, and that is related to a change we plan to do next quarters -- for our first quarter release, so that would be our release scheduled in April. 
What we have done over the last, gosh -- most of our public life is that before market opens, at 7:00 in the morning Central Time approximately, we publish -- we publicly release our earnings for the previous quarter. And one thing I've learned over time is that you always keep your ears open for suggested improvements or changes that you could make that maybe improve the process. Something we're going to try in April, and in our scheduled conference call is for Thursday, April 19, I believe I wrote that date down correctly, and -- or April 12, excuse me.
But instead of releasing at 7:00 in the morning, before market opens, we're going to release the evening before. Typically, the way our process works currently is that we will queue up all of our documents for release somewhere between 7 and 8 p.m. in the evening and schedule them to come out the following morning. We're going to queue them up between 7 and 8 as we've done in the past, go through our normal process, but make them immediately available. We believe that will help inform the marketplace, the analyst community and the marketplace in general on our quarter; and will add to the quality of this earnings call, potentially some of the questions; and also help with the dissemination of information. So that will be a change. We'll try it next quarter. We'll do it for this year, and we'll see how it goes and continue to try to improve the process of communicating with The Street.
I will echo some comments that Will made and delve a little deeper on a couple of them. This morning at 7:00, I had my typical call with our Regional Vice President. It's basically -- it's our group of leaders, our regional CEOs if you will, that manage our business and are a large part of the success behind our business. And some of the messages I've shared with them, first and foremost, was nice quarter, nice year. And we did a really nice job in a lot of fronts and like always, we identified the things that we did well, we identified the things that we can improve on, and we'll work on those as we move into 2012.
As Will mentioned, and I would echo the comment, continue to be impressed by our top line performance. As all of you know, over the last several years, especially in the bottom of the 2009 dip, tried to do a lot of things to try to look at our seasonal trend patterns, to try to really understand and communicate what our business normally does, and we used that '98 to 2003 as a benchmark for that.
If you look at the chart we published in our press release and in our quarterly documents, you can see that we have soundly been at or above that trend line now for both 2010 and 2011. So it's not about the recovery or easy comps or hard comps or all that kind of stuff you can talk about. It's really what happened from June to July, July to August, August to September. Are we building the fundamentals of our business every day to launch us into the next year? And that's the secret of Fastenal's top line growth for the last 40 years, is we build a little bit more everyday and we step higher. 
And when I look at that, we continue to handily outperform those numbers, which makes me feel very good as we go on into 2012. And as you see in the ISM numbers, they continue to support what we're doing, and we feel very good going into the new year. 
On the expense side, Will touched on both the labor and the nonlabor side. I'll add a few more tidbits to the nonlabor side. If I look at 2009, 2010 and 2011, our total operating expenses have gone from 35.6% of sales in 2009, granted that was a high number because of the recession, to 32.8% in 2010 and 31.1% in 2011. So we dropped 450 basis points in 2009. Probably the more meaningful comparison is we dropped 170 from 2010, 2011, because 2010 was a good number.
If I look at that, we've always talked about labor being about 70% of operating expenses, labor and labor-related. So payroll, health care, school business, those types of expenses, versus all the other expenses. Our occupancy, our store fleet, our gasoline going into that fleet, all the expenses we have to operate our business day in and day out. That represents about 30% of our operating expenses. That 30% piece has performed so well in the last 2 years that 80% of our improvements in operating expenses have come there. And a big piece of that would be on the occupancy side, and that's 'pathway to profit'. It's not complicated math, it's just we're leveraging our store base. 
When I look at that, the good news, good news in that story is we've done a great job with that component. And I think we're poised really well coming into 2012 to have another piece, a big piece of our operating expenses, that we can leverage quite attractively, and we've jumped on that midway through the fourth quarter to really go into the new year and attack that well. And with the rising sales and gross profit dollars because seasonality of our business, it poises us well for 2012. 
The other thing that I think is real compelling when I look at that, the non-payroll piece, is that non-payroll piece also contains all of our vending expenses. So we've gone from 567 units in service at the end of 2009, or said another way, the start of 2010, to almost 7,500 machines in service at the end of 2011, a thirteen-fold increase. And all those expenses have been absorbed in an area where we saw great leverage in our P&L, frankly [ph] everything else, but even better. And I don't want that to be lost in the whole message.
Speaking of vending, there is one clarification I do want to make when I look at the information we've released, and this is on top of Page 6 of our earnings release. In there, we have a table of information, and that table goes through -- and it talks about the number of machines we added, that we signed contracts on during the quarter. That's to try to give you a current touch on what activity is happening, of machines that will go online today and in the future and what those trends look like: The cumulative machines installed, so how many machines did we end up each quarter with, the machines in service; the percent of total sales to vending customers, so that's customers -- total sales for that customer group, both vended and non-vended dollars so we can measure the impact of it, how big that business is; and then the final is what's happening with that business, how fast is it growing. 
If you take a good close look at some of the numbers compared to prior quarters, you'll see some slight changes in the numbers. Really what's happened is we've -- as vending ramped up, we were compiling a lot of that information in a very manual process. We've migrated now to a more automated platform. Decided that -- we took another look at the data, and we slightly modified the field of definitions.
The first group, any changes there would just be cleaned up and the changes are very modest. The second group, you would see some changes. Really, what happened was a definitional change. Instead of the number of machines installed and scheduled at the end of the quarter, it is now very clean number. It's the number of machines installed and producing revenue at the end of the quarter, which I think is a cleaner number. None of it changes the trends, but whenever you see numbers that change, I think it's worthwhile pointing it out.
The third category, slight changes, very modest. The fourth category, if you look at Q2 and Q3, instead of growth in the upper 40s, it's growth in the lower 40s. Still a very attractive number but slightly lower than what we previously reported, and I wanted to point that out in the release. My take, when I look at all 4 sets of data, unbelievable numbers and doesn't change my opinion, it only enhances our opinion of vending as we go into 2012 and the future. I think it's a very compelling growth component to our business, one of many.
The -- as always, as I mentioned earlier, we talk internally and we talk externally about the good things in our business and some of the things that were proved more challenging or maybe the work side of the business, if you will. Two things jump out in my mind when I look at 2011, particularly fourth quarter. Our gross margin did drop about 70 basis points from 51.9% to 51.2%. Hopefully, the narrative I put in the release helps to explain the sum. I will provide a little more insight. 
Historically, we talk about the transactional piece of our gross margin, the organizational piece of our gross margin and the vendor incentive. And the transactional is about things we do every day, day in and day out. Organizational is more about leveraging our trucking network, as well as our ability to source products domestically and globally, using tremendous volume capabilities to buy, as well as a dedicated focus to improve our source of supply. And the third, vendor incentive, while it's a smaller component of the gross margin, it's a piece that can move around some. So that's why we mention it periodically. 
If I look at those 3 pieces and I take even a deeper dive into some components, one component of the transactional and organizational, it crosses actually a little bit of both, is the freight side. How are we utilizing our trucks, how are we doing charging freight, how we are doing with our -- how much LTL shipping are we doing because we don't have volume on certain lanes, et cetera. And Will touched on this earlier but when I look at that piece, one thing you see -- whenever you're predicting numbers coming into a quarter or looking at a year or you're looking at what you think you can do, you always have kind of a mind of where those pieces are. And one piece is going to be higher, one piece is going to be lower, and that's just life. What we really saw in the fourth quarter is, directionally, they all moved the same direction. We gave up 6 basis points here, we gave up 7 basis points there, 12 in another spot, 15 in another. If I look at all those pieces, we gave up about 40 basis points.
Now a piece of that, about 1/3 of that, ends up being in our ending inventory. So it doesn't hit the P&L because it's capitalized in the inventory. But most of that, 25, 27 basis points does impact our gross margin in the fourth quarter. A second piece and an almost equal size is the rebate number does fluctuate a bit from quarter-to-quarter. Typically, in the fourth quarter, you have some true-ups. It might increase the number slightly, it might lower the numbers slightly because trueing up, most programs are calendar based. Gave up about 25 basis points there. 
That's the bad news. The good news is when I look at those pieces, that is a seasonal piece of our business and now the freight piece, we got to do some hard work to improve those. Some of it occurs naturally because we better leverage our trucking network. Our trucks have more product on them. So our relative cost is lower. Some of it takes -- sometimes taking a good hard look at it, kicking a few people in the butt, including ourselves, and saying we need to be better at this as we go into the new year. 
The last piece I'll touch on is what we talked about our organizational gross profit. Gave up a little bit in the quarter. That always moves around a bit from quarter-to-quarter, some natural gives and takes. Things that we're doing to exclusive brands tend to improve that number over time. Our large national account program tends to erode a little bit of that number. The real case is managing the mix over time to constantly improve it. 
Long story short, gave up some gross margin in the fourth quarter. I believe we're poised well as we go into 2012. So the last one is on the working capital. We continue to improve our working capital. That's part of the 'pathway to profit.' Our inventory utilization should improve over time. My issue there is we're just not making fast enough progress and that's something we'll work on. 
Our internal calculation really looks at the ending inventory and looks back in time against cost of goods to comp with the days of inventory and days that they are on hand. So how much working capital. Our business, as everybody on this call knows, historically uses quite a bit of working capital but we get great returns on that working capital, so we can afford it. But we operate in that 220, 225 days of working capital neighborhood when you combine the 2 together. Our challenge is how do we get to that sub-200, down in the 185, 190 neighborhood and how long does it take us to get there. Not to say we can't improve beyond that, but you always have shorter and longer-term goals.
We made about 8 days of improvement from last year. That should have been twice that number. So that's our challenge for 2012, is continuing to improve those days and do what we think we should do, not what we did in 2011. So I think we have good opportunity there, and that just enhances our cash flow and our ability to get returns as we go forward.
I believe our operating margin and our pretax margin will continue to improve if we can improve the relative performance of our working capital. It's a great one-two punch. 
With that, I will stop talking, and we'll open up for some questions. Thank you."

It's top 10 customers represent about 65% of sales in that store and the other 1/3 of the customers represent about 25%, and then there's some cash business on the tail end, so retail business. And one way I think about it, real simplistically, if I think that we have 2,600 stores times the top 10 customers per store, there's a group of 26,000 customers. And some of those customers -- that's based on account numbers, so you might have some replication in a given store. But you essentially have 26,000 customers in our business that represent a big percentage of our business and are very prime candidates for vending. As we develop the additional machines over time, that's where you start to scratch your head and you wonder how deep in the organization you can go with what size of customer. And I guess I would say a lot of those 90% that are smaller customers are smaller customers because we don't do that much business with them today. They don't have smaller potential."

But I would argue most of the benefit of 'pathway to profit' haven't been realized yet. Because if you look at what's happened from 2007 to 2011, our improvement in operating margin -- as I touched on earlier, we've seen nice leverage in our occupancy. But our occupancy leverage hasn't come because we raised our average store size. Because we have raised it, don't get me wrong, but we haven't raised it -- when we started 'pathway to profit' we said 200 basis points of improvement because we go from 70,000 a month to 125. We've gone from 70 to the mid-80s, and we've taken out a meaningful piece of our operating expenses as it relates to occupancy just by lowering our rents and being smarter, re-approaching how we look at it. Fourth quarter of 2009, our rent was 540 basis points, today it's 395. And that's just the rent component, there's utilities and other things. But a lot of the improvement came from we raised our gross margin. So when I look at the 'pathway to profit', we've gotten a piece from occupancy. We've gotten a piece from labor, don't get me wrong, but that's primarily been in the non-selling areas. If we look at the data on headcount, you really see we've done a great job managing our support headcount, a great job managing our distribution and manufacturing headcount. We've invested in a lot of selling energy, both store and non-store. And so as the average store size grows, we still have a lot of runway left as it relates to the labor side and nice runway on the occupancy side."

It's also our second year in a row",1177,"Thank you, Ellen, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're proud to announce another good quarter. In fact, it's our seventh quarter in a row where we've had EPS growth north of 30%. We're very proud of that. It's also our second year in a row that we've had EPS growth north of 30%. So we're feeling good about the accomplishments that the team has done, and I want to thank all the Fastenal people for a hard -- a job well done.
For the quarter, our sales -- we had a very good quarter for sales, coming in about the same as third quarter. And I guess the way I would describe our sales over the last 6 quarters is very consistent. If you look at it, we've been in that 20% to 22% range almost every month for the past 18 months. So they've done a nice job with just growing it consistently over a long period of time.
December, a little bit of color on December. December was actually, in my view, a better month than we reported, at just over 21%, because we had a very strong first 3 weeks and then we slowed down for the holidays. And my own personal opinion is, every year, it seems like holidays become longer or businesses take more time off if you look at the Fourth of July and different holidays. It's probably just a cultural thing. But it's very hard to read looking at the month, but the positive is we came into the month strong and had a great 3 weeks, which led us to still having a good month even with a disappointing finish.
On the margin side, we did take a dip in the margin. As you see, reporting 51.2%, still within our range of 51% to 53%. I guess, and I'd look at the numbers closely to -- things just didn't line up for us. There was some seasonal things, there -- a little bit of pressure from mix, but overall it was a disappointing quarter on margin, but we're still very comfortable with our range and believe that some of it will snap back in the first quarter. But Dan will also give more color on the pieces of where our margin deteriorated some.
Earnings standpoint. I really feel comfortable with what we did there, nice earnings growth, and I'm very proud of the fact that we reported pretax of 20.2%. That's the first time in our history that we've ever had pretax above 20% in the fourth quarter, so that was a good achievement. For the year, our pretax came in at 20.8%, the first time that we've been over 20% in actually more than 15 years. We were there in 1995. So another good accomplishment, I think, and it just shows that the power of our 'pathway to profit' is working and we're still able to get the good growth. So we're very happy with that.
From an expense standpoint, it's kind of a tale of 2 -- or there's 2 stories here. On the non-payroll expenses, which make up about 1/3 of our SG&A, we did a great job. Those expenses grew, for the quarter, in the low to mid-single digits, and for the year, very similar numbers. The payroll on the other hand grew faster. For the quarter, our payroll grew 16%. For the year, it grew just under 21%. I believe it was 20.9%, which was a little higher than we had expected. So we do have some work to do on payroll. On a positive note there, because of the -- what is normally cutter sales in the first quarter, we can work that through very quickly and feel that we're going to see leverage in 2012. But we talked to all our people about it, we understand where it's going. And some of it is make-up from the slowdown or lower bonuses in 2010, but some of it is we just have to pay a little closer attention. And the way we do it here is we tell you what we think, where we have to work on, and we're comfortable that we can correct that situation very quickly.
Vending. Vending was a little slower than we had expected. But we actually -- vending was very similar to what I've described December. We had 2 good months, October and November, and then December kind of fell on its face with vending. And did not surprise us because it's very hard to get people to make decisions and sign contracts at the end of the year and around the holidays. So we're not at all discouraged by it. We knew it would be a tough quarter with December in there.
But from an overall standpoint, with industrial vending, the concept and the long-term opportunities continue to look better every day. And as we study the results, we look at all the things that are going on, the opportunities that are out there, we are more excited about what it could do for Fastenal over the next several years than we've ever been. 
Structurally, we are very well positioned with our store network, with our distribution and with our large workforce in the field out in these small communities. We're very, very well positioned to service this business and should work well for us.
And the thing I'd like to say when I talk to people who don't really understand the concept and they're trying to understand what we're doing, very -- there's a note on my desk, a little -- it's like a fortune cookie sign, it's been on my computer for about 10 or 15 years. And what it says is, ""The best way to sell is make it convenient to buy."" And I always remind myself of that and that's really the essence of vending. Vending is a more convenient way for our customers to buy product from Fastenal. And if we can make things more convenient and more efficient, we believe we will sell more product and it will give us long-term growth opportunities, and that's why we're so heavily invested in this project and we're so bullish on it whenever we talk to the investment community, the customer community, the supplier community and any other community that's willing to listen to us about this prospect. So very, very positive on vending and believe that -- have a long run there.
So overall, I believe Fastenal had a very good year. We had a very good -- excuse me, we had a very good quarter and we had a very good year. And we believe, with the strength we saw in the fourth quarter in our sales, we're well positioned to launch the business into 2012 and hopefully maintain our string of north of 30% EPS growth in quarters to come.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. Dan will give you some more color and then we'll open it up for questions. Thank you."

Before I start, I'm going to touch on one housekeeping note, and that is related to a change we plan to do next quarters -- for our first quarter release, so tha",2479,"Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for participating on our call today. Before I start, I'm going to touch on one housekeeping note, and that is related to a change we plan to do next quarters -- for our first quarter release, so that would be our release scheduled in April. 
What we have done over the last, gosh -- most of our public life is that before market opens, at 7:00 in the morning Central Time approximately, we publish -- we publicly release our earnings for the previous quarter. And one thing I've learned over time is that you always keep your ears open for suggested improvements or changes that you could make that maybe improve the process. Something we're going to try in April, and in our scheduled conference call is for Thursday, April 19, I believe I wrote that date down correctly, and -- or April 12, excuse me.
But instead of releasing at 7:00 in the morning, before market opens, we're going to release the evening before. Typically, the way our process works currently is that we will queue up all of our documents for release somewhere between 7 and 8 p.m. in the evening and schedule them to come out the following morning. We're going to queue them up between 7 and 8 as we've done in the past, go through our normal process, but make them immediately available. We believe that will help inform the marketplace, the analyst community and the marketplace in general on our quarter; and will add to the quality of this earnings call, potentially some of the questions; and also help with the dissemination of information. So that will be a change. We'll try it next quarter. We'll do it for this year, and we'll see how it goes and continue to try to improve the process of communicating with The Street.
I will echo some comments that Will made and delve a little deeper on a couple of them. This morning at 7:00, I had my typical call with our Regional Vice President. It's basically -- it's our group of leaders, our regional CEOs if you will, that manage our business and are a large part of the success behind our business. And some of the messages I've shared with them, first and foremost, was nice quarter, nice year. And we did a really nice job in a lot of fronts and like always, we identified the things that we did well, we identified the things that we can improve on, and we'll work on those as we move into 2012.
As Will mentioned, and I would echo the comment, continue to be impressed by our top line performance. As all of you know, over the last several years, especially in the bottom of the 2009 dip, tried to do a lot of things to try to look at our seasonal trend patterns, to try to really understand and communicate what our business normally does, and we used that '98 to 2003 as a benchmark for that.
If you look at the chart we published in our press release and in our quarterly documents, you can see that we have soundly been at or above that trend line now for both 2010 and 2011. So it's not about the recovery or easy comps or hard comps or all that kind of stuff you can talk about. It's really what happened from June to July, July to August, August to September. Are we building the fundamentals of our business every day to launch us into the next year? And that's the secret of Fastenal's top line growth for the last 40 years, is we build a little bit more everyday and we step higher. 
And when I look at that, we continue to handily outperform those numbers, which makes me feel very good as we go on into 2012. And as you see in the ISM numbers, they continue to support what we're doing, and we feel very good going into the new year. 
On the expense side, Will touched on both the labor and the nonlabor side. I'll add a few more tidbits to the nonlabor side. If I look at 2009, 2010 and 2011, our total operating expenses have gone from 35.6% of sales in 2009, granted that was a high number because of the recession, to 32.8% in 2010 and 31.1% in 2011. So we dropped 450 basis points in 2009. Probably the more meaningful comparison is we dropped 170 from 2010, 2011, because 2010 was a good number.
If I look at that, we've always talked about labor being about 70% of operating expenses, labor and labor-related. So payroll, health care, school business, those types of expenses, versus all the other expenses. Our occupancy, our store fleet, our gasoline going into that fleet, all the expenses we have to operate our business day in and day out. That represents about 30% of our operating expenses. That 30% piece has performed so well in the last 2 years that 80% of our improvements in operating expenses have come there. And a big piece of that would be on the occupancy side, and that's 'pathway to profit'. It's not complicated math, it's just we're leveraging our store base. 
When I look at that, the good news, good news in that story is we've done a great job with that component. And I think we're poised really well coming into 2012 to have another piece, a big piece of our operating expenses, that we can leverage quite attractively, and we've jumped on that midway through the fourth quarter to really go into the new year and attack that well. And with the rising sales and gross profit dollars because seasonality of our business, it poises us well for 2012. 
The other thing that I think is real compelling when I look at that, the non-payroll piece, is that non-payroll piece also contains all of our vending expenses. So we've gone from 567 units in service at the end of 2009, or said another way, the start of 2010, to almost 7,500 machines in service at the end of 2011, a thirteen-fold increase. And all those expenses have been absorbed in an area where we saw great leverage in our P&L, frankly [ph] everything else, but even better. And I don't want that to be lost in the whole message.
Speaking of vending, there is one clarification I do want to make when I look at the information we've released, and this is on top of Page 6 of our earnings release. In there, we have a table of information, and that table goes through -- and it talks about the number of machines we added, that we signed contracts on during the quarter. That's to try to give you a current touch on what activity is happening, of machines that will go online today and in the future and what those trends look like: The cumulative machines installed, so how many machines did we end up each quarter with, the machines in service; the percent of total sales to vending customers, so that's customers -- total sales for that customer group, both vended and non-vended dollars so we can measure the impact of it, how big that business is; and then the final is what's happening with that business, how fast is it growing. 
If you take a good close look at some of the numbers compared to prior quarters, you'll see some slight changes in the numbers. Really what's happened is we've -- as vending ramped up, we were compiling a lot of that information in a very manual process. We've migrated now to a more automated platform. Decided that -- we took another look at the data, and we slightly modified the field of definitions.
The first group, any changes there would just be cleaned up and the changes are very modest. The second group, you would see some changes. Really, what happened was a definitional change. Instead of the number of machines installed and scheduled at the end of the quarter, it is now very clean number. It's the number of machines installed and producing revenue at the end of the quarter, which I think is a cleaner number. None of it changes the trends, but whenever you see numbers that change, I think it's worthwhile pointing it out.
The third category, slight changes, very modest. The fourth category, if you look at Q2 and Q3, instead of growth in the upper 40s, it's growth in the lower 40s. Still a very attractive number but slightly lower than what we previously reported, and I wanted to point that out in the release. My take, when I look at all 4 sets of data, unbelievable numbers and doesn't change my opinion, it only enhances our opinion of vending as we go into 2012 and the future. I think it's a very compelling growth component to our business, one of many.
The -- as always, as I mentioned earlier, we talk internally and we talk externally about the good things in our business and some of the things that were proved more challenging or maybe the work side of the business, if you will. Two things jump out in my mind when I look at 2011, particularly fourth quarter. Our gross margin did drop about 70 basis points from 51.9% to 51.2%. Hopefully, the narrative I put in the release helps to explain the sum. I will provide a little more insight. 
Historically, we talk about the transactional piece of our gross margin, the organizational piece of our gross margin and the vendor incentive. And the transactional is about things we do every day, day in and day out. Organizational is more about leveraging our trucking network, as well as our ability to source products domestically and globally, using tremendous volume capabilities to buy, as well as a dedicated focus to improve our source of supply. And the third, vendor incentive, while it's a smaller component of the gross margin, it's a piece that can move around some. So that's why we mention it periodically. 
If I look at those 3 pieces and I take even a deeper dive into some components, one component of the transactional and organizational, it crosses actually a little bit of both, is the freight side. How are we utilizing our trucks, how are we doing charging freight, how we are doing with our -- how much LTL shipping are we doing because we don't have volume on certain lanes, et cetera. And Will touched on this earlier but when I look at that piece, one thing you see -- whenever you're predicting numbers coming into a quarter or looking at a year or you're looking at what you think you can do, you always have kind of a mind of where those pieces are. And one piece is going to be higher, one piece is going to be lower, and that's just life. What we really saw in the fourth quarter is, directionally, they all moved the same direction. We gave up 6 basis points here, we gave up 7 basis points there, 12 in another spot, 15 in another. If I look at all those pieces, we gave up about 40 basis points.
Now a piece of that, about 1/3 of that, ends up being in our ending inventory. So it doesn't hit the P&L because it's capitalized in the inventory. But most of that, 25, 27 basis points does impact our gross margin in the fourth quarter. A second piece and an almost equal size is the rebate number does fluctuate a bit from quarter-to-quarter. Typically, in the fourth quarter, you have some true-ups. It might increase the number slightly, it might lower the numbers slightly because trueing up, most programs are calendar based. Gave up about 25 basis points there. 
That's the bad news. The good news is when I look at those pieces, that is a seasonal piece of our business and now the freight piece, we got to do some hard work to improve those. Some of it occurs naturally because we better leverage our trucking network. Our trucks have more product on them. So our relative cost is lower. Some of it takes -- sometimes taking a good hard look at it, kicking a few people in the butt, including ourselves, and saying we need to be better at this as we go into the new year. 
The last piece I'll touch on is what we talked about our organizational gross profit. Gave up a little bit in the quarter. That always moves around a bit from quarter-to-quarter, some natural gives and takes. Things that we're doing to exclusive brands tend to improve that number over time. Our large national account program tends to erode a little bit of that number. The real case is managing the mix over time to constantly improve it. 
Long story short, gave up some gross margin in the fourth quarter. I believe we're poised well as we go into 2012. So the last one is on the working capital. We continue to improve our working capital. That's part of the 'pathway to profit.' Our inventory utilization should improve over time. My issue there is we're just not making fast enough progress and that's something we'll work on. 
Our internal calculation really looks at the ending inventory and looks back in time against cost of goods to comp with the days of inventory and days that they are on hand. So how much working capital. Our business, as everybody on this call knows, historically uses quite a bit of working capital but we get great returns on that working capital, so we can afford it. But we operate in that 220, 225 days of working capital neighborhood when you combine the 2 together. Our challenge is how do we get to that sub-200, down in the 185, 190 neighborhood and how long does it take us to get there. Not to say we can't improve beyond that, but you always have shorter and longer-term goals.
We made about 8 days of improvement from last year. That should have been twice that number. So that's our challenge for 2012, is continuing to improve those days and do what we think we should do, not what we did in 2011. So I think we have good opportunity there, and that just enhances our cash flow and our ability to get returns as we go forward.
I believe our operating margin and our pretax margin will continue to improve if we can improve the relative performance of our working capital. It's a great one-two punch. 
With that, I will stop talking, and we'll open up for some questions. Thank you."

And the answer from the group was 1 day, it takes one day to install it. So they have 19 to 20 days to go out and sell everything else. If we could sell 1 machine per month per store, you can do the math and see what it would do for us. It would be -- and I'm not saying we would. But it's a very small disruption for the gain.

And one way I think about it, real simplistically, if I think that we have 2,600 stores times the top 10 customers per store, there's a group of 26,000 customers. And some of those customers -- that's based on account numbers, so you might have some replication in a given store. But you essentially have 26,000 customers in our business that represent a big percentage of our business and are very prime candidates for vending. As we develop the additional machines over time, that's where you start to scratch your head and you wonder how deep in the organization you can go with what size of customer. And I guess I would say a lot of those 90% that are smaller customers are smaller customers because we don't do that much business with them today. They don't have smaller potential."

If we introduce a new product line that we've really sourced well and we believe we can sell through to the customers, like metalworking, we have just expanded the market for that store.

Because if you look at what's happened from 2007 to 2011, our improvement in operating margin -- as I touched on earlier, we've seen nice leverage in our occupancy. But our occupancy leverage hasn't come because we raised our average store size. Because we have raised it, don't get me wrong, but we haven't raised it -- when we started 'pathway to profit' we said 200 basis points of improvement because we go from 70,000 a month to 125. We've gone from 70 to the mid-80s, and we've taken out a meaningful piece of our operating expenses as it relates to occupancy just by lowering our rents and being smarter, re-approaching how we look at it. Fourth quarter of 2009, our rent was 540 basis points, today it's 395. And that's just the rent component, there's utilities and other things. But a lot of the improvement came from we raised our gross margin. So when I look at the 'pathway to profit', we've gotten a piece from occupancy. We've gotten a piece from labor, don't get me wrong, but that's primarily been in the non-selling areas. If we look at the data on headcount, you really see we've done a great job managing our support headcount, a great job managing our distribution and manufacturing headcount. We've invested in a lot of selling energy, both store and non-store. And so as the average store size grows, we still have a lot of runway left as it relates to the labor side and nice runway on the occupancy side."

Starting out, I'd like to say that we believe or I feel it was a good quarter. Our sales growth was right on plan. Looking at our internal sales goals. In January,",1762,"Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us on our first quarter conference call. Starting out, I'd like to say that we believe or I feel it was a good quarter. 
Our sales growth was right on plan. Looking at our internal sales goals. In January, we were at 100.6% of goal, February 98.8% of goal and March, 101.3% of goal. So for the quarter, we are at 100.3% of goal. I'm not sure if it's good sales growth and good forecasting but whatever rewrite on target this far into the year. 
I'll also take a look at the 2-year gross numbers because as we look at the sequential numbers trying to understand what the patterns are, but sometimes it's easier to look at the 2 year. If you look at the 2-year growth numbers that we put in the report and combined 2010 and 2011, there was 40.1% growth in January, 41.5% in February and 42.1% in March. So we continue to march forward and also show very consistent growth. 
The other reason I feel pretty good about the sales growth is if you look at the purchasing index that was also in the release, last year through the first 3 months, the average for the country U.S. market is at 59.8%, a very high rating. This year, still a good reading but it's down to 53.3%, so it's really 6.5 points lower, and we had similar -- our growth was off a little bit but very similar. So I think the initiatives we're putting in place are working well. 
This week I had the opportunity to visit -- this week, we're holding our customer showdown in Indianapolis where we bring in about 4,000 to 5,000 customers and 200 suppliers, and we let our customers visit our suppliers and the product. Anyway that give me the opportunity to visit with dozens of companies, both suppliers and our customers also to speak with many of our managers, and the mood is very upbeat. 
So I was optimistic about that. Many of our customers believe they're going to have a good year, continue to have a good year. And many of the suppliers are hearing that not only from the Fastenal people, but also from other customers. So it was a very upbeat showing and gave us a good feel for the next couple of months.
In the report, there was I believe moving on, there's only one negative in our report this quarter, one major negative, and that was the margin. I spend a lot of time looking at the margin trying to analyze what we're doing and what we need to do. And after spending a time analyzing it and discussing it with most of our sales leaders down in Indianapolis this week, the conclusion I came to and I hate to say this, but my conclusion is that we basically take our eye off the ball a little bit working on other things. But after the discussions I had with the regionals, with our sales leader and our National Account sales leaders, I'm very confident that we know what we need to do, and we will see improvement in the second quarter. So we're going to work very hard on that. 
We're not off a long ways. We're still on a range between 51% and 53% but as competitive people, the competitive people that we are, we'd rather be in the high end of the range rather than the low end. So we're going to work very hard to move that up over the next 2 to 3 quarters and get into the upper end of our margin range.
On the expense control side, I have to say the Fastenal team, the blue team, did a great job. Our expenses grew about 6 percentage points below sales, exactly what we needed to do. Labor grew a little faster than the other expenses, but that's -- some of that is planned. We did a lot of things changing some pay programs, trying to make sure that we're taking care of our people and is working very well. So not a lot to say on the expense control. Dan will probably touch more on that, but I'm really proud of what we are able to do on expense control.
You may have noticed we have a will drop off was the store profitability that we show on Page 7 where some of the store groups had lower profitability per size than they had in the previous year, and that's all explained in one word: margin. As we look at that because margin was a little lower, the profitability per store size is a little lower. So we can correct the margin or as we correct the margin problem, we'll also correct that problem. But overall, our pretax profit, 21%, I'm proud of the number. We only picked up 90 basis points from last year with our goal is 100 so we missed it by a tenth, but I'm very confident we'll get that back. 
And the most positive thing on that chart on Page 7 is the number of stores that moved up a category. So we continue to do what we have laid out in 'pathway to profit' grow -- move the average store size up, the profitability goes up and the system continues to work. One area on the report that I'm also very happy about was the inventory control. We had said in the fourth quarter call that we thought we could improve our turns through the quarter we only added or we added less than $2 million in inventory, and so we've done a nice job both quarter to or sequentially through the quarter, but also year-over-year very nice job on inventory growth or controlling our inventory growth deploying our assets in better ways.
Talking -- switching gears a little bit talking about the initiatives that we have, our sales initiatives. All of the initiatives -- I'm happy to report that all of our initiatives are going well. Our Government project that we started 2 years ago is ahead of plan from a standpoint of sales growth. We are fully staffed or I mean, very few openings. We have the people in place that we need. We have the coverage in The states. Our contract which is our big state contract is going very well. It's at or ahead of plan. In some states, we're doing better than others but overall, it's doing very well. And we feel very good about the knowledge that we're getting through the people in the field. 
5 years ago, we probably had 2 or 3 people in the company that had a real good knowledge of how to do this. Now we have a team of about 40, and I think we're just going to continue to gain traction on the Government business mainly in the state areas where we're looking other pieces of Government business as well. 
Our web sales continue to grow. That's been an initiative since really the end of 2010. We did well in 2011, but we continue to see traction in 2012. Buying off the web is good for our customers. It's good for our stores also because it's more efficient that continues to do well. 
Metalworking. We're very happy with the results in metalworking, and to show this week, I had the opportunity visit with several of our large suppliers that just came on. And on very positive note they're happy with the results because that's one of the keys to making this work. We have to be able to sell grow fast enough to make the suppliers happy with the results, and that's going well. Our sales people that we've been hiring and training in the field, they're doing a nice job. We have about 52 people that are sales specialist just in metalworking. Our plan is to add another 10 as the year goes on or as we can find the right people to do that. But also the opportunity to speak with many customers who are looking at us for metalworking, and it appears or the theme was now there is another national player, there's another company I can look at to provide my metalworking supplies, and so we've had some very nice opportunities that fits in well with our vending program, and so we're very optimistic about that for the future. 
It's a large market and there is good tough competition in it, but we think we can continue to take share. And the main reason is because of the relationships we've developed with these customers over the years. We're not taking it out to new customers per se. It's really developed relationships that are looking for a possible alternative. 
And our biggest initiative that we talked about is vending. And as you saw in the results, we had a great quarter. As I've been stating for the last 4 quarters, our goal is to hit 2,500 machines for the quarter. We exceeded that by more than 2,000 at 4,500 machines. We installed more than 2,300 machines, and so we're moving along nicely. 
I am more convinced than ever that it's a long-term change in industrial distribution. Again, I keep talking about the show, but I just got back last night. I had the opportunity to speak with probably 20 to 30 customers that have deployed vending, and not one of them is disappointed with the results. They're all talking about the savings. 
There are really 2 themes that come off from the customers. One is inventory control and how much time it saves them to not have to distribute the product, and the other is the consumption or the savings. But I think the biggest theme really is about the inventory control more than the savings. It's there when we needed, and it's just out of sight, out of mind in a positive way. So we're working very hard on that belief. We'll continue to see good results going forward. 
So overall, looking at the quarter, looking at the information, I'll put it down as a good quarter. If we had improved the margin, I would say it was a great quarter because everything else looks good. So we have some things to work on. We're focused on that, and hopefully, we'll see improvement this quarter. 
With that, I'm going to turn over to Dan, and he'll give you some more detailed color on other things in that quarter. Thank you."

What I wanted to touch on most of you will probably notice a change to the format of the earnings release a bit this quarter. I felt there was pieces of it that",1232,"Thanks, Will, and good morning everybody, and thanks again for listening in on our call today. What I wanted to touch on most of you will probably notice a change to the format of the earnings release a bit this quarter. I felt there was pieces of it that were getting a bit stale, removed out the explicit discussion of 'pathway to profit' and more integrated it just into the general layout of the earnings release. I know reading through the document written by accountant can be painful. Hopefully, made this a little less painful this quarter. 
One item on Page 3 that I thought was worthwhile to point out, and that's looking at the sequential trends of the business. And Will talked a bit about the year-over-year information, but one thing I think is worthwhile to note and added actually 3 years' worth of data rather than a typical 2 years' worth of data that we cover is a similar trend that we've seen the last several years, and that trend played out again this year in the first quarter is actually from my perspective a little bit of softness in the January, February time frame followed by a huge leap forward from February to March. 
We saw it in 2010, we saw it in 2011 and we saw it again here in 2012, and hopefully that sets us up for continued nice performance as we go into the future. But it's interesting dynamic to our business. The March time frame in each of the last 3 years, we've more than doubled the sequential norm of February to March gains in daily average, and I think it's worthwhile to note. Especially when you look at the month of March because one thing that is noteworthy in our numbers as well is our construction numbers, and construction is roughly 20% of our business, our construction numbers were actually a little bit weak in March. And my perception looking at the data is really that was a very mild winter. There was some work that moved into January and February that normally would have been in February and March, and I think it softened February a little bit, and it softened March a little bit. 
And I had some first-hand knowledge of this only from the standpoint my wife and I had some work done on our home here last year and I told the contractor which is a dangerous thing to tell a contractor. I told the contractor I'm in no particular rush. So when you had a chance to fit it in, come back and finish the work because there was some stuff on outside garage. Well, in early March, I got a call from my contractor and he says little work, I got some time to finish that project that I didn't think he gets it until late summer. So it that tells me there's probably some truth to the fact some work got pushed up into the early part of the quarter and maybe latter half a little bit softer. 
As Will mentioned mix continues to hold up well for us. It came in at 53.4% in March. When I look at the growth drivers that I talked about on Page 5 as Will mentioned, all of our areas are operating above plan. And when I look at the FAST Solutions in particular, we touched on it in our February sales release that we had exceeded our 2,500 number. As you see, we exceeded it soundly. 
But the other thing that jumped out for me was the case of it was solid in all 3 months of the quarter. It wasn't the case of January was big because of a weaker December. It was solid in January, February and March and building. So very nice performance when I look at vending for the quarter.
The profit drivers on Pages 6 and 7, I don't recall us ever having a first quarter with 21% pretax. So it's a nice milestone mark for the organization. As Will touched on earlier, we did lose some of the what I referred to as amplification effect on 'pathway to profit' with weaker gross margin, but it was in store. Our relative profitability per group fell up a little bit from last year. It's still nicely above where it was in 2010. But our $150,000 store group did hold up and actually improved nicely. I believe they improved by about 90 basis points year-over-year. So continue to see some nice performance. 
The other thing I think is worthwhile to note when we started the 'pathway to profit' back in 2007, if you had told me that sometime in the future with an average store size of just over 86,000 that we'd be at 21% pretax, I would have given you a pretty skeptical look because I wouldn't have thought it was possible, and I think we've done a nice job with our operating expenses during that time frame and moving the mix but having nice profits with an average store size, which is still relatively small in the scheme of 'pathway to profit'.
As Will touched on a few minutes ago, I only worked in this release from my perspective is our gross margin. We just aren't executing really well, very well in this regard and but we've always said gross margin is only attitude, and we need to develop some attitude, and I believe we have opportunity. 
With that said, there are some positives when I look at components. Our exclusive brands, our private label, if you will, brands that we talked about in the past, a year ago that was at about 8.5% of our sales. Today that is at 9.3% so we continue to inch forward. Not moving as fast as we'd like but still moving forward and improving the mix. 
Operating and administrative expenses on Page 11 I'll just cut through the chase and say we did we managed that well as we went into the first quarter, and I think we're poised well to go into second and third with a good position on operating expenses, get some listing gross margin will have some nice numbers. 
The final item I'll point out is related to working capital and cash flow on Page 13. Nice numbers. We did a nice job with both inventory growth year-over-year. The challenging thing we've had last several years on all fronts is the expansion of our Large Account business, the expansion of our International business, which is challenging with working capital because especially on the international, we don't have the same distribution support that we have domestically or in North America in general. 
And finally, from a cash flow perspective, operating cash flow was 132% of earnings. About 40% of that comes from the fact we don't have any tax payments. So a 90-plus number in the first quarter is extremely unusual because of the growth we need in accounts receivable because of the sequential increase in sales. So I think a great number from the standpoint of cash flow. We spent about 27% of earnings for CapEx right in line with what we'd expected. So free cash flow of over 100% in the first quarter versus 68% a year ago. 
With that, I will turn it over to the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

When we look at that first number, the contracts signed during the period and we look at 2 years ago we're at 257, and that grew a year we have 1,400. Now we're at about 4,500, that is the raw number. That is the gross number of contracts signed, and there is always things that happen downstream that caused some of those not to be installed. It might be a case of the I guess delayed because the customer changes their mind or maybe the person that signed for wasn't sure what they wanted and they pull back and maybe and it expires, and we don't actually install that. Over time, when I look at that first statistic, about 90% of those signings turn into a vending machine, and about 10% that contract signing expires. It might be subsequently signed as new contract or maybe we get going again 4 months later, 6 months later.

If all of the vending -- we get a very high growth that's going to large customers then we have to work on that, but that's actually a positive problem.

And then the final piece as it relates to locations, we are -- our growth in occupancy related to locations is half the rate of growth from store openings. So we continue to find ways to improve our leverage there from both a percentage of sales standpoint and just absolute dollar standpoint. And that piece is sustainable as you go through the year.

Starting out, I'd like to say that I believe it was a -- or I feel it was a good quarter. Our sales growth was right on plan. Looking at our internal sales goals. I",1789,"Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us on our first quarter conference call. Starting out, I'd like to say that I believe it was a -- or I feel it was a good quarter. Our sales growth was right on plan. 
Looking at our internal sales goals. In January, we're at 100.6% of goal; February, 98.8% of goal; and March, 101.3% of goal. So for the quarter, we're at 100.3% of goal. I'm not sure if it's good sales growth or good forecasting. But whatever, we're right on target this far into the year. I also take a look at the 2-year growth numbers because as we look at the sequential numbers, are trying to understand what the patterns are, but sometimes it's easier to look at the 2-year. And if you look at the 2-year growth numbers that we put in the report and combine 2010 and 2011, there was 40.1% growth in January, 41.5% in February and 42.1% in March. So we continue to march forward and also show a very consistent growth. 
The other reason I feel pretty good about the sales growth is if you look at the purchasing index that was also in the release, last year through the first 3 months, the average for the country, [indiscernible] the U.S. market was at 59.8%, a very high rating. This year, still a good reading but it's down to 53.3%, so it's really 6.5 points lower. And we had similar -- our growth was off a little bit but very similar. So I think the initiatives we're putting in place are working well. 
This week, I had the opportunity to visit -- this week, we're holding our customer show down in Indianapolis, where we bring in about 4,000 to 5,000 customers and 200 suppliers, and we let our customers visit our suppliers and the product. But anyway, that gave me the opportunity to visit with dozens of companies, both suppliers and our customers, also to speak with many of our managers. And the mood is very upbeat. So I was optimistic about that. Many of our customers believe they're going to have a good year, continue to have a good year. And many of the suppliers are hearing that not only from the Fastenal people, but also from other customers. So it was a very upbeat show and gave us a good feel for the next couple of months.
In the report, there was, I believe -- moving on, there's only one negative in our report this quarter, one major negative, and that was the margin. I spend a lot of time looking at the margin, trying to analyze what we're doing and what we need to do. And after spending a time analyzing it and discussing it with most of our sales leaders down in Indianapolis this week, the conclusion I came to, and I hate to say this, but my conclusion is that we've basically taken our eye off the ball a little bit working on other things. But after the discussions I had with the regionals, with our sales leader and our National Accounts sales leaders, I'm very confident that we know what we need to do, and we will see improvement in the second quarter. So we're going to work very hard on that. 
We're not off a long ways. We're still on our range of between 51% and 53%. But as the competitive people that we are, we'd rather be in the high end of the range rather than the low end. So we're going to work very hard to move that up over the next 2 to 3 quarters and get into the upper end of our margin range.
On the expense control side, I have to say the Fastenal team, the Blue Team, did a great job. Our expenses grew about 6 percentage points below sales, exactly what we needed to do. Labor grew a little faster than the other expenses, but that's -- some of that is planned. We did a lot of things, changing some pay programs, trying to make sure that we're taking care of our people, and it's working very well. So not a lot to say on the expense control. Dan will probably touch more on that, but I'm really proud of what we are able to do on expense control.
We know that you already may have noticed we had a little dropoff, it was the store profitability that we show on Page 7, where some of the store groups had lower profitability per size than they had in the previous year. And that's all explained in one word: margin. As we look at that, because margin was a little lower, the profitability per store size was a little lower. So if we can correct the margin or as we correct the margin problem, we'll also correct that problem. But overall, our pretax profit at 21%, I'm proud of the number. We only picked up 90 basis points from last year with our goal as 100, so we missed it by 1/10, but I'm very confident we'll get that back. 
And the most positive thing on that chart on Page 7 is the number of stores that moved up a category. So we continue to do what we have laid out in 'pathway to profit', grow -- move the average store size up, the profitability goes up and the system continues to work. One area on the report that I'm also very happy about was the inventory control. We have said in the fourth quarter call that we thought we could improve our turns. Through the quarter, we only added or we added less than $2 million in inventory. And so we've done a nice job both quarter to -- or sequentially through the quarter, but also year-over-year, a very nice job on inventory growth or controlling our inventory growth, deploying our assets in better ways.
Talking -- switching gears a little bit. Talking about the initiatives that we have, our sales initiatives. All of the initiatives -- I'm happy to report that all of our initiatives are going well. Our Government project that we started 2 years ago is ahead of plan from a standpoint of sales growth. We are fully staffed or, I mean, very few openings. We have the people in place that we need. We have the coverage in the states. Our WSCA contract, which is our big state contract, is going very well. It's at or ahead of plan, and in some states, are doing better than others. But overall, it's doing very well. And we feel very good about the knowledge that we're gaining through the people in the field. 
5 years ago, we probably had 2 or 3 people in the company that had a real good knowledge of how to do this. Now we have a team of about 40. And I think we're just going to continue to gain traction on the Government business, mainly in the state areas where we're looking at other pieces of Government business as well. 
Our Web sales continue to grow. That's been an initiative since really the end of 2010. We did well in 2011, but we continue to see traction in 2012. Buying off the Web is good for our customers. It's good for our stores also because it's more efficient if that continues to do well. 
Metalworking. We're very happy with the results in metalworking. And at the show this week, I had the opportunity to visit with several of our large suppliers that just came on. And on a very positive note, they're happy with the results because that's one of the keys to making this work. We have to be able to sell -- grow fast enough to make the suppliers happy with the results, and that's going well. Our sales people that we've been hiring and training in the field, they're doing a nice job. We have about 52 people that are sales specialists just in metalworking. Our plan is to add another 10 as the year goes on or as we can find the right people to do that. But also the opportunity to speak with many customers who are looking at us for metalworking. And it appears or the theme was now there's another national player, there's another company I can look at to provide my metalworking supplies. And so we've had some very nice opportunities that fits in well with our vending program, and so we're very optimistic about that for the future. It's a large market and there's good, tough competition in it, but we think we can continue to take share. And the main reason is because of the relationships we've developed with these customers over the years. We're not taking it out to new customers per se. It's really developed relationships that are looking for a possible alternative. 
And our biggest initiative that we talked about is vending. And as you saw in the results, we had a great quarter. As I've been stating for the last 4 quarters, our goal would be to hit 2,500 machines for the quarter. We exceeded that by more than 2,000 at 4,500 machines. We installed more than 2,300 machines. And so we're moving along nicely. I am more convinced than ever that it's a long-term change in industrial distribution. Again, I keep talking about the show, but I just got back last night. I had the opportunity to speak with probably 20 to 30 customers that have deployed vending, and not one of them is disappointed with the results. They're all talking about the savings. 
There's really 2 themes that come off from the customers. One is inventory control and how much time it saves them to not have to distribute the product, and the other is the consumptions or the savings. But I think the biggest theme really is about the inventory control more than the savings. And it's just there when we need it, and it's just out of sight, out of mind in a positive way. So we're working very hard on that and believe we'll continue to see good results going forward. 
So overall, looking at the quarter, looking at the information, I'll put it down as a good quarter. If we had improved the margin, I would say it was a great quarter because everything else looks good. So we have some things to work on. We're focused on that. And hopefully, we'll see improvement this quarter. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan, and he'll give you some more detailed color on other things in that quarter. Thank you."

And thanks again for listening in on our call today. So one thing I wanted to touch on, most of you have probably noticed, changed the format of the earnings release a bit this quarter. I felt there was pieces of",1262,"Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody. And thanks again for listening in on our call today. So one thing I wanted to touch on, most of you have probably noticed, changed the format of the earnings release a bit this quarter. I felt there was pieces of it that were getting a bit stale, removed out the explicit discussion of 'pathway to profit' and more integrated it just into the general layout of the earnings release. I know reading through a document written by an accountant can be painful. Hopefully, this makes it a little less painful this quarter. 
One item on Page 3 that I thought was worthwhile to point out, and that's looking at the sequential trends of the business. And Will talked a bit about the year-over-year information. But one thing I think is worthwhile to note and added actually 3 years' worth of data rather than a typical 2 years' worth of data that we cover is a similar trend that we've seen the last several years, and that trend played out again this year in the first quarter, is actually from my perspective a little bit of softness in the January, February timeframe followed by a huge leap forward from February to March. We saw it in 2010, we saw it in 2011 and we saw it again here in 2012. And hopefully, that sets us up for continued nice performance as we go into the future, but it's an interesting dynamic to our business. The March timeframe in each of the last 3 years, we've more than doubled the sequential norm of February to March gains in daily average. And I think it's worthwhile to note, especially when you look at the month of March because one thing that is noteworthy in our numbers as well is our construction numbers. And construction is roughly 20% of our business. Our construction numbers were actually a little bit weak in March. And my perception looking at the data is really that with the very mild winter, there was some work that moved into January and February that normally would have been in February and March. And I think it softened February a little bit, I think it softened March a little bit. 
And I had some first-hand knowledge of this, only from the standpoint my wife and I had some work done on our home here last year. And I told the contractor, which -- this is like a dangerous thing to tell a contractor. I told the contractor, ""I'm in no particular rush. So when you get a chance to fit it in, come back and finish the work."" Because there were some stuff on our outside garage. Well, in early March, I got a call from my contractor, and he says, ""Dan, I'm running a little low on work. I've got some time to finish that project up."" I didn't think he'd get through it until late summer. So it that tells me there's probably some truth to the fact some work got pushed up into the early part of the quarter and maybe latter half a little bit softer. 
As Will mentioned, ISM index, I think, continues to hold up well for us. It came in at 53.4% in March. When I look at the growth drivers that I talked about on Page 5, as Will mentioned, all of our areas are operating above plan. And when I look at the FAST Solutions in particular, we touched on it in our February sales release that we had exceeded our 2,500 number. As you see, we exceeded it soundly.  But the other thing that jumped out for me was the case of it was solid in all 3 months of the quarter. It wasn't the case of January was big because of a weaker December. It was solid in January, February and March and building. So very nice performance when I look at the vending for the quarter.
The profit drivers on Pages 6 and 7. I don't recall us ever having a first quarter with 21% pretax, so it's a nice milestone mark for the organization. As Will touched on earlier, we did lose some of the what I refer to as amplification effect on 'pathway to profit' with weaker gross margin, but it was in store. Our relative profitability per group fell up a little bit from last year. It's still nicely above where it was in 2010. But our $150,000 store group did hold up and actually improved nicely. I believe they improved by about 90 basis points year-over-year, so continue to see some nice performance. 
The other thing I think is worthwhile to note, when we started the 'pathway to profit' back in 2007, if you had told me that at some time in the future with an average store size of just over 86,000 that we'd be at 21% pretax, I would have given you a pretty skeptical look because I wouldn't have thought it was possible. And I think we've done a nice job with lowering our operating expenses during that timeframe and moving the mix but having nice profits with an average store size, which is still relatively small in the scheme of 'pathway to profit'.
As Will touched on a few minutes ago, our only worth in this release from my perspective is our gross margin. We just aren't executing really well, very well in this regard, and -- but we've always said gross margin is all attitude, and we just need to develop some attitude. And I believe we have opportunity. 
With that said, there are some positives when I look at components. Our exclusive brands, our private label, if you will, brands that we talked about in the past, a year ago that was at about 8.5% of our sales. Today, that is at 9.3%, so we continue to inch forward on that. Not moving as fast as we'd like, but still moving forward and improving the mix. 
Operating and administrative expenses on Page 11. I'll just cut through the chase and say we did -- we managed that well as we went into the first quarter, and I think we're poised well to go into second and third with a good position on operating expenses, get some lift in gross margin and we'll have some nice numbers. 
The final item I'll point out is related to working capital and cash flow on Page 13. Nice numbers. We did a nice job with both accounts receivable and inventory growth year-over-year. The challenging thing we've had the last several years on all fronts is the expansion of our large account business, the expansion of our international business, which is challenging with working capital because, especially on the international, we don't have the same distribution support that we have domestically or in North America, in general. 
And finally, from a cash flow perspective, operating cash flow was 132% of earnings. About 40% of that comes from the fact we don't have any tax payments. So a 90-plus number in the first quarter is extremely unusual because of the growth we need in accounts receivable because of the sequential increase in sales. So I think a great number from the standpoint of cash flow. We spent about 27% of earnings for CapEx, right in line with what we'd expected, so free cash flow of over 100% in the first quarter versus 68% a year ago. 
With that, I will turn it over to the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

The data that we disclosed -- keep in mind when we started disclosing this data, this is a new animal for us. And with a lot of information that we disclosed, we have a very time-tested intuitive feel about how things will play out. When we look at that first number, the contracts signed during the period, and we look at 2 years ago, we're at 257. And that grew a year ago, we're at 1,400. Now we're at about 4,500. That is the raw number. That is the gross number of contracts signed. And there is always things that happen downstream that caused some of those not to be installed. It might be a case of the -- it gets delayed because the customer changes their mind or maybe the person that signed for it wasn't sure what they wanted and they pulled back and maybe -- and it expires, and we don't actually install it. Over time, when I look at that first statistic, about 90% of those signings turn into a vending machine. And about 10% that contract signing expires, it might be subsequently signed as a new contract or maybe we get inertia going again 4 months later or 6 months later. But what we're trying to do on that first number is we're trying to just give you, ""Here's a raw number of the contracts we signed that quarter."" So when you add up all those raw numbers and compare that to what's actually installed, you're kind of comparing apples and oranges."

Starting out, I'd like to say that I believe it was a -- or I feel it was a good quarter. Our sales growth was right on plan. Looking at our internal sales goals. I",1784,"Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us on our first quarter conference call. Starting out, I'd like to say that I believe it was a -- or I feel it was a good quarter. Our sales growth was right on plan. 
Looking at our internal sales goals. In January, we're at 100.6% of goal; February, 98.8% of goal; and March, 101.3% of goal. So for the quarter, we're at 100.3% of goal. I'm not sure if it's good sales growth or good forecasting. But whatever, we're right on target this far into the year. I also take a look at the 2-year growth numbers because as we look at the sequential numbers, trying to understand what the patterns are, but sometimes it's easier to look at the 2-year. And if you look at the 2-year growth numbers that we put in the report and combine 2010 and 2011, there was 40.1% growth in January, 41.5% in February and 42.1% in March. So we continue to march forward and also show a very consistent growth. 
The other reason I feel pretty good about the sales growth is if you look at the purchasing index that was also in the release, last year through the first 3 months, the average for the country, the U.S. market is at 59.8%, a very high rating. This year, still a good reading but it's down to 53.3%, so it's really 6.5 points lower. And we had similar -- our growth was off a little bit but very similar. So I think the initiatives we're putting in place are working well. 
This week, I had the opportunity to visit -- this week, we're holding our customer show down in Indianapolis, where we bring in about 4,000 to 5,000 customers and 200 suppliers, and we let our customers visit our suppliers and the product. But anyway, that gave me the opportunity to visit with dozens of companies, both suppliers and our customers, also to speak with many of our managers. And the mood is very upbeat. So I was optimistic about that. Many of our customers believe they're going to have a good year, continue to have a good year. And many of the suppliers are hearing that not only from the Fastenal people, but also from other customers. So it was a very upbeat show and gave us a good feel for the next couple months.
In the report, there was, I believe -- moving on, there's only one negative in our report this quarter, one major negative, and that was the margin. Spend a lot of time looking at the margin, trying to analyze what we're doing and what we need to do. And after spending a time analyzing it and discussing it with most of our sales leaders down in Indianapolis this week, the conclusion I came to, and I hate to say this, but my conclusion is that we've basically taken our eye off the ball a little bit working on other things. But after the discussions I had with the regionals, with our sales leader and our National Accounts sales leaders, I'm very confident that we know what we need to do, and we will see improvement in the second quarter. So we're going to work very hard on that. 
We're not off a long ways. We're still on our range of between 51% and 53%. But as the competitive people that we are, we'd rather be in the high end of the range rather than the low end. So we're going to work very hard to move that up over the next 2 to 3 quarters and get into the upper end of our margin range.
On the expense control side, I have to say the Fastenal team, the Blue Team, did a great job. Our expenses grew about 6 percentage points below sales, exactly what we needed to do. Labor grew a little faster than the other expenses, but that's -- some of that is planned. We did a lot of things, changing some pay programs, trying to make sure that we're taking care of our people, and it's working very well. So not a lot to say on expense control. Dan will probably touch more on that, but I'm really proud of what we were able to do on expense control.
One other area that you may have noticed we had a little drop-off was the store profitability that we show on Page 7, where some of the store groups had lower profitability per size than they had in the previous year. And that's all explained in one word: margin. As we look at that, because margin was a little lower, the profitability per store size was a little lower. So if we can correct the margin or as we correct the margin problem, we'll also correct that problem. But overall, our pretax profit at 21%, I'm proud of the number. We only picked up 90 basis points from last year with our goal as 100, so we missed it by 1/10, but I'm very confident we'll get that back. 
And the most positive thing on that chart on Page 7 is the number of stores that moved up a category. So we continue to do what we have laid out in 'pathway to profit', grow -- move the average store size up, the profitability goes up and the system continues to work. One area on the report that I'm also very happy about was the inventory control. We had stated in the fourth quarter call that we thought we could improve our turns. Through the quarter, we only added -- or we added less than $2 million in inventory. And so we've done a nice job both quarter to -- or sequentially through the quarter, but also year-over-year, a very nice job on inventory growth or controlling our inventory growth, deploying our assets in better ways.
Talking -- switching gears a little bit, talking about the initiatives that we have, our sales initiatives. All of the initiatives -- I'm happy to report that all of our initiatives are going well. Our Government project that we started 2 years ago is ahead of plan from a standpoint of sales growth. We are fully staffed or, I mean, very few openings. We have the people in place that we need. We have the coverage in the states. Our WSCA contract, which is our big state contract, is going very well. It's at or ahead of plan, and some states are doing better than others. But overall, it's doing very well. And we feel very good about the knowledge that we're gaining through the people in the field. 
5 years ago, we probably had 2 or 3 people in the company that had a real good knowledge of how to do this. Now we have a team of about 40. And I think we're just going to continue to gain traction on the Government business, mainly in the state areas where we're looking at other pieces of Government business as well. 
Our Web sales continue to grow. That's been an initiative since really the end of 2010. We did well in 2011, but we continue to see traction in 2012. Buying off the Web is good for our customers. It's good for our stores also because it's more efficient; that continues to do well. 
Metalworking. We're very happy with the results in metalworking. And at the show this week, I had the opportunity to visit with several of our large suppliers that just came on. And on a very positive note, they're happy with the results because that's one of the keys to making this work. We have to be able to sell -- grow fast enough to make the suppliers happy with the results, and that's going well. Our sales people that we've been hiring and training in the field are doing a nice job. We have about 52 people that are sales specialists just in metalworking. Our plan is to add another 10 as the year goes on or as we can find the right people to do that. But also the opportunity to speak with many customers who are looking at us for metalworking. And it appears or the theme was now there's another national player, there's another company I can look at to provide my metalworking supplies. And so we've had some very nice opportunities. It fits in well with our vending program, and so we're very optimistic about that for the future. It's a large market and there's good, tough competition in it, but we think we can continue to take share. And the main reason is because of the relationships we've developed with these customers over the years. We're not taking it out to new customers per se. It's really developed relationships that are looking for a possible alternative. 
And our biggest initiative that we talked about is vending. And as you saw in the results, we had a great quarter. As I've been stating for the last 4 quarters, our goal would be to hit 2,500 machines for the quarter. We exceeded that by more than 2,000 at 4,500 machines. We installed more than 2,300 machines. And so we're moving along nicely. I am more convinced than ever that it's a long-term change in industrial distribution. Again, I keep talking about the show, but I just got back last night. I had the opportunity to speak with probably 20 to 30 customers that have deployed vending, and not one of them is disappointed with the results. They're all talking about the savings. 
There's really 2 themes that come up from the customers. One is inventory control and how much time it saves them to not have to distribute the product, and the other is the consumption -- or the savings. But I think the biggest theme really is about the inventory control more than the savings. And it's just, it's there when we need it, and it's just out of sight, out of mind in a positive way. So we're working very hard on that and believe we'll continue to see good results going forward. 
So overall, looking at the quarter, looking at the information, I'll put it down as a good quarter. If we had improved the margin, I would say it was a great quarter because everything else looks good. So we have some things to work on. We're focused on that. And hopefully, we'll see improvement this quarter. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan, and he'll give you some more detailed color on other things in the quarter. Thank you."

And thanks again for listening in on our call today. So one thing I wanted to touch on, most of you have probably noticed, changed the format of the earnings release a bit this quarter. I felt there was pieces of",1268,"Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody. And thanks again for listening in on our call today. So one thing I wanted to touch on, most of you have probably noticed, changed the format of the earnings release a bit this quarter. I felt there was pieces of it that were getting a bit stale, removed out the explicit discussion of 'pathway to profit' and more integrated it just into the general layout of the earnings release. I know reading through a document written by an accountant can be painful. Hopefully, this makes it a little less painful this quarter. 
One item on Page 3 that I thought was worthwhile to point out, and that's looking at the sequential trends of the business. And Will talked a bit about the year-over-year information. But one thing I think is worthwhile to note and added actually 3 years' worth of data rather than the typical 2 years' worth of data that we cover is a similar trend that we've seen the last several years, and that trend played out again this year in the first quarter, is actually from my perspective a little bit of softness in the January, February timeframe followed by a huge leap forward from February to March. We saw it in 2010, we saw it in 2011 and we saw it again here in 2012. And hopefully, that sets us up for continued nice performance as we go into the future, but it's an interesting dynamic to our business. 
The March timeframe in each of the last 3 years, we've more than doubled the sequential norm of February to March gains in daily average. And I think it's worthwhile to note, especially when you look at the month of March because one thing that is noteworthy in our numbers as well is our construction numbers. And construction is roughly 20% of our business. Our construction numbers were actually a little bit weak in March. And my perception looking at the data is really that with the very mild winter, there was some work that moved into January and February that normally would have been in February and March. And I think it softened February a little bit, I think it softened March a little bit. 
And I have some first-hand knowledge of this, only from the standpoint my wife and I had some work done on our home here last year. And I told the contractor, which -- this is always a dangerous thing to tell a contractor. I told the contractor, ""I'm in no particular rush. So when you get a chance to fit it in, come back and finish the work."" Because there were some stuff on our outside garage. Well, in early March, I got a call from my contractor, and he says, ""Dan, I'm running a little low on work. I've got some time to finish that project up."" I didn't think he'd get to it until late summer. So  that tells me there's probably some truth to the fact some work got pushed up into the early part of the quarter and made the latter half a little bit softer. 
As Will mentioned, ISM index, I think, continues to hold up well for us. It came in at 53.4% in March. When I look at the growth drivers that I talked about on Page 5, as Will mentioned, all of our areas are operating above plan. And when I look at the FAST Solutions in particular, we touched on it in our February sales release that we had exceeded our 2,500 number. As you see, we exceeded it soundly.  But the other thing that jumped out for me was, it was the case of it was solid in all 3 months of the quarter. It wasn't a case of January was big because of a weaker December. It was solid in January, February and March and building. So very nice performance when I look at the vending for the quarter.
The profit drivers on Pages 6 and 7. I don't recall us ever having a first quarter with 21% pretax, so it's a nice milestone mark for the organization. As Will touched on earlier, we did lose some of the, what I refer to as amplification effect on 'pathway to profit' with weaker gross margin, but it was – and so our relative profitability per group fell up a little bit from last year. It's still nicely above where it was in 2010. But our $150,000 store group did hold up and actually improved nicely. I believe they improved by about 90 basis points year-over-year, so continued to see some nice performance. 
The other thing I think is worthwhile to note, when we started the 'pathway to profit' back in 2007, if you'd have told me that at some time in the future with an average store size of just over 86,000 that we'd be at 21% pretax, I would have given you a pretty skeptical look because I wouldn't have thought it was possible. And I think we've done a nice job with lowering our operating expenses during that timeframe and moving the mix but having nice profits with an average store size, which is still relatively small in the scheme of 'pathway to profit'.
As Will touched on a few minutes ago, our only wart in this release from my perspective is our gross margin. We just aren't executing really well, very well in this regard, and -- but we've always said gross margin is all attitude, and we just need to develop some attitude. And I believe we have opportunity. 
With that said, there are some positives when I look at components. Our exclusive brands, our private label, if you will, brands that we talked about in the past, a year ago that was at about 8.5% of our sales. Today, that is at 9.3%, so we continue to inch forward on that. Not moving as fast as we'd like, but still moving forward and improving the mix. 
Operating and administrative expenses on Page 11. I'll just cut to the chase and say I think we did a -- we managed that well as we went into the first quarter, and I think we're poised well to go into second and third with a good position on operating expenses, get some lift in gross margin and we'll have some nice numbers. 
The final item I'll point out is relating to working capital and cash flow on Page 13. Nice numbers. We did a nice job with both accounts receivable and inventory growth year-over-year. The challenging thing we've had the last several years on all fronts is the expansion of our large account business, the expansion of our international business, which is challenging with working capital because, especially on the international, we don't have the same distribution support that we have domestically or in North America, in general. 
And finally, from a cash flow perspective, operating cash flow was 132% of earnings. About 40% of that comes from the fact we don't have any tax payments. So a 90%-plus number in the first quarter is extremely unusual because of the growth we need in accounts receivable because of the sequential increase in sales. So I think a great number from the standpoint of cash flow. We spent about 27% of earnings for CapEx, right in line with what we'd expected, so free cash flow of over 100% in the first quarter versus 68% a year ago. 
With that, I will turn it over to the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

It's probably worthwhile to point out, and we mentioned this last May at our investor conference, but I think it's worthwhile to point out. The data we disclosed -- keep in mind when we started disclosing this data, this is a new animal for us. And with a lot of information that we disclose, we have a very time-tested intuitive feel about how things will play out. When we look at that first number, the contracts signed during the period, and we look at 2 years ago, we're at 257. And that grew a year ago, we were at 1,400. Now we're at about 4,500. That is the raw number. That is the gross number of contracts signed. And there is always things that happen downstream that cause some of those not to be installed. It might be a case of the -- it gets delayed because the customer changes their mind or maybe the person that signed for it wasn't sure what they wanted and they pull back and maybe -- and it expires, and we don't actually install it. Over time, when I look at that first statistic, about 90% of those signings turn into a vending machine. And about 10% that contract signing expires, it might be subsequently signed as a new contract or maybe we get inertia going again 4 months later or 6 months later. But what we're trying to do on that first number is we're trying to just give you, ""Here's a raw number of the contracts we signed that quarter."" So when you add up all those raw numbers and compare that to what's actually installed, you're kind of comparing apples and oranges."

And you have to understand we have one big thing going for us, and that's pay programs. Margin is a big part, our gross profit is a big part of how we get paid, all of us. And most of the people were disciplined, no matter -- even though we had a good quarter, many of us, our bonuses were down; many of our regionals, their bonuses there down."

I'm very happy with the quarter that we reported this morning. I'm going to make my comments pretty brief.

I'm very happy with the quarter that we reported this morning. I'm going to make my comments pretty brief. Dan does a very good job in his press release and so we'll go through it pretty quickly and basically just give you the color as I see it. 
Manufacturing has slowed. That's clear, but on a very positive note, I've been off talking a lot of our regional people and district people and we have not seen a lot of abrupt changes. It's more of a step down and we haven't seen a lot of panic from our customers, so we think although it's much slower, so much slower than it was, it doesn't appear to be a lot of panic going on, so that gives us some optimism for the next several months. 
Construction has also slowed. But we're actually have a difficult time of the comparisons or understanding the comparisons. Because of the very warm winter, now the hot summer, it's hard to see whether the business would have normalized. But overall, it appears to be somewhat weaker than it was but still a lot of business and a lot of opportunity out there. 
On the margin, my comment there is I think we've made nice progress. I'm happy with what the team has done. We believe that there are still several opportunities or many opportunities to show additional improvement in margin. We're going to continue to work very, very hard on the margin as we go forward. 
One of the areas that I guess on I'm the happiest with is our expense management. The second quarter, this quarter was the first time we've ever reported SG&A below 30% which we're proud of, and it's really, I believe, it's really just a result of focus and hard work by the team. A lot of people working on, a lot of people understand the expenses and I guess really doing a nice job and I want to  give the people in our team a kudos for that because they're working very hard. 
Initiatives, our sales initiatives, we continue to see very nice progress on those. Metalworking continues to show progress. We continue to pace, to run at a nice pace, but we have a long ways to go. We're learning a lot about it. Our learning curve is very steep right now. We've been meeting with several good managers and talking about these initiative and finding out what we need to improve upon in areas that we can move faster with. 
Government is also very similar. We're making nice progress with our government initiatives and there's a tremendous opportunity going forward. Both of those areas were pretty much fully staffed as we see it today with our sales teams and those sales teams continue to improve their knowledge level so we think that we have -- we should continue to see incremental improvement quarter-to-quarter as we go forward. So that's some built-in upside for us. 
Vending, all I can say is, I feel we made great progress. Our team, Russ Rubie and his team runs the vending program. They're working hard and they've had the opportunity to talk to several of our larger customers that have deployed our vending solutions and the feedback has all been very positive. So the customers are seeing the savings, the customers like that control on their inventory, the software is working well for them to show them where they're using and how they're using these products, so there's a very positive customer feedback. 
In our processes, internal processes, for how we receive the orders from the customers, how we set the machines and all the different things that we have developed continue to improve and we still have a lot of opportunity there to improve these processes. And every time we do that, we lower our cost and we improve the customer service at the same time, so we have a tremendous amount of focus on the entire process of the vending business from the start to finish and think that, that will just continue to get better as we go forward. 
Sitting back, or stepping back and thinking of the overview of our business and the puts and the takes, thinking about the economy, the economy, as we see it, is I guess we'd say it's not great, but it's okay, so we should continue to -- we should be able to perform at a reasonable level in the current economic situation. I think we're doing a nice job , as I mentioned, with expense control which creates cash flow, so we're in a very positive position there, feel good about that. 
Our sales drivers initiatives that we continue to talk about are getting stronger, which is very good. You saw that with the vending numbers that we reported. We're actually accelerating in those areas. Some of the areas that we don't talk as much about are internal things. One that I'm very optimistic about is our IT group has developed some new software programs to use in our stores, and all of them, there's actually 2 or 3 large ones that were either rolling out our adjusting at this time. Our systems that are set up to make store life far easier and automate different processes like receiving product, how we process orders and several other areas, 3 weeks ago, I had the opportunity to go out and visit 11 stores in eastern Wisconsin, larger stores, some of the more mature area and talk to managers about how these were working. And in every case, they were talking about this one saves me an hour a day or this one saves me 2 hours a week. And we only have these initiatives rolled out to a handful of stores or a smaller percentage of our stores. As we do that, it has the tremendous upside to save labor in the store, and usually, the way that works, that label will now be used for sales activity, and we're very optimistic about the potential for the sales of our company over the next 2 to 6, 7 quarters, very optimistic. 
Our warehouse and transportation group continues to work on automating their systems. We're within about 4 weeks of starting up our new automated warehouse hear at the Winona facility, and that should not only show up our cycle times to produce the others but also lower our expense and we have several other projects that we're working on for warehouse automation. 
The transportation group, the people that run our entire fleet, or direct our entire fleet, are always into the project trying to understand the use of compressed natural gas CNG to run our trucks off and we've actually have some very good feedback, it's a small experiment, with our branch vehicles and now they have some semis coming in, some large vehicles coming in, and it has some real potential if it works up for the future. As an example, the semis that we're working on, we would say that on the average between $1,500 and $2,000 per month in operating expense on those trucks after paying a higher price for the vehicle and the tanks, so it has some potential going forward to lower our expense. And as you know, transportation has always been a very big part of our business. 
So overall, very positive about the future things that we have going on and we'll just have to work through this slow economic time and go from there. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, and I thank you again for joining us today."

I'm going to touch on a handful of things in the press release to highlight a few things that we believe are noteworthy. Let's start with the sequence of tre",1773,"Thank you, Will, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us as well on our call. I'm going to touch on a handful of things in the press release to highlight a few things that we believe are noteworthy. 
Let's start with the sequence of trends on Page 3. If you look at the 3 years we have displayed there, it really is a story of 3 different years. If I look at 2010, from January to October, we were soundly beating the historical pattern about 60% to 70% of the time. February was what I'd call a setback month. And at June, our cumulative number was in line with history, we were beating it most of the time, we had a big setback month, but we were trending with history. 
2011 was a little different story. From January to October, we were actually beating, soundly beating the pattern a little bit less, about 50% or 60% of the time, but we didn't have any big setback month. And at the midpoint of the year, we were about 370 basis points ahead of what history says we should be building. And so we come into the year, we'd estimate we'd grow 19 based on history. We ended growing closer to 22 based on just having better momentum and better trend throughout the year and no big setback month. 
When I look at 2012, March was -- January to June time frame that we have history on, March was a huge beat, and April and June were essentially in line with our historical patterns. February and May were our setback months, and because of those 2 months, we were sitting there about 330 basis points behind our history. Those are just some of the things I guess to note when we look at the sequential patterns of our business. 
When I look at the second half of the year, the first positive and negative. Positive, I think we have some nice built-up momentum with our vending machines that have been signed and are going to be installed, the ones that have been installed about 6 months which are significant. And the headwind is, the uncertainty about the economy and some of the things going on that our currency rates. 
One of the things that we did see change quite abruptly in the spring, and I mentioned it on Page 4 of the release is, on our production fastener side or on our fasteners in general. In the first quarter, that business was growing about 15.5%. In the second quarter, it dropped to just double digits in April. It dropped down about 6% in May and rebounded a bit to about 9% in June. But definitely, it has taken a step back. 
If you look at non-fastener areas, areas where most of our growth drivers are centered on, we're seeing still very strong results still in the close to 20% neighborhood. 
The ISM index, I touched on that in the release as well, dropped just below 50 here in June. I believe that's the first reading below 50 since obviously 2009 was quite long stretch. Growth drivers, as Will mentioned, we're seeing nice progress on those. One thing that I think is really noteworthy when you look at the venting stats is while we were seeing softening trends as we went through the second quarter, our vending numbers, the growth of our vending customers actually improved from Q1, where we grew at 33.9% with that subset of customers to Q2, where we grew at 34.3%, which from a directional a standpoint, I think that's a huge accomplishment because these are larger customers where a lot of these vending machines are going and we're really demonstrating our ability to take market share at a faster pace in that subset of customers. 
Profit drivers on Page 8, a few things that I thought were noteworthy, we're often guilty a bit of beating ourselves up internally and externally a bit when some things aren't working as we think they could, a god example of that is our margin in the first quarter. We do this because we believe we fixed up today, we don't just analyze and talk about it or say it another way, rationalize it. However, if I take a longer-term look at our business and look at first quarter of 2007, so that's last quarter before we started the 'pathway to profit' in the second quarter of 2012, our average store has gone from 72,000 a month to 89,000 per month. Our gross margin has increased from 51% to 51.6% and operating costs have improved through our 'pathway to profit' and through our initiatives to improve our relative performance in each category or said a much simpler way, we've increased the size of Fastenal by about 65% and we've doubled our profits. These are great long-term improvements and we are all about long-term improvements. 
The other thing that I think is worthwhile to note, we probably are a little anal on some of our systems in putting our press release, one of them is the table that shows our headcount numbers and our store numbers, et cetera as we tried to demonstrate and to communicate what we're seeing on the 'pathway to profit'. 
If you look at FTE headcount growth, in that table, on Page 10, you'd notice that since the first quarter of 2007, we've added about 3,700 FTEs to the business or an increase of about 38%. Of this, about 3,200 or about 87% of our increase are individuals that have direct contact with our customers, either in the store or a nonstore selling role. We added another 235 people or about 6% into our distribution centers to support that 65% increase in sales. We added another 229 or about another 6% into our manufacturing centers, and about 40% of this came from our Holo-Krome acquisition back in 2009. And because of the efficiencies we've gained in our business in the support areas, we've added 27 FTEs or less than 1% of our headcount growth since the first quarter of 2007 have been in a role that doesn't directly relate to selling, moving product or manufacturing product that we sell. And I think that's a strong tribute to the individuals internally, as well as the wisdom and the possibilities of our 'pathway to profit'. 
And speaking of Holo-Krome, I thought I'd mention quickly that I had the opportunity here several months ago to go out, and one of our regional VPs, out in Ohio was having a district managers need to there to get a view of the facility as well as have the district meeting, and I went out to speak to the group. One comment I'd make is, we moved into a new manufacturing facility about several years ago. It was my first chance to see it. It was a very impressive facility, very impressive people I met that work in that facility and my compliments to him and his team out there. 
Also, as noted in the the table, we hit 22.2% operating margin. I don't know if that -- I think that's our best quarter we've ever had from an operating margin perspective. I'm sure if I'm wrong, somebody will call me later today and inform me, but very impressive. We had about an 80 basis point improvement from 2011, not 100 basis points that we strive for, but I think very strong given that we moved our operating expenses below 30%, and that's the first as well, I believe, as Will mentioned earlier in the call. 
The gross margin on Page 10, as I mentioned, we kind of beat ourselves up on that a little bit, and that was our work in the first quarter. We aren't done yet, but I'm pleased with the progress we've seen in the second quarter. I'm also pleased in general when I look at the 22% pretax, the improvement in gross margin, the improvement in our business that we've experienced not only in the last year but in the last 5 to personally be associated with an organization of this caliber. 
As mentioned in prior quarters, our exclusive brands continue to inch upward. Today, they are about 9.5% of our sales. A good piece of that is being driven by our vending solution. Operating and administrative expenses, we talk about the great thing we did with expense control. I think the story is often understated because under the surface of those expenses, there are some things that are growing quite dramatically, but I see them as high-quality items of growth. 401(k), profit sharing contribution, we share a piece of our profits with our employees that participate either in our retirement programs throughout the company. Our profit-sharing contribution in the quarter grew 74% from the number a year ago. In fact, if you look at our profit sharing contribution for the second quarter, we are about 70% of our annual number of just 2 years ago in 2010. 
Also, in our occupancy, our vending machine cost more than double from a year ago because the success we've seen with vending. Those are 2 items that are ongoing the company, high-quality items I might add. 
Finally, on the working capital side, all I can say is we had a nice improvement and I credit that to our team in the field. They're doing his job of managing their working capital needs both in accounts receivable and inventory, which produced a very strong cash flow again as we go through the first 6 months of the year. Our expectation and we started 'pathway to profit' was operational working capital. That should be operational cash flow at 89% of earnings. I believe that range has really moved to 85% to 95%. Year-to-date, we're at about 90%. Net CapEx, we really set our target number of that as about 25% of earnings; year-to-date, we're about 23%, which puts our free cash flow at about 66%, 67% of earnings not only a strong number given our range of estimating about 60% assisted 65% but a very strong number when you consider the first half of the year is where we need the most working capital growth because of the seasonality in our business. I think that bodes well for our cash flow capabilities in the second half of the year. 
With that, I would turn it over to questions. As we've said in the past, please limit yourself to 1 questions so we can get to the entire group and post them queued up. Thank you."

The Midwest where we've been strong also saw a little bit of -- can't give you much help there. Industry-wise, the number, manufacturing construction there. So overall, it just seems like and I think I commented this, the entire thing has stepped down a little bit, a little energy just let off the throttle for the economy. Even our international business is much slower than it was a year ago. Mexico, that has remained very strong for us, their growth was slightly lower than it had been in previous months, still well above the company, more than double the company.

The software things that I've talked about, our branch-based initiatives where it's just, it's operational efficiencies and how we receive the product, fit the product, ship the product, some of the larger stores larger volume, we are saving labor. I was in our largest facility on a trip to Wisconsin and the manager there has had this system for about 3 to 4 months now. He said, well, I could not operate the business today without that and I suppose he'd figured out that, that's his feeling which is very positive. So there are a lot of things we're working on the vending software to streamline that process. It wasn't would have been a real big you and we had 500 or 1,000 machines. But now that we have 13,000 machines installed, we're going to -- by the end of the year, we could be close to 20 or probably should be close to 20. Those types of things really work and give us some efficiencies. We are, as an organization, we are very focused on making a more efficient business, a leaner business. So in the higher economy, we can use that to grow our sales paths from being leaner. In a slow economy, we can use sensibly to lower our costs and be a better competitor and be more profitable."

And if you need to follow, I'll give you a follow-up on that, but I think it says more -- I think it understates the strength of vending in general because if you notice, one of the things we touched on was the slowdown in our fasteners. Our fasteners really aren't helped by our vending. Vending is really about the the non-fastener side of the business. So I think the fastener business is doing what the fastener business will do right now because of what's happening in the economy. And the growth we're seeing is because of our ability to keep taking market share, but the economy has fallen back, in my opinion, on the fastener side. So I think it's more about that piece of the business. Clearly, our stores with fasteners grow faster with vending grow faster than the stores without. In fact, I believe if you look at our stores, that Will maybe want to touch on, if you look at the stores that have deployed 10 machines or more, those stores are growing at almost double the rate of the peer group. So there really is something. Now there's more to it than just vending and maybe the better managers, people embracing different ideas. But there is a direct correlation. And also, and to answer is 10%, 11% the right number, if the ISM is flat to down, it says that there's no growth, no underlying growth, so everything that we're getting is taking share. And taking share at that rate at our size is probably still pretty good performance. What it really tells us is we need initiatives to cover a broader base of our business, and that's what we're focusing on saying, okay, vending's working well, government's working well, metalworking is working well, we just need more of those and figure out what are the best ones to continue on above average growth as an organization."

We're comfortable we're going to exceed that, but we're not going to ratchet up the number externally because it's still a tremendous amount of work, but we're optimistic that we can keep a fast pace. As far as the types of machines, the FAST 5000 is still the work since we're signing more of those than all the other ones combined. The second machine that we're seeing tremendous success with is the lockers. We put out the new locker system that's actually stand-alone which means it doesn't need to be driven up of the FAST 5000 or the control in the FAST 5000. And we cannot keep up with that machine. In fact, we would've installed several hundred more machines in the quarter if we would've had the machines to do it. The success is greater than we'd estimated that we're getting caught up. We believe we got caught up this quarter and moving forward. The cutting tool machines are moving slower than we had hoped. We are signing lots of them, but not the numbers that we had hoped. And the FAST 3000 is moving up, but also slower than I would have estimated. But that really -- whether that's a 3000 or a 5000, it really doesn't matter to us. And part of the reason I think that's moving slower is we're still very focused on the larger customers and it's a machine that's designed for smaller customers with smaller usage. But as a group, we're not real concerned which machine sign, we just want to get our footprint out there. We want to turn our slide into that account. And then for the most part, what we're seeing is the customers that have it or a lot of our growth is coming from that are deploying more equipment and other plans then so that's very positive result that we're seeing."

We thought we may be a little sloppy and maybe not as focused as we need to be. You're right, there were some headwinds. But the vending overall isn't a headwind unless it's being sold to larger customers. We don't see a step-down in the margin and in vending just because it's vending. We see a step-down in margin biggest it's being vended to large customers that are typically lower-margin customers. We want to make that clear because there seems to be a notion out there that if it goes to the vending machine, it's in the lower gross margin. The same product and the same customer doesn't really matter how we deliver it. It's about the customer, it's about the customer and the product delivered to that customer. And overall, from an operating margin standpoint, as we develop our processes for vending, although the gross margins may be lower to those customers, our operating margin should continue to improve because it's a far more efficient process. So we're looking at this as long term, a big tailwind, not a big headwind."

We have seen it slowing in our international business. Some of that is FX. But also, we didn't do as good a job of signing new large accounts. Most of our international business is driven by large account signings, and we didn't have quite as many successes in the fourth and the first quarter which affected our second quarter growth. We do have a lot of good things going on. We just signed a couple of nice large customers that will be coming on later this quarter in the early fourth quarter which will give us some boost. And so we're expecting the growth rates to come back. But it's always going to be more up and down than the rest of our business because it's driven by a handful of large customers where those stores are. As far as new areas, we're just getting going in Brazil. It's taken us longer than we expected, it's a bureaucratic nightmare with the taxes and the things we have to do. But we're very optimistic about that area. And so overall, we still believe international is going to do well for us.

I'm very happy with the quarter that we reported this morning. I'm going to make my comments pretty brief. Dan does a very good job in his press release and so I'm go through it pretty quickly and basically just give you the color as I see it. 
Manufacturing has slowed, that's clear. But on a very positive note, I've been off talking to lot of our regional people and district people and we have not seen a lot of abrupt changes. It's more of a step down and we haven't seen a lot of panic from our customers, so we think although it's much slower, so much slower than it was, it doesn't appear to be a lot of panic going on, so that gives us some optimism for the next several months. 
Construction has also slowed. But we're actually having a difficult time with the comparisons or understanding the comparisons because of the very warm winter, now the hot summer, it's hard to see whether the business would have normalized. But overall, it appears to be somewhat weaker than it was but there is still a lot of business and a lot of opportunity out there. 
On the margin, my comment there is I think we've made nice progress. I'm happy with what the team has done. We believe there are still several opportunities or many opportunities to show additional improvement in margin. We're going to continue to work very, very hard on the margin as we go forward. 
One of the areas that I guess I'm the happiest with is our expense management. The second quarter, this quarter, was the first time that we've ever reported SG&A below 30%, which we're proud of, and it's really -- I believe, it's really just a result of focus and hard work by the team. A lot of people working on, a lot of people understand the expenses and I guess really doing a nice job. And I want to give the chief people on our team a kudos for that because they're working very hard. 
Initiatives, our sales initiatives, we continue to see very nice progress on those. Metalworking continues to show progress. We continue to pace -- run at a nice pace, but we have a long ways to go. We're learning a lot about it. Our learning curve is very steep right now. I've been meeting with several groups of managers and talking about these initiative and finding out what we need to improve upon in areas that we can move faster with. 
Government is also very similar. We're making nice progress with our government initiatives and there's a tremendous opportunity going forward. Both of those areas were pretty much fully staffed, as we see it today with our sales teams, and those sales teams continue to improve their knowledge level. So we think that we have -- we should continue to see incremental improvement quarter-to-quarter as we go forward, so that's some built-in upside for us. 
Vending, all I can say is I feel we made great progress. Our team, Russ Rubie and his team that runs the vending program, they're working hard and they've had the opportunity to talk to several of our larger customers that have deployed our vending solutions and the feedback has all been very positive. So the customers are seeing the savings. The customers like the control on their inventory. The software is working well for them to show them what they're using, how they're using these products. So there's a very positive customer feedback. 
In our processes, internal processes, for how we receive the orders from the customers, how we set the machines up, all the different things that we have developed, continue to improve. And we still have a lot of opportunity there to improve these processes. And every time we do that, we lower our cost and we improve the customer service at the same time. So we have a tremendous amount of focus on the entire process of the vending business from the start to finish, and I think that, that will just continue to get better as we go forward. 
Sitting back or stepping back and thinking of the overview of our business and the puts and the takes, thinking about the economy, the economy, as we see it, is I guess we'd say it's not great, but it's okay. So we should continue to -- we should be able to perform at a reasonable level in the current economic situation. I think we're doing a nice job, as I mentioned, with expense control, which creates cash flow. So we're in a very positive position there, I feel good about that. 
Our sales drivers initiatives that we continue to talk about are getting stronger, which is very good. You saw that with the vending numbers that we reported. We're actually accelerating in those areas. Some of the areas that we don't talk as much about are internal things. One that I'm very optimistic about is we've -- our IT group has developed some new software programs to use in our stores. And all of them, there's actually 2 or 3 large ones that we're either rolling out or adjusting at this time. Our systems that are set up to make store life far easier and automate different processes like receiving product, how we process orders and several other areas. Three weeks ago, I had the opportunity to go out and visit 11 stores in eastern Wisconsin, larger stores, some of our more mature area and talk to managers about how these were working. And in every case, they were talking about this one saves me an hour a day or this one saves me 2 hours a week. And we only have these initiatives rolled out to a handful of stores or a smaller percentage of our stores. As we do that, it has the tremendous upside to save labor in the store and usually, with the way that works, is that labor will now be used for sales activity. So I'm very optimistic about what this -- the potential of this has for our company over the next 2 to 6, 7 quarters, very optimistic. 
Our warehouse and transportation group continues to work on automating their systems. We're within about 4 weeks of starting up our new automated warehouse here at the Winona facility, and that should not only shorten up our cycle times to produce the orders, but also lower our expense and we have several other projects that we're working on for warehouse automation. 
The transportation group, the people that run all our entire fleet or direct our entire fleet, are always into a project trying to understand the use of compressed natural gas, CNG, to run our trucks off. And we've actually had some very good feedback to small experiment with our branch vehicles, and now they have some semis coming in, some large vehicles coming in, and it has some real potential if it works out for the future. As an example, the semis that we're working on, we would save, on the average, between $1,500 and $2,000 per month in operating expense on those trucks after paying a higher price for the vehicle and the tanks. So it has some potential going forward to lower our expense. And as you know, transportation has always been a very big part of our business. 
So overall, I'm very positive about the future of things that we have going on, and we'll just have to work through this slower economic time and go from there. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, and I thank you again for joining us today."

I'm going to touch on a handful of things in the press release to highlight a few things that we believe are noteworthy. Let's start with the sequential tren",1792,"Thank you, Will, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us as well on our call. I'm going to touch on a handful of things in the press release to highlight a few things that we believe are noteworthy. 
Let's start with the sequential trends on Page 3. If you look at the 3 years we have displayed there, it really is a story of 3 different years. If I look at 2010, from January to October, we were soundly beating the historical pattern about 60% to 70% of the time. February was what I'd call a setback month. And at June, our cumulative number was in line with history, we were beating it most of the time, we had a big setback month, but we were trending with history. 
2011 was a little bit different story. From January to October, we actually we're beating, soundly beating the pattern a little bit less, about 50% or 60% of the time, but we didn't have any big setback months. And at the midpoint of the year, we were about 370 basis points ahead of what history says we should be building. And so we come into the year, we've estimate we'd grow around 19 based on history. We ended growing closer to 22 based on just having better momentum and better trends throughout the year and no big setback months. 
When I look at 2012, March was -- January to June time frame that we have history on, March was a huge beat. And April and June were essentially in line with our historical patterns. February and May were our setback months. And because of those 2 months, we were sitting there about 330 basis points behind our history. Those are just some of the things I guess to note when we look at the sequential patterns of our business. 
When I look at the second half of the year, the -- first some positives, then negatives. Positive, I think we have some nice built-up momentum with our vending machines that have been signed and are going to be installed, the ones that have been installed in the last 6 months, which are significant. And the headwind is the uncertainty about the economy and some of the things going on with our currency rates. 
One of the things we did see a change quite abruptly in the spring, and I mentioned it on Page 4 of the release, is on our production fastener side or on our fasteners in general. In the first quarter, that business was growing about 15.5%. In the second quarter, it dropped to just double digits in April. It dropped down about 6% in May and rebounded a bit to about 9% in June. But definitely, it has taken a step back. 
If you look at non-fastener areas, areas where most of our growth drivers are centered on, we're seeing still very strong results still in the close to 20% neighborhood. 
The ISM index, I touched on that in the release as well, dropped just below 50 here in June. I believe that's the first reading below 50 since obviously 2009, which was quite a long stretch. Growth drivers, as Will mentioned, we're seeing a nice progress on those. One thing that I think is really noteworthy when you look at the venting stats, is while we were seeing softening trends as we went through the second quarter, our vending numbers, the growth of our vending customers actually improved from Q1, where we grew at 33.9% with that subset of customers to Q2, where we grew at 34.3%. Which from a directional standpoint, I think that's a huge accomplishment because these are larger customers where a lot of these vending machines are going and we're really demonstrating our ability to take market share at a faster pace in that subset of customers. 
Profit drivers on Page 8, a few things that I thought were noteworthy, we're often guilty a bit of beating ourselves up internally and externally a bit when some things aren't working as we think they could. A god example of that is our margin in the first quarter. We do this because we believe we fixed it up today, we don't just analyze and talk about it or said another way, rationalize it. However, if I take a longer-term look at our business and look at first quarter of 2007, so the last quarter before we started the pathway to profit in the second quarter of 2012, our average store has gone from 72,000 a month to 89,000 per month. Our gross margin has increased from 51% to 51.6% and our operating costs have improved through our pathway to profit and through our initiatives to improve our relative performance in each category or said a much simpler way, we've increased the size of Fastenal by about 65% and we've doubled our profits. These are great long-term improvements and we are all about long-term improvements. 
The other thing that I think is worthwhile to note, we probably are a little [indiscernible] with some of our statistics we put in our press release, one of them is the table that shows our headcount numbers and our store numbers, et cetera, as we tried to demonstrate and to communicate what we're seeing on the pathway to profit.
If you look at the FTE headcount growth, in that table on Page 10, you would notice that since the first quarter of 2007, we've added about 3,700 FTEs to the business or an increase of about 38%. Of this, about 3,200 or about 87% of our increase are individuals that have direct contact with our customers, either in the store or a non-store selling role. We added another 235 people or about 6% into our distribution centers to support that 65% increase in sales. We added another 229 or about another 6% into our manufacturing centers, and about 40% of this came from our Holo-Krome acquisition back in 2009. And because of the efficiencies we've gained in our business in the support areas, we've added 27 FTEs or less than 1% of our headcount growth since the first quarter of 2007, have been in a role that doesn't directly relate to selling, moving product or manufacturing product that we sell. And I think that's a strong tribute to the individuals internally, as well as the wisdom and the possibilities of our pathway to profit. 
And speaking of Holo-Krome, I thought I'd mention quickly that I had the opportunity here several months ago to go out, and one of our regional VPs, who's office are at -- out of Ohio, was having a district managers meet there to get a view of the facility, as well as have their district meeting, and I went out to speak to the group. One comment I'd make is, we've moved into a new manufacturing facility about several years ago. It was my first chance to see it. Very impressive facility, very impressive people I met that work in that facility, and my compliments to Tim and his team out there. 
Also, as noted in the table, we hit 22.2% operating margin. I don't know if that -- I think that's our best quarter we've ever had from an operating margin percent perspective. I'm sure if I'm wrong, somebody will call me later today and inform me, but very impressive. We had about an 80 basis point improvement from 2011, not the 100 basis points that we strive for, but I think very strong given that we moved our operating expenses below 30%. And that's the first as well, I believe, as Will mentioned earlier in the call. 
The gross margin on Page 10, as I mentioned, we kind of beat ourselves up on that a little bit, and that was our work in the first quarter. We aren't done yet, but I'm pleased with the progress we've seen in the second quarter. I'm also pleased, in general, when I look at the 22% pretax, the improvement in gross margin, the improvement in our business that we have experienced not only in the last year but in the last 5 to personally be associated with an organization of this caliber. 
As mentioned in prior quarters, our exclusive brands continue to inch upward. Today, they are about 9.5% of our sales. A good piece of that is being driven by our vending solution. Operating and administrative expenses, we talk about the great thing we did with expense control. I think the story is often understated because under the surface in those expenses, there are some things that are growing quite dramatically, but I see them as high-quality items of growth. 401(k), profit sharing contribution, we share a piece of our profits with our employees that participate either in our retirement programs throughout the company. Our profit-sharing contribution in the quarter grew 74% from the number a year ago. In fact, if you look at our profit sharing contribution calc for the second quarter, we're about 70% of our annual number of just 2 years ago in 2010. 
Also, in our occupancy, our vending machine cost more than doubled from a year ago because of the success we've seen with vending. Those are 2 items that are outgrowing the company, high-quality items, I might add. 
Finally, on the working capital side, all I can say is we had a nice improvement, and I credit that to our team in the field. They're doing a job of managing their working capital needs, both accounts receivable and inventory, which produced a very strong cash flow again as we go through the first 6 months of the year. Our expectation when we started pathway to profit was operational working capital. That should be operational cash flow at 89% of earnings. I believe that range has really moved to 85% to 95%. Year-to-date, we're at about 90%. Net CapEx, we've really set our target number of that, it's about 25% of earnings. Year-to-date, we're at about 23%, which puts our free cash flow at about 66%, 67% of earnings. Not only a strong number given our range of estimating about 60% to 65%, but a very strong number when you consider the first half of the year is where we need the most working capital growth because of the seasonality in our business. I think that bodes well for our cash flow capabilities in the second half of the year. 
With that, I would turn it over to questions. As we have said and asked in the past, please limit yourself to one question so we can get through the entire group of folks that get queued up. Thank you."

So as we work in -- I'm not going to make predictions on what our gross margins are going to do or not, but if you think of the mechanics of what's happening in 2011, our gross margin was stepping down during the year. So our comps changed dramatically as we step through this year. And all of a sudden, all that headwind from gross margin dissipates as we get into the second half of the year. So that puts us in a position, if we're doing good job with operating expenses, to do a great job on raising operating margin. But Will, maybe you want to touch on a few of the initiatives."

The first half of the year was a little tougher because fuel prices started out high, but we are making money on our transportation and we'll be, at least based on halfway through the year -- well, halfway through the year, we've already made more money on our freight program than we did the entire year of 2011, so well ahead there. The software things that I talked about are branch-based initiatives where it's just -- it's operational efficiencies and how we receive the product, pick the product, ship the product. So on the larger stores with higher volume, we are saving labor. I was in our largest facility on that trip to Wisconsin, and the manager there has had this system for about 3 to 4 months now. He said, ""Well, I could not operate the business today without that."" I suppose he'd figured it out, but that's his feeling which was very positive. So there are a lot of things we're working on the vending software to streamline that process. It wasn't -- it wouldn't have been a real big deal when we had 500 or 1,000 machines, but now that we have 13,000 machines installed, we're going to -- by the end of the year, we could be close to 20,000 or probably should be close to 20,000. Those types of things really work and give us some efficiencies. We are, as an organization, we are very focused on making a more efficient business, a leaner business. So in the higher economy, we can use that to grow our sales faster and being leaner. In a slow economy, we can use it defensively to lower our costs and be a better competitor and more profitable."

And then also if you could comment on the mix of machines. I know that, originally, it was really focused on the FAST 5000, but you had the 3000 and the cutting tool machines too. What are you seeing in terms of the other types of machines that you've had introduced later?"

We just -- we had seen such rapid acceleration that we didn't want to -- we are hoping it would hold, we thought it would hold, but we didn't want to commit to that. As far as going forward, our goal for the year is 10,000 machines. We're comfortable we're going to exceed that, but we're not going to ratchet up the number externally because it's still a tremendous amount of work, but we're optimistic that we can keep a fast pace. As far as the types of machines, the FAST 5000 is still the workhorse, we're signing more of those than all the other ones combined. The second machine that we're seeing tremendous success with is the lockers. We put out a new locker system that's actually stand-alone, which means it doesn't need to be driven off the brains of a FAST 5000 or the controller on a FAST 5000. And we cannot keep up with that machine. In fact, we would've installed several hundred more machines in the quarter if we would've had the machines to do it. The success is greater than we had estimated but we're getting caught up. We believe we'll be caught up this quarter and moving forward. The cutting tool machines are moving slower than we had hoped. We are signing lots of them, but not the numbers that we had hoped. And the FAST 3000 is moving out, but also slower than I would have estimated. But that really -- whether that's a 3000 or a 5000, it really doesn't matter to us. And part of the reason I think that's moving slower is we're still very focused on the larger customers and it's a machine that's designed for smaller customers, with smaller usage. But as a group, we're not real concerned which machine is signed, we just want to get our footprint out there. We want to turn our flag in that account. And then for the most part, what we're seeing is the customers that have it are where a lot of our growth is coming from that are deploying more equipment in other plants. So that's a very positive result that we're seeing."

In the first quarter we thought we've been a little sloppy and maybe not as focused as we need to be. But you're right, there were some headwinds. But vending, overall, isn't a headwind unless it's being sold to larger customers. We don't see a step down in the margin in vending just because it's vending. We see a step down in margin because it's being vended to large customers that are typically lower-margin customers. We want to make that clear because there seems to be a notion out there that if it goes through a vending machine, it's  a lower gross margin. The same product to the same customer doesn't really matter how we deliver it, it's about the customer. It's about the customer and the product delivered to that customer. And overall, from an operating margin standpoint, as we develop our processes for vending, although the gross margins may be lower to those customers, our operating margin should continue to improve because it's a far more efficient process. So we're looking at this as long term, a big tailwind, not a big headwind."

We do have a lot of good things going on. We've just signed a couple of nice large customers that will be coming on later this quarter, early fourth quarter which will give us a boost. And so we're expecting the growth rates to come back. But it's always going to be more up and down in the rest of our business because it's driven by a handful of large customers where those stores are. As far as new areas, we're just getting going in Brazil. It's taken us longer than we expected, it's a bureaucratic nightmare with the taxes and the things we have to do. But we are very optimistic about that area. And so overall, we still believe international is going to do well for us.

I'm very happy with the quarter that we reported this morning. I'm going to make my comments pretty brief. Dan does a very good job in his press release, and so I'm go through it pretty quickly and basically just give you the color as I see it. 
Manufacturing has slowed, that's clear. But on a very positive note, I've been out talking to lot of our regional people and district people, and we have not seen a lot of abrupt changes. It's more of a step-down, and we haven't seen a lot of panic from our customers, so we think although it's much slower, so much slower than it was, it doesn't appear to be a lot of panic going on, so that gives us some optimism for the next several months. 
Construction has also slowed. But we're actually having a difficult time with the comparisons or understanding the comparisons.  Because of the very warm winter, now the hot summer, it's hard to see where the business would have normalized. But overall, it appears to be somewhat weaker than it was, but there is still a lot of business and a lot of opportunity out there. 
On the margin, my comment there is I think we've made nice progress. I'm happy with what the team has done. We believe there are still several opportunities or many opportunities to show additional improvement in margin. We're going to continue to work very, very hard on the margin as we go forward. 
One of the areas that I guess I'm the happiest with is our expense management. The second quarter, this quarter, was the first time that we've ever reported SG&A below 30%, which we're proud of, and it's really -- I believe, it's really just the result of focus and hard work by the team. A lot of people working on, a lot of people understand the expenses and just really doing a nice job. And I want to give the chief people on our team a kudos for that, because they're working very hard. 
Initiatives, our sales initiatives, we continue to see very nice progress on those. Metalworking continues to show progress. We continue to pace -- run at a nice pace, but we have a long ways to go. We're learning a lot about it. Our learning curve is very steep right now. I've been meeting with several groups of managers and talking about this initiative and finding out what we need to improve upon and areas that we can move faster with. 
Government is also very similar. We're making nice progress with our government initiatives, and there's a tremendous opportunity going forward. Both of those areas were pretty much fully staffed, as we see it today with our sales teams, and those sales teams continue to improve their knowledge level. So we think that we have -- we should continue to see incremental improvement quarter-to-quarter as we go forward, so that's some built-in upside for us. 
Vending, all I can say is I feel we made great progress. Our team, Russ Rubie and his team that runs the vending program, they're working hard and I've had the opportunity to talk to several of our larger customers that have deployed our vending solutions, and the feedback has all been very positive. So the customers are seeing the savings. The customers like the control on their inventory. The software is working well for them to show them what they're using, how they're using these products. So there's a very positive customer feedback. 
In our processes, internal processes, for how we receive the orders from the customers, how we set the machines up, all the different things that we have developed continue to improve. And we still have a lot of opportunities there to improve these processes. And every time we do that, we lower our cost and we improve the customer service at the same time. So we have a tremendous amount of focus on the entire process of the vending business from the start to finish, and think that, that will just continue to get better as we go forward. 
Sitting back or stepping back and thinking of the overview of our business and the puts and the takes, thinking about the economy -- the economy, as we see it, is I guess we'd say it's not great, but it's okay. So we should continue to -- we should be able to perform at a reasonable level in the current economic situation. I think we're doing a nice job, as I mentioned, with expense control, which creates cash flow. So we're in a very positive position there.  I feel good about that. 
Our sales drivers initiatives that we continue to talk about are getting stronger, which is very good. You saw that with the vending numbers that we reported. We're actually accelerating in those areas. Some of the areas that we don't talk as much about are internal things. One that I'm very optimistic about is we've -- our IT group has developed some new software programs to use in our stores. And all of them, there's actually 2 or 3 large ones that we're either rolling out or testing at this time. Our systems that are set up to make store life far easier and automate different processes like receiving product, how we process orders and several other areas. Three weeks ago, I had the opportunity to go out and visit 11 stores in eastern Wisconsin, larger stores, some of our more mature area and talk to managers about how these were working. And in every case, they were talking about this one saves me an hour a day or this one saves me 2 hours a week. And so we only have these initiatives rolled out to a handful of stores or a smaller percentage of our stores. As we do that, it has the tremendous upside to save labor in the store and usually, with the way that works, is that labor will now be used for sales activity. So I'm very optimistic about what this -- the potential of this has for our company over the next 2 to 6, 7 quarters, very optimistic. 
Our warehouse and transportation group continues to work on automating their systems. We're within about 4 weeks of starting up our new automated warehouse here at the Winona facility, and that should not only shorten up our cycle times to produce the orders, but also lower our expense.  And we have several other projects that we're working on for warehouse automation. 
The transportation group, the people that run all our entire fleet or direct our entire fleet, are a ways into a project trying to understand the use of compressed natural gas, CNG, to run our trucks off. And we've actually had some very good feedback, it's a small experiment with our branch vehicles, and now they have some semis coming in, some large vehicles coming in, and it has some real potential if it works out for the future. As an example, the semis that we're working on, we would save, on the average, between $1,500 and $2,000 per month in operating expense on those trucks after paying a higher price for the vehicle and the tanks. So it has some potential going forward to lower our expense. And as you know, transportation has always been a very big part of our business. 
So overall, I'm very positive about the future of things that we have going on, and we'll just have to work through this slower economic time and go from there. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, and I thank you again for joining us today."

I'm going to touch on a handful of things in the press release just to highlight a few things that we believe are noteworthy. 
Let's start with the sequential trends on Page 3. If you look at the 3 years we have displayed there, it really is a story of 3 different years. If I look at 2010, from January to October, we were soundly beating the historical pattern about 60% to 70% of the time. February was what I'd call a setback month. And at June, our cumulative number was in line with history.  We were beating it most of the time, we had a big setback month, but we were trending with history. 
2011 was a little bit different story. From January to October, we actually we're beating, soundly beating the pattern a little bit less, about 50% or 60% of the time, but we didn't have any big setback months. And at the midpoint of the year, we were about 370 basis points ahead of what history says we should be building. And so we come into the year, we'd estimated we'd grow around 19 based on history. We ended up growing closer to 22 based on just having better momentum and better trends throughout the year and no big setback months. 
When I look at 2012, March was -- in the January to June time frame that we have history on, March was a huge beat. And April and June were essentially in line with our historical patterns. February and May were our setback months. And because of those 2 months, we're sitting there about 330 basis points behind our history. Those are just some of the things I guess to note when we look at the sequential patterns of our business. 
When I look at the second half of the year, the -- first some positives, then negatives. Positive, I think we have some nice built-up momentum with our vending machines that have been signed and are going to be installed, the ones that have been installed in the last 6 months, which are significant. And the headwind is the uncertainty about the economy and some of the things going on with our currency rates. 
One of the things we did see a change quite abruptly in the spring, and I mentioned it on Page 4 of the release, is on our production fastener side or on our fasteners in general. In the first quarter, that business was growing about 15.5%. In the second quarter, it dropped to just double-digits in April. It dropped down to about 6% in May and rebounded a bit to about 9% in June. But definitely, it has taken a step back. 
If you look at non-fastener areas, areas where most of our growth drivers are centered on, we're seeing, still, very strong results, still in the close to 20% neighborhood. 
The ISM index, I touched on that in the release as well, dropped just below 50 here in June. I believe that's the first reading below 50 since August of 2009, which was quite a long stretch. Growth drivers, as Will mentioned, continuing to make nice progress on those. One thing that I think is really noteworthy when you look at the vending stats is while we were seeing softening trends as we went through the second quarter, our vending numbers, the growth of our vending customers actually improved from Q1, where we grew at 33.9% with that subset of customers to Q2, where we grew at 34.3%. Which from a directional standpoint, I think that's a huge accomplishment, because these are larger customers where a lot of these vending machines are going and we're really demonstrating our ability to take market share at a faster pace in that subset of customers. 
Profit drivers on Page 8, a few things that I thought were noteworthy, we're often guilty a bit of beating ourselves up internally and externally a bit when some things aren't working as we think they could. A god example of that is our margin in the first quarter. We do this because we believe we fix stuff today, we don't just analyze and talk about it or, said another way, rationalize it. However, if I take a longer-term look at our business and look at first quarter of 2007, so the last quarter before we started the pathway to profit in the second quarter of 2012, our average store has gone from 72,000 a month to 89,000 per month. Our gross margin has increased from 51% to 51.6%, and our operating costs have improved through our pathway to profit and through our initiatives to improve our relative performance in each category or, said a much simpler way, we've increased the size of Fastenal by about 65% and we've doubled our profits. These are great long-term improvements, and we are all about long-term improvements. 
The other thing that I think is worthwhile to note, we probably are a little anal with some of our statistics we put in our press release.  One of them is the table that shows our headcount numbers and our store numbers, et cetera, as we tried to demonstrate and to communicate what we're seeing on the pathway to profit.
If you look at the FTE headcount growth in that table on Page 10, you would notice that since the first quarter of 2007, we've added about 3,700 FTEs to the business or an increase of about 38%. Of this, about 3,200 or about 87% of our increase are individuals that have direct contact with our customers, either in the store or a non-store selling role. We added another 235 people or about 6% into our distribution centers to support that 65% increase in sales. We added another 229 or about another 6% into our manufacturing centers, and about 40% of this came from our Holo-Krome acquisition back in 2009. And because of the efficiencies we've gained in our business in the support areas, we've added 27 FTEs or less than 1% of our headcount growth since the first quarter of 2007, have been in a role that doesn't directly relate to selling, moving product or manufacturing product that we sell. And I think that's a strong tribute to the individuals internally as well as the wisdom and the possibilities of our pathway to profit. 
And speaking of Holo-Krome, I thought I'd mention quickly that I had the opportunity here several months ago to go out, and one of our regional VPs, whose office are at [ph] -- out of Ohio, was having a district managers' meet there to get a view of the facility as well as have their district meeting, and I went out to speak to the group. One comment I'd make is, we've moved into a new manufacturing facility about several years ago. It was my first chance to see it. Very impressive facility, very impressive people I met that work in that facility, and my compliments to Tim and his team out there. 
Also, as noted in the table, we hit 22.2% operating margin. I don't know if that -- I think that's our best quarter we've ever had from an operating margin percent perspective. I'm sure if I'm wrong, somebody will call me later today and inform me, but very impressive. We had about an 80-basis-point improvement from 2011, not the 100 basis points that we strive for, but I think very strong given that we moved our operating expenses below 30%. And that's a first as well, I believe, as Will mentioned earlier in the call. 
The gross margin on Page 10, as I mentioned, we kind of beat ourselves up on that a little bit, and that was our award in the first quarter. We aren't done yet, but I'm pleased with the progress we've seen in the second quarter. I'm also pleased, in general, when I look at the 22% pretax, the improvement in gross margin, the improvement in our business that we have experienced not only in the last year, but in the last 5, to personally be associated with an organization of this caliber. 
As mentioned in prior quarters, our exclusive brands continue to inch upward. Today, they are about 9.5% of our sales. A good piece of that is being driven by our vending solution. Operating and administrative expenses, we talk about the great thing we did with expense control. I think the story is often understated, because under the surface in those expenses, there are some things that are growing quite dramatically, but I see them as high-quality items of growth. 401(k) profit sharing contribution.  We share a piece of our profits with our employees that participate either in our retirement programs throughout the company. Our profit-sharing contribution in the quarter grew 74% from the number a year ago. In fact, if you look at our profit sharing contribution calc for the second quarter, we're about 70% of our annual number of just 2 years ago in 2010. 
Also, in our occupancy, our vending machine cost more than doubled from a year ago because of the success we've seen with vending. Those are 2 items that are outgrowing the company, high-quality items, I might add. 
Finally, on the working capital side, all I can say is we had a nice improvement, and I credit that to our team in the field. They're doing a job of managing their working capital needs, both accounts receivable and inventory, which produced a very strong cash flow again as we go through the first 6 months of the year. Our expectation when we started 'pathway to profit' was operational working capital, excuse me, operational cash flow at 89% of earnings. I believe that range has really moved to 85% to 95%. Year-to-date, we're at about 90%. Net CapEx, we've really set our target number of that, it's about 25% of earnings. Year-to-date, we're at about 23%, which puts our free cash flow at about 66%, 67% of earnings. Not only a strong number given our range of estimating about 60% to 65%, but a very strong number when you consider the first half of the year is where we need the most working capital growth because of the seasonality in our business. I think that bodes well for our cash flow capabilities in the second half of the year. 
With that, I would turn it over to questions. As we have said -- asked in the past, please limit yourself to one question so we can get through the entire group of folks that get queued up. Thank you."

Even in the areas that we're doing so well earlier in the year, the oil patch from Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, their growth stepped down about equal to the rest of the company. The Midwest, where we've been strong, also saw a little bit, so I can't give you much help there. Industry-wise, Dan puts in his number, manufacturing, construction are -- so overall, it just seems like, and I think I've commented on this, the entire thing just stepped down a little bit. A little energy is like we let off the throttle for the economy. Even our international business is much slower than it was a year ago.

So our comps changed dramatically as we step through this year. And all of a sudden, all that headwind from gross margin dissipates as we get into the second half of the year.

The software things that I talked about are branch-based initiatives where it's just -- it's operational efficiencies and how we receive the product, pick the product, ship the product. So on the larger stores with higher volume, we are saving labor. I was in our largest facility on that trip to Wisconsin, and the manager there has had this system for about 3 to 4 months now. He said, ""Well, I could not operate the business today without that."" I suppose he'd figure it out, but that's his feeling, which was very positive. So there are a lot of things we're working on the vending software to streamline that process. It wasn't -- it wouldn't have been a real big deal when we had 500 or 1,000 machines, but now that we have 13,000 machines installed, we're going to -- by the end of the year, we could be close to 20,000 or probably should be close to 20,000. Those types of things really work and give us some efficiencies. We are, as an organization, we are very focused on making a more efficient business, a leaner business. So in the higher economy, we can use that to grow our sales faster and being leaner. In a slow economy, we can use it defensively to lower our costs and be a better competitor and more profitable."

The biggest hurdle that we have to overcome, and we're doing well with it, is finding the right person to sell to. Because in most cases, going to our everyday buyer that we call on isn't the right contact within the facility. And once we get to the right contact, it goes very well. But it's a very broad customer base. A lot of warehousing also.  We've had some great success in big distribution operations, so pick back and ship operations for they're a necessary step."

I was just wondering what had changed there and whether the right pace going forward can now actually be more in this 4,000 to 5,000 range than the 2,500 that you were originally targeting. And then also if you could comment on the mix of machines. I know that, originally, it was really focused on the FAST 5000, but you had the 3000 and the cutting tool machines, too.

Nothing has really changed. We just -- we had seen such rapid acceleration that we didn't want to -- we were hoping it would hold, we thought it would hold, but we didn't want to commit to that. As far as going forward, our goal for the year is 10,000 machines. We're comfortable we're going to exceed that, but we're not going to ratchet up the number externally, because it's still -- it's a tremendous amount of work, but we're optimistic that we can keep a fast pace. As far as the types of machines, the FAST 5000 is still the workhorse.  We're signing more of those than all the other ones combined. The second machine that we're seeing tremendous success with is the lockers. We put out a new locker system that's actually standalone, which means it doesn't need to be driven off the brains of a FAST 5000 or the controller on a FAST 5000. And we cannot keep up with that machine. In fact, we would've installed several hundred more machines in the quarter if we would've had the machines to do it. The success is greater than we had estimated, but we're getting caught up. We believe we'll be caught up this quarter and moving forward. The cutting-tool machines are moving slower than we had hoped. We are signing lots of them, but not the numbers that we had hoped. And the FAST 3000 is moving out but also slower than I would have estimated. But that really -- whether that's a 3000 or a 5000, it really doesn't matter to us. And part of the reason I think that's moving slower is we're still very focused on the larger customers, and it's a machine that's designed for smaller customers with smaller usage. But as a group, we're not real concerned which machine is signed, we just want to get our footprint out there. We want to plant our flag in that account. And then for the most part, what we're seeing is the customers that have it are where a lot of our growth is coming from that are deploying more equipment in other plants. And so that's a very positive result that we're seeing."

In the first quarter we thought we'd been a little sloppy and maybe not as focused as we need to be. But you're right, there were some headwinds. But vending overall isn't a headwind unless it's being sold to larger customers. We don't see a step-down in the margin in vending just because it's vending. We see a step-down in margin because it's being vended to large customers that are typically lower-margin customers. We want to make that clear, because there seems to be a notion out there that if it goes through a vending machine, it's  a lower gross margin. The same product to the same customer, doesn't really matter how we deliver it.  It's about the customer. It's about the customer and the product delivered to that customer. And overall, from an operating margin standpoint, as we develop our processes for vending, although the gross margins may be lower to those customers, our operating margin should continue to improve because it's a far more efficient process. So we're looking at this as, long term, a big tailwind, not a big headwind."

We do have a lot of good things going on. We've just signed a couple of nice large customers that will be coming on later this quarter, early fourth quarter, which will give us a boost. And so we're expecting the growth rates to come back. But it's always going to be more up and down in the rest of our business, because it's driven by a handful of large customers where those stores are. As far as new areas, we're just getting going in Brazil. It's taken us longer than we expected, it's a bureaucratic nightmare with the taxes and the things we have to do. But we are very optimistic about that area. And so overall, we still believe international is going to do well for us.

I'm very happy with the quarter that we reported this morning. I'm going to make my comments pretty brief. Dan does a very good job in his press release, and so I'm go through it pretty quickly and basically just give you the color as I see it. 
Manufacturing has slowed, that's clear. But on a very positive note, I've been out talking to lot of our regional people and district people, and we have not seen a lot of abrupt changes. It's more of a step-down, and we haven't seen a lot of panic from our customers, so we think although it's much slower, so much slower than it was, it doesn't appear to be a lot of panic going on, so that gives us some optimism for the next several months. 
Construction has also slowed. But we're actually having a difficult time with the comparisons or understanding the comparisons.  Because of the very warm winter, now the hot summer, it's hard to see where the business would have normalized. But overall, it appears to be somewhat weaker than it was, but there is still a lot of business and a lot of opportunity out there. 
On the margin, my comment there is I think we've made nice progress. I'm happy with what the team has done. We believe there are still several opportunities or many opportunities to show additional improvement in margin. We're going to continue to work very, very hard on the margin as we go forward. 
One of the areas that I guess I'm the happiest with is our expense management. The second quarter, this quarter, was the first time that we've ever reported SG&A below 30%, which we're proud of, and it's really -- I believe, it's really just the result of focus and hard work by the team. A lot of people working on, a lot of people understand the expenses and just really doing a nice job. And I want to give the chief people on our team a kudos for that, because they're working very hard. 
Initiatives, our sales initiatives, we continue to see very nice progress on those. Metalworking continues to show progress. We continue to pace -- run at a nice pace, but we have a long ways to go. We're learning a lot about it. Our learning curve is very steep right now. I've been meeting with several groups of managers and talking about this initiative and finding out what we need to improve upon and areas that we can move faster with. 
Government is also very similar. We're making nice progress with our government initiatives, and there's a tremendous opportunity going forward. Both of those areas were pretty much fully staffed, as we see it today with our sales teams, and those sales teams continue to improve their knowledge level. So we think that we have -- we should continue to see incremental improvement quarter-to-quarter as we go forward, so that's some built-in upside for us. 
Vending, all I can say is I feel we made great progress. Our team, Russ Rubie and his team that runs the vending program, they're working hard and I've had the opportunity to talk to several of our larger customers that have deployed our vending solutions, and the feedback has all been very positive. So the customers are seeing the savings. The customers like the control on their inventory. The software is working well for them to show them what they're using, how they're using these products. So there's a very positive customer feedback. 
In our processes, internal processes, for how we receive the orders from the customers, how we set the machines up, all the different things that we have developed continue to improve. And we still have a lot of opportunities there to improve these processes. And every time we do that, we lower our cost and we improve the customer service at the same time. So we have a tremendous amount of focus on the entire process of the vending business from the start to finish, and think that, that will just continue to get better as we go forward. 
Sitting back or stepping back and thinking of the overview of our business and the puts and the takes, thinking about the economy -- the economy, as we see it, is I guess we'd say it's not great, but it's okay. So we should continue to -- we should be able to perform at a reasonable level in the current economic situation. I think we're doing a nice job, as I mentioned, with expense control, which creates cash flow. So we're in a very positive position there.  I feel good about that. 
Our sales drivers initiatives that we continue to talk about are getting stronger, which is very good. You saw that with the vending numbers that we reported. We're actually accelerating in those areas. Some of the areas that we don't talk as much about are internal things. One that I'm very optimistic about is we've -- our IT group has developed some new software programs to use in our stores. And all of them, there's actually 2 or 3 large ones that we're either rolling out or testing at this time. Our systems that are set up to make store life far easier and automate different processes like receiving product, how we process orders and several other areas. Three weeks ago, I had the opportunity to go out and visit 11 stores in eastern Wisconsin, larger stores, some of our more mature area and talk to managers about how these were working. And in every case, they were talking about this one saves me an hour a day or this one saves me 2 hours a week. And so we only have these initiatives rolled out to a handful of stores or a smaller percentage of our stores. As we do that, it has the tremendous upside to save labor in the store and usually, with the way that works, is that labor will now be used for sales activity. So I'm very optimistic about what this -- the potential of this has for our company over the next 2 to 6, 7 quarters, very optimistic. 
Our warehouse and transportation group continues to work on automating their systems. We're within about 4 weeks of starting up our new automated warehouse here at the Winona facility, and that should not only shorten up our cycle times to produce the orders, but also lower our expense.  And we have several other projects that we're working on for warehouse automation. 
The transportation group, the people that run all our entire fleet or direct our entire fleet, are a ways into a project trying to understand the use of compressed natural gas, CNG, to run our trucks off. And we've actually had some very good feedback, it's a small experiment with our branch vehicles, and now they have some semis coming in, some large vehicles coming in, and it has some real potential if it works out for the future. As an example, the semis that we're working on, we would save, on the average, between $1,500 and $2,000 per month in operating expense on those trucks after paying a higher price for the vehicle and the tanks. So it has some potential going forward to lower our expense. And as you know, transportation has always been a very big part of our business. 
So overall, I'm very positive about the future of things that we have going on, and we'll just have to work through this slower economic time and go from there. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, and I thank you again for joining us today."

I'm going to touch on a handful of things in the press release just to highlight a few things that we believe are noteworthy. 
Let's start with the sequential trends on Page 3. If you look at the 3 years we have displayed there, it really is a story of 3 different years. If I look at 2010, from January to October, we were soundly beating the historical pattern about 60% to 70% of the time. February was what I'd call a setback month. And at June, our cumulative number was in line with history.  We were beating it most of the time, we had a big setback month, but we were trending with history. 
2011 was a little bit different story. From January to October, we actually we're beating, soundly beating the pattern a little bit less, about 50% or 60% of the time, but we didn't have any big setback months. And at the midpoint of the year, we were about 370 basis points ahead of what history says we should be building. And so we come into the year, we'd estimated we'd grow around 19 based on history. We ended up growing closer to 22 based on just having better momentum and better trends throughout the year and no big setback months. 
When I look at 2012, March was -- in the January to June time frame that we have history on, March was a huge beat. And April and June were essentially in line with our historical patterns. February and May were our setback months. And because of those 2 months, we're sitting there about 330 basis points behind our history. Those are just some of the things I guess to note when we look at the sequential patterns of our business. 
When I look at the second half of the year, the -- first some positives, then negatives. Positive, I think we have some nice built-up momentum with our vending machines that have been signed and are going to be installed, the ones that have been installed in the last 6 months, which are significant. And the headwind is the uncertainty about the economy and some of the things going on with our currency rates. 
One of the things we did see a change quite abruptly in the spring, and I mentioned it on Page 4 of the release, is on our production fastener side or on our fasteners in general. In the first quarter, that business was growing about 15.5%. In the second quarter, it dropped to just double-digits in April. It dropped down to about 6% in May and rebounded a bit to about 9% in June. But definitely, it has taken a step back. 
If you look at non-fastener areas, areas where most of our growth drivers are centered on, we're seeing, still, very strong results, still in the close to 20% neighborhood. 
The ISM index, I touched on that in the release as well, dropped just below 50 here in June. I believe that's the first reading below 50 since August of 2009, which was quite a long stretch. Growth drivers, as Will mentioned, continuing to make nice progress on those. One thing that I think is really noteworthy when you look at the vending stats is while we were seeing softening trends as we went through the second quarter, our vending numbers, the growth of our vending customers actually improved from Q1, where we grew at 33.9% with that subset of customers to Q2, where we grew at 34.3%. Which from a directional standpoint, I think that's a huge accomplishment, because these are larger customers where a lot of these vending machines are going and we're really demonstrating our ability to take market share at a faster pace in that subset of customers. 
Profit drivers on Page 8, a few things that I thought were noteworthy, we're often guilty a bit of beating ourselves up internally and externally a bit when some things aren't working as we think they could. A god example of that is our margin in the first quarter. We do this because we believe we fix stuff today, we don't just analyze and talk about it or, said another way, rationalize it. However, if I take a longer-term look at our business and look at first quarter of 2007, so the last quarter before we started the pathway to profit in the second quarter of 2012, our average store has gone from 72,000 a month to 89,000 per month. Our gross margin has increased from 51% to 51.6%, and our operating costs have improved through our pathway to profit and through our initiatives to improve our relative performance in each category or, said a much simpler way, we've increased the size of Fastenal by about 65% and we've doubled our profits. These are great long-term improvements, and we are all about long-term improvements. 
The other thing that I think is worthwhile to note, we probably are a little anal with some of our statistics we put in our press release.  One of them is the table that shows our headcount numbers and our store numbers, et cetera, as we tried to demonstrate and to communicate what we're seeing on the pathway to profit.
If you look at the FTE headcount growth in that table on Page 10, you would notice that since the first quarter of 2007, we've added about 3,700 FTEs to the business or an increase of about 38%. Of this, about 3,200 or about 87% of our increase are individuals that have direct contact with our customers, either in the store or a non-store selling role. We added another 235 people or about 6% into our distribution centers to support that 65% increase in sales. We added another 229 or about another 6% into our manufacturing centers, and about 40% of this came from our Holo-Krome acquisition back in 2009. And because of the efficiencies we've gained in our business in the support areas, we've added 27 FTEs or less than 1% of our headcount growth since the first quarter of 2007, have been in a role that doesn't directly relate to selling, moving product or manufacturing product that we sell. And I think that's a strong tribute to the individuals internally as well as the wisdom and the possibilities of our pathway to profit. 
And speaking of Holo-Krome, I thought I'd mention quickly that I had the opportunity here several months ago to go out, and one of our regional VPs, whose office are at [ph] -- out of Ohio, was having a district managers' meet there to get a view of the facility as well as have their district meeting, and I went out to speak to the group. One comment I'd make is, we've moved into a new manufacturing facility about several years ago. It was my first chance to see it. Very impressive facility, very impressive people I met that work in that facility, and my compliments to Tim and his team out there. 
Also, as noted in the table, we hit 22.2% operating margin. I don't know if that -- I think that's our best quarter we've ever had from an operating margin percent perspective. I'm sure if I'm wrong, somebody will call me later today and inform me, but very impressive. We had about an 80 basis point improvement from 2011, not the 100 basis points that we strive for, but I think very strong given that we moved our operating expenses below 30%. And that's a first as well, I believe, as Will mentioned earlier in the call. 
The gross margin on Page 10, as I mentioned, we kind of beat ourselves up on that a little bit, and that was our award in the first quarter. We aren't done yet, but I'm pleased with the progress we've seen in the second quarter. I'm also pleased, in general, when I look at the 22% pretax, the improvement in gross margin, the improvement in our business that we have experienced not only in the last year, but in the last 5, to personally be associated with an organization of this caliber. 
As mentioned in prior quarters, our exclusive brands continue to inch upward. Today, they are about 9.5% of our sales. A good piece of that is being driven by our vending solution. Operating and administrative expenses, we talk about the great thing we did with expense control. I think the story is often understated, because under the surface in those expenses, there are some things that are growing quite dramatically, but I see them as high-quality items of growth. 401(k) profit sharing contribution.  We share a piece of our profits with our employees that participate either in our retirement programs throughout the company. Our profit-sharing contribution in the quarter grew 74% from the number a year ago. In fact, if you look at our profit sharing contribution calc for the second quarter, we're about 70% of our annual number of just 2 years ago in 2010. 
Also, in our occupancy, our vending machine cost more than doubled from a year ago because of the success we've seen with vending. Those are 2 items that are outgrowing the company, high-quality items, I might add. 
Finally, on the working capital side, all I can say is we had a nice improvement, and I credit that to our team in the field. They're doing a job of managing their working capital needs, both accounts receivable and inventory, which produced a very strong cash flow again as we go through the first 6 months of the year. Our expectation when we started pathway to profit was operational working capital -- excuse me, operational cash flow at 89% of earnings. I believe that range has really moved to 85% to 95%. Year-to-date, we're at about 90%. Net CapEx, we've really set our target number of that, it's about 25% of earnings. Year-to-date, we're at about 23%, which puts our free cash flow at about 66%, 67% of earnings. Not only a strong number given our range of estimating about 60% to 65%, but a very strong number when you consider the first half of the year is where we need the most working capital growth because of the seasonality in our business. I think that bodes well for our cash flow capabilities in the second half of the year. 
With that, I would turn it over to questions. As we have said -- asked in the past, please limit yourself to one question so we can get through the entire group of folks that get queued up. Thank you."

But overall, it was a very predictable month, off from May and kind of an average growth as you saw in the sequential number. As far as the geography, there wasn't a lot of change. In May, we had more slowing, and up the Eastern Seaboard, most of those areas came back in June. It seems like it's just a step-down across the country. Even in the areas that we're doing so well earlier in the year, the oil patch from Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, their growth stepped down about equal to the rest of the company. The Midwest, where we've been strong, also saw a little bit, so I can't give you much help there. Industry-wise, Dan puts in his number, manufacturing, construction are -- so overall, it just seems like, and I think I've commented on this, the entire thing just stepped down a little bit. A little energy is like we let off the throttle for the economy. Even our international business is much slower than it was a year ago. Mexico, that has remained very strong for us, their growth was slightly lower than it had been in previous months, still well above the company, more than double the company. So it's hard to really pinpoint any one area that's slowed more than another. Dan?"

On the first quarter, one of the questions I had going into the second quarter was, first quarter was helped in a meaningful fashion from the standpoint we had no winter, and natural gas prices had dropped. So we had some things in there that weren't necessarily sustainable on a sequential basis. When I look at our operating expenses in general today, there is nothing in there that is unusual in nature. So I think our ability to continue managing that at an extremely low level, like we did in this quarter, is fairly sustainable."

So our comps changed dramatically as we step through this year. And all of a sudden, all that headwind from gross margin dissipates as we get into the second half of the year. So that puts us in a position, if we're doing good job with operating expenses, to do a great job on raising operating margin. But Will, maybe you want to touch on a few of the initiatives."

The software things that I talked about are branch-based initiatives where it's just -- it's operational efficiencies and how we receive the product, pick the product, ship the product. So on the larger stores with higher volume, we are saving labor. I was in our largest facility on that trip to Wisconsin, and the manager there has had this system for about 3 to 4 months now. He said, ""Well, I could not operate the business today without that."" I suppose he'd figure it out, but that's his feeling, which was very positive. So there are a lot of things we're working on the vending software to streamline that process. It wasn't -- it wouldn't have been a real big deal when we had 500 or 1,000 machines, but now that we have 13,000 machines installed, we're going to -- by the end of the year, we could be close to 20,000 or probably should be close to 20,000. Those types of things really work and give us some efficiencies. We are, as an organization, we are very focused on making a more efficient business, a leaner business. So in the higher economy, we can use that to grow our sales faster and being leaner. In a slow economy, we can use it defensively to lower our costs and be a better competitor and more profitable."

If you look at the backlogs, the backlogs flattened out, a lot of them in April, March to May time frame.

And it really is centered around that FAST production fastener business. I think it's slower than others maybe are seeing because we're more involved in that production."

It is so broad-based, we just haven't seen an area that isn't working well when we present it right. The biggest hurdle that we have to overcome, and we're doing well with it, is finding the right person to sell to. Because in most cases, going to our everyday buyer that we call on isn't the right contact within the facility. And once we get to the right contact, it goes very well. But it's a very broad customer base. A lot of warehousing also.  We've had some great success in big distribution operations, so pick back and ship operations for they're a necessary step."

Nothing has really changed. We just -- we had seen such rapid acceleration that we didn't want to -- we were hoping it would hold, we thought it would hold, but we didn't want to commit to that. As far as going forward, our goal for the year is 10,000 machines. We're comfortable we're going to exceed that, but we're not going to ratchet up the number externally, because it's still -- it's a tremendous amount of work, but we're optimistic that we can keep a fast pace. As far as the types of machines, the FAST 5000 is still the workhorse.  We're signing more of those than all the other ones combined. The second machine that we're seeing tremendous success with is the lockers. We put out a new locker system that's actually standalone, which means it doesn't need to be driven off the brains of a FAST 5000 or the controller on a FAST 5000. And we cannot keep up with that machine. In fact, we would've installed several hundred more machines in the quarter if we would've had the machines to do it. The success is greater than we had estimated, but we're getting caught up. We believe we'll be caught up this quarter and moving forward. The cutting-tool machines are moving slower than we had hoped. We are signing lots of them, but not the numbers that we had hoped. And the FAST 3000 is moving out but also slower than I would have estimated. But that really -- whether that's a 3000 or a 5000, it really doesn't matter to us. And part of the reason I think that's moving slower is we're still very focused on the larger customers, and it's a machine that's designed for smaller customers with smaller usage. But as a group, we're not real concerned which machine is signed, we just want to get our footprint out there. We want to plant our flag in that account. And then for the most part, what we're seeing is the customers that have it are where a lot of our growth is coming from that are deploying more equipment in other plants. And so that's a very positive result that we're seeing."

But vending, overall, isn't a headwind unless it's being sold to larger customers. We don't see a step-down in the margin in vending just because it's vending. We see a step-down in margin because it's being vended to large customers that are typically lower-margin customers. We want to make that clear, because there seems to be a notion out there that if it goes through a vending machine, it's  a lower gross margin. The same product to the same customer, doesn't really matter how we deliver it.  It's about the customer. It's about the customer and the product delivered to that customer. And overall, from an operating margin standpoint, as we develop our processes for vending, although the gross margins may be lower to those customers, our operating margin should continue to improve because it's a far more efficient process. So we're looking at this as, long term, a big tailwind, not a big headwind."

We do have a lot of good things going on. We've just signed a couple of nice large customers that will be coming on later this quarter, early fourth quarter, which will give us a boost. And so we're expecting the growth rates to come back. But it's always going to be more up and down in the rest of our business, because it's driven by a handful of large customers where those stores are. As far as new areas, we're just getting going in Brazil. It's taken us longer than we expected, it's a bureaucratic nightmare with the taxes and the things we have to do. But we are very optimistic about that area. And so overall, we still believe international is going to do well for us.

I'm going to spend a few minutes of brief comments in my view of the quarter and then I'm going to turn it over to Dan. 
Overall, I felt that we did a very good job in the quarter considering a little bit of economic headwind. Sales were slow, but we did see an uptick in September, so we're very optimistic about that. Another thing on a positive note is on a sequential basis, from June to September, we're really on track with what our historical numbers are, so we also see that as a positive. We had a very weak April, May time frame although we lost a lot of ground for the year, but since then, we've really been tracking very consistent. So there is a little life underneath all of this. 
We've seen very slow growth in both Asia and Europe. That's also been holding us back. If you compare it to last year, in 2011, we actually were getting about a 200 basis point bump in our sales because of our foreign activity, and this year, it's about equal to the U.S. business, so just not getting any tailwind from our Asia and European businesses. 
Mexico remains very strong, which is very positive. They did great over the last 4 years and we continued to invest, we've opened 7 stores in the last year in Mexico and continue to perform at a very high level. 
A little bit on some of the vertical markets. Construction actually bounced back a little bit in September, but if you look at the number, August was like a low point. And so September is more on a normal number or more a traditional number, almost 10% growth in the construction. In manufacturing, we just haven't seen much change. I think it went -- moved about 10 basis points over the 3-month period, up 10, down 10 so manufacturing has been very consistent, which we actually look as a positive because it has been moving down prior to that, so we're holding our own in manufacturing, and hopefully, things will pick up as time goes on here. 
On the margin -- I'm a little disappointed in the margin. We've been working very hard on improving our margin. We didn't lose any ground. We also didn't make up much ground in the quarter. One thing to note on that, though, is steel remains soft. If you follow the steel markets at all, steel continues to decline a little bit. If you look at -- we look at the Asian steel markets because a lot of our fasteners come out of Asia and a lot of their prices are down, 10% to 20% from a year ago. And so that continues to put pressure on our margins. I think the team is doing a good job of holding the price lift best as they can, but it's more difficult to make gains in a deflationary market. And as fasteners making close to 50% of our business, that makes a big difference in our margin opportunities. But we'll continue to work on that and believe we will show some improvement as we go forward. 
Some of the other projects or initiatives that we're working on, we continue to work hard in metal working. Our goal during the end of the year was to grow that business. The product line, metalworking product line had at least 10 points faster than the overall Fastenal growth. We've been able to maintain that, actually exceed that goal. We continue to make nice wins, still not a huge business for us, but it's a nice sized business and it's growing, meaningfully faster than the overall business, so we're optimistic and our margins have maintained at a nice level. We're not giving up a lot of price to get that sales and we're not getting the sales on price, so that's very positive for us and we'll continue to invest heavily on the metalworking business. 
On the government side, another one of our new initiatives, our goal is the same in government, grow the business at least 10% faster than Fastenal. We're also exceeding those goals, that business, tremendous upside and we'll continue to invest. We continue to make nice wins there. That's going to be -- it's almost regard, it's like streetfighting, it's a door-to-door business, you have to go to a lot of small entities, county shops and small hospitals and city shops, very good, dependable business but it's hard to get, so it's not one big swing gets it all, so we're working very hard in the government business and continue to develop our people in train them and how to go after that business because it is a little different than our traditional industrial and construction business. 
Vending had a very strong quarter. We have very strong quarter in vending. We signed over 5,300 machines. We installed just under 4,000 machines so we've made nice progress in both areas. Some of the positives -- things that I see as positives are we've had broader participation at the store level. We're getting more stores to buy the end of the program. We still have ways to go there, the stores that have bought in earlier, the early adopters are signing far more machines than the rest. It is broadening out and we've also made some very nice customer wins that we've picked up over the last 3  to 4 months, so we're optimistic about what's going on there. We believe it will continue to grow in the future, and as a company, we will continue to invest in the vending program as we will in the metalworking and government programs. 
On the 'pathway to profit', again, a little disappointed there. We only picked up 50 basis points year-over-year. Our goal was 100 basis points, but we really didn't have the sales growth to make it happen. We need probably north of 16%, 15% to 16% sales growth to pick up 100 basis points without squeezing the business too hard and other things. On a positive note, if you look at a 2-year run, we're up 190 basis points. We're still staying pretty close to the goal over a longer period and that's really what we wanted to do. We know we're going to have some strong years and some weaker years. So as a project, we're doing nice, the team is doing a great job, I believe, and we believe we can stay on that track going forward. 
Expense control, done a nice job considering we didn't have the great sales growth that -- as good a sales growth as we're expecting. But I think the team tested a nice job looking at stuff and that's how we've been able to maintain the earnings growth that we have. 
Strong cash flow, Dan and his team did a great job with that, controlling the inventory growth and creating very positive cash flow for the company. So overall, I believe we had a good quarter. I think there's a lot of work to do, a lot of things we can do better. We're very focused on improving our business and growing into the future. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan because Dan will provide more color on the quarter."

A couple of things to make note as we flip through the various pages of the press release. On Page 1, inserted a paragraph in this quarter, atypical for us, but the calendar had some impact on the quarter, so I wanted to share a few thoughts on that. 
In the third quarter, we actually had 63 days versus 64 days a year ago. And in some businesses, that might not make much of a difference, but for us, when you're selling a very tangible product, the number of business days really does matter. Our headline number is we grew our sales at 10.5%, but if you really peer under the hood a little bit, look at our daily growth, that's over 12%. I think that's a number that's relevant because that's the number that carries the trend into the future. And so I added a little comment blurb on that. 
Looking at that 10%, very pleased, and Will mentioned very pleased the fact that we were able to obtain leverage in an environment where we could grew top line dollars growing at 10% and had a little bit of a headwind from the gross profit side as well. 
One item just to make notable, when I look into Q4, we will have, it's a 63 to 63-day quarter so nothing going on from that standpoint. There is a bit of movement among months of the quarter. October will have 23 days this year versus 21 a year ago, so a nice headline number. Daily will probably suffer a little bit because of that just because there's a certain piece of our business that's more centered on the month and there's piece to our business that's more centered on the day. So just to make everybody aware that there is 2 additional days. Those 2 days we give back in December. So if I look at trade-offs in life, October is a big month for us, and if I can get 2 extra days in October and get them back in December, I'll take that deal anytime. 
Will touched on the sequential patterns love that we looked at on Page 3 in the release. If you look at the last couple of years, 2010 and 2011, we were beating the benchmark pattern that we laid out, 50%, 60%, 70% of the time, and we go out to September, we were 490 basis points ahead of the trend line, so 5 points ahead of the trendline, year-to-date, looking at January to September. This year, we have a setback in February, some weather issues going on. We quickly got it back in March, but then May came along and May really changed the year for us and created more conservative tones within the organization for the balance of the year. And at the end of June, we were about 330 basis points behind year-to-date history, and we're basically at that same point we've got 330 basis points behind, now it's September. So since June, the business has been kind of treading water as far as compared to history, but nice momentum nice pickup, as Will mentioned, as we signed September. And that bodes well as we go into October and into 2013, the more important way of looking at it. 
In that context of the April, May, June timeframe when we did see the slowdown, it was really in the faster area. The non-fastener area held up much better, but that's also the area that's helped by all the growth drivers, the vending, the government business, the metalworking, all those things we're doing really demonstrated that we can work through a period of declining economy and maintain very attractive top line growth rates. 
One thing, in September here, ISM did pop up. Historically, when we look at ISM, and we've always felt ISM led us by about 3 months, so if ISM drops in June, we expect to see a drop in September. What we've been seeing in really the last year, year and a half is, that we kind of coincide with ISM. I'm not quite sure what caused the change, but when we dropped off in May, the ISM dropped off in June. I'm going to see if the ISM was over 51 in September is a blip about some legs. I think essentially the jury's still out for us. We're still maintaining a conservative tone as we go into the tailwind of the year and into the first part of 2013. 
As Will mentioned, on the growth drivers, on Page 6, all I can say in the FAST Solutions is, really nice quarter, great signings. I attribute that to great focus on it at the field level. Our stores, our districts, our regionals are really running with this. Russ Rubie and his team does a great job. We're very pleased with that. To me, that gives the piece that jumps out the most, is the fact that obviously, this is wrapping up quickly, but we have a fair number of machines that have been out there for 12, 18, 24 months. That's not an inconsequential number, and the fact that, that entire group of customers that have vending overlapping numbers come is still growing faster than 30%, I think is a staggering figure and demonstrates the power of what vending can mean for our business. It's really about customer engagement. Vending is just the way we measure it. It's about we are engaged with that group of customers and we're growing because we're providing great service and great value for them. 
In that same section of growth drivers, Will touched on a bit of 2013, we set out some expectations for store openings for next year, indicated a range of 50 to 100, which is about 2% to 4%. And I think our focus, really, is continuing the growth drivers we have in 2011 and 2012. They're demonstrating great results. We integrate fasteners. We have some things that we're working on to really drive our OEM fastener growth. And in July, we mentioned the elevation of Lee to President and I think we announced that after the call last quarter, so I'm going to congratulate Lee on his promotion. But I think the final thing we've touched on that paragraph was talking about fixing our underperforming stores. And when I think of people and their strengths that they bring to the table, one of the things that I think when I think of Lee, he's great at assessing people and talent and he's great at raising the bar. And if you're driving down the road and with your car and your brake is stuck on one of your tires, it's going to slow you down. And we have a subset of stores that are growing in aren't performing and we need to raise the bar and get that brake off because it damages the rest of the engine, and I'm pretty excited about that looking to 2013. 
Profit drivers of the business on Page 7, continue to be pleased with the progress of 'pathway to profit'. We took a step back a little bit in some of the smaller groups. I think there's really 2 things that are driving that, one working on and another one is probably a good problem, one is the gross margin that Will touched on. We're down in gross margin as a percent year-over-year. That creates a drag in all those groups of stores. The other thing is, we're preventing a rolling out in the smaller stores, the expense that vending does put a little drag on their pretax, but I think that's a good problem from the standpoint that really is driving our growth. But if you look at the stores that do more than 150,000 a month, where there is no vending impact, I mean, negative vending impact because the dollars is expensed not big enough, well, that group is impressive and we saw nice profit growth on a year-over-year basis. 
The other thing I think to think about, and I touched on it in last quarter call as well, if you look at since we started the 'pathway to profit' back in 2007, we have increased the size of Fastenal by about 65%. We improved our gross margin from 51% to 51.6% and our profits have doubled not just talking about the power of growth, leverage it with improving gross profit and managing your fixed operating expenses and leveraging quite effectively. 
If you look -- looking at our expenses in the organization, we guys talked about our biggest operating expenses is the people side of the equation. And if I look at what we've done since 2007, we've added around 3,800 people to our organization since the first quarter of 2007. 87% of those adds are in roles that directly contact, that interact with customers every day. 6% are involved in our distribution centers, 6% are involved in our manufacturing. So if I add those 3 up, 99% of our headcount growth since 2007 is in those 3 areas, and that's how you leverage overhead in an organization. 
I'm very pleased with the fact that we hit 21.9, I'm just going to round up and say 22, it just feels better, but again, those are 2 highly profitable quarters for us despite the fact that we didn't have great sales growth in the quarter. We continue to make progress on our exclusive brands. We're essentially at 10% of sales to date. Vending really is nothing move that number. 
And then finally, I'll touch on some working capital. Will mentioned continued improvement on working capital. Now I do want to mention that Scott and his team really did a nice job, I think, year-to-date on managing the distribution side of the inventory. We lost a little traction on the accounts receivable side. Part of that was a short September, takes x number of days to cross paths and there's enough of August business that's coming in the first week of October. That's more a calendar issue. But when I look at cash flow, year-to-date, we've taken 90% of our earnings and turned it into operating cash. We've spent about 27% of earnings on CapEx. A big piece of that relates to the success we're seeing in vending and we've thrown off 63% of our earnings in free cash flow year-to-date. Great number, and because of that, we did announce last night an increased store dividend and are paying out a $0.21 dividend fourth quarter. 
With that, I'll turn it over to quick questions might come up."

We still don't know yet from our non-North American business what that means for store openings into the future. We just don't know. If I center the answer on North America, what we know about the market is it's big, $140 billion, it's $150 billion, it's $160 billion year, depending on whose math you're looking at and we have somewhere between 2% and 3% market share. And historically, a lot of our eggs are in the store opening basket. And with the 'pathway to profit', we really took a step away from that and said, there's a whole bunch of ways for us to go out and go after this market share and we have this network that's out there that is -- that has unbelievable capabilities and that's balanced our total growth drivers across more channels, so we put tools in the hand, not just of an area where we're more sparse but an area where we're more dense. I mean, with a look at the growth, we continue to see in the upper Midwest in a business that we've been in for 40-plus years. And we're dealing with a combination of store openings, vending, government, the whole gamut as far as growth drivers. We think 2% to 4% is a good number for 2013. 2014 and 2015, we'll see when we get there. Long way over not really answer your question, but seeing the opportunity is so big that we don't want to paint ourselves into the corner and say it has to go from this one thing. It comes from a variety. But when I think of, for example, the government business, and I don't know in our products how big the government is, but if you read the headline, the government is 20% of our economy. So if we have 2,500 locations, I'm figuring out the math in my head, and we had a 20% potential to that, that's like opening 500 stores. So is that a better route to go down in the short term or is it a goal of store openings? I think it's a combination of the 2, but I'll take that government business."

Some of the other companies offer a machine that has a PC built into it. It seems less than what we used to offer for 5 years ago and we find out these are far more dependable. Because it's up PC-based appliance come it's also lower cost system and so we're able to provide them at somewhat lower cost. The inventory in some customers is consigned inventory and other customers choose to own but a majority is consigned. Some of our competition does consigned inventory and some of them have the customers own it. I think one of our biggest advantages compared to the big public companies that we all know of is our local branch network because this a physical business. If you think about the person who's supplying your soda machines or slot machines in the office, those people are driving from 3 or 4 hours in many cases. Our local branch have the service element. It's going to be very hard to duplicate for some of our competitors. I know some of our competitors, their strategy is to shift at the end of the factory and that the factory workers put the product away. But I guess if you're the person regretting the vending machines in your office, you ship the product in the dock and you guys can put it away in the morning, probably you will find a new supplier. So we have that local advantage that really gives us some leverage and we have this distribution network to move the product more efficiently. But machine to machine, product to product, it's not that dissimilar."

Are you happy with where the set point is right now that you'll maintain that unless things change one way or the other in 2013? That's the first question. And then just take the second one in here, too. In terms of vending placements, the number of vending machines, by my math, is up over 300% in the past year and revenues to customers with vending machines looks like it's up a little bit less than 100% and I'm trying to understand that dynamic. Does that mean you're now getting to smaller customers? Are you placing more of the fast, FAST 3000 machines with less yield per customer? What is the implication from that math?"

First, on the breakpoint, my comment a year ago, '12 and '13, I'm glad to say I was wrong. I think part of it is I'm Midwestern and I'm an accountant so it probably makes me too conservative and not willing to put my neck out and we can get to 10% because I don't think we could. So I think that's good execution especially on the face of the gross profit dynamic going on which made it more challenging. On the vending machine, I'm not sure if I'm following your math on the 100% pieces. And in fact, I'll kind of restate it back the way we have it and I think I'll allow that and I'll give you a third question to follow up on my answer. But when you think about it is, the customers that are coming into that group when we introduced vending, our -- that overall business is growing up 30% and that includes the weight, if you will, of the customers that have anniversaried, the customers that have been there a year ago or 2 years ago because we're looking at that combine group. I think if you're talking about vending being up over 100 because you're looking at the new machines and the dollars going through it, you're just taking the math saying, okay, 24% of your sales of the customers are vending and that number is x percent bigger than it was a year ago, you're comparing apples and oranges because we have customers that we had a year ago that didn't have vending that have vending today. And so when we talk about a percentage of our sales that is vending, that includes customers that have been buying for us for years. We're just now looking at it and saying how big is that pool growing and how big was that customer base a year ago, and which I think the best way to look at it, because it's really how much is it impacting your business, not what is the dollar growth on a machine because that's really not a meaningful number. I'm not sure if I answered your question, but again, the other thing I get a look at it and say if I look at our dollars per machine and I try to understand that dynamic, is it improving or getting worse, it's at or better than it was a year ago. And so from that standpoint, I don't think there's any dilution going on because of the different models of machines, but there is some impact. When we report our machine count, we're reporting just our absolute count, any machines we have out there. And in that mix, there's the traditional FAST 5000, there's the locker systems, there's the hydration machines, I think that's what we call it, and there are some cutting tool machines, so there's a variety of machines and they have different potentials as far as throughput. And the way we measure it is we look at lockers and we say, we think they have about a 1/2 of a potential. So when we're looking at $1 for machine we look at that as a  1/2. But I don't know if I just thought out loud did it bring -- did it answer your question maybe Will has a better answer."

We're bringing this machine that we believe will help your business and what we need is a couple of thousand dollars for incremental business with you. And that's usually the worst case scenario, but let's use that scenario where the customer is spending $3,000 a month of business that now is going to 100% will go to the vending machine. And I know based on the value that vending machine brings, that $3,000 spend that we've had with that customer had with us is probably going down to $1,800 or $2,000 because it goes the vending machine there's more accountability to the product. And so our discussion with that customer is, we need, in total, to take your business from $10,000 to $12,000."

And we think about 10% of that number, 25,000 to 30,000, based on our initial definition of the vending, the FAST 5000, could have a vending machine. And we looked at it and said, if we could have 2 machines per customer in that environment, there's opportunity here for us to have 50,000 machines. That was what we thought about it 3 years ago. And so if I think of the -- I don't have exact number in front of me, but we have, what, 17,000 machines out there right now, and the last I think the relationship is about 2 or 2.2 machines per customer, so there's 8,000 customers right now that have vending, rough numbers and we have might have a better number. And so there's a big universe of customers out there that we have today that we put vending into, even based on our definition of 3 years ago if I look at where FAST 5000 is, we've added a whole fleet of machines now and we've brought in the audience of customers that could have vending. We've decreased the size that we need to run through the machine and decrease the size of customer. So I don't think there's a market limitation for us unless you want to start talking out to 2020."

Part of that was driven by currency, but overall, even that was up internationally. So it was consistent. It was, for the most part, consistent through the month. We had a little bit of a stronger finish, but we do our daily analysis and we bring the sales in and we ended up about 200 basis points ahead of where we had estimated even before halfway through the month. Some of the days into the month we were estimating in that high 12s and that's where we ended up a little bit about 12.9. So very consistent pattern, consistent across the United States and steady is the month went, so that was all positive."

So the reality is, if I design a machine today, it's probably March before I see much again. So we have a lot of energy and selling that has a delayed, positive effect because that's actually a great thing because it will come through.

Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our call. I'm going to spend a few minutes with some brief comments on my view of the quarter, then I'm going to turn it over to Dan. 
Overall, I felt that we did a very good job in the quarter considering a little bit of economic headwind. Sales were slow, but we did see an uptick in September. So we're very optimistic about that. Another thing on a positive note is on a sequential basis, from June to September, we're really on track with what our historical numbers are. So we also see that as a positive. We had a very weak April-May time frame although we lost a lot of ground for the year. But since then, we've really been tracking very consistent. So there is a little life underneath all of this.
We've seen very slow growth in both Asia and Europe. That's also been holding us back. If you compare it to last year, in 2011, we actually were getting about a 200 basis point bump on our sales because of our foreign activity. And this year, it's about equal to the U.S. business. So we're just not getting any tailwind from our Asia and European businesses.
Mexico remains very strong, which is very positive. They've just done great over the last 3 or 4 years, and we continue to invest. We opened 7 stores in the last year in Mexico, and they continue to perform at a very high level. 
A little bit on some of the vertical markets. Construction actually bounced back a little bit in September, but if you look at the number, August was a -- was like the low point. And so September is more on a normal number or more a traditional number, almost 10% growth on the construction. In manufacturing, we just haven't seen much change. I think it went -- moved about 10 basis points over the 3-month period, up 10, down 10. So manufacturing has been very consistent, which we actually look as a positive because it had been moving down prior to that. So we're holding our own in manufacturing. And hopefully, things will pick up as time goes on here. 
On the margin -- I'm a little disappointed in the margin. We've been working very hard on improving our margin. We didn't lose any ground. We also didn't make up much ground in the quarter. One thing to note on that though is that steel remains soft. If you follow the steel markets at all, steel continues to decline a little bit. If you look at -- we look at the Asian steel markets because a lot of our fasteners come out of Asia. A lot of their prices are down, 10% to 20% from a year ago. And so that continues to put pressure on our margin. But I think the team is doing a good job of holding the prices up as they can, but it's more difficult to make gains in a deflationary market. And with fasteners making up close to 50% of our business, that makes a big difference in our margin opportunities. We will continue to work on it and believe we can -- we will show some improvement as we go forward. 
Some of the other projects or initiatives that we're working on. We continue to work hard on metalworking. Our goal going end of the year was to grow that business, the product line, metalworking product line, at least 10 points faster than the overall Fastenal growth. We've been able to maintain that -- actually exceeded that goal. We continue to make nice wins, still not a huge business for us, but it's a nice-sized business and it's growing meaningfully faster than the overall business. So we're optimistic, and our margins have maintained at a nice level. We're not giving up a lot of price to get that sales. We're not getting the sales on price. So that's very positive for us, and we'll continue to invest heavily on the metalworking business.
On the Government side, another one of our new initiatives, our goal is the same in Government: grow the business at least 10% faster than Fastenal. We're also exceeding those goals on that business, tremendous upside, and we'll continue to invest. We will continue to make nice wins there. That's going to be a -- it's almost door -- it's like street fighting. It's door-to-door business. You have to go to a lot of small entities, county shops and small hospitals and city shops, very good, dependable business, but it's hard to get. So it's not ""one big swing gets it all."" So we're working very hard in the Government business and continue to develop our people and train them on how to go after that business because it is a little different than our traditional industrial and construction business. 
Vending had a very strong quarter. We have a very strong quarter in vending. We signed over 5,300 machines. We installed just under 4,000 machines. So we've made nice progress in both areas. Some of the positives that I've -- things that I see as positives in that is we've had broader participation at the store level. We're getting more stores to buy into the program. We still have a ways to go there, the stores that have bought in early. The early adopters are signing far more machines than the rest. It is broadening out. And we've also made some very nice customer wins that we picked up over the last 3 to 4 months. So we're optimistic about what's going on there. We believe it will continue to grow in the future. And as a company, we will continue to invest in the vending program as we will in the metalworking and government programs.
On the 'pathway to profit', I'm again a little disappointed there. We only picked up 50 basis points year-over-year. Our goal was 100 basis points, but we really didn't have the sales growth to make it happen. We need probably north of 16% -- 15% to 16% sales growth to pick up 100 basis points without squeezing the business too hard on other things. On a positive note though, if you look at the 2-year run, we're up 190 basis points. We're still staying pretty close to the goal over a longer period, and that's really what we want to do. We know we're going to have some stronger years and some weaker years. So as a project, we're doing nice. The team is doing a great job, I believe, and we believe we can stay on that track going forward. 
Expense control done a nice job considering we didn't have the great sales growth that we were -- as good a sales growth as we're expecting. But I think the teams did a nice job looking at the little stuff, and that's how we've been able to maintain the earnings growth that we have. 
Strong cash flow. Dan and his team did a great job with that, controlling the inventory growth and creating a very positive cash flow for the company.
So overall, I believe we had a good quarter. I think there is a lot of work to do, a lot of things we can do better. We're very focused on improving our business and growing into the future. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan because Dan will provide more color on the quarter."

A couple of things to make note as we flip through the various pages of the press release. On Page 1 and sort of the paragraph into this quarter, atypical for us, but the calendar had some impacts on the quarter. So I wanted to share a few thoughts on that. In the third quarter, we actually had 63 days versus 64 days a year ago. In some businesses, that might not make much of a difference, but for us, when you're selling a very tangible product, the number of business days really does matter. Our headline number is we grew our earnings -- grew our sales, excuse me, at 10.5%. But if you really peek under the hood a little bit, look at our daily growth, that's over 12%. I think that's the number that's really relevant because that's the number that carries the trend into the future. And so I added a little comment -- a blurb on that. Looking at that 10%, very pleased, and to touch -- build on what Will just mentioned, very pleased the fact that we were able to obtain leverage in an environment where we could grow -- where our top line dollars had only grown at 10% and we had a little bit of headwind from the gross profit side as well.
One item just to make note of when I look into Q4, we will have -- it's a 63 to 63 day quarter. So there's nothing really going on from that standpoint. There is a little bit of movement around within the months of the quarter. October will have 23 days this year versus 21 a year ago. So that will give us a nice headline number. Daily will probably suffer a little bit because of that just because there's a certain piece of our business that's more centered on the month and there's a piece to our business that's more centered on the day. So just to make everybody aware that there is 2 additional days. Those 2 days, we give back in December. So if I look at trade-offs in life, October is a big month for us. And if I can get 2 extra days in October and give them back in December, I'll take that deal anytime.
Will touched on the sequential patterns a little bit that we looked at on Page 3 of the release. If I look at the last couple of years, 2010 and 2011, we were beating the benchmark pattern that we laid out, 50%, 60%, 70% of the time. And when we got out of September, we were 490 basis points ahead of the trend line, so 5 points ahead of the trend line year-to-date, looking at January to September. This year, we had a setback in February, some weather issue has gone on. We quickly got it back in March, but then May came along. And May really changed the year for us and created more conservative tone within the organization for the balance of the year. And at the end of June, we were about 330 basis points behind year-to-date history, and we're basically at that same point. We're about 330 basis points behind now it's September. So since June, the business has been kind of treading water as far as how we compare to history, but nice momentum and also nice pickup, as Will mentioned, that we saw in September. And that bodes well as we go into October and into 2013, the more important way of looking at it.
In that context of the April-May-June time frame when we did see the slowdown, it was really in the fastener area. The non-fastener area held up much better, but that's also the area that's helped by all the growth drivers, the vending, the Government business, the metalworking. All those things we're doing really demonstrated that we can work through a period of declining economy and maintain very attractive top line growth rates.
One thing, in September here, ISM did pop up. Historically, when we looked at ISM, we've always felt ISM led us by about 3 months. So if ISM drops in June, we'd expect to see a drop in September. What we've been seeing in really the last year, 1.5 years, is that we kind of coincide with ISM. I'm not quite sure what caused the change, but when we dropped off in May, the ISM dropped off in June. I'm waiting to see if the ISM over 51 in September is a blip or if it has some legs. At this juncture, we're -- the jury is still out for us. And we're still maintaining a conservative tone as we go into the tail end of the year and into the first part of 2013.
As Will mentioned, on the growth drivers, top part on Page 6, all I can say on the FAST Solutions is really a nice quarter, great signings. I attribute that to great focus on it at the field level. Our stores, our districts, our regionals are really running with this. Russ Rubie and his team does a great job and very pleased with that. To me, that gets the piece that jumped out the most is the fact that obviously, this is wrapping up quickly, but we have a fair number of machines that have been out there for 12, 18, 24 months. That's not an inconsequential number. And the fact that, that entire group of customers that have vending, overlapping numbers still growing faster than 30%, I think, is a staggering figure and demonstrates the power of what vending can mean for our business. It's really about customer engagement. Vending is just the way we measure it. It's about we're engaged with that group of customers and we're growing because we're providing great service and great value for them.
In that same section of growth drivers a bit -- touched on a bit on 2013, we set out some expectations for store openings for next year, indicated a range of 50 to 100, which is about 2% to 4%. And I think our focus really is continuing the growth drivers we have in 2011 and 2012. They're demonstrating great results. We integrate the fasteners. We have some things that we're working on to really drive our OEM fastener growth. And in July, we mentioned the elevation of Lee Hein to President. And I think we announced that right after our call last quarter. So I'm going to congratulate Lee on that promotion. But I think the final thing we've touched on that paragraph was talking about fixing our underperforming stores. And when I think of people and their strengths that they bring to the table, one of the strengths that I think of when I think of Lee, he's great at assessing people and talent and he's great at raising the bar. And if you're driving down the road and you -- in your car and the brake is stuck on one of your tires, it's going to slow you down. And we have a subset of stores in any given month that aren't growing and aren't performing, and we need to raise the bar and get that brake off because it damages the rest of the engine. And I'm brutally excited about that looking into 2013. 
Profit drivers of the business on Page 7. I'm continue to be pleased with the progress of 'pathway to profit'. We took a step back a little bit in some of the smaller groups. I think there is really 2 things that are driving that, one we're working and the other one is probably a good problem. One is the gross margin that Will touched on. We're down in gross margin as a percent year-over-year. That creates drag in all those groups of stores. The other thing is we're preventing a rolling out. In the smaller stores, the expense of that vending does put a little drag on their pretax, but I think that's a good problem from the standpoint it really is driving our growth. But if you look at the stores that do more than $150,000 a month, where there is no vending impact, I mean negative vending impact, because the dollars of expense isn't big enough, well, that group is impressive and we saw nice profit growth on a year-over-year basis.
The other thing, I think, to think about and I touched on this in last quarter's call as well, if you look at since we started the 'pathway to profit' back in 2007, we have increased the size of Fastenal by about 65%. We improved our gross margin from 51% to 51.6% and our profits have doubled, not just talking the power of growth, leverage it with improving gross profit and managing your fixed operating expenses and leveraging quite effectively. If you look -- looking at our expenses in the organization, we've always talked about our biggest operating expenses is the people side of the equation. And if I look at what we've done since 2007, we've added around 3,800 people to our organization since the first quarter of 2007. 87% of those adds are in roles that directly contact, that interact with customers every day. 6% are involved in our distribution centers. 6% are involved in our manufacturing. So if I add those 3 up, 99% of our headcount growth since 2007 is in those 3 areas, and that's how you leverage overhead in an organization. 
The -- I'm very pleased through the fact that we hit 21.9%. I'm just going to round up and say 22%. It just feels better. But again, those are 2 highly profitable quarters for us despite the fact that we didn't have great sales growth in the quarter. We continue to make progress on our exclusive brands. We're essentially at 10% of sales to date. Vending, really, is helping move that number.
And then finally, I'm touching on some working capital. Will mentioned continued improvement on working capital. Now I do want to mention that Scott Camp and his team really did a nice job, I think, year-to-date on managing the distribution side of the inventory. We've lost a little traction on the accounts receivable side. Part of that was a short September. It takes X number of days to correct paths and there's enough of August business that's coming in here the first week of October. That's more of a calendar issue. But when I look at cash flow year-to-date, we've taken 90% of our earnings and turned it into operating cash. We've spent about 27% of earnings on CapEx. A big piece of that relates to the success we're seeing in vending, and we've thrown off 63% of our earnings in free cash flow year-to-date, great number. And because of that, we did announce last night an increased store dividend and are paying out $0.21 dividend in the fourth quarter. 
With that, I'll turn it over to what questions might come up."

We still don't know yet from our non-North American business what that means for store openings into the future. We just don't know. If I center the answer on North America, what we know about the market is it's big, $140 billion to $150 billion. It's $160 billion a year depending on whose math you're looking at, and we have somewhere between 2% and 3% market share. And historically, a lot of our eggs are in the store opening basket. And with 'pathway to profit', we really took a step away from that and said, ""There's a whole bunch of ways for us to go out and go after this market share, and we have this network that's out there that is -- that has unbelievable capabilities."" And that's balanced our total growth drivers across more channels. So we put tools in the hand not just of an area where we're more sparse but area where we're more dense. I mean, when I look at the growth, we continue to see in the Upper Midwest in a business that we've been in for 40-plus years. And we're doing it with the combination of store openings, vending, government, the whole gamut as far as growth drivers. We think 2% to 4% is a good number for 2013. 2014 and 2015, we'll see when we get there. Long way of truly not answering your question but saying the opportunity is so big that we don't want to pin ourselves into the corner of saying, ""It has to go from this one thing."" It comes from a variety. But when I think of, for example, the Government business, and I don't know in our products how big the government is, but if you read the headline, government is 20% of our economy. So if we have 2,500 locations, I'm using that figure -- the math in my head, and we had a 20% potential to that, that's like opening 500 stores. So is that a better route to go down in the short term or it's a goal with store openings? I think it's a combination of the 2, but I'll take that Government business."

Some of the other companies offer a machine that has a PC built into it. It seems less than what we used to offer 4 or 5 years ago, and we find ours are far more dependable. Because it's a PC-based appliance, it's also a lower cost system and so we're able to provide them at somewhat lower cost. The inventory in some customers is consigned inventory. In other customers, the customers choose to own it but the majority is consigned. Some of our competition does consigned inventory, and some of them have the customers own it. I think one of our biggest advantage, as compared to the big public companies that we all know of, is our local branch network because this is a physical business. If you think about the person who's supplying your soda machines or pop machines in the office, those people aren't driving from 3 or 4 hours away in many cases. Our local branch have the service element. It's going to be very hard to duplicate for some of our competitors. I know some of our competitors, their strategy is to ship at end of the factory and that the factory workers put the product away. But I would guess if you're the person providing the vending machines at your office, either [ph] you ship the product to the dock and you guys can put it away in the morning, probably, you'd find -- or you may find a new supplier. So we have that local advantage that really gives us some leverage, and we have this distribution network to move the product more efficiently. But machine to machine, product to product, it's not that dissimilar."

And it seems like you're taking the leverage probably down to that level or lower, and I'm just wondering about the strength you saw here in September relative to an uncertain economy. Are you happy where the set point is right now that you'll maintain that unless things change one way or the other into 2013? That's the first question. And then I'll just take the second one in here, too. In terms of vending placements, the number of vending machines, by my math, is up over 300% in the past year, and revenues to customers with vending machines looks like it's up a little bit less than 100% and I'm trying to understand that dynamic. Does that mean you're now getting into smaller customers? Are you placing more of the FAST 3000 machines with their less yield per customer? Or what is the implication from that math?"

So it makes me probably too conservative a",581,"Okay. First off, a couple of different questions there. First, on the breakpoint, my comment a year ago, '12 and '13, I'm glad to say I was wrong. I think part of it is maybe I'm Midwestern and I'm an accountant. So it makes me probably too conservative and not willing to put my neck out and say, ""We could do that 10%,"" because I didn't think we could. So that's just, I think, good execution especially in the face of the gross profit dynamic going on, which made it more challenging. On the vending machine, I'm not sure if I'm following your math on the 100% pieces. And in fact, I think I'll kind of restate it back the way we have it. And I'll think aloud a second and then I'll give you a third question to follow up on my answer. But the way I think about it is the customers that are coming into that group when we introduced vending, our -- that overall business is growing at 30% and that includes the weight, if you will, of the customers that have anniversary-ed, the customers that have vending a year ago and 2 years ago because we're looking at that combined group. I think if you're talking about vending being up over 100% because you're looking at the new machines and the dollars going through it, you're just -- you're taking the math and saying, ""Okay, 24% of your sales are with customers with vending and that number is X percent bigger than it was a year ago,"" you're comparing apples and oranges because we have customers that we had a year ago that didn't have vending that have vending today. So when we talk about the percentage of our sales that is vending, that includes customers that have been buying from us for years. We're just now looking at it and saying, ""How big is that pool growing and how big was that customer base a year ago?"" and -- which I think is the best way to look at it because it's really ""How much is it impacting your business?"" not ""What is the dollar growth going through a machine?"" because that's really not a meaningful number. I'm not sure if I answered your question right then, but the other thing I get out of looking at it and say, ""If I look at our dollars per machine and I try to understand that dynamic, is it improving or getting worse?"" it's at or was better than it was a year ago. And so from that standpoint, I don't think there's any dilution going on because of the different models of machines but there is some impact. When we report our machine count, we're reporting just our absolute count, running [ph] machines we have out there. And in that mix, there's the traditional FAST 5000 with the locker systems. There's some hydration machines. I think that's what we call it. And there are some cutting tool machines. So there's a variety of machines, and they have different potentials as far as throughput. And the way we measure it is we look at lockers and we say, ""We think they have about 1/2 of potential."" So when we're looking at $1 for machine, we look at that as the half. But I don't know if I just thought out loud. Did I bring you down and didn't answer the question? Maybe Will has a better answer."

If you take 25 -- roughly 25% of your business, grew 20 points faster than the overall company, the average of that represents the majority of our incremental growth. And we lay that against the expense of the vending program. But then from the vending program, we can also look at it at a different way and, say, we're putting expense of all these machines into our occupancy because we really think it's just offsite storage and our occupancy is not growing our revenue because Dan's group is doing such a great job. So we're really building this into our old P&L working model. And so it's very accretive business when you look at it that way. It's a great growth driver. But we can talk more and try and clear up.

We had a little bit of a stronger finish, but we do our daily analysis and we bring the sales in and we ended up about 200 basis points ahead of where we had estimated even before halfway through the month. Some early days into the month, we were estimating in that high 12s, and that's where we ended up just a little bit about -- we're in a 12.9%, so very consistent pattern, consistent across the United States and steady as the month went.

Whether we sell it to them or the other guys did, they have a stock that we have to burn through. And many times, we'll actually put their machines and burn the inventory through other tariffs or theirs. So the reality is if I sign a machine today, it's probably March before I see much gain. So we have a lot of energy and selling that has a delayed, positive effect, which is actually a great thing because it will come through. The other part, you have that.

Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our call. I'm going to spend a few minutes with some brief comments on my view of the quarter, then I'm going to turn it over to Dan. 
Overall, I felt that we did a very good job in the quarter considering a little bit of economic headwind. Sales were slow, but we did see an uptick in September. So we're very optimistic about that. Another thing on a positive note is on a sequential basis, from June to September, we're really on track with what our historical numbers are. So we also see that as a positive. We had a very weak April-May time frame, although we lost a lot of ground for the year. But since then, we've really been tracking very consistent. So there is a little life underneath all of this.
We've seen very slow growth in both Asia and Europe. That's also been holding us back. If you compare it to last year, in 2011, we actually were getting about a 200-basis-point bump in our sales because of our foreign activity. And this year, it's about equal to the U.S. business. So we're just not getting any tailwind from our Asia and European businesses.
Mexico remains very strong, which is very positive. They've just done great over the last 3 or 4 years, and we continue to invest. I believe we've opened 7 stores in the last year in Mexico, and they continue to perform at a very high level. 
A little bit on some of the vertical markets. Construction actually bounced back a little bit in September, but if you look at the number, August was a -- was like the low point. And so September is more on a normal number or more a traditional number, almost 10% growth on the construction. In manufacturing, we just haven't seen much change. I think it went -- moved about 10 basis points over the 3-month period, up 10, down 10. So manufacturing has been very consistent, which we actually look as a positive, because it had been moving down prior to that. So we're holding our own in manufacturing. And hopefully, things will pick up as time goes on here. 
On the margin -- I'm a little disappointed in the margin. We've been working very hard on improving our margin. We didn't lose any ground. We also didn't make up much ground in the quarter. One thing to note on that, though, is that steel remains soft. If you follow the steel markets at all, steel continues to decline a little bit. If you look at -- we look at the Asian steel markets, because a lot of our fasteners come out of Asia. A lot of their prices are down 10% to 20% from a year ago. And so that continues to put pressure on our margin. But I think the team is doing a good job of holding the prices up as they can, but it's more difficult to make gains in a deflationary market. And with fasteners making up close to 50% of our business, that makes a big difference in our margin opportunities. We will continue to work on it and believe we can -- we will show some improvement as we go forward. 
Some of the other projects or initiatives that we're working on. We continue to work hard on metalworking. Our goal going into the year was to grow that business, the product line, metalworking product line, at least 10 points faster than the overall Fastenal growth. We've been able to maintain that -- actually exceeded that goal. We continue to make nice wins, still not a huge business for us, but it's a nice-sized business, and it's growing meaningfully faster than the overall business. So we're optimistic, and our margins have maintained at a nice level. We're not giving up a lot of price to get that sales. We're not getting the sales on price. So that's very positive for us, and we'll continue to invest heavily on the metalworking business.
On the Government side, another one of our new initiatives, our goal is the same in Government: grow the business at least 10% faster than Fastenal. We're also exceeding those goals on that business, tremendous upside, and we'll continue to invest. We continue to make nice wins there. That's going to be a -- it's almost door -- it's like street fighting. It's door-to-door business. You have to go to a lot of small entities, county shops and small hospitals and city shops.  Very good, dependable business, but it's hard to get. So it's not one big swing gets it all.  So we're working very hard in the Government business and continue to develop our people and train them on how to go after that business, because it is a little different than our traditional industrial and construction business. 
Vending had a very strong quarter. We had a very strong quarter in vending. We signed over 5,300 machines. We installed just under 4,000 machines. So we've made nice progress in both areas. Some of the positives that I've -- things that I see as positives in that is we've had broader participation at the store level. We're getting more stores to buy into the program. We still have a ways to go there, the stores that have bought in early. The early adopters are signing far more machines than the rest. It is broadening out. And we've also made some very nice customer wins that we picked up over the last 3 to 4 months. So we're optimistic about what's going on there. We believe it will continue to grow in the future. And as a company, we will continue to invest in the vending program as we will in the metalworking and government programs.
On the 'pathway to profit', I'm again a little disappointed there. We only picked up 50 basis points year-over-year. Our goal was 100 basis points, but we really didn't have the sales growth to make it happen. You need probably north of 16% -- 15% to 16% sales growth to pick up 100 basis points without squeezing the business too hard on other things. On a positive note, though, if you look at the 2-year run, we're up 190 basis points. We're still staying pretty close to the goal over a longer period, and that's really what we want to do. We know we're going to have some stronger years and some weaker years. So as a project, we're doing nice. The team is doing a great job, I believe, and we believe we can stay on that track going forward. 
Expense control, done a nice job considering we didn't have the great sales growth that we were -- as good a sales growth as we're expecting. But I think the teams did a nice job looking at the little stuff, and that's how we've been able to maintain the earnings growth that we have. 
Strong cash flow. Dan and his team did a great job with that, controlling the inventory growth and creating very positive cash flow for the company.
So overall, I believe we had a good quarter. I think there is a lot of work to do, a lot of things we can do better. We're very focused on improving our business and growing into the future. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan, because Dan will provide more color on the quarter."

A couple of things to make note as we flip through the various pages of the press release. On Page 1, inserted a paragraph into this quarter, a bit atypical for us, but the calendar had some impacts on the quarter. So I wanted to share a few thoughts on that. In the third quarter, we actually had 63 days versus 64 days a year ago. In some businesses, that might not make much of a difference, but for us, when you're selling a very tangible product, the number of business days really does matter. Our headline number is we grew our earnings -- grew our sales, excuse me, at 10.5%. But if you really peer under the hood a little bit, look at our daily growth, that's over 12%. I think that's the number that's really relevant because that's the number that carries the trend into the future. And so I added a little comment -- a blurb on that. Looking at that 10%, very pleased, and to touch -- build on what Will just mentioned, very pleased the fact that we were able to obtain leverage in an environment where we could grow -- where our top line dollars had only grow at 10% and we had a little bit of headwind from the gross profit side as well.
One item just to make note of when I look into Q4, we will have -- it's a 63- to 63-day quarter. So there's nothing really going on from that standpoint. There is a little bit of movement around within the months of the quarter. October will have 23 days this year versus 21 a year ago. So that will give us a nice headline number. Daily will probably suffer a little bit because of that just because there's a certain piece of our business that's more centered on the month and there's a piece to our business that's more centered on the day. So just to make everybody aware that there is 2 additional days. Those 2 days we give back in December. So if I look at trade-offs in life, October is a big month for us. And if I can get 2 extra days in October and give them back in December, I'll take that deal anytime.
Will touched on the sequential patterns a little bit that we looked at on Page 3 of the release. If I look at the last couple of years, 2010 and 2011, we were beating the benchmark pattern that we laid out, 50%, 60%, 70% of the time. And when we got out to September, we were 490 basis points ahead of the trend line, so 5 points ahead of the trend line year-to-date, looking at January to September. This year, we had a setback in February, some weather issues going on. We quickly got it back in March, but then May came along. And May really changed the year for us and created more conservative tone within the organization for the balance of the year. And at the end of June, we were about 330 basis points behind year-to-date history, and we're basically at that same point. We're about 330 basis points behind now at September. So since June, the business has been kind of treading water as far as how we compare to history, but nice momentum and also nice pickup, as Will mentioned, that we saw in September. And that bodes well as we go into October and into 2013, the more important way of looking at it.
In that context of the April-May-June time frame when we did see the slowdown, it was really in the fastener area. The non-fastener area held up much better, but that's also the area that's helped by all the growth drivers, the vending, the Government business, the metalworking. All those things we're doing really demonstrated that we can work through a period of declining economy and maintain very attractive top line growth rates.
One thing, in September here, ISM did pop up. Historically, when we looked at ISM, we've always felt ISM led us by about 3 months. So if ISM drops in June, we'd expect to see a drop in September. What we've been seeing in really the last year, 1.5 years is that we kind of coincide with ISM. I'm not quite sure what caused the change, but when we dropped off in May, the ISM dropped off in June. I'll be interested to see if the ISM over 51 in September is a blip or if it has some legs. At this juncture, we're -- the jury is still out for us. And we're still maintaining a conservative tone as we go into the tail end of the year and into the first part of 2013.
As Will mentioned, on the growth drivers, top part on Page 6, all I can say on the FAST Solutions is really a nice quarter.  Great signings, I attribute that to great focus on it at the field level. Our stores, our districts, our regionals are really running with this. Russ Rubie and his team does a great job and very pleased with that. To me, that gets the piece that jumped out the most is the fact that obviously, this is wrapping up quickly, but we have a fair number of machines that have been out there for 12, 18, 24 months. That's not an inconsequential number. And the fact that, that entire group of customers that have vending, overlapping numbers is still growing faster than 30%, I think it's a staggering figure and demonstrates the power of what vending can mean for our business. It's really about customer engagement. Vending is just the way we measure it. It's about we're engaged with that group of customers, and we're growing because we're providing great service and great value for them.
In that same section of growth drivers, did touch on a bit on 2013, we set out some expectations for store openings for next year, indicated a range of 50 to 100, which is about 2% to 4%. And I think our focus really is continuing the growth drivers we have in 2011 and 2012. They're demonstrating great results. We integrate the fasteners. We have some things that we're working on to really drive our OEM fastener growth. And in July, we mentioned the elevation of Lee Hein to President. And I think we announced that right after our call last quarter. So I want to congratulate Lee on that promotion. But I think the final thing we've touched on in that paragraph was talking about fixing our underperforming stores. And when I think of people and their strengths that they bring to the table, one of the strengths that I think of when I think of Lee, he's great at assessing people and talent, and he's great at raising the bar. And if you're driving down the road and you -- in your car, and the brake is stuck on one of your tires, it's going to slow you down. And we have a subset of stores in any given month just aren't growing and aren't performing, and we need to raise the bar and get that brake off, because it damages the rest of the engine. And I'm brutally excited about that looking into 2013. 
Profit drivers of the business on Page 7.  Continue to be pleased with the progress of 'pathway to profit'. We took a step back a little bit in some of the smaller groups. I think there's really 2 things that are driving that, one we're working on, and the other one is probably a good problem. One is the gross margin that Will touched on. We're down in gross margin as a percent year-over-year. That creates drag in all those groups of stores. The other thing is we're preventing a rolling out. In the smaller stores, the expense of that vending does put a little drag on their pretax, but I think that's a good problem from the standpoint it really is driving our growth. But if you look at the stores that do more than $150,000 a month, where there is no vending impact, I mean negative vending impact, because the dollars of expense isn't big enough, well, that group is impressive, and we saw nice profit growth on a year-over-year basis.
The other thing, I think, to think about, and I touched on this in last quarter's call as well, if you look at since we started the 'pathway to profit' back in 2007, we have increased the size of Fastenal by about 65%. We improved our gross margin from 51% to 51.6%, and our profits have doubled, and that's just talking the power of growth, leverage it with improving gross profit and managing your fixed operating expenses and leveraging quite effectively. If you look -- looking at our expenses in the organization, we've always talked about our biggest operating expenses is the people side of the equation. And if I look at what we've done since 2007, we've added around 3,800 people to our organization since the first quarter of 2007. 87% of those adds are in roles that directly contact, that interact with customers every day. 6% are involved in our distribution centers. 6% are involved in our manufacturing. So if I add those 3 up, 99% of our headcount growth since 2007 is in those 3 areas, and that's how you leverage overhead in an organization. 
The -- I'm very pleased through the fact that -- we hit 21.9%. I'm just going to round up and say 22%. It just feels better. But again, those are 2 highly profitable quarters for us despite the fact that we didn't have great sales growth in the quarter. We continue to make progress on our exclusive brands. We're essentially at 10% of sales to date. Vending really is helping move that number.
And then finally, I'm touching on some working capital. Will mentioned continued improvement on working capital. Now I do want to mention that Scott Camp and his team really did a nice job, I think, year-to-date on managing the distribution side of the inventory. We've lost a little traction on the accounts receivable side. Part of that was a short September. It takes X number of days to collect cash, and there's enough of August business that's coming in here the first week of October. That's more of a calendar issue. But when I look at cash flow year-to-date, we've taken 90% of our earnings and turned it into operating cash. We've spent about 27% of earnings on CapEx. A big piece of that relates to the success we're seeing in vending, and we've thrown off 63% of our earnings in free cash flow year-to-date, great number. And because of that, we did announce last night an increase to our dividend and are paying out a $0.21 dividend in the fourth quarter. 
With that, I'll turn it over to what questions might come up."

If I center the answer",387,"I'm going to be perfectly honest. I don't know that we know, and I'll say that in a couple of ways. We still don't know yet from our non-North American business what that means for store openings into the future. We just don't know. If I center the answer on North America, what we know about the market is it's big, $140 billion to $150 billion. It's $160 billion a year, depending on whose math you're looking at.  And we have somewhere between 2% and 3% market share. And historically, a lot of our eggs are in the store opening basket. And with 'pathway to profit', we really took a step away from that and said, ""There's a whole bunch of ways for us to go out and go after this market share, and we have this network that's out there that is -- that has unbelievable capabilities."" And that's balanced our total growth drivers across more channels. So we put tools in the hand not just of an area where we're more sparse but area where we're more dense. I mean, when I look at the growth we continue to see in the Upper Midwest in a business that we've been in for 40-plus years -- and we're doing it with a combination of store openings, vending, government, the whole gamut as far as growth drivers. We think 2% to 4% is a good number for 2013. 2014 and 2015, we'll see when we get there. Long way of truly not answering your question but saying the opportunity is so big that we don't want to pin ourselves into the corner of saying, ""It has to go from this one thing."" It comes from a variety. But when I think of, for example, the Government business, and I don't know in our products how big the government is, but if you read the headline, government is 20% of our economy. So if we have 2,500 locations, I'm using that so I can do the math in my head, and we add a 20% potential to that, that's like opening 500 stores. So is that a better route to go down in the short term or it's a goal of store openings, I think it's a combination of the 2, but I'll take that Government business."

Some of the other companies offer a machine that has a PC built into it. Same system that we used to offer 4 or 5 years ago, and we find ours are far more dependable. Because it's a PC-based appliance, it's also a lower-cost system and so we're able to provide them at somewhat lower cost. The inventory in some customers is consigned inventory. In other customers, the customers choose to own it.  But the majority is consigned. Some of our competition does consigned inventory, and some of them have the customers own it. I think one of our biggest advantages, compared to the big public companies that we all know of, is our local branch network, because this is a physical business. If you think about the person who's supplying your soda machines or pop machines in the office, those people aren't driving from 3 or 4 hours away in many cases. Our local branch adds a service element that's going to be very hard to duplicate for some of our competitors. I know some of our competitors, their strategy is to ship it into the factory and then have the factory workers put the product away. But I would guess if your person providing the vending machines at your office said that they'll just ship the product to the dock, and you guys can put it away in the morning, probably you'd find -- or you may find a new supplier. So we have that local advantage that really gives us some leverage, and we have this distribution network to move the product more efficiently. But machine to machine, product to product, it's not that dissimilar."

Are you happy where the set point is right now, that you'll maintain that unless things change one way or the other into 2013? That's the first question. And then I'll just sneak the second one in here, too. In terms of vending placements, the number of vending machines, by my math, is up over 300% in the past year, and revenues to customers with vending machines looks like it's up a little bit less than 100% and I'm trying to understand that dynamic. Does that mean you're now getting into smaller customers? Are you placing more of the FAST 3000 machines with their less yield per customer? Or what is the implication from that math?"

First, on the breakpoint, my comment a year ago, '12 and '13, I'm glad to say I was wrong. I think part of it is maybe I'm Midwestern, and I'm an accountant, so it makes me probably too conservative",585,"Okay. First off, a couple of different questions there. First, on the breakpoint, my comment a year ago, '12 and '13, I'm glad to say I was wrong. I think part of it is maybe I'm Midwestern, and I'm an accountant, so it makes me probably too conservative and not willing to put my neck out and say we could do it at 10%, because I didn't think we could. So that's just, I think, good execution, especially in the face of the gross profit dynamic going on, which made it more challenging. On the vending machine, I'm not sure if I'm following your math on the 100% pieces. And in fact, I think I'll kind of restate it back the way we have it. And I'll think out loud a second, and then I'll give you a third question to follow up on my answer. But the way I think about it is the customers that are coming into that group when we introduced vending, our -- that overall business is growing at 30%, and that includes the weight, if you will, of the customers that have anniversary-ed, the customers that had vending a year ago and 2 years ago, because we're looking at that combined group. I think if you're talking about vending being up over 100% because you're looking at the new machines and the dollars going through it, you're just -- you're taking the math and saying, ""Okay, 24% of your sales are with customers with vending, and that number is X percent bigger than it was a year ago,"" you're comparing apples and oranges.  Because we have customers that we had a year ago that didn't have vending that have vending today. So when we talk about the percentage of our sales that is vending, that includes customers that have been buying from us for years. We're just now looking at it and saying, ""How big is that pool growing, and how big was that customer base a year ago?"" and -- which I think is the best way to look at it, because it's really ""How much is it impacting your business?"" not ""What is the dollar growth going through a machine?""  Because that's really not a meaningful number. I'm not sure if I answered your question right then [ph].  The other thing I guess I would look at and say if I look at our dollars per machine and I try to understand that dynamic, is it improving or getting worse?  It's at or a little bit better than it was a year ago. And so from that standpoint, I don't think there's any dilution going on because of the different models of machines, but there is some impact. When we report our machine count, we're reporting just our absolute count.  Here's vending [ph] machines we have out there. And in that mix, there's the traditional FAST 5000 with the locker systems. There's some hydration machines. I think that's what we call it. And there are some cutting tool machines. So there's a variety of machines, and they have different potentials as far as throughput. And the way we measure it is we look at lockers and we say, ""We think they have about 1/2 a potential."" So when we're looking at dollars per machine, we look at that as a half. But I don't know if I just thought out loud and did a brain dump and didn't answer the question? Maybe Will has a better answer."

If you take 25 -- roughly 25% of your business grew 20 points faster than the overall company, the average of that represents the majority of our incremental growth. And we lay that against the expense of the vending program. But then from the vending program, we can also look at it at a different way and, say, we're putting expense of all these machines into our occupancy, because we really think it's just offsite storage, and our occupancy is not outgrowing our revenue, because Dan's group is doing such a great job. So we're really building this into our old P&L working model. And so it's very accretive business when you look at it that way. It's a great growth driver. But we can talk more and try and clear up.

So there's 8,000 customers right now that have vending.  Rough numbers. And Lee might have a better number. And so there's a big universe of customers out there that we have today that we put vending into, even based on our definition of, 3 years ago, what the FAST 5000 is. We've added the whole fleet of machines now. We've broadened the audience of customers that could have vending. We've decreased the size that we need to run through the machine and decreased the size of the customer. So I don't think there's a market limitation for us, unless you want to start talking about 2020."

And when you visit stores that have done very well, stores that have 20 or 30 machines, and we have several of those now, and you ask them what their market potential is, with -- the lowest numbers I hear are 50. And most of the people say, ""Oh, I'll get well over 100 in my store."" And so once that the store managers start to see this, the numbers become so much larger, I'm almost shaking my head, going, ""Wow.""  But these are the guys in the field, these are the guys that understand it. And so it's really about opening the eyes, and the numbers will continue to grow, as Dan said, as we get different machines for smaller customers and larger customers. It's simply a better way to deliver our product."

One thing I noticed about September, Ryan, is the consistency throughout the United States. If you look at the growth region by region, it's probably the narrowest group that you -- band that you've seen in a long time. Nobody had a real bad month, and there's really no one that had a great month, which -- consistency is good for us. We did see a nice uptick, though, in our international business. Part of that was driven by currency, but overall, even the unit growth was up internationally. So it was consistent. It was, for the most part, consistent through the month. We had a little bit of a stronger finish, but we do our daily analysis and we bring the sales in, and we ended up about 200 basis points ahead of where we had estimated even before halfway through the month. Some early days into the month, we were estimating in that high 12s, and that's where we ended up just a little bit about -- or 12.9%.  So very consistent pattern, consistent across the United States and steady as the month went. So that was -- it was all positive."

But it's really delayed, because it takes us about 90 days to install a machine after we sign it. And it really takes us, on Dan's analysis, another 60 to 90 days to get everything flowing, because what happens in most cases is the customers we sign up have a lot of inventory. Whether we sell it to them or the other guys did, they have a stock that we have to burn through. And many times, we'll actually put that in our machines and burn the inventory through whether it's ours or theirs. So the reality is if I sign a machine today, it's probably March before I see much gain. So we have a lot of energy and selling that has a delayed, positive effect, which is actually a great thing, because it will come through. The other part, you have that. The other is with all that energy, we're probably not working as hard on some other things we should, because we only have so many hours in a day. So it's where you put your time. And as Dan mentioned, fasteners, they're probably suffering because of some of this -- Lee has a comment."

That -- every time you look at Fastenal, whether it's Government, any of our industry specialists, you always have to hold that against how many stores are participating in this growth driver today.
