Good morning, and many thanks for joining us today.  As always, we appreciate your continued investment and interest in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.
Joining me this morning are Rob Martinovich, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our quarterly results and updated earnings guidance; Pierce Norton, our Chief Operating Officer, who will review the operating performance of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners’; and Terry Spencer, our President, who will review current market conditions, including our outlook on supply and demand for NGL, and the implications of lower commodity prices, followed by a status report on the ONEOK Partners’ growth projects.
On this morning’s conference call, I will briefly review our fourth quarter and year-end 2011 results, provide some perspective on our revised 2012 guidance, and conclude with some comments about our current and future growth.
Let’s start with ONEOK Partners fourth quarter and year-end performance.  Both the year and the quarter were exceptional.  Results were driven by wider NGL differentials, as well as higher volumes in our natural gas liquids, and our natural gas gathering and processing segments.
Our growth projects are on time, and on budget, and we continue to increase volume commitments for these projects.  Our Garden Creek natural gas processing plant in the Williston Basin is operational, allowing producers the ability to capture additional value, while reducing the amount of flaring occurring in the Bakken shale.
Our natural gas distribution segment performed well in the quarter and for the full year.  Net margins were essentially flat with operating income affected primarily by higher share-based compensation costs.
You will recall that we award all full time employees with one share of stock each time the closing price reaches a new $1 high.  In 2011, we awarded 31 shares of stock at a cost of $16 million.  Since the natural gas distribution segment has largest number of employees, and the allocations of this cost are on a per employee basis, it incurred a large portion of that expense.  We believe it is a small price to pay for outstanding share price appreciation in 2011.
Our energy services segment continues to struggle as a result of challenging market conditions, narrow seasonal and location differentials, low natural gas prices and volatility, moderate weather conditions, and an oversupply of natural gas.  While we have lowered our expectations for this business in 2012, we continue to reduce our leased storage and transportation capacity, and operating cost, but the fact remains it’s a very challenging market.
We also updated our 2012 financial guidance, increasing our earnings expectation at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners’ and raising our dividend and distribution growth forecasts for the year.  Rob will provide more detail in a few minutes.
Our updated 2012 ONEOK Partners’ guidance includes higher natural gas liquids operating income than we originally forecast, $528 million today versus last fall of 2012 forecast of $395 million, but lower than the segments 2011 actual results.
Our updated NGL segment guidance is the result of an expected increase in ethane differentials between the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast, compared with what we assumed in our original 2012 guidance.  However, we expect lower NGL optimization margins in 2012, as we continue to convert some capacity to firm fee-based contracts.
In 2012, lower expected commodity prices will also impact the partnerships natural gathering and processing segment.  We expect 2012 GMP segment results to be higher than 2011, but lower than we originally forecast last fall.
Rob will now review ONEOK’s financial highlights, and then Perez will review ONEOK’s operating performance.  Rob?

ONEOK’s fourth quarter net income increased by 38% compared with the same period last year, driven by the strong performance of ONEOK Partners.
For 2011, net income increased 8% versus 2010.  Results in the distribution segment were lower due to higher employee related cost, while energy services had reduced results, due primarily to lower storage, marketing, and transportation margins, resulting from narrower seasonal spreads and natural gas price location differentials.
ONEOK’s 2011, standalone cash flow, before changes in working capital, exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $213.7 million.  In 2011, ONEOK received approximately $333 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners, a 10% increase over 2010.
ONEOK’s income taxes on the distributions from the ONEOK Partners LP units they own or deferred contributing to ONEOK’s strong cash flow.
We also updated guidance for ONEOK in 2012.  Net income is expected to be in the range of $360 million to $410 million, compared with its previous range of $355 million to $400 million.  The updated guidance reflects higher anticipated earnings in the ONEOK’s Partner segment, offset partially by lower expected earnings in the energy services segment.
In January, ONEOK completed $700 million public offering of 4.5% senior notes due 2022.  We used the proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our $1.2 billion commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes, providing additional capacity for various options, which may include repurchasing ONEOK common stock under our previously approved share repurchase program, purchase of additional common units of ONEOK Partners, and/or the payment of dividends to shareholders.  Also in January, we declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of $0.61 per share, a 17% increase since January 2011.  Since January 2006, the company has increased the dividend 13 times representing 118% increase during that period.
Subject to Board approval, we also expect to increase the dividend $0.05 per share in July compared with our expectation last September of $0.04 per share.  This increase is consistent with our goal to grow the dividend by 50% by 2014.
ONEOK’s liquidity position is excellent.  At the end of the fourth quarter, on a standalone basis, we had $842 million of commercial paper outstanding, $30.9 million of cash and cash equivalents; $347.7 million of natural gas and storage, $356 million available under our new credit facility, and our total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 45%.  ONEOK significant cash flow and outstanding liquidity position continue to give us incredible financial flexibility.
Now Pierce will update you on ONEOK’s operating performance.

Let’s start with our natural gas distribution segment.  Fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings were lower compared with the same period last year, because of higher operating cost, primarily the share-based compensation cost discussed on previous conference call.  This segments portion of the 31 shares of stock awarded to employees in 2011 was $10 million.
2012 operating income guidance been updated to $223 million, reflecting the recent sale of the retail natural gas marketing business that has now accounted for as discontinued operations.
Now a brief regulatory update.  In Kansas, the Kansas Corporation Commission approved our application to increase the Gas System Reliability Surcharge by an additional $2.9 million effective January 2012.  This capital recovery mechanism allows us to recover and to earn a return on safety-related and government mandated capital investments made between rate cases.
Kansas Gas Service plans to file a rate case in mid 2012; it’s first since 2006.  As part of that rate case, we are exploring rate design options that reduce our volumetric sensitivity.
Oklahoma Natural Gas will make its annual performance base rates filing on or before March the 1st.  We expect to request a modest increase in rates to recognize our investment in rate base and increases in operating cost.
We continue our efforts to grow our rate base by investing in projects that provide benefits to our customers and our shareholders.  In 2011, the distribution segment invested approximately $243 million of capital, including $25 million in automated meter reading devices.  In 2012, we planned to invest approximately $270 million of capital, as in the past; this includes pipeline integrity projects, pipeline replacement, extending services to new areas, automated meter reading devices, and increasing the systems delivery capability.
Now let’s turn to energy services.  The lower earnings result reflects lower storage and marketing margins, due primarily to lower realized seasonal storage price differentials, and lower transportation margins, due primarily to narrower realized price location differentials, and lower hedge settlements in 2011.
Full year 2011 operating income was $24 million.  Location differentials are essentially non-existent between several market delivery points.  Seasonal differentials remained narrow for 2012, with little or no price volatility, but have improved somewhat for 2013.  We’ve reduced energy services 2012 operating income guidance to zero as this segment will continue to face extraordinarily challenging market conditions, because of the increase in transportation pipeline capacity in recent years, and an oversupply of natural gas from shale play.
We continue to access how much transportation and storage capacity we need to service our premium customers, and look for opportunities to renegotiate transportation and storage rate.  By the end of this year, more than 20% of our leased storage capacity and 15% of our leased transportation capacity will be up for renewal.  And by 2015, more than 90% of the storage capacity and 75% of the transport capacity will be up for renewal, providing an opportunity to either renew them at lower market rates or cancel the leases.  These explorations also give us additional opportunities to realign our capacity with customers needs and rebase our cost structure.
We now expect to reduce our target leased storage capacity from 65 Bcf at the end of 2012 to 60 Bcf at 2015, and our leased transportation capacity from 1 Bcf per day at the end of 2012 down to 0.8 Bcf per day by 2015.

In the fourth quarter, ONEOK Partners’ net income more than doubled compared with the fourth quarter of 2010.  For 2011, net income increased 76% versus 2010.
Distributable cash flow increased 89% compared with the fourth quarter last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 2.26 times.  For 2011, distributable cash flow increased 61% compared with 2010, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.66 times.  The higher earnings and resulting higher coverage ratio were primarily due to strong NGL optimization margins from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu.
Similar to the 2008 when commodity prices were record levels, we do not believe these wider NGL price differentials are sustainable long-term.  In 2008, we utilized the incremental cash flow to finance a portion of our $2 billion capital investment program that was completed in 2009, and we finally utilized a portion of the incremental cash flow likewise in 2012, to help fund our current $3 billion capital growth program, reducing our debt and equity financing needs.
At the same time, we are meaningfully increasing distributions to our unitholders.  We increased the distribution 1.5 cents per unit for the fourth quarter and subject to Board approval expect to increase it another 2.5 cents per quarter in 2012, higher than the $0.02 per quarter increase we announced last September.  With the strong performance of the NGL segment expected to continue in 2012, although at a lower level than we experienced in 2011, we’ve increased the partnerships 2012 earnings guidance by almost 10% to a range of $810 million to $870 million, compared with its previous range of $740 million to $800 million.
We also estimate the partnerships 2012 distributable cash flow to be in the range of $925 million to $985 million, compared with its previous range of $845 million to $915 million.
We updated our 2012 capital expenditure guidance to $2 billion to reflect our latest forecast.  This breaks down to $1.9 billion in growth capital and $109 million in maintenance capital.
We have hedges in place to lock-in margins on our expected equity volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, where a portion of our margin is derived from the receipt of commodities.  Our news release contains updated information on these hedges.
Our 2012 natural gas hedges have increased to 73% from 42%, while our 2012 NGL hedges have increased to 72% from 43%.  As is our practice, we continually monitor the commodity markets, and will place additional hedges as conditions warrant.
At the end of the fourth quarter, the partnership had $35.1 million in cash and no commercial paper or other short-term borrowings, a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 53%, and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9 times.
Now Pierce will review the partnerships operating performance.

As John said the partnership had an exceptional fourth quarter.  Operating income almost doubled compared with the same period last year, driven primarily by higher margins in the natural gas liquid segment from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu, and increased fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities.
Earnings also increased as a result of higher isomerization margins in the NGL segment, and solid performance in the natural gas gathering and processing segment from higher natural gas volumes processed.
While we benefited from these favorable NGL price differentials, and higher NGL and condensate prices, our base business continues to grow.  In the fourth quarter, natural gas volumes processed increased, as did NGL volumes gathered, fractionated, and NGL purity projects -- products distributed.  More on that in a moment.
The natural gas gathering and processing segments fourth quarter financial results were higher due primarily to higher natural gas volumes processed, specifically in the Williston Basin and higher net realized NGL and condensate prices.  We decreased this segments operating income guidance for 2012 to $247 million, compared with the $297 million we provided last September, to reflect lower commodity price assumptions.
In 2012, we expect processed volumes to be up 24% and gathered volumes to be up 15%, both driven our investments in the Williston Basin, the new Garden Creek plant that went into service in December, and the Stateline I plant that we expect to be in service sometime in the third quarter of this year.
The natural gas pipeline segment’s fourth quarter results were lower compared with the fourth quarter last year, due to lower transportation margins from narrow regional natural gas price differentials that decreased contracted capacity on Midwestern gas transmission and interruptible volumes across several of our pipelines.  For 2011, equity earnings from Northern Border pipeline increased by 12% compared with 2010, as it maintained it’s position as a low cost provider in transporting Canadian source supply to markets in the Midwest.  Northern Border is substantially contracted for long haul capacity through March 2013, and has been successful capturing three years or longer extensions, as current contracts expire.
We decreased this segments 2012 operating income guidance to $135 million, reflecting a lower assumed natural gas price as it relates to our retained fuel position.  Almost 90% of the contracted capacity on our wholly owned top-line serve endusers directly such as natural gas distribution companies and electric generators that need the natural gas to operate their businesses, regardless of regional price differentials.
In spite of narrow price differential environment, this business due to the totally contracted capacity continues to generate stable earnings with 82% of our pipeline capacity and 100% of our storage capacity contracted under firm long-term contracts.
Our natural gas liquid segment continued to benefit in 2011 from record wide NGL price differentials and having more fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities.  This segment also benefited from higher isomerization margins due to wider price differentials between normal butane and isobutane.
Successful contract negotiations, associated with our exchange and storage services activities also helped earnings.  We fractionated 10% more volumes during the fourth quarter 2011 compared with the same period last year, averaging 583,000 barrels per day, which includes volumes fractionated at the target facility from the fractionation services agreement that began during the second quarter in 2011.
NGLs transported on our gathering lands were up 17% during the quarter compared with the same period last year, averaging 473,000 barrels per day during the quarter, as a result of increased volumes gathered on the Arbuckle Pipeline and in the Mid-Continent.
Arbuckle Pipeline volumes are now reaching more than 200,000 barrels per day.  Additional pump stations have been added as a part of the Arbuckle expansion that will increase capacity to 240,000 barrels per day in the early second quarter of 2012.  We significantly increased our 2012 operating income guidance for this segment to reflect the wider NGL price differentials.  For 2012, we have updated the Conway and Mont Belvieu ethane price differential to average $0.32 per gallon compared with $0.12 per gallon provided in September.  While the current ethane price differential has softened to levels below $0.32 due to a number of short-term maintenance outages at U.S. Petrochemical plants, we anticipate ethane differentials will increase as the Petchems return to normal operations during the second quarter.
Although we only provided expected Conway to Mont Belvieu differentials for ethane in our guidance, our opportunity to capture optimization margins is not solely based on the ethane differential.
Our well positioned and vertically integrated assets can also benefit from Conway to Belvieu differentials, from the other NGL products such as propane and butane.  Additionally, we are also expecting to utilize less capacity for optimization activities in 2012 compared with 2011, attracting some of the capacity under fee-based long-term agreements with customers.
We have a planned maintenance turnaround at our Mont Belvieu fractionator MB I scheduled for May.  During this turnaround, raw NGL volumes that were currently being fractionated at MB I either will be sent to other fractionators, and/or placed in storage.  The cause of the events planning that goes into the turnaround, we expect this turnaround will not substantially affect our customers operations.
John that concludes my remarks.

This morning I will discuss our outlook of the NGL markets and close with a status report on our growth projects.On the demand side, the petrochemical industry continues to find ways to consume more ethane, due t",1038,"Thanks John, and good morning everyone.  This morning I will discuss our outlook of the NGL markets and close with a status report on our growth projects.
On the demand side, the petrochemical industry continues to find ways to consume more ethane, due to its strong price advantage versus oil base feedstocks.  In the short-term, several petrochemical facilities are currently conducting maintenance turnarounds reducing the immediate need for ethane, which is primarily responsible for the current lower ethane prices in the Mont Belvieu market.  We also understand that several of these petchems are in turnarounds to also increase their ethane cracking capability.
In addition, the price weakness is exacerbated by the petchems that are down for maintenance, filling ethane into the market.  The lower natural gas price environment also puts downward pressure on ethane prices.  There has been some concern about the impact of lower natural gas prices on our businesses.  On the supply side, rigs are continuing to move away from dry gas regions and producers are focusing specifically on crude oil and liquids rich plays such as the Bakken, Cana-Woodford, Woodford, Granite Wash, Niobrara, Mississippi and Lime, and the Eagle Ford Shale.
Fortunately for us, our assets are well positioned in all but one of these areas.  From what we have seen in drilling schedules, we have been provided; we do not expect any material impact on volumes that supply our plants or systems that serve these liquid rich regions.  With oil prices showing little signs of pulling back, the weaker natural gas prices help to maintain or further widen the ethane to crude ratio improving the U.S. petrochems industries competitive position globally, and increasing demand for more NGL feedstock, which benefits our NGL business.
Once these planned turnarounds are completed in the next few months, demand from the petchems for ethane and the price of ethane should strengthen particularly in Mont Belvieu.  Some experts are projecting ethane demand will reach new record highs later this year and will continue to grow over the long-term, especially with the announcements of petrochemical plant restarts, expansions, and development of new world class petrochemical plants.
As a consequence, we expect NGL fractionation capacity to remain tight, but gradually become more available as new fractionators come online over the next few years.
As NGL growth continues at a rapid pace, we believe that over the next couple of years there will be some period oversupplies of ethane as new NGL infrastructure brings additional NGLs to market.  As we approach, and move through the 2015 and 2017 timeframe, we believe supply and demand will remain relatively balanced, as new petrochemical plants and expansions come online.
Now an update on our projects.  First, our Bakken projects are expected to resolve some of the challenges producers are facing in the Williston Basin, in particular, the flaring of NGL rich natural gas.  Our first of three new processing plants in the Bakken; Garden Creek was completed in late December.  The Stateline I plant is expected to be in service in the third quarter of this year with completion of the Stateline II plant following in the first half of 2013.  The Stateline natural gas processing plant projects remain on schedule and on budget.
Oil production in the Bakken continues to grow rapidly, and oil transportation infrastructure continues to be developed to meet producer needs, thus allowing the current pace of drillings to continue.
As you all are aware, drilling economics in the Bakken are primarily driven by crude oil prices and not significantly impacted by the current lower natural gas price environment.  The 500-plus-mile 60,000 barrel per day Bakken NGL pipeline, along with the expansions of the Bushton fractionator and Overland Pass Pipeline are either on schedule or ahead of schedule and on budget.
We have acquired more than 85% of the right away needed for the Bakken NGL pipeline.  Engineering and design continues to move along and steel pipe and many of the required materials have been purchased.
Of special note, the Bushton fractionator expansion is now ahead of our original schedule, and is expected to be completed sometime in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with our original plan to complete it in the first half of 2013.
Let’s turn to our Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast projects.  The expansion of our Mid-Continent to Mont Belvieu NGL distribution pipeline Sterling I is done, adding 15000 barrels per day of additional capacity to ship purity NGL products south to Mont Belvieu.  The construction of 230 miles of NGL gathering pipelines in the Cana-Woodford and Granite Wash is on schedule with completion expected early in the second quarter of 2012 bringing 75,000 to 80,000 barrels per day of raw NGL through our existing system in the Mid-Continent and the Arbuckle Pipeline.
The expansion of Arbuckle to 240,000 barrels per day from 180,000 barrels per day by installing additional pump stations is well underway with incremental barrels already being transported, as Pierce noted, and we expect all the pump stations to be completed and in service also in the second quarter of 2012.
The 570-mile Sterling III pipeline in the 75,000 barrel per day MB II fractionator are progressing as planned.  We have increased our supply commitments for both projects with approximately 75% committed on the 193,000 barrels per day Sterling III, that’s the level of supply commitment we target for this project to achieve its required returns.  All the capacity is committed on our 75,000 barrel per day MB II fractionator.  Our commercial team has done a terrific job securing these supply commitments well before these assets go into service in 2013.
We continue to develop and evaluate a lengthy backlog of natural gas and NGL related infrastructure projects, including investments in processing plants and NGL fractionation and storage facilities.  This backlog totals more than $1 billion and it’s growing.
Some of these investments will create additional redundancy and reliability and approve our connectivity to our petchem customers, while others will provide the critical infrastructure that producers and processors need to get their products to market.
As we’ve done in the past, we will announce the projects, when we have sufficient producer and/or customer commitment to make them economically viable.
John, that concludes my remarks.

Before we take your questions, I’d like to provide you with some context on our 2011 results, our updated 2012 guidance, and our future growth.  While Terry has provided you with a detailed rundown of our $3 billion in growth projects, it’s important to keep in perspective these current projects, and the $2 billion of projects we completed in 2009.
While there has been a lot of current detention on the widening NGL differentials between the Mid-Continent and the Gulf Coast, short-term ethane price softness, and declining natural gas prices, let’s not lose sight of the fact that the assets we’ve built and are building, increase our ability to add volumes to our system, both natural gas and natural gas liquids, and to collect a fee to gather process, fractionate, store, and transport these commodities for producers, processors and customers.
These services provide us and our customers and investors with sustainable long-term value regardless of short-term moves and differentials in prices. It's the incremental earnings from these projects, now in service and now being built that give us the ability to grow our earnings at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners by an average of approximately 20% per year for the next three years, to increase distributions to ONEOK Partner unitholders this year and beyond and to increase the ONEOK dividend 50% by 2014.
While internal growth may not be as exciting or as headline grabbing as an acquisition, internal growth project opportunities provide our investors with far better returns than if we were to buy earnings at today's prices. And we're not done.  As you’ve just heard, our internal growth backlog is in excess of $1 billion and growing, providing us with more earnings growth potential.
In closing, I would like to again thank our employees who work safely, reliably and environmentally responsibly every day to operate our assets, creating exceptional value for our investors and customers.  We never forget that our success as a company depends on the efforts of all of our employees, and I along with the rest of our management team appreciate their efforts.

So we brought it back to where we thought it would average over the year.  And then, as we moved into the winter, and we saw certain things occur it became obvious to us that those dynamics in the marketplace were going to result in $0.12 or $0.10 spread that it was going to be higher.  And so we have subsequently gone back and readjusted not only that spread but also our view on gas prices and NGL prices.
So it’s a matter of better knowledge with time and as the market gives you more transparency and deal with what’s happening.

As it relates to transforming transaction, we obviously haven’t made one, but in my comments and I’ve also talked about the fact that we’ve created more value for our shareholders and our unitholders by the now $5 billion worth of investments and infrastructure both in the gas and the gas liquids business.
As I said we can create more value investing in those projects and we can going out and buying earnings at today’s prices.  So a transforming transaction which I have in the past compared to when we acquired the coke NGL assets, when we acquired the gathering and processing assets from Dynegy and Kinder Morgan.  When we acquired the Bushton plant NGL storage with Kinder Morgan.  Those when we look back, although they may not be significant in size, from a dollar perspective they were significant and they gave us the opportunity to then and invest more money as it relates building that infrastructure.
So we, be clear, are not driven to do a transforming transaction so that we can go to the marketplace to say we’ve done one.  We will continue to invest where we see opportunities to create more value as it relates to the future of ONEOK and what ONEOK might look like; it’s hard to argue with success.  We’ve been successful, we look at opportunities as I indicated to ease, we look for opportunities and other commodities where we think we can apply the same capabilities, we have, we also look as an organization as to where we can increase our capabilities, so that we can move into other market.
It’s all an iterative process that we apply all this -- all these techniques to.  But I can’t tell you, a year from now whether we will have another school.  There has been years where energy services has made $230 million and gathering and processing barely broke-even.  But our commitment is for long-term.  So if we’ve this discussion a year from now, it will be heavily influenced by what we perceive to be reality between now and then.  Did that help you, at all James?

ONEOK's fourth quarter net income increased by 38% compared with the same period last year, driven by the strong performance at ONEOK Partners. For 2011, net income increased 8% versus 2010.  Results in the distribution segment were lower due to higher employee related costs, while energy services had reduced results, due primarily to lower storage, marketing, and transportation margins, resulting from narrower seasonal spreads and natural gas price location differentials. ONEOK's 2011 standalone cash flow, before changes in working capital, exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $213.7 million. In 2011, ONEOK received approximately $333 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners, a 10% increase over 2010. ONEOK's income taxes on the distributions from the ONEOK Partners LP units it owns or deferred contributing to ONEOK's strong cash flow. We also updated guidance for ONEOK in 2012. Net income is expected to be in the range of $360 million to $410 million, compared with its previous range of $355 million to $400 million. The updated guidance reflects higher anticipated earnings in the ONEOK Partner segment, offset partially by lower expected earnings in the energy services segment. In January, ONEOK completed a $700 million public offering of 4.25% senior notes due 2022.  We used the proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our $1.2 billion commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes, providing additional capacity for various options, which may include repurchasing ONEOK common stock under our previously approved share repurchase program, purchase of additional common units of ONEOK Partners, and/or the payment of dividends to shareholders.  Also in January, we declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of $0.61 per share, a 17% increase since January 2011. Since January 2006, the company has increased the dividend 13x representing 118% increase during that period. Subject to Board approval, we also expect to increase the dividend $0.05 per share in July compared with our expectation last September of $0.04 per share.  This increase is consistent with our goal to grow the dividend by 50% by 2014. ONEOK's liquidity position is excellent.  At the end of the fourth quarter on a standalone basis, we had $842 million of commercial paper outstanding, $30.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $347.7 million of natural gas and storage, $356 million available under our new credit facility, and our total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 45%. ONEOK's significant cash flow and outstanding liquidity position continue to give us incredible financial flexibility. Now Pierce will update you on ONEOK's operating performance."

This segments portion of the 31 shares of stock awarded to employees in 2011 was $10 million. 2012 operating income guidance been updated to $223 million, reflecting the recent sale of the retail natural gas marketing business that has now accounted for as discontinued operations. 
Now a brief regulatory update. In Kansas, the Kansas Corporation Commission approved our application to increase the Gas System Reliability Surcharge by an additional $2.9 million effective January 2012. This capital recovery mechanism allows us to recover and to earn a return on safety-related and government mandated capital investments made between rate cases. Kansas Gas Service plans to file a rate case in mid 2012, it's first since 2006. As part of that rate case, we are exploring rate design options that reduce our volumetric sensitivity. Oklahoma Natural Gas will make its annual performance base rates filing on or before March 1.  We expect to request a modest increase in rates to recognize our investment in rate base and increases in operating cost. We continue our efforts to grow our rate base by investing in projects that provide benefits to our customers and our shareholders. In 2011, the distribution segment invested approximately $243 million of capital, including $25 million in automated meter reading devices.  In 2012, we planned to invest approximately $270 million of capital, as in the past this includes pipeline integrity projects, pipeline replacements, extending services to new areas, automated meter reading devices, and increasing the systems delivery capabilities. 
Now let's turn to energy services.  The lower earnings result reflects lower storage and marketing margins, due primarily to lower realized seasonal storage price differentials, and lower transportation margins, due primarily to narrower realized price location differentials, and lower hedge settlements in 2011. Full year 2011 operating income was $24 million. Location differentials are essentially non-existent between several market delivery points. Seasonal differentials remained narrow for 2012, with little or no price volatility but have improved somewhat for 2013.  We've reduced energy services 2012 operating income guidance to 0 as this segment will continue to face extraordinarily challenging market conditions because of the increase in transportation pipeline capacity in recent years, and an oversupply of natural gas from shale plays. We continue to access how much transportation and storage capacity we need to service our premium customers, and look for opportunities to renegotiate transportation and storage rates.  By the end of this year, more than 20% of our leased storage capacity and 15% of our leased transportation capacity will be up for renewal. And by 2015 more than 90% of the storage capacity and 75% of the transport capacity will be up for renewal, providing an opportunity to either renew them at lower market rates or cancel the leases.  These explorations also give us additional opportunities to realign our capacity with customers' needs and rebase our cost structure. We now expect to reduce our target leased storage capacity from 65 Bcf at the end of 2012 to 60 Bcf at 2015, and our leased transportation capacity from 1 Bcf per day at the end of 2012 down to 0.8 Bcf per day by 2015. John, that concludes my remarks for ONEOK."

In the fourth quarter, ONEOK Partners' net income more than doubled compared with the fourth quarter of 2010.  For 2011, net income increased 76% versus 2010. Distributable cash flow increased 89% compared with the fourth quarter last year,",454,"Thanks, John.  In the fourth quarter, ONEOK Partners' net income more than doubled compared with the fourth quarter of 2010.  For 2011, net income increased 76% versus 2010. Distributable cash flow increased 89% compared with the fourth quarter last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 2.26x. For 2011, distributable cash flow increased 61% compared with 2010, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.66x. The higher earnings and resulting higher coverage ratio were primarily due to strong NGL optimization margins from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu. Similar to 2008 when commodity prices were record levels, we do not believe these wider NGL price differentials are sustainable long-term. In 2008, we utilized the incremental cash flow to finance a portion of our $2 billion capital investment program that was completed in 2009, and we plan to utilized a portion of the incremental cash flow likewise in 2012, to help fund our current $3 billion capital growth program, reducing our debt and equity financing needs. At the same time, we are meaningfully increasing distributions to our unitholders.  We increased the distribution $0.015 per unit for the fourth quarter and subject to Board approval, expect to increase it another $0.025 per quarter in 2012, higher than the $0.02 per quarter increase we announced last September. 
With the strong performance of the NGL segment expected to continue in 2012, although at a lower level than we experienced in 2011, we've increased the partnerships' 2012 earnings guidance by almost 10% to a range of $810 million to $870 million, compared with its previous range of $740 million to $800 million. We also estimate the partnerships' 2012 distributable cash flow to be in the range of $925 million to $985 million, compared with its previous range of $845 million to $915 million. We updated our 2012 capital expenditure guidance to $2 billion to reflect our latest forecast. This breaks down to $1.9 billion in growth capital and $109 million in maintenance capital. We have hedges in place to lock-in margins on our expected equity volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, where a portion of our margin is derived from the receipt of commodities.  Our news release contains updated information on these hedges. Our 2012 natural gas hedges have increased to 73% from 42%, while our 2012 NGL hedges have increased to 72% from 43%.  As is our practice, we continually monitor the commodity markets, and will place additional hedges as conditions warrant. At the end of the fourth quarter, the partnership had $35.1 million in cash and no commercial paper or other short-term borrowings, a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 53%, and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9x. Now Pierce will review the partnerships' operating performance."

As John said, the partnership had an exceptional fourth quarter.  Operating income almost doubled compared with the same period last year, driven primarily by higher margins in the natural gas liquid segment from wider NGL price different",878,"Thank you, Rob.  As John said, the partnership had an exceptional fourth quarter.  Operating income almost doubled compared with the same period last year, driven primarily by higher margins in the natural gas liquid segment from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu, and increased fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities. Earnings also increased as a result of higher isomerization margins in the NGL segment, and solid performance in the natural gas gathering and processing segment from higher natural gas volumes processed. While we benefited from these favorable NGL price differentials, and higher NGL and condensate prices, our base business continues to grow. In the fourth quarter, natural gas volumes processed increased, as did NGL volumes gathered, fractionated, and NGL purity projects -- products distributed. More on that in a moment. 
The natural gas gathering and processing segments fourth quarter financial results were higher due primarily to higher natural gas volumes processed, specifically in the Williston Basin and higher net realized NGL and condensate prices.  We decreased this segments operating income guidance for 2012 to $247 million, compared with the $297 million we provided last September to reflect lower commodity price assumptions. In 2012 we expect processed volumes to be up 24% and gathered volumes to be up 15%, both driven by our investments in the Williston Basin, the new Garden Creek plant that went into service in December, and the Stateline I plant that we expect to be in service sometime in the third quarter of this year. The natural gas pipeline segment's fourth quarter results were lower compared with the fourth quarter last year, due to lower transportation margins from narrow regional natural gas price differentials that decreased contracted capacity on Midwestern gas transmission and interruptible volumes across several of our pipelines. For 2011, equity earnings from Northern Border pipeline increased by 12% compared with 2010, as it maintained it's position as a low cost provider in transporting Canadian source supply to markets in the Midwest. Northern Border is substantially contracted for long haul capacity through March 2013 and has been successful capturing 3 year or longer extensions, as current contracts expire. We decreased this segments' 2012 operating income guidance to $135 million, reflecting a lower assumed natural gas price as it relates to our retained fuel position. Almost 90% of the contracted capacity on our wholly owned top-line serve end users directly, such as natural gas distribution companies and electric generators that need the natural gas to operate their businesses regardless of regional price differentials. In spite of narrow price differential environment, this business due to its highly contracted capacity continues to generate stable earnings with 82% of our pipeline capacity and 100% of our storage capacity contracted under firm long-term contracts. 
Our natural gas liquid segment continued to benefit in 2011 from record wide NGL price differentials and having more fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities.  This segment also benefited from higher isomerization margins due to wider price differentials between normal butane and isobutane. Successful contract negotiations, associated with our exchange and storage services activities also helped earnings.  We fractionated 10% more volumes during the fourth quarter 2011 compared with the same period last year, averaging 583,000 barrels per day, which includes volumes fractionated at the target facility from the fractionation services agreement that began during the second quarter in 2011. NGLs transported on our gathering lines were up 17% during the quarter compared with the same period last year, averaging 473,000 barrels per day during the quarter, as a result of increased volumes gathered on the Arbuckle Pipeline and in the Mid-Continent. Arbuckle Pipeline volumes are now reaching more than 200,000 barrels per day. Additional pump stations have been added as a part of the Arbuckle expansion that will increase capacity to 240,000 barrels per day in the early second quarter of 2012.  We significantly increased our 2012 operating income guidance for this segment to reflect the wider NGL price differentials. For 2012, we have updated the Conway to Mont Belvieu ethane price differential to average $0.32 per gallon compared with $0.12 per gallon provided in September.  While the current ethane price differential has softened to levels below $0.32 due to a number of short-term maintenance outages at U.S. Petrochemical plants, we anticipate ethane differentials will increase as the Petchems return to normal operations during the second quarter. Although we only provided expected Conway to Mont Belvieu differentials for ethane in our guidance, our opportunity to capture optimization margins is not solely based on the ethane differential. Our well positioned and vertically integrated assets can also benefit from Conway to Belvieu differentials from the other NGL products such as propane and butane.  Additionally, we are also expecting to utilize less capacity for optimization activities in 2012 compared with 2011, attracting some of the capacity under fee-based long-term agreements with customers. We have a planned maintenance turnaround at our Mont Belvieu fractionator MB I scheduled for May.  During this turnaround, raw NGL volumes that were currently being fractionated at MB I either will be sent to other fractionators, and/or placed in storage. Because of the events planning that goes into the turnaround, we expect this turnaround will not substantially affect our customers' operations. John, that concludes my remarks."

On this morning's conference call, I will briefly review our fourth quarter and year-end 2011 results, provide some perspective on our revised 2012 guidance, and conclude with some comments about our current and future growth. Let's start with ONEOK Partners' fourth quarter and year-end performance. Both the year and the quarter were exceptional. Results were driven by wider NGL differentials as well as higher volumes in our natural gas liquids and our natural gas gathering and processing segments. Our growth projects are on time and on budget and we continue to increase volume commitments for these projects. Our Garden Creek natural gas processing plant in the Williston Basin is operational, allowing producers the ability to capture additional value, while reducing the amount of flaring occurring in the Bakken shale. Our natural gas distribution segment performed well in the quarter and for the full year. Net margins were essentially flat with operating income affected primarily by higher share-based compensation costs. You will recall that we award all full time employees with one share of stock each time the closing price reaches a new $1.00 high. In 2011 we awarded 31 shares of stock at a cost of $16 million. Since the natural gas distribution segment has largest number of employees, and the allocations of this cost are on a per employee basis, it incurred a large portion of that expense. We believe it is a small price to pay for outstanding share price appreciation in 2011. Our energy services segment continues to struggle as a result of challenging market conditions, narrow seasonal and location differentials, low natural gas prices and volatility, moderate weather conditions, and an oversupply of natural gas. While we have lowered our expectations for this business in 2012, we continue to reduce our leased storage and transportation capacity, and operating cost, but the fact remains it's a very challenging market. We also updated our 2012 financial guidance, increasing our earnings expectation at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and raising our dividend and distribution growth forecasts for the year. Rob will provide more detail in a few minutes. Our updated 2012 ONEOK Partners' guidance includes higher natural gas liquids operating income than we originally forecast, $528 million today versus last fall's 2012 forecast of $395 million, but lower than the segment's 2011 actual results. Our updated NGL segment guidance is the result of an expected increase in ethane differentials between the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast, compared with what we assumed in our original 2012 guidance. However, we expect lower NGL optimization margins in 2012, as we continue to convert some capacity to firm fee-based contracts. In 2012, lower expected commodity prices will also impact the partnerships natural gas gathering and processing segment. We expect 2012 GMP segment results to be higher than 2011, but lower than we originally forecast last fall. Rob will now review ONEOK's financial highlights, and then Pierce will review ONEOK's operating performance. Rob?"

ONEOK's fourth quarter net income increased by 38% compared with the same period last year, driven by the strong performance at ONEOK Partners. For 2011, net income increased 8% versus 2010. Results in the distribution segment were lower due to higher employee related costs, while energy services had reduced results, due primarily to lower storage, marketing, and transportation margins, resulting from narrower seasonal spreads and natural gas price location differentials. ONEOK's 2011 standalone cash flow, before changes in working capital, exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $213.7 million. In 2011, ONEOK received approximately $333 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners, a 10% increase over 2010. ONEOK's income taxes on the distributions from the ONEOK Partners LP units it owns or deferred contributing to ONEOK's strong cash flow. We also updated guidance for ONEOK in 2012. Net income is expected to be in the range of $360 million to $410 million, compared with its previous range of $355 million to $400 million. The updated guidance reflects higher anticipated earnings in the ONEOK Partner segment, offset partially by lower expected earnings in the energy services segment. In January, ONEOK completed a $700 million public offering of 4.25% senior notes due 2022. We used the proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our $1.2 billion commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes, providing additional capacity for various options, which may include repurchasing ONEOK common stock under our previously approved share repurchase program, purchase of additional common units of ONEOK Partners, and/or the payment of dividends to shareholders. Also in January, we declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of $0.61 per share, a 17% increase since January 2011. Since January 2006, the company has increased the dividend 13x representing 118% increase during that period. Subject to Board approval, we also expect to increase the dividend $0.05 per share in July compared with our expectation last September of $0.04 per share. This increase is consistent with our goal to grow the dividend by 50% by 2014. ONEOK's liquidity position is excellent. At the end of the fourth quarter on a standalone basis, we had $842 million of commercial paper outstanding, $30.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $347.7 million of natural gas and storage, $356 million available under our new credit facility, and our total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 45%. ONEOK's significant cash flow and outstanding liquidity position continue to give us incredible financial flexibility. Now Pierce will update you on ONEOK's operating performance."

Let's start with our natural gas distribution segment. Fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings were lower compared with the same period last year, because of higher operating cost, primarily the share-based compensation cost discussed on previous conference calls. This segments portion of the 31 shares of stock awarded to employees in 2011 was $10 million. 2012 operating income guidance been updated to $223 million, reflecting the recent sale of the retail natural gas marketing business that has now accounted for as discontinued operations. 
Now a brief regulatory update. In Kansas, the Kansas Corporation Commission approved our application to increase the Gas System Reliability Surcharge by an additional $2.9 million effective January 2012. This capital recovery mechanism allows us to recover and to earn a return on safety-related and government mandated capital investments made between rate cases. Kansas Gas Service plans to file a rate case in mid 2012, its first since 2006. As part of that rate case, we are exploring rate design options that reduce our volumetric sensitivity. Oklahoma Natural Gas will make its annual performance base rates filing on or before March 1. We expect to request a modest increase in rates to recognize our investment in rate base and increases in operating cost. We continue our efforts to grow our rate base by investing in projects that provide benefits to our customers and our shareholders. In 2011, the distribution segment invested approximately $243 million of capital, including $25 million in automated meter reading devices. In 2012, we planned to invest approximately $270 million of capital, as in the past this includes pipeline integrity projects, pipeline replacements, extending services to new areas, automated meter reading devices, and increasing the systems delivery capabilities. 
Now let's turn to energy services. The lower earnings result reflects lower storage and marketing margins, due primarily to lower realized seasonal storage price differentials, and lower transportation margins, due primarily to narrower realized price location differentials, and lower hedge settlements in 2011. Full year 2011 operating income was $24 million. Location differentials are essentially non-existent between several market delivery points. Seasonal differentials remained narrow for 2012, with little or no price volatility but have improved somewhat for 2013. We've reduced energy services 2012 operating income guidance to 0 as this segment will continue to face extraordinarily challenging market conditions because of the increase in transportation pipeline capacity in recent years, and an oversupply of natural gas from shale plays. We continue to access how much transportation and storage capacity we need to service our premium customers, and look for opportunities to renegotiate transportation and storage rates. By the end of this year, more than 20% of our leased storage capacity and 15% of our leased transportation capacity will be up for renewal. And by 2015 more than 90% of the storage capacity and 75% of the transport capacity will be up for renewal, providing an opportunity to either renew them at lower market rates or cancel the leases. These explorations also give us additional opportunities to realign our capacity with customers' needs and rebase our cost structure. We now expect to reduce our target leased storage capacity from 65 Bcf at the end of 2012 to 60 Bcf at 2015, and our leased transportation capacity from 1 Bcf per day at the end of 2012 down to 0.8 Bcf per day by 2015. John, that concludes my remarks for ONEOK."

In the fourth quarter, ONEOK Partners' net income more than doubled compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. For 2011, net income increased 76% versus 2010.

In the fourth quarter, ONEOK Partners' net income more than doubled compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. For 2011, net income increased 76% versus 2010. Distributable cash flow increased 89% compared with the fourth quarter last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 2.26x. For 2011, distributable cash flow increased 61% compared with 2010, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.66x. The higher earnings and resulting higher coverage ratio were primarily due to strong NGL optimization margins from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu. Similar to 2008 when commodity prices were record levels, we do not believe these wider NGL price differentials are sustainable long-term. In 2008, we utilized the incremental cash flow to finance a portion of our $2 billion capital investment program that was completed in 2009, and we plan to utilize a portion of the incremental cash flow likewise in 2012, to help fund our current $3 billion capital growth program, reducing our debt and equity financing needs. At the same time, we are meaningfully increasing distributions to our unitholders. We increased the distribution $0.015 per unit for the fourth quarter and subject to Board approval, expect to increase it another $0.025 per quarter in 2012, higher than the $0.02 per quarter increase we announced last September. 
With the strong performance of the NGL segment expected to continue in 2012, although at a lower level than we experienced in 2011, we've increased the partnerships' 2012 earnings guidance by almost 10% to a range of $810 million to $870 million, compared with its previous range of $740 million to $800 million. We also estimate the partnerships' 2012 distributable cash flow to be in the range of $925 million to $985 million, compared with its previous range of $845 million to $915 million. We updated our 2012 capital expenditure guidance to $2 billion to reflect our latest forecast. This breaks down to $1.9 billion in growth capital and $109 million in maintenance capital. We have hedges in place to lock-in margins on our expected equity volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, where a portion of our margin is derived from the receipt of commodities. Our news release contains updated information on these hedges. Our 2012 natural gas hedges have increased to 73% from 42%, while our 2012 NGL hedges have increased to 72% from 43%. As is our practice, we continually monitor the commodity markets, and will place additional hedges as conditions warrant. At the end of the fourth quarter, the partnership had $35.1 million in cash and no commercial paper or other short-term borrowings, a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 53%, and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9x. Now Pierce will review the partnerships' operating performance."

As John said, the partnership had an exceptional fourth quarter. Operating income almost doubled compared with the same period last year, driven primarily by higher margins in the natural gas liquid segment from wider NGL price differentia",878,"Thank you, Rob. As John said, the partnership had an exceptional fourth quarter. Operating income almost doubled compared with the same period last year, driven primarily by higher margins in the natural gas liquid segment from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu, and increased fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities. Earnings also increased as a result of higher isomerization margins in the NGL segment, and solid performance in the natural gas gathering and processing segment from higher natural gas volumes processed. While we benefited from these favorable NGL price differentials, and higher NGL and condensate prices, our base business continues to grow. In the fourth quarter, natural gas volumes processed increased, as did NGL volumes gathered, fractionated, and NGL purity projects -- products distributed. More on that in a moment. 
The natural gas gathering and processing segments fourth quarter financial results were higher due primarily to higher natural gas volumes processed, specifically in the Williston Basin and higher net realized NGL and condensate prices. We decreased this segment’s operating income guidance for 2012 to $247 million, compared with the $297 million we provided last September to reflect lower commodity price assumptions. In 2012 we expect processed volumes to be up 24% and gathered volumes to be up 15%, both driven by our investments in the Williston Basin, the new Garden Creek plant that went into service in December, and the Stateline I plant that we expect to be in service sometime in the third quarter of this year. The natural gas pipeline segment's fourth quarter results were lower compared with the fourth quarter last year, due to lower transportation margins from narrow regional natural gas price differentials that decreased contracted capacity on Midwestern gas transmission and interruptible volumes across several of our pipelines. For 2011, equity earnings from Northern Border pipeline increased by 12% compared with 2010, as it maintained its position as a low cost provider in transporting Canadian source supply to markets in the Midwest. Northern Border is substantially contracted for long haul capacity through March 2013 and has been successful capturing 3 year or longer extensions, as current contracts expire. We decreased this segments' 2012 operating income guidance to $135 million, reflecting a lower assumed natural gas price as it relates to our retained fuel position. Almost 90% of the contracted capacity on our wholly owned top-line serve end users directly, such as natural gas distribution companies and electric generators that need the natural gas to operate their businesses regardless of regional price differentials. In spite of narrow price differential environment, this business due to its highly contracted capacity continues to generate stable earnings with 82% of our pipeline capacity and 100% of our storage capacity contracted under firm long-term contracts. 
Our natural gas liquid segment continued to benefit in 2011 from record wide NGL price differentials and having more fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities. This segment also benefited from higher isomerization margins due to wider price differentials between normal butane and isobutane. Successful contract negotiations, associated with our exchange and storage services activities also helped earnings. We fractionated 10% more volumes during the fourth quarter 2011 compared with the same period last year, averaging 583,000 barrels per day, which includes volumes fractionated at the target facility from the fractionation services agreement that began during the second quarter in 2011. NGLs transported on our gathering lines were up 17% during the quarter compared with the same period last year, averaging 473,000 barrels per day during the quarter, as a result of increased volumes gathered on the Arbuckle Pipeline and in the Mid-Continent. Arbuckle Pipeline volumes are now reaching more than 200,000 barrels per day. Additional pump stations have been added as a part of the Arbuckle expansion that will increase capacity to 240,000 barrels per day in the early second quarter of 2012. We significantly increased our 2012 operating income guidance for this segment to reflect the wider NGL price differentials. For 2012, we have updated the Conway to Mont Belvieu ethane price differential to average $0.32 per gallon compared with $0.12 per gallon provided in September. While the current ethane price differential has softened to levels below $0.32 due to a number of short-term maintenance outages at U.S. Petrochemical plants, we anticipate ethane differentials will increase as the Petchems return to normal operations during the second quarter. Although we only provided expected Conway to Mont Belvieu differentials for ethane in our guidance, our opportunity to capture optimization margins is not solely based on the ethane differential. Our well positioned and vertically integrated assets can also benefit from Conway to Belvieu differentials from the other NGL products such as propane and butane. Additionally, we are also expecting to utilize less capacity for optimization activities in 2012 compared with 2011, attracting some of the capacity under fee-based long-term agreements with customers. We have a planned maintenance turnaround at our Mont Belvieu fractionator MB I scheduled for May. During this turnaround, raw NGL volumes that were currently being fractionated at MB I either will be sent to other fractionators, and/or placed in storage. Because of the events planning that goes into the turnaround, we expect this turnaround will not substantially affect our customers' operations. John, that concludes my remarks."

This morning I will discuss our outlook of the NGL markets and close with a status report on our growth projects. On the demand side, the petrochemical industry continues to find ways to consume more ethane, due to",1039,"Thanks John, and good morning everyone. This morning I will discuss our outlook of the NGL markets and close with a status report on our growth projects. On the demand side, the petrochemical industry continues to find ways to consume more ethane, due to its strong price advantage versus oil based feedstocks. In the short-term, several petrochemical facilities are currently conducting maintenance turnarounds, reducing the immediate need for ethane which is primarily responsible for the current lower ethane prices in the Mont Belvieu market. We also understand that several of these petchems are in turnarounds to also increase their ethane cracking capabilities. In addition, the price weakness is exacerbated by the petchems that are down for maintenance, filling [ph] ethane into the market. The lower natural gas price environment also puts downward pressure on ethane prices. There has been some concern about the impact of lower natural gas prices on our businesses. On the supply side, rigs are continuing to move away from dry gas regions and producers are focusing specifically on crude oil and liquids rich plays such as the Bakken, Cana-Woodford, Woodford, Granite Wash, Niobrara, Mississippi and Lime, and the Eagle Ford Shale. Fortunately for us, our assets are well positioned in all but one of these areas. From what we have seen in drilling schedules we have been provided we do not expect any material impact on volumes that supply our plants or systems that serve these liquid rich regions. With oil prices showing little signs of pulling back, the weaker natural gas prices help to maintain or further widen the ethane to crude ratio improving the U.S. petrochems industries' competitive position globally, and increasing demand for more NGL feedstock, which benefits our NGL business. Once these planned turnarounds are completed in the next few months, demand from the petchems for ethane and the price of ethane should strengthen, particularly in Mont Belvieu. Some experts are projecting ethane demand will reach new record highs later this year and will continue to grow over the long-term, especially with the announcements of petrochemical plant restarts, expansions, and development of new world class petrochemical plants. As a consequence, we expect NGL fractionation capacity to remain tight, but gradually become more available as new fractionators come online over the next few years. As NGL growth continues at a rapid pace, we believe that over the next couple of years there will be some periodic oversupplies of ethane as new NGL infrastructure brings additional NGLs to market. As we approach and move through the 2015 and 2017 timeframe, we believe supply and demand will remain relatively balanced, as new petrochemical plants and expansions come online. 
Now an update on our projects. First, our Bakken projects are expected to resolve some of the challenges producers are facing in the Williston Basin, in particular the flaring of NGL rich natural gas. Our first of 3 new processing plants in the Bakken; Garden Creek was completed in late December. The Stateline I plant is expected to be in service in the third quarter of this year with completion of the Stateline II plant following in the first half of 2013. The Stateline natural gas processing plant projects remain on schedule and on budget. Oil production in the Bakken continues to grow rapidly, and oil transportation infrastructure continues to be developed to meet producer needs thus allowing the current pace of drilling to continue. As you all are aware, drilling economics in the Bakken are primarily driven by crude oil prices and not significantly impacted by the current low natural gas price environment. The 500-plus-mile 60,000 barrel per day Bakken NGL pipeline, along with the expansions of the Bushton fractionator and Overland Pass Pipeline are either on schedule or ahead of schedule and on budget. We have acquired more than 85% of the right away needed for the Bakken NGL pipeline. Engineering and design continues to move along and steel pipe and many of the required materials have been purchased. Of special note, the Bushton fractionator expansion is now ahead of our original schedule, and is expected to be completed sometime in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with our original plan to complete it in the first half of 2013. 
Let's turn to our Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast projects. The expansion of our Mid-Continent to Mont Belvieu NGL distribution pipeline, Sterling I is done, adding 15,000 barrels per day of additional capacity to ship purity NGL products south to Mont Belvieu. The construction of 230 miles of NGL gathering pipelines in the Cana-Woodford and Granite Wash is on schedule with completion expected early in the second quarter of 2012, bringing 75,000 to 80,000 barrels per day of raw NGL through our existing system in the Mid-Continent and the Arbuckle Pipeline. The expansion of Arbuckle to 240,000 barrels per day from 180,000 barrels per day by installing additional pump stations is well underway with incremental barrels already being transported, as Pierce noted, and we expect all the pump stations to be completed and in service also in the second quarter of 2012. The 570-mile Sterling III pipeline in the 75,000 barrel per day MB II fractionator are progressing as planned. We have increased our supply commitments for both projects with approximately 75% committed on the 193,000 barrel per day Sterling III, that's the level of supply commitment we target for this project to achieve its required returns. All the capacity is committed on our 75,000 barrel per day MB II fractionator. Our commercial team has done a terrific job securing these supply commitments well before these assets go into service in 2013. 
We continue to develop and evaluate a lengthy backlog of natural gas and NGL related infrastructure projects, including investments in processing plants and NGL fractionation and storage facilities. This backlog totals more than $1 billion and it's growing. Some of these investments will create additional redundancy and reliability and improve our connectivity to our petchem customers, while others will provide the critical infrastructure that producers and processors need to get their products to market. As we've done in the past, we will announce the projects when we have sufficient producer and/or customer commitments to make them economically viable. John, that concludes my remarks."

Before we take your questions, I'd like to provide you with some context on our 2011 results, our updated 2012 guidance, and our future growth. While Terry has provided you with a detailed rundown of our $3 billion in growth projects, it's important to keep in perspective these current projects and the $2 billion of projects we completed in 2009. While there has been a lot of current detention on the widening NGL differentials between the Mid-Continent and the Gulf Coast, short-term ethane price softness, and declining natural gas prices, let's not lose sight of the fact that the assets we've built and are building, increase our ability to add volumes to our system, both natural gas and natural gas liquids, and to collect a fee to gather, process, fractionate, store, and transport these commodities for producers, processors and customers. These services provide us and our customers and investors with sustainable long-term value, regardless of short-term moves and differentials in prices. It's the incremental earnings from these projects, now in service and now being built that give us the ability to grow our earnings at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners by an average of approximately 20% per year for the next 3 years, to increase distributions to ONEOK Partners' unitholders this year and beyond and to increase the ONEOK dividend 50% by 2014. While internal growth may not be as exciting or as headline grabbing as an acquisition, internal growth project opportunities provide our investors with far better returns than if we were to buy earnings at today's prices. And we're not done. As you've just heard, our internal growth backlog is in excess of $1 billion and growing, providing us with more earnings growth potential. In closing, I would like to again thank our employees who work safely, reliably and environmentally responsibly every day to operate our assets, creating exceptional value for our investors and customers. We never forget that our success as a company depends on the efforts of all of our employees, and I, along with the rest of our management team, appreciate their efforts.

So we brought it back to where we thought it would average over the year. And then as we moved into the winter, and we saw certain things occur it became obvious to us that those dynamics in the marketplace were going to result in a $0.12 or $0.10 spread that it was going to be higher.

As it relates to transforming transaction, we obviously haven't made one, but in my comments and I've also talked about the fact that we've created more value for our shareholders and our unitholders by the now $5 billion worth of investments and infrastructure both in the gas and the gas liquids business. As I said we can create more value investing in those projects than we can going out and buying earnings at today's prices. So a transforming transaction which I have in the past compared to when we acquired the coke NGL assets, when we acquired the gathering and processing assets from Dynegy and Kinder Morgan. When we acquired the Bushton plant NGL storage with Kinder Morgan. Those when we look back, although they may not be significant in size, from a dollar perspective they were significant and they gave us the opportunity to then invest more money as it relates building that infrastructure. So we, be clear, are not driven to do a transforming transaction so that we can go to the marketplace to say we've done one. We will continue to invest where we see opportunities to create more value as it relates to the future of ONEOK and what ONEOK might look like, it's hard to argue with success. We've been successful, we look at opportunities as I indicated to Yves, we look for opportunities and other commodities where we think we can apply the same capabilities we have, we also look as an organization as to where we can increase our capabilities, so that we can move into other markets. It's all an iterative [ph] process that we apply all this -- all these techniques to. But I can't tell you a year from now whether we will have another stool. There has been years where energy services has made $230 million and gathering and processing barely broke even. But our commitment is for long-term.

And it's always a balance trying to target that coverage ratio that we've talked about before in the $105 million to $115 million but be prudent with regards to long-term trends and where we see the business performing. So we felt that it was appropriate adjustment to reflect the increase in the partnership and yet at the same time be mindful that as the comments that have been made today that that long-term view on the optimization spread is not sustainable between Conway and Mont Belvieu and thus be able to use that cash flow appropriately to partially fund our growth projects."

We always appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Joining me this morning are Rob Martinovich, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our quarterly financial performance and update our three-year growth forecast; Pierce Norton, our Chief Operating Officer, who will review the operating performance of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and update you on the partnership’s growth projects; and Terry Spencer, our President, who will discuss our NGL supply and demand outlook, followed by an update on our new Bakken Crude Express Pipeline.
On this morning’s call, I will briefly review our first quarter results, discuss our rationale for building the crude oil pipeline out of the Bakken and then conclude with some perspective on our updated three-year growth forecast.
Let’s start with our first quarter performance. Again, ONEOK Partners turned in an exceptionally strong performance, while our Natural Gas Distribution segment turned in slightly lower results, and our Energy Services segment reported a loss because of the continued decline in natural gas prices. Pierce will provide more detail on each segment’s operating performance in just a few minutes. We remain confident with our 2012 earnings guidance ranges for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Although it’s still early in the year, we expect the continued strong performance at the partnership to offset the weaker performance at Energy Services.
Now, a few comments about our Bakken Crude Express Pipeline. Building this crude oil line is consistent with our vision statement, which includes applying our core capabilities of gathering, processing, fractionating, storing, marketing and distributing the natural gas, natural gas liquids, and other energy commodities. Our physical presence in the Bakken provides us a unique opportunity to apply our capabilities to crude oil. It’s very similar to what we did when we entered the NGL business more than a decade ago.
Whenever we evaluate opportunities, whether they’re capital projects or new business ventures, we answer three questions. First, how does the opportunity fit with our vision? Second, what is our competitive advantage? And finally, are we creating value for others besides ourselves? In this case, the opportunity fits our vision very well. We believe our unique knowledge of the Bakken, the presence of our existing assets, our relationships with producers and our strong commercial, construction and operating capabilities represent a competitive advantage that will create value, not only for investors, but also for producers and refiners.
For producers, this new pipeline provides a reliable mode of transportation at a lower cost versus other alternatives. It allows them to increase their net backs and receive the benefits of their high-quality crude oil. Demand for light, sweet crude has never been greater. Despite improved technology to refine heavier, sour crudes, light sweet crude is still refiners’ preferred feedstock.
This new platform also is a - excuse me, this new pipeline also is a platform for future growth, creating additional opportunities to provide services to producers and refiners. As Terry will discuss later, we are well on our way to securing the supply commitments to make this pipeline economically viable. Consistent with our past practice, we only announce projects in which we have a high degree of confidence that we can secure producer commitment.
Rob will now review ONEOK’s financial highlights, and then Pierce will review ONEOK’s operating performance. Rob?

ONEOK’s first quarter net income was $122.9 million compared with $130.9 million for the same period last year, due mostly to losses in the Energy Services segment as a result of the continued decline in natural gas prices.
This quarter included a non-recurring, non-cash $10.3 million or $8.5 million after-tax goodwill impairment charge that reduced Energy Services’ goodwill balance to zero, and a required $29.9 million non-cash reclassification of deferred losses to earnings on certain financial contracts related to our Storage business. This loss is similar to an LCM, or lower of cost or market charge on inventory that you may be familiar with. However, this charge relates to losses on purchase hedge contracts rather than on physical inventory. We still have gains that will be recognized in earnings during the 2012, 2013 heating season.
In February 2012, we sold ONEOK Energy Marketing Company, a natural gas retail marketing business, to Constellation Energy Group. We received net proceeds of approximately $32 million and recognized an after-tax gain on the sale of approximately $13.3 million. During the quarter, ONEOK invested approximately $460 million to acquire an additional 8 million common units from ONEOK Partners in a private placement transaction. ONEOK also contributed approximately $19 million to maintain its 2% general partner interest, demonstrating our bullish view on ONEOK Partners’ future growth.
ONEOK’s first quarter 2012 stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $69.2 million. As the general partner and significant limited partner owner, ONEOK will receive $107 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners for the first quarter, a 32% increase from the same period last year.
We also reaffirmed our 2012 guidance with net income expected to be in the range of $360 million to $410 million. The continued strong performance at ONEOK Partners, especially from its natural gas liquids business, should offset the lower results from Energy Services. We expect ONEOK’s net income to grow approximately 18% annually from our 2012 guidance through 2014, as incremental earnings from the growth at ONEOK Partners flow to ONEOK.
In April, we declared a dividend of $0.61 per share, unchanged from the previous quarter. Subject to board approval, we expect to increase the dividend $0.05 per share in July. We also expect the dividend to grow by approximately 40% between 2012 and 2014, following an 18% increase from 2011.
ONEOK’s liquidity position is good. At the end of the first quarter, on a stand-alone basis, we had $419.8 million of commercial paper outstanding, $34.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, $188.5 million of natural gas in storage, $778.2 million available under our $1.2 billion credit facility, and our total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 49%. ONEOK’s significant cash flow and outstanding liquidity position continue to give us incredible financial flexibility.
Since ONEOK Partners announced the Bakken Crude Express Pipeline, we’ve been asked if this project changes our uses or preferences of ONEOK’s free cash flow. The short answer is no. ONEOK remains committed to providing sustainable value to our shareholders and solidifying our position as an attractive investment, whether it’s by increasing our dividend, repurchasing ONEOK stock and/or purchasing additional units of ONEOK Partners. We have used all of these options, and don’t view them as mutually exclusive, and are fortunate to have the financial capability to do one or more under favorable conditions.
Now, Pierce will update you on ONEOK’s operating performance.

Let’s start with our Natural Gas Distribution segment. First quarter 2012 earnings were slightly lower because of higher depreciation expense primarily related to the installation of automated meter reading devices last year. The warmer weather reduced some of the commercial customer transportation demand that is not subject to weather normalization. But these decreases were partially offset by higher rates in Texas as a result of regulatory activity.
Now, a brief regulatory update; Kansas Gas Service plans to file a rate case this month that will include rate design options, further reducing our volumetric sensitivity in this area. In March 2012, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed a performance-based rate change application seeking to increase base rates by $16.2 million, resetting our regulated return on equity to 10.25%, which is slightly below the current approved 10.5%. A hearing with the commission is set for the end of June.
Now, a brief business overview of Energy Services. As we have said on previous earnings calls, we are aligning or right-sizing the transportation and storage capacity to serve our premium services customers, which means we are turning back or renegotiating transportation and storage rates. By 2015, approximately 90% of the storage capacity and more than 75% of the transport capacity will expire, providing an opportunity to either renew them at lower rates or cancel the leases.
For example, we did not renew 35 million cubic feet per day of transportation capacity that expired in the first quarter and an additional 46 million cubic feet per day that expired on April 1. We do not plan to renew another 60 million cubic feet per day that will expire in the fourth quarter of this year. We began this year at just over 1.1 billion cubic feet per day of transportation capacity, and we’ll exit the year at around 0.97 billion cubic feet per day. As disclosed in our last analyst call, we still expect to reduce our targeted leased transportation capacity down to 0.8 billion cubic feet per day and our lease storage capacity to 60 billion cubic feet by 2015. John, that concludes my remarks for ONEOK.

In the first quarter, ONEOK Partners’ net income increased 58% compared with the first quarter of 2011. ONEOK Partners reported net income of $238.8 million or $0.91 per unit compared with last year’s first quarter net income of $150.9 million or $0.58 per unit. Distributable cash flow increased 51% compared with the first quarter last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.74 times.
The higher earnings and resulting higher coverage ratio were primarily due to strong NGL optimization margins, increased NGL volumes transported and fractionated and increased natural gas gathering and processing volumes from the growth in the Williston Basin, including the startup of the Garden Creek plant in late December.
In 2008, when commodity prices were at record levels, we used the incremental cash flow to finance a portion of our $2 billion capital investment program that was completed in 2009, and we plan to use a portion of the incremental cash flow likewise in 2012 to help fund our more than $5 billion capital growth program, reducing our debt and equity financing needs.
At the same time, we are increasing distributions to our unitholders in a meaningful way. We increased the distribution $0.025 per unit for the first quarter, and subject to board approval, expect to increase it another $0.025 per unit per quarter in 2012. We still expect to increase our distribution by an average of 15% to 20% annually in 2013 and 2014.
In March, we completed a public offering of 8 million common units and a private placement with ONEOK of 8 million common units, which generated total proceeds of approximately $920 million, providing significant capacity for our capital expenditures program. We also repaid $350 million of senior notes at maturity in April. With the strong performance of the NGL segment expected to continue through 2012, we’ve reaffirmed and expect to be at the high end of the partnership’s 2012 earnings guidance net income range of $810 million to $870 million and its distributable cash flow range of $925 million to $985 million.
We expect ONEOK Partners’ EBITDA to grow approximately 20% annually from our 2012 guidance through 2014, as our growth projects go into service. We also reaffirmed our 2012 capital expenditure guidance of $2 billion, approximately $1.9 billion in growth capital and $109 million in maintenance capital.
We continue to actively hedge to lock in margins on our expected equity volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment. Our 2012 natural gas hedges are 78%, while our 2012 NGL hedges are 72%. The news release also provides hedging information for 2013.
At the end of the first quarter, the partnership had $746.7 million in cash and no commercial paper or other short-term borrowings, a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 46% and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.6 times.
Now, Pierce will review the partnership’s operating performance.

As John said, the partnership had a strong first quarter. Operating income increased 44%, driven primarily by higher margins in the Natural Gas Liquids segment from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu, an increased fractionation in transportation capacity available for these optimization activities. Earnings also increased as a result of higher volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, specifically in the Williston Basin from the startup of the new Garden Creek plant that went into service in late December.
The natural gas gathering and processing segment’s first quarter financial results were higher due primarily to higher natural gas volumes gathered and processed in the Williston Basin and Western Oklahoma, offset partially by lower natural gas and NGL product prices on our unhedged portion of these commodities, primarily ethane and propane.
The Garden Creek plant is already processing over 90 million cubic feet per day, less than four months after going into service with full capacity expected in the very near future. Operationally, the plant has exceeded our expectations, and we continue on a record-setting pace for new well connections.
The natural gas pipelines segment’s first quarter results were lower, due primarily to the impact of lower realized natural gas prices on our retained fuel position. Equity earnings from Northern Border Pipeline were relatively unchanged, as the pipeline maintained its position as a low cost provider to transport Canadian supply to Midwest markets. Northern Border is substantially contracted through March 2013, and has been successful in capturing three year or longer extensions as current contracts expire.
Our Natural Gas Liquids segment continued to benefit from wider NGL differentials and more capacity available for optimization activities. The segment also benefited from higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated. We fractionated 18% more volume during the first quarter 2012, averaging 585,000 barrels per day, including the volumes fractionated at the Targa facility under our agreement that began during the second quarter of last year.
NGLs transported on our gathering lines were up 25%, averaging 498,000 barrels per day during the quarter as a result of increased NGL volumes gathered on the Arbuckle Pipeline into the Mid-Continent. We still expect the Conway to Mont Belvieu ethane price differential to average $0.32 per gallon this year. While the ethane differential was $0.24 in the first quarter, we anticipate ethane differentials for the remainder of the year to increase to sufficient levels to support our average ethane guidance differential of $0.32 per gallon, as petchems ramp up demand following their maintenance turnarounds where additional capacity was added.
We have started our planned maintenance turnaround on our Mont Belvieu fractionator MB-1 and expect it to last until the end of May. During this turnaround, raw NGL volumes that were being fractionated at MB-1 either will be sent to other fractionators and/or placed in storage. Because of the advanced planning that goes on in a turnaround, we expect this turnaround will not substantially affect our customers’ operations and it’s factored into our earnings guidance.
Now a quick update on our new projects. First, the Stateline I plant is expected to be in service in the third quarter of this year, with completion of the Stateline II plant in the first half of 2013. Last month, we announced the Divide County project in the Bakken Shale that includes 270 miles of natural gas gathering system and related infrastructure that will gather natural gas in the Bakken and deliver and practically fill the remaining capacity at Stateline II.
We continue to see significant increases in drilling rig counts within our core areas in Western Oklahoma, in the NGL-rich Cana-Woodford Shale. As a result, we will construct a new 200 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing facility, the Canadian Valley Plant, and related infrastructure. The contracts are percent of proceeds with an additional fee component, and we have significant acreage dedications in most active development areas in the Cana-Woodford Shale. Terry will discuss the new Bakken Crude Express line in a moment.
The 500-mile plus 60,000 barrel per day Bakken NGL pipeline, along with the expansions of the Bushton Fractionator and Overland Pass Pipeline are either on or ahead of schedule and on budget. We’ve acquired more than 90% of the right-of-way needed for the Bakken NGL Pipeline. We’ve purchased and started taking delivery of the steel pipe. Construction is set to start in late May or early June.
Let’s turn to our Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast projects look. The Arbuckle Pipeline expansion was completed in April, with gathering volumes already approaching its expanded capacity of 240,000 barrels per day. In addition, our 230-mile Mid-Continent NGL gathering system expansion in the Cana-Woodford and Granite Wash was also completed in April. This project connected our NGL gathering system to three new and three existing third-party natural gas processing facilities, and is expected to add 75,000 to 80,000 barrels per day of raw NGLs into our NGL system.
The Sterling III Pipeline and MB-2 fractionator are progressing as planned. We have approximately 75% of the capacity committed on the 193,000 barrel per day Sterling III, which is the level of supply commitment we targeted for this project to achieve its required returns. All the capacity is committed on our 75,000 barrel per day MB-2 fractionator. Our commercial team has done a terrific job securing these supply commitments well before the assets go into service in 2013.
We continue to develop and evaluate a lengthy backlog of natural gas and NGL-related infrastructure projects, including investments in processing plants, natural gas pipelines, NGL fractionation and storage facilities. This backlog totals substantially more than 2 billion and it’s growing.
Some of these investments will free additional redundancy and reliability and improve our connectivity to our petchem customers while others will provide the critical infrastructure that producers, processors need to get their products to market. As we have done in the past, we will announce the projects when we have sufficient producer and/or customer commitments to make them economically viable.
John, that concludes my remarks.

This morning I’ll provide a brief outlook of the NGL markets and close with some additional color on our recently announced Bakken Crude Express Pipeline. On the NGL demand side, the petrochemical industry conti",960,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. This morning I’ll provide a brief outlook of the NGL markets and close with some additional color on our recently announced Bakken Crude Express Pipeline. On the NGL demand side, the petrochemical industry continues to take advantage of using ethane as its feedstock due to its strong price advantage versus oil-based feedstocks.
In the short term, several petrochemical facilities are currently conducting maintenance turnarounds reducing the immediate need for ethane. We also understand that several of these petchems are in turnarounds to increase their ethane fracing capabilities by a total of approximately 100,000 barrels per day. Dow also recently announced a world-scale ethylene cracker in the Gulf Coast to be completed in 2017, adding another estimated 100,000 barrels per day of ethane demand.
Once these planned turnarounds are completed over the next few months, demand from the petchems for ethane and the price of ethane should strengthen, particularly in Mont Belvieu. Some experts are projecting ethane demand will reach new record highs later this year and will continue to grow over the long term, especially with the petrochemical plant restarts, expansions and new facilities. As a consequence, we expect NGL fractionation capacity to remain tight, but only gradually ease as new fractionators come online over the next few years.
On the supply side, as you know, rigs have moved away from dry gas regions and producers are focusing especially on crude oil and liquids-rich plays, such as the Bakken, Cana-Woodford, Woodford, Granite Wash, Niobrara, Mississippian Lime and the Eagle Ford Shales. Fortunately, for us, our assets are well positioned in all but one of these areas. As NGL growth continues at a rapid pace, we believe that over the next couple of years, there will be some periodic over-supplies of ethane as new NGL production and infrastructure brings additional NGLs to market. As we approach and move through the 2015 and 2017 timeframe, we believe there will be sufficient demand for NGLs, as new petrochemical expansions come online, as well as from growing Gulf Coast export activity.
Last month, we announced plans to build 1,300-mile Bakken Crude Express Pipeline, enabling us to serve the rapid crude oil supply growth in the Bakken Shale in the Williston Basin. Producers continue to aggressively drill in the Williston Basin, with current crude oil production in North Dakota exceeding 0.5 million barrels per day with over 200 active rigs. By comparison, in January 2011, crude oil production was approximately 340,000 barrels per day, and there were 150 active rigs.
With crude oil production expected to increase to well over 1 million barrels per day within the next five years, additional crude oil take-away capacity is required. A pipeline compared with rail or truck is the most efficient and reliable method of transporting crude oil to the marketplace, especially in the Williston Basin, where the weather is harsh and very unpredictable. More than 80% of our pipeline is designed to parallel our existing and soon-to-be-built NGL pipelines, including the Bakken NGL pipeline, that will begin construction very soon.
We will still need to acquire right-of-way for the pipeline, but knowing the geography and regulatory landscape provides us a significant advantage in estimating construction costs and understanding permitting and other regulatory requirements. Additionally, the pipeline will primarily serve those producers of light, low sulfur crude oil originating from the Bakken, as well as production from the Niobrara and in Kansas.
New connections to consuming markets along the route, particularly in Kansas, are also being considered in addition to the Cushing market center. At the moment, we are in various stages of negotiations with almost 30 producers who represent nearly all of the 0.5 million barrels per day of Williston Basin crude oil production, many of which we already have relationships with for their natural gas and NGLs. They have expressed strong interest in our pipeline because of their expected crude oil production is ramping up at an even faster pace than recent years.
Based upon current producer interest, we expect to have all of the pipeline’s capacity committed within the next couple of months. However, we do plan on having an open-season process in the late summer, early fall of this year. Based on our latest estimates, we expect to generate EBITDA multiples of 5 to 7 times, a similar return from our previously announced projects. For obvious competitive reasons, we are not disclosing the proposed tariff at this time, however, it will be more competitive and cheaper than rail, with producers able to lock in rates for a longer term compared with the contract for rail capacities.
Many have asked if the partnership will need to own storage in Cushing to make this project viable. Several storage and terminal operators have contacted us about having our pipelines connected to their storage facilities. Cushing remains a key market center for crude oil due to its massive storage position, expanding capability and extensive connectivity, and several companies are building additional storage capacity to handle the incremental barrels from the Bakken and other producing regions.
While the crude oil market is well served, this fact does not preclude us from further participating in crude oil-related opportunities within the value chain to serve our customers, just like we have in the natural gas and especially the NGL business. Our company has the commercial construction and operational expertise to execute this project with an experienced team of individuals who have constructed and operated crude oil systems before. With a history of successfully building and operating long-haul liquids transportation pipelines across the country, our capabilities in developing and operating NGL pipelines will serve us well, as we move into crude oil. We are well-prepared to execute on this important project.
John, that concludes my remarks.

Before we take your questions, I’d like to provide some additional context to our long-term growth forecast that Rob mentioned earlier. While growth in the Bakken and the Mid-Continent will create more commodity price exposure in our gathering and processing segment and our Mid-Continent NGL assets both current and future create opportunities to capture price differentials.
Our projected earnings growth by 2014 is driven primarily by volume growth, not by higher projected commodity prices or wider differentials. If our assets or contracts allow us to capture upside, we will certainly do so, but it is not factored into our three year plan. As I’ve said before, we are not in the business to predict commodity prices or play the spread. We are in the business to provide value-added fee-based services to our producers, processors and other customers.
In closing, I’d like to again thank our 4,800 employees who operate our assets safely, reliably and environmentally responsibly every day, creating the exceptional value for our investors and our customers. Our success as a company depends on their contributions, and our entire management team appreciates their efforts.
Operator, we’re now ready to take your questions.

And so we are using some of that cash flow to pre-fund our capital projects. We did have the equity project offering in March, a year ago in January we had $1.3 billion of debt.

We always appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Joining me this morning are Rob Martinovich, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our quarterly financial performance and update our 3-year growth forecast; Pierce Norton, our Chief Operating Officer, who will review the operating performance of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and update you on the partnership’s growth projects; and Terry Spencer, our President, who will discuss our NGL supply and demand outlook, followed by an update on our new Bakken Crude Express Pipeline.
On this morning’s call, I will briefly review our first quarter results, discuss our rationale for building the crude oil pipeline out of the Bakken, and then conclude with some perspective on our updated 3-year growth forecast.
Let’s start with our first quarter performance. Again, ONEOK Partners turned in an exceptionally strong performance, while our Natural Gas Distribution segment turned in slightly lower results, and our Energy Services segment reported a loss because of the continued decline in natural gas prices. Pierce will provide more detail on each segment’s operating performance in just a few minutes. We remain confident with our 2012 earnings guidance ranges for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Although it’s still early in the year, we expect the continued strong performance at the partnership to offset the weaker performance at Energy Services.
Now, a few comments about our Bakken Crude Express Pipeline. Building this crude oil line is consistent with our vision statement, which includes applying our core capabilities of gathering, processing, fractionating, storing, marketing and distributing the natural gas, natural gas liquids, and other energy commodities. Our physical presence in the Bakken provides us a unique opportunity to apply our capabilities to crude oil. It’s very similar to what we did when we entered the NGL business more than a decade ago.
Whenever we evaluate opportunities, whether they’re capital projects or new business ventures, we answer three questions. First, how does the opportunity fit with our vision? Second, what is our competitive advantage? And finally, are we creating value for others besides ourselves? In this case, the opportunity fits our vision very well. We believe our unique knowledge of the Bakken, the presence of our existing assets, our relationships with producers and our strong commercial, construction and operating capabilities represent a competitive advantage that will create value, not only for investors, but also for producers and refiners.
For producers, this new pipeline provides a reliable mode of transportation at a lower cost versus other alternatives. It allows them to increase their net backs and receive the benefits of their high-quality crude oil. Demand for light, sweet crude has never been greater. Despite improved technology to refine heavier, sour crudes, light sweet crude is still refiners’ preferred feedstock.
This new platform also is a -- excuse me, this new pipeline also is a platform for future growth, creating additional opportunities to provide services to producers and refiners. As Terry will discuss later, we are well on our way to securing the supply commitments to make this pipeline economically viable. Consistent with our past practice, we only announce projects in which we have a high degree of confidence that we can secure producer commitment.
Rob will now review ONEOK’s financial highlights, and then Pierce will review ONEOK’s operating performance. Rob?"
293889,146298686,295591,"ONEOK Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 02, 2012",2012-05-02,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. ONEOK’s first quarter net income was $122.9 million compared with $130.9 million for the same period last year, due mostly to losses in the Energy Services segment as a result of the continued decline in natural",572,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. ONEOK’s first quarter net income was $122.9 million compared with $130.9 million for the same period last year, due mostly to losses in the Energy Services segment as a result of the continued decline in natural gas prices.
This quarter included a non-recurring, non-cash $10.3 million or $8.5 million after-tax goodwill impairment charge that reduced Energy Services’ goodwill balance to zero, and a required $29.9 million non-cash reclassification of deferred losses to earnings on certain financial contracts related to our Storage business. This loss is similar to an LCM, or lower of cost or market charge on inventory that you may be familiar with. However, this charge relates to losses on purchase hedge contracts rather than on physical inventory. We still have gains that will be recognized in earnings during the 2012, 2013 heating season.
In February 2012, we sold ONEOK Energy Marketing Company, a natural gas retail marketing business, to Constellation Energy Group. We received net proceeds of approximately $32 million and recognized an after-tax gain on the sale of approximately $13.3 million. During the quarter, ONEOK invested approximately $460 million to acquire an additional 8 million common units from ONEOK Partners in a private placement transaction. ONEOK also contributed approximately $19 million to maintain its 2% general partner interest, demonstrating our bullish view on ONEOK Partners’ future growth.
ONEOK’s first quarter 2012 stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $69.2 million. As the general partner and significant limited partner owner, ONEOK will receive $107 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners for the first quarter, a 32% increase from the same period last year.
We also reaffirmed our 2012 guidance with net income expected to be in the range of $360 million to $410 million. The continued strong performance at ONEOK Partners, especially from its natural gas liquids business, should offset the lower results from Energy Services. We expect ONEOK’s net income to grow approximately 18% annually from our 2012 guidance through 2014, as incremental earnings from the growth at ONEOK Partners flow to ONEOK.
In April, we declared a dividend of $0.61 per share, unchanged from the previous quarter. Subject to board approval, we expect to increase the dividend $0.05 per share in July. We also expect the dividend to grow by approximately 40% between 2012 and 2014, following an 18% increase from 2011.
ONEOK’s liquidity position is good. At the end of the first quarter, on a stand-alone basis, we had $419.8 million of commercial paper outstanding, $34.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, $188.5 million of natural gas in storage, $778.2 million available under our $1.2 billion credit facility, and our total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 49%. ONEOK’s significant cash flow and outstanding liquidity position continue to give us incredible financial flexibility.
Since ONEOK Partners announced the Bakken Crude Express Pipeline, we’ve been asked if this project changes our uses or preferences of ONEOK’s free cash flow. The short answer is no. ONEOK remains committed to providing sustainable value to our shareholders and solidifying our position as an attractive investment, whether it’s by increasing our dividend, repurchasing ONEOK stock and/or purchasing additional units of ONEOK Partners. We have used all of these options, and don’t view them as mutually exclusive, and are fortunate to have the financial capability to do one or more under favorable conditions.
Now, Pierce will update you on ONEOK’s operating performance."

Let’s start with our Natural Gas Distribution segment. First quarter 2012 earnings were slightly lower because of higher depreciation expense, primarily related to the installation of automated meter reading devices last year. The warmer weather reduced some of the commercial customer transportation demand that is not subject to weather normalization. But these decreases were partially offset by higher rates in Texas as a result of regulatory activity.
Now, a brief regulatory update; Kansas Gas Service plans to file a rate case this month that will include rate design options, further reducing our volumetric sensitivity in this area. In March 2012, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed a performance-based rate change application seeking to increase base rates by $16.2 million, resetting our regulated return on equity to 10.25%, which is slightly below the current approved 10.5%. A hearing with the commission is set for the end of June.
Now, a brief business overview of Energy Services. As we have said on previous earnings calls, we are aligning or right-sizing the transportation and storage capacity to serve our premium services customers, which means we are turning back or renegotiating transportation and storage rates. By 2015, approximately 90% of the storage capacity and more than 75% of the transport capacity will expire, providing an opportunity to either renew them at lower rates or cancel the leases.
For example, we did not renew 35 million cubic feet per day of transportation capacity that expired in the first quarter and an additional 46 million cubic feet per day that expired on April 1. We do not plan to renew another 60 million cubic feet per day that will expire in the fourth quarter of this year. We began this year at just over 1.1 billion cubic feet per day of transportation capacity, and we’ll exit the year at around 0.97 billion cubic feet per day. As disclosed in our last analyst call, we still expect to reduce our targeted leased transportation capacity down to 0.8 billion cubic feet per day and our lease storage capacity to 60 billion cubic feet by 2015. John, that concludes my remarks for ONEOK."

In the first quarter, ONEOK Partners’ net income increased 58% compared with the first quarter of 2011. ONEOK Partners reported net income of $238.8 million or $0.91 per unit compared with last year’s first quarter net income of $150.9 m",472,"Thanks, John. In the first quarter, ONEOK Partners’ net income increased 58% compared with the first quarter of 2011. ONEOK Partners reported net income of $238.8 million or $0.91 per unit compared with last year’s first quarter net income of $150.9 million or $0.58 per unit. Distributable cash flow increased 51% compared with the first quarter last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.74x.
The higher earnings and resulting higher coverage ratio were primarily due to strong NGL optimization margins, increased NGL volumes transported and fractionated and increased natural gas gathering and processing volumes from the growth in the Williston Basin, including the startup of the Garden Creek plant in late December.
In 2008, when commodity prices were at record levels, we used the incremental cash flow to finance a portion of our $2 billion capital investment program that was completed in 2009, and we plan to use a portion of the incremental cash flow likewise in 2012 to help fund our more than $5 billion capital growth program, reducing our debt and equity financing needs.
At the same time, we are increasing distributions to our unitholders in a meaningful way. We increased the distribution $0.025 per unit for the first quarter, and subject to board approval, expect to increase it another $0.025 per unit per quarter in 2012. We still expect to increase our distribution by an average of 15% to 20% annually in 2013 and 2014.
In March, we completed a public offering of 8 million common units and a private placement with ONEOK of 8 million common units, which generated total proceeds of approximately $920 million, providing significant capacity for our capital expenditures program. We also repaid $350 million of senior notes at maturity in April. With the strong performance of the NGL segment expected to continue through 2012, we’ve reaffirmed and expect to be at the high end of the partnership’s 2012 earnings guidance net income range of $810 million to $870 million and its distributable cash flow range of $925 million to $985 million.
We expect ONEOK Partners’ EBITDA to grow approximately 20% annually from our 2012 guidance through 2014, as our growth projects go into service. We also reaffirmed our 2012 capital expenditure guidance of $2 billion, approximately $1.9 billion in growth capital and $109 million in maintenance capital.
We continue to actively hedge to lock in margins on our expected equity volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment. Our 2012 natural gas hedges are 78%, while our 2012 NGL hedges are 72%. The news release also provides hedging information for 2013.
At the end of the first quarter, the partnership had $746.7 million in cash and no commercial paper or other short-term borrowings, a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 46% and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.6x.

As John said, the partnership had a strong first quarter. Operating income increased 44%, driven primarily by higher margins in the Natural Gas Liquids segment from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu, an increase",1007,"Thank you, Rob. As John said, the partnership had a strong first quarter. Operating income increased 44%, driven primarily by higher margins in the Natural Gas Liquids segment from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu, an increased fractionation in transportation capacity available for these optimization activities. Earnings also increased as a result of higher volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, specifically in the Williston Basin from the startup of the new Garden Creek plant that went into service in late December.
The natural gas gathering and processing segment’s first quarter financial results were higher due primarily to higher natural gas volumes gathered and processed in the Williston Basin and Western Oklahoma, offset partially by lower natural gas and NGL product prices on our unhedged portion of these commodities, primarily ethane and propane.
The Garden Creek plant is already processing over 90 million cubic feet per day, less than four months after going into service with full capacity expected in the very near future. Operationally, the plant has exceeded our expectations, and we continue on a record-setting pace for new well connections.
The natural gas pipelines segment’s first quarter results were lower, due primarily to the impact of lower realized natural gas prices on our retained fuel position. Equity earnings from Northern Border Pipeline were relatively unchanged, as the pipeline maintained its position as a low cost provider to transport Canadian supply to Midwest markets. Northern Border is substantially contracted through March 2013, and has been successful in capturing 3 year or longer extensions as current contracts expire.
Our Natural Gas Liquids segment continued to benefit from wider NGL differentials and more capacity available for optimization activities. The segment also benefited from higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated. We fractionated 18% more volume during the first quarter 2012, averaging 585,000 barrels per day, including the volumes fractionated at the Targa facility under our agreement that began during the second quarter of last year.
NGLs transported on our gathering lines were up 25%, averaging 498,000 barrels per day during the quarter, as a result of increased NGL volumes gathered on the Arbuckle Pipeline into the Mid-Continent. We still expect the Conway to Mont Belvieu ethane price differential to average $0.32 per gallon this year. While the ethane differential was $0.24 in the first quarter, we anticipate ethane differentials for the remainder of the year to increase to sufficient levels to support our average ethane guidance differential of $0.32 per gallon, as petchems ramp up demand following their maintenance turnarounds where additional capacity was added.
We have started our planned maintenance turnaround on our Mont Belvieu fractionator MB-1 and expect it to last until the end of May. During this turnaround, raw NGL volumes that were being fractionated at MB-1 either will be sent to other fractionators and/or placed in storage. Because of the advanced planning that goes on in a turnaround, we expect this turnaround will not substantially affect our customers’ operations and it’s factored into our earnings guidance.
Now a quick update on our new projects. First, the Stateline I plant is expected to be in service in the third quarter of this year, with completion of the Stateline II plant in the first half of 2013. Last month, we announced the Divide County project in the Bakken Shale that includes 270 miles of natural gas gathering system and related infrastructure that will gather natural gas in the Bakken and deliver and practically fill the remaining capacity at Stateline II.
We continue to see significant increases in drilling rig counts within our core areas in Western Oklahoma, in the NGL-rich Cana-Woodford Shale. As a result, we will construct a new 200 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing facility, the Canadian Valley Plant, and related infrastructure. The contracts are percent of proceeds with an additional fee component, and we have significant acreage dedications in most active development areas in the Cana-Woodford Shale. Terry will discuss the new Bakken Crude Express line in a moment.
The 500-mile plus 60,000 barrel per day Bakken NGL pipeline, along with the expansions of the Bushton Fractionator and Overland Pass Pipeline are either on or ahead of schedule and on budget. We’ve acquired more than 90% of the right-of-way needed for the Bakken NGL Pipeline. We’ve purchased and started taking delivery of the steel pipe. Construction is set to start in late May or early June.
Let’s turn to our Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast projects look. The Arbuckle Pipeline expansion was completed in April, with gathering volumes already approaching its expanded capacity of 240,000 barrels per day. In addition, our 230-mile Mid-Continent NGL gathering system expansion in the Cana-Woodford and Granite Wash was also completed in April. This project connected our NGL gathering system to 3 new and 3 existing third-party natural gas processing facilities, and is expected to add 75,000 to 80,000 barrels per day of raw NGLs into our NGL system.
The Sterling III Pipeline and MB-2 fractionator are progressing as planned. We have approximately 75% of the capacity committed on the 193,000 barrel per day Sterling III, which is the level of supply commitment we targeted for this project to achieve its required returns. All the capacity is committed on our 75,000 barrel per day MB-2 fractionator. Our commercial team has done a terrific job securing these supply commitments well before the assets go into service in 2013.
We continue to develop and evaluate a lengthy backlog of natural gas and NGL-related infrastructure projects, including investments in processing plants, natural gas pipelines, NGL fractionation and storage facilities. This backlog totals substantially more than 2 billion and it’s growing.
Some of these investments will free additional redundancy and reliability and improve our connectivity to our petchem customers while others will provide the critical infrastructure that producers, processors need to get their products to market. As we have done in the past, we will announce the projects when we have sufficient producer and/or customer commitments to make them economically viable.
John, that concludes my remarks."

293889,146298686,295591,"ONEOK Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 02, 2012",2012-05-02,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. This morning I’ll provide a brief outlook of the NGL markets and close with some additional color on our recently announced Bakken Crude Express Pipeline. On the NGL demand side, the petrochemical industry conti",959,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. This morning I’ll provide a brief outlook of the NGL markets and close with some additional color on our recently announced Bakken Crude Express Pipeline. On the NGL demand side, the petrochemical industry continues to take advantage of using ethane as its feedstock due to its strong price advantage versus oil-based feedstocks.
In the short term, several petrochemical facilities are currently conducting maintenance turnarounds reducing the immediate need for ethane. We also understand that several of these petchems are in turnarounds to increase their ethane fracing capabilities by a total of approximately 100,000 barrels per day. Dow also recently announced a world-scale ethylene cracker in the Gulf Coast to be completed in 2017, adding another estimated 100,000 barrels per day of ethane demand.
Once these planned turnarounds are completed over the next few months, demand from the petchems for ethane and the price of ethane should strengthen, particularly in Mont Belvieu. Some experts are projecting ethane demand will reach new record highs later this year, and will continue to grow over the long term, especially with the petrochemical plant restarts, expansions and new facilities. As a consequence, we expect NGL fractionation capacity to remain tight, but only gradually ease as new fractionators come online over the next few years.
On the supply side, as you know, rigs have moved away from dry gas regions and producers are focusing especially on crude oil and liquids-rich plays, such as the Bakken, Cana-Woodford, Woodford, Granite Wash, Niobrara, Mississippian Lime and the Eagle Ford Shales. Fortunately, for us, our assets are well positioned in all but one of these areas. As NGL growth continues at a rapid pace, we believe that over the next couple of years, there will be some periodic over-supplies of ethane as new NGL production and infrastructure brings additional NGLs to market. As we approach and move through the 2015 and 2017 timeframe, we believe there will be sufficient demand for NGLs, as new petrochemical expansions come online, as well as from growing Gulf Coast export activity.
Last month, we announced plans to build 1,300-mile Bakken Crude Express Pipeline, enabling us to serve the rapid crude oil supply growth in the Bakken Shale in the Williston Basin. Producers continue to aggressively drill in the Williston Basin, with current crude oil production in North Dakota exceeding 0.5 million barrels per day with over 200 active rigs. By comparison, in January 2011, crude oil production was approximately 340,000 barrels per day, and there were 150 active rigs.
With crude oil production expected to increase to well over 1 million barrels per day within the next 5 years, additional crude oil take-away capacity is required. A pipeline compared with rail or truck is the most efficient and reliable method of transporting crude oil to the marketplace, especially in the Williston Basin, where the weather is harsh and very unpredictable. More than 80% of our pipeline is designed to parallel our existing and soon-to-be-built NGL pipelines, including the Bakken NGL pipeline, that will begin construction very soon.
We will still need to acquire right-of-way for the pipeline, but knowing the geography and regulatory landscape provides us a significant advantage in estimating construction costs and understanding permitting and other regulatory requirements. Additionally, the pipeline will primarily serve those producers of light, low sulfur crude oil originating from the Bakken, as well as production from the Niobrara and in Kansas.
New connections to consuming markets along the route, particularly in Kansas, are also being considered in addition to the Cushing market center. At the moment, we are in various stages of negotiations with almost 30 producers who represent nearly all of the 0.5 million barrels per day of Williston Basin crude oil production, many of which we already have relationships with for their natural gas and NGLs. They have expressed strong interest in our pipeline because of their expected crude oil production is ramping up at an even faster pace than recent years.
Based upon current producer interest, we expect to have all of the pipeline’s capacity committed within the next couple of months. However, we do plan on having an open-season process in the late summer, early fall of this year. Based on our latest estimates, we expect to generate EBITDA multiples of 5x to 7x, a similar return from our previously announced projects. For obvious competitive reasons, we are not disclosing the proposed tariff at this time, however, it will be more competitive and cheaper than rail, with producers able to lock in rates for a longer term compared with the contract for rail capacities.
Many have asked if the partnership will need to own storage in Cushing to make this project viable. Several storage and terminal operators have contacted us about having our pipelines connected to their storage facilities. Cushing remains a key market center for crude oil due to its massive storage position, expanding capability and extensive connectivity, and several companies are building additional storage capacity to handle the incremental barrels from the Bakken and other producing regions.
While the crude oil market is well served, this fact does not preclude us from further participating in crude oil-related opportunities within the value chain to serve our customers, just like we have in the natural gas and especially the NGL business. Our company has the commercial construction and operational expertise to execute this project with an experienced team of individuals who have constructed and operated crude oil systems before. With a history of successfully building and operating long-haul liquids transportation pipelines across the country, our capabilities in developing and operating NGL pipelines will serve us well, as we move into crude oil. We are well-prepared to execute on this important project.
John, that concludes my remarks."

Before we take your questions, I’d like to provide some additional context to our long-term growth forecast that Rob mentioned earlier. While growth in the Bakken and the Mid-Continent will create more commodity price exposure in our gathering and processing segment and our Mid-Continent NGL assets both current and future create opportunities to capture price differentials.
Our projected earnings growth by 2014 is driven primarily by volume growth, not by higher projected commodity prices or wider differentials. If our assets or contracts allow us to capture upside, we will certainly do so, but it is not factored into our 3-year plan. As I’ve said before, we are not in the business to predict commodity prices or play the spread. We are in the business to provide value-added fee-based services to our producers, processors and other customers.

One, yes, that we are having a fair announcement, but as with the timing on that Bakken crude line, that’s going to be insignificant this year, really the bulk of that coming in 2014 from a spend standpoint. So as we place those capital investments on top of the -- what we’ve already got, plus the Woodford Shale investment, we still come back to recognizing that the optimization margins are -- that we’re currently realizing are not going to be sustainable, as we’ve said.
And so we are using some of that cash flow to pre-fund our capital projects. We did have the equity project offering in March, a year ago in January we had $1.3 billion of debt. I think you all can figure out kind of what would be mixed in the tranche, but the key thing on that is the optimization margins and how we use that going on.
And as we’ve said before, we typically do not -- we don’t signal when we’re coming next to market and what tranche, but we’ve got this obviously planned out. And we feel good with regards to supporting Terry and Pierce’s business on the existing projects, plus, as you heard Pierce say today, the $2 billion of unannounced projects."

We always appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Joining me this morning are Rob Martinovich, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our quarterly financial performance and update our 3-year growth forecast; Pierce Norton, our Chief Operating Officer, who will review the operating performance of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and update you on the partnership’s growth projects; and Terry Spencer, our President, who will discuss our NGL supply and demand outlook, followed by an update on our new Bakken Crude Express Pipeline.
On this morning’s call, I will briefly review our first quarter results, discuss our rationale for building the crude oil pipeline out of the Bakken, and then conclude with some perspective on our updated 3-year growth forecast.
Let’s start with our first quarter performance. Again, ONEOK Partners turned in an exceptionally strong performance, while our Natural Gas Distribution segment turned in slightly lower results, and our Energy Services segment reported a loss because of the continued decline in natural gas prices. Pierce will provide more detail on each segment’s operating performance in just a few minutes. We remain confident with our 2012 earnings guidance ranges for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Although it’s still early in the year, we expect the continued strong performance at the partnership to offset the weaker performance at Energy Services.
Now, a few comments about our Bakken Crude Express Pipeline. Building this crude oil line is consistent with our vision statement, which includes applying our core capabilities of gathering, processing, fractionating, storing, marketing and distributing the natural gas, natural gas liquids, and other energy commodities. Our physical presence in the Bakken provides us a unique opportunity to apply our capabilities to crude oil. It’s very similar to what we did when we entered the NGL business more than a decade ago.
Whenever we evaluate opportunities, whether they’re capital projects or new business ventures, we answer three questions. First, how does the opportunity fit with our vision? Second, what is our competitive advantage? And finally, are we creating value for others besides ourselves? In this case, the opportunity fits our vision very well. We believe our unique knowledge of the Bakken, the presence of our existing assets, our relationships with producers and our strong commercial, construction and operating capabilities represent a competitive advantage that will create value, not only for investors, but also for producers and refiners.
For producers, this new pipeline provides a reliable mode of transportation at a lower cost versus other alternatives. It allows them to increase their net backs and receive the benefits of their high-quality crude oil. Demand for light, sweet crude has never been greater. Despite improved technology to refine heavier, sour crudes, light sweet crude is still refiners’ preferred feedstock.
This new platform also is a -- excuse me, this new pipeline also is a platform for future growth, creating additional opportunities to provide services to producers and refiners. As Terry will discuss later, we are well on our way to securing the supply commitments to make this pipeline economically viable. Consistent with our past practice, we only announce projects in which we have a high degree of confidence that we can secure producer commitment.
Rob will now review ONEOK’s financial highlights, and then Pierce will review ONEOK’s operating performance. Rob?"
293889,146298686,296171,"ONEOK Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 02, 2012",2012-05-02,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. ONEOK’s first quarter net income was $122.9 million compared with $130.9 million for the same period last year, due mostly to losses in the Energy Services segment as a result of the continued decline in natural",572,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. ONEOK’s first quarter net income was $122.9 million compared with $130.9 million for the same period last year, due mostly to losses in the Energy Services segment as a result of the continued decline in natural gas prices.
This quarter included a non-recurring, non-cash $10.3 million or $8.5 million after-tax goodwill impairment charge that reduced Energy Services’ goodwill balance to zero, and a required $29.9 million non-cash reclassification of deferred losses to earnings on certain financial contracts related to our Storage business. This loss is similar to an LCM, or lower of cost or market charge on inventory that you may be familiar with. However, this charge relates to losses on purchase hedge contracts rather than on physical inventory. We still have gains that will be recognized in earnings during the 2012, 2013 heating season.
In February 2012, we sold ONEOK Energy Marketing Company, a natural gas retail marketing business, to Constellation Energy Group. We received net proceeds of approximately $32 million and recognized an after-tax gain on the sale of approximately $13.3 million. During the quarter, ONEOK invested approximately $460 million to acquire an additional 8 million common units from ONEOK Partners in a private placement transaction. ONEOK also contributed approximately $19 million to maintain its 2% general partner interest, demonstrating our bullish view on ONEOK Partners’ future growth.
ONEOK’s first quarter 2012 stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $69.2 million. As the general partner and significant limited partner owner, ONEOK will receive $107 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners for the first quarter, a 32% increase from the same period last year.
We also reaffirmed our 2012 guidance with net income expected to be in the range of $360 million to $410 million. The continued strong performance at ONEOK Partners, especially from its natural gas liquids business, should offset the lower results from Energy Services. We expect ONEOK’s net income to grow approximately 18% annually from our 2012 guidance through 2014, as incremental earnings from the growth at ONEOK Partners flow to ONEOK.
In April, we declared a dividend of $0.61 per share, unchanged from the previous quarter. Subject to board approval, we expect to increase the dividend $0.05 per share in July. We also expect the dividend to grow by approximately 40% between 2012 and 2014, following an 18% increase from 2011.
ONEOK’s liquidity position is good. At the end of the first quarter, on a stand-alone basis, we had $419.8 million of commercial paper outstanding, $34.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, $188.5 million of natural gas in storage, $778.2 million available under our $1.2 billion credit facility, and our total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 49%. ONEOK’s significant cash flow and outstanding liquidity position continue to give us incredible financial flexibility.
Since ONEOK Partners announced the Bakken Crude Express Pipeline, we’ve been asked if this project changes our uses or preferences of ONEOK’s free cash flow. The short answer is no. ONEOK remains committed to providing sustainable value to our shareholders and solidifying our position as an attractive investment, whether it’s by increasing our dividend, repurchasing ONEOK stock and/or purchasing additional units of ONEOK Partners. We have used all of these options, and don’t view them as mutually exclusive, and are fortunate to have the financial capability to do one or more under favorable conditions.
Now, Pierce will update you on ONEOK’s operating performance."

Let’s start with our Natural Gas Distribution segment. First quarter 2012 earnings were slightly lower because of higher depreciation expense, primarily related to the installation of automated meter reading devices last year. The warmer weather reduced some of the commercial customer transportation demand that is not subject to weather normalization. But these decreases were partially offset by higher rates in Texas as a result of regulatory activity.
Now, a brief regulatory update; Kansas Gas Service plans to file a rate case this month that will include rate design options, further reducing our volumetric sensitivity in this area. In March 2012, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed a performance-based rate change application seeking to increase base rates by $16.2 million, resetting our regulated return on equity to 10.25%, which is slightly below the current approved 10.5%. A hearing with the commission is set for the end of June.
Now, a brief business overview of Energy Services. As we have said on previous earnings calls, we are aligning or right-sizing the transportation and storage capacity to serve our premium services customers, which means we are turning back or renegotiating transportation and storage rates. By 2015, approximately 90% of the storage capacity and more than 75% of the transport capacity will expire, providing an opportunity to either renew them at lower rates or cancel the leases.
For example, we did not renew 35 million cubic feet per day of transportation capacity that expired in the first quarter and an additional 46 million cubic feet per day that expired on April 1. We do not plan to renew another 60 million cubic feet per day that will expire in the fourth quarter of this year. We began this year at just over 1.1 billion cubic feet per day of transportation capacity, and we’ll exit the year at around 0.97 billion cubic feet per day. As disclosed in our last analyst call, we still expect to reduce our targeted leased transportation capacity down to 0.8 billion cubic feet per day and our lease storage capacity to 60 billion cubic feet by 2015. John, that concludes my remarks for ONEOK."

In the first quarter, ONEOK Partners’ net income increased 58% compared with the first quarter of 2011.

In the first quarter, ONEOK Partners’ net income increased 58% compared with the first quarter of 2011. ONEOK Partners reported net income of $238.8 million or $0.91 per unit compared with last year’s first quarter net income of $150.9 million or $0.58 per unit. Distributable cash flow increased 51% compared with the first quarter last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.74x.
The higher earnings and resulting higher coverage ratio were primarily due to strong NGL optimization margins, increased NGL volumes transported and fractionated and increased natural gas gathering and processing volumes from the growth in the Williston Basin, including the startup of the Garden Creek plant in late December.
In 2008, when commodity prices were at record levels, we used the incremental cash flow to finance a portion of our $2 billion capital investment program that was completed in 2009, and we plan to use a portion of the incremental cash flow likewise in 2012 to help fund our more than $5 billion capital growth program, reducing our debt and equity financing needs.
At the same time, we are increasing distributions to our unitholders in a meaningful way. We increased the distribution $0.025 per unit for the first quarter, and subject to board approval, expect to increase it another $0.025 per unit per quarter in 2012. We still expect to increase our distribution by an average of 15% to 20% annually in 2013 and 2014.
In March, we completed a public offering of 8 million common units and a private placement with ONEOK of 8 million common units, which generated total proceeds of approximately $920 million, providing significant capacity for our capital expenditures program. We also repaid $350 million of senior notes at maturity in April. With the strong performance of the NGL segment expected to continue through 2012, we’ve reaffirmed and expect to be at the high end of the partnership’s 2012 earnings guidance net income range of $810 million to $870 million and its distributable cash flow range of $925 million to $985 million.
We expect ONEOK Partners’ EBITDA to grow approximately 20% annually from our 2012 guidance through 2014, as our growth projects go into service. We also reaffirmed our 2012 capital expenditure guidance of $2 billion, approximately $1.9 billion in growth capital and $109 million in maintenance capital.
We continue to actively hedge to lock in margins on our expected equity volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment. Our 2012 natural gas hedges are 78%, while our 2012 NGL hedges are 72%. The news release also provides hedging information for 2013.
At the end of the first quarter, the partnership had $746.7 million in cash and no commercial paper or other short-term borrowings, a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 46% and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.6x.
Now, Pierce will review the partnership’s operating performance."

As John said, the partnership had a strong first quarter. Operating income increased 44%, driven primarily by higher margins in the Natural Gas Liquids segment from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu, an increase",1007,"Thank you, Rob. As John said, the partnership had a strong first quarter. Operating income increased 44%, driven primarily by higher margins in the Natural Gas Liquids segment from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu, an increased fractionation in transportation capacity available for these optimization activities. Earnings also increased as a result of higher volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, specifically in the Williston Basin from the startup of the new Garden Creek plant that went into service in late December.
The natural gas gathering and processing segment’s first quarter financial results were higher due primarily to higher natural gas volumes gathered and processed in the Williston Basin and Western Oklahoma, offset partially by lower natural gas and NGL product prices on our unhedged portion of these commodities, primarily ethane and propane.
The Garden Creek plant is already processing over 90 million cubic feet per day, less than four months after going into service with full capacity expected in the very near future. Operationally, the plant has exceeded our expectations, and we continue on a record-setting pace for new well connections.
The natural gas pipelines segment’s first quarter results were lower, due primarily to the impact of lower realized natural gas prices on our retained fuel position. Equity earnings from Northern Border Pipeline were relatively unchanged, as the pipeline maintained its position as a low cost provider to transport Canadian supply to Midwest markets. Northern Border is substantially contracted through March 2013, and has been successful in capturing 3 year or longer extensions as current contracts expire.
Our Natural Gas Liquids segment continued to benefit from wider NGL differentials and more capacity available for optimization activities. The segment also benefited from higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated. We fractionated 18% more volume during the first quarter 2012, averaging 585,000 barrels per day, including the volumes fractionated at the Targa facility under our agreement that began during the second quarter of last year.
NGLs transported on our gathering lines were up 25%, averaging 498,000 barrels per day during the quarter, as a result of increased NGL volumes gathered on the Arbuckle Pipeline into the Mid-Continent. We still expect the Conway to Mont Belvieu ethane price differential to average $0.32 per gallon this year. While the ethane differential was $0.24 in the first quarter, we anticipate ethane differentials for the remainder of the year to increase to sufficient levels to support our average ethane guidance differential of $0.32 per gallon, as petchems ramp up demand following their maintenance turnarounds where additional capacity was added.
We have started our planned maintenance turnaround on our Mont Belvieu fractionator MB-1 and expect it to last until the end of May. During this turnaround, raw NGL volumes that were being fractionated at MB-1 either will be sent to other fractionators and/or placed in storage. Because of the advanced planning that goes on in a turnaround, we expect this turnaround will not substantially affect our customers’ operations and it’s factored into our earnings guidance.
Now a quick update on our new projects. First, the Stateline I plant is expected to be in service in the third quarter of this year, with completion of the Stateline II plant in the first half of 2013. Last month, we announced the Divide County project in the Bakken Shale that includes 270 miles of natural gas gathering system and related infrastructure that will gather natural gas in the Bakken and deliver and practically fill the remaining capacity at Stateline II.
We continue to see significant increases in drilling rig counts within our core areas in Western Oklahoma, in the NGL-rich Cana-Woodford Shale. As a result, we will construct a new 200 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing facility, the Canadian Valley Plant, and related infrastructure. The contracts are percent of proceeds with an additional fee component, and we have significant acreage dedications in most active development areas in the Cana-Woodford Shale. Terry will discuss the new Bakken Crude Express line in a moment.
The 500-mile plus 60,000 barrel per day Bakken NGL pipeline, along with the expansions of the Bushton Fractionator and Overland Pass Pipeline are either on or ahead of schedule and on budget. We’ve acquired more than 90% of the right-of-way needed for the Bakken NGL Pipeline. We’ve purchased and started taking delivery of the steel pipe. Construction is set to start in late May or early June.
Let’s turn to our Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast projects look. The Arbuckle Pipeline expansion was completed in April, with gathering volumes already approaching its expanded capacity of 240,000 barrels per day. In addition, our 230-mile Mid-Continent NGL gathering system expansion in the Cana-Woodford and Granite Wash was also completed in April. This project connected our NGL gathering system to 3 new and 3 existing third-party natural gas processing facilities, and is expected to add 75,000 to 80,000 barrels per day of raw NGLs into our NGL system.
The Sterling III Pipeline and MB-2 fractionator are progressing as planned. We have approximately 75% of the capacity committed on the 193,000 barrel per day Sterling III, which is the level of supply commitment we targeted for this project to achieve its required returns. All the capacity is committed on our 75,000 barrel per day MB-2 fractionator. Our commercial team has done a terrific job securing these supply commitments well before the assets go into service in 2013.
We continue to develop and evaluate a lengthy backlog of natural gas and NGL-related infrastructure projects, including investments in processing plants, natural gas pipelines, NGL fractionation and storage facilities. This backlog totals substantially more than 2 billion and it’s growing.
Some of these investments will free additional redundancy and reliability and improve our connectivity to our petchem customers while others will provide the critical infrastructure that producers, processors need to get their products to market. As we have done in the past, we will announce the projects when we have sufficient producer and/or customer commitments to make them economically viable.
John, that concludes my remarks."

This morning I’ll provide a brief outlook of the NGL markets and close with some additional color on our recently announced Bakken Crude Express Pipeline. On the NGL demand side, the petrochemical industry conti",959,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. This morning I’ll provide a brief outlook of the NGL markets and close with some additional color on our recently announced Bakken Crude Express Pipeline. On the NGL demand side, the petrochemical industry continues to take advantage of using ethane as its feedstock due to its strong price advantage versus oil-based feedstocks.
In the short term, several petrochemical facilities are currently conducting maintenance turnarounds reducing the immediate need for ethane. We also understand that several of these petchems are in turnarounds to increase their ethane frac-ing capabilities by a total of approximately 100,000 barrels per day. Dow also recently announced a world-scale ethylene cracker in the Gulf Coast to be completed in 2017, adding another estimated 100,000 barrels per day of ethane demand.
Once these planned turnarounds are completed over the next few months, demand from the petchems for ethane and the price of ethane should strengthen, particularly in Mont Belvieu. Some experts are projecting ethane demand will reach new record highs later this year, and will continue to grow over the long term, especially with the petrochemical plant restarts, expansions and new facilities. As a consequence, we expect NGL fractionation capacity to remain tight, but only gradually ease as new fractionators come online over the next few years.
On the supply side, as you know, rigs have moved away from dry gas regions and producers are focusing especially on crude oil and liquids-rich plays, such as the Bakken, Cana-Woodford, Woodford, Granite Wash, Niobrara, Mississippian Lime and the Eagle Ford Shales. Fortunately, for us, our assets are well positioned in all but one of these areas. As NGL growth continues at a rapid pace, we believe that over the next couple of years, there will be some periodic over-supplies of ethane as new NGL production and infrastructure brings additional NGLs to market. As we approach and move through the 2015 and 2017 timeframe, we believe there will be sufficient demand for NGLs, as new petrochemical expansions come online, as well as from growing Gulf Coast export activity.
Last month, we announced plans to build 1,300-mile Bakken Crude Express Pipeline, enabling us to serve the rapid crude oil supply growth in the Bakken Shale in the Williston Basin. Producers continue to aggressively drill in the Williston Basin, with current crude oil production in North Dakota exceeding 0.5 million barrels per day with over 200 active rigs. By comparison, in January 2011, crude oil production was approximately 340,000 barrels per day, and there were 150 active rigs.
With crude oil production expected to increase to well over 1 million barrels per day within the next 5 years, additional crude oil take-away capacity is required. A pipeline compared with rail or truck is the most efficient and reliable method of transporting crude oil to the marketplace, especially in the Williston Basin, where the weather is harsh and very unpredictable. More than 80% of our pipeline is designed to parallel our existing and soon-to-be-built NGL pipelines, including the Bakken NGL pipeline, that will begin construction very soon.
We will still need to acquire right-of-way for the pipeline, but knowing the geography and regulatory landscape provides us a significant advantage in estimating construction costs and understanding permitting and other regulatory requirements. Additionally, the pipeline will primarily serve those producers of light, low sulfur crude oil originating from the Bakken, as well as production from the Niobrara and in Kansas.
New connections to consuming markets along the route, particularly in Kansas, are also being considered in addition to the Cushing market center. At the moment, we are in various stages of negotiations with almost 30 producers who represent nearly all of the 0.5 million barrels per day of Williston Basin crude oil production, many of which we already have relationships with for their natural gas and NGLs. They have expressed strong interest in our pipeline because of their expected crude oil production is ramping up at an even faster pace than recent years.
Based upon current producer interest, we expect to have all of the pipeline’s capacity committed within the next couple of months. However, we do plan on having an open-season process in the late summer, early fall of this year. Based on our latest estimates, we expect to generate EBITDA multiples of 5x to 7x, a similar return from our previously announced projects. For obvious competitive reasons, we are not disclosing the proposed tariff at this time, however, it will be more competitive and cheaper than rail, with producers able to lock in rates for a longer term compared with the contract for rail capacities.
Many have asked if the partnership will need to own storage in Cushing to make this project viable. Several storage and terminal operators have contacted us about having our pipelines connected to their storage facilities. Cushing remains a key market center for crude oil due to its massive storage position, expanding capability and extensive connectivity, and several companies are building additional storage capacity to handle the incremental barrels from the Bakken and other producing regions.
While the crude oil market is well served, this fact does not preclude us from further participating in crude oil-related opportunities within the value chain to serve our customers, just like we have in the natural gas and especially the NGL business. Our company has the commercial construction and operational expertise to execute this project with an experienced team of individuals who have constructed and operated crude oil systems before. With a history of successfully building and operating long-haul liquids transportation pipelines across the country, our capabilities in developing and operating NGL pipelines will serve us well, as we move into crude oil. We are well-prepared to execute on this important project.
John, that concludes my remarks."

Before we take your questions, I’d like to provide some additional context to our long-term growth forecast that Rob mentioned earlier. While growth in the Bakken and the Mid-Continent will create more commodity price exposure in our gathering and processing segment and our Mid-Continent NGL assets both current and future create opportunities to capture price differentials.
Our projected earnings growth by 2014 is driven primarily by volume growth, not by higher projected commodity prices or wider differentials. If our assets or contracts allow us to capture upside, we will certainly do so, but it is not factored into our 3-year plan. As I’ve said before, we are not in the business to predict commodity prices or play the spread. We are in the business to provide value-added fee-based services to our producers, processors and other customers.

One, yes, that we are having a fair announcement, but as with the timing on that Bakken crude line, that’s going to be insignificant this year, really the bulk of that coming in 2014 from a spend standpoint. So as we place those capital investments on top of the -- what we’ve already got, plus the Woodford Shale investment, we still come back to recognizing that the optimization margins are -- that we’re currently realizing are not going to be sustainable, as we’ve said. And so we are using some of that cash flow to pre-fund our capital projects. We did have the equity project offering in March, a year ago in January we had $1.3 billion of debt. I think you all can figure out kind of what would be mixed in the tranche, but the key thing on that is the optimization margins and how we use that going on. And as we’ve said before, we typically do not -- we don’t signal when we’re coming next to market and what tranche, but we’ve got this obviously planned out.

Pierce Norton, our Chief Operating Officer who will review the operating performance of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and update you on the partnership’s growth projects which I am pleased to say are on-time, on-budget and growing. And Terry Spencer, our President, who will update our NGL supply and demand outlook.
On this morning’s call, we will review our second quarter results and discuss our rationale for our updates to 2012 earnings guidance, reaffirm our ability to continue to grow ONEOK’s dividend and ONEOK Partners distribution over the next several years even in a lower commodity price environment, and update our progress with our growth projects, including our contracting status for the Bakken Crude Express pipeline and the $1 billion of additional projects we announced just last week.
Let’s start with our second quarter performance. ONEOK Partners turned in an exceptionally strong performance, driven by strong volume growth in the Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing businesses. Our Natural Gas Distribution segment turned in slightly higher results performing as expected and our energy services segment reported a loss because of the continuing challenges it faces in a low natural gas price environment with low price volatility. 
Pierce will provide more detail on each segment’s operating performance in just a few minutes.
We updated our 2012 earnings guidance ranges increasing the range for ONEOK Partners to reflect our expectation of a continued strength of the natural gas liquids business. We decreased slightly the ONEOK guidance range to reflect lower than expected earnings at energy services and to a lesser extent the Natural Gas Distribution segment, partially offset by the strong contribution from the ONEOK Partners segment.
As Rob will discuss in a few minutes, we remain confident in our ability to grow ONEOK’s dividends and ONEOK Partners distributions over the next several years even with lower prices. The main driver of these increases will be the volume growth from ONEOK Partners capital investments. Since our last conference call, we have made a lot of progress contracting for our Bakken Crude Express pipeline, which Pierce will discuss in a few minutes. Demand for the capacity is strong and we may have opportunities to increase the pipeline’s capacity.
Rob will now review ONEOK’s financial highlights and then Pierce will review ONEOK’s operating performance. Rob?

ONEOK’s second quarter net income was $61 million compared with $55.1 million for the same period last year, driven primarily by the solid performance of ONEOK Partners offset partially by continued challenges in the Energy Services segment. We completed a 2:1 split of the company’s common stock on June 1, making our shares more accessible to a broader base of potential investors. Also in June, ONEOK executed $150 million accelerated share repurchase agreement funded by cash-on-hand and short-term borrowings, part of a Board approved $750 million share repurchase program through 2013, of which $300 million remain. Based on the repurchase of shares, we expect the average amount of diluted shares outstanding for 2012 to be approximately 211 million.
ONEOK’s year-to-date 2012 standalone cash flow report changes in working capital exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $82 million. In July, we declared a dividend of $0.33 per share on a split adjusted basis, an increase of 8% from the previous quarter. 
With the partnership’s equity offering and private placement in March 2012, ONEOK as a general partner and significant limited partner owner is now expecting to receive $437 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners this year, a 31% increase over 2011. 
We also updated 2012 guidance for ONEOK. Net income is expected to be in the range of $345 million to $375 million compared with its previous range of $360 million to $410 million. The updated guidance reflects lower expected earnings in the Energy Services and Natural Gas Distribution segments, offset partially by higher expected earnings in the ONEOK Partners segment. Pierce will discuss the specific guidance updates in a moment.
Our updated standalone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is expected to exceed capital expenditures and dividends by a range of $115 million to $145 million versus our previous guidance range of $155 million to $195 million. This change reflects our revised ONEOK earnings guidance. Today we are also affirming our expectation to increase the dividend by approximately 40% between 2012 and 2014 as incremental cash from the growth of ONEOK Partners flows to ONEOK. At our Investor Day in September, we will present our updated 3-year 2013 to 2015 projections that will include specific ranges for net income and dividend growth. We also expect to release 2013 financial guidance at that time.
ONEOK’s liquidity position remains good. At the end of the second quarter, on a standalone basis, we had $571.9 million of commercial paper outstanding, $22.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, with $626.4 million available under our $1.2 billion credit facility and our standalone total debt to capitalization ratio was 52%. ONEOK’s cash flow and liquidity position continue to give us excellent financial flexibility. ONEOK remains committed to providing sustainable value to our shareholders and solidifying our position as an attractive investment, whether it is by increasing our dividend, repurchasing ONEOK stock, and/or purchasing additional units of ONEOK Partners. We have used all of these options and don’t view them as mutually exclusive, and are fortunate to have the financial capability to do one or more under favourable conditions.
Now, Pierce will update you on ONEOK’s operating performance.

Starting with our Natural Gas Distribution segment, second quarter 2012 earnings was up slightly due to higher rates and surcharge recoveries driven by regulatory activity in Texas and Kansas.

Starting with our Natural Gas Distribution segment, second quarter 2012 earnings was up slightly due to higher rates and surcharge recoveries driven by regulatory activity in Texas and Kansas. The distribution segment’s operating income guidance for 2012 has been slightly decreased to $215 million, reflecting lower margins due to warmer than normal weather.
Now a brief regulatory update. Kansas Gas Service filed a requested with the Kansas Corporation Commission to increase its overall annual revenues by $32.7 million. The request includes a $50.7 million increase in base rates and an $18 million reduction in amounts currently recovered through surcharges. If approved, we expect to implement new rates in January 2013. 
In July 2012, Oklahoma Natural Gas received approval to increased base rates by $9.5 million annually. Our tariff was also modified, narrowing the range of allowed return on equity to between 10% and 11% compared with the previously approved range of 9.75% to 11.25%. So far in 2012, we have received approval for increasing totals of $10.1 million annually in various Texas jurisdictions under rate cases and capital recovery and cost of service mechanisms.
Now a brief overview of Energy Services. Second quarter 2012 earnings were reduced as a result of lower transportation margins impaired with 2011 and lower premium services’ margins due to lower natural gas prices. As we have said on previous earnings calls, we are aligning, or right-sizing the transportation and storage capacity to serve our premium services customers, which means we are turning back or renegotiating transportation in storage leases. We now expect our year-end 2012 natural gas storage position to be approximately 72 Bcf compared with our previous estimate of 65 Bcf. 
We decreased guidance for the Energy Services segment to an operating loss of $60 million. This was primarily from the required $30 million non-cash reclassification of deferred losses to earnings on certain financial contracts related to our storage business, of which we have gains that will be recognized in earnings during 2012 and 2013 heating season, and the non-cash $10 million goodwill impairment charge. Both of these charges occurred in the first quarter 2012. This segment continues to be challenged by lower natural gas prices and volatility and narrow seasonal and location natural gas price differentials.
John that concludes my remarks for ONEOK.

In the second quarter, ONEOK Partners net income increased 21% compared with the second quarter of 2011, driven by higher natural gas liquids operating results. ONEOK Partners reported net income of $206.5 million, or $0.69 per unit compared with last year’s second quarter net income of $171.1 million, or $0.67 per unit. There were 219.8 million units outstanding for the second quarter this year compared with 203.8 million units outstanding for the same period in 2011. The equity offering and private placement in March 2012 included the issuance of 16 million additional units. Quarterly distributable cash flow increased 16% compared with the second quarter last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.29 times. At the same time, we are increasing distributions to our unit holders. We increased the distribution $0.025 per unit for the second quarter and subject to Board approval, expect to increase another $0.025 per unit per quarter for the remainder of 2012. 
The most common question we are asked relates to the potential impact of sustained low commodity prices, specifically NGL prices on our distribution growth rate. Based on a current forward-looking price tag developed by averaging Pyro and Wood MacKenzie prices for crude oil and natural gas and applying NGL price relationships to crude oil from CMAI, our average annual distribution growth rate would be at the low end of the 15% to 20% range for 2013 and 2014 with a coverage ratio of 1. Our long-term coverage ratio target remains at 1.05 to 1.15 times. However, if low commodity prices are sustained our coverage ratios could be slightly below that. We will provide more specific price assumption with you at our Investor Day in September.
We have increased the partnership’s 2012 earnings guidance to a range of $860 million to $910 million compared with the previous range of $810 million to $870 million, reflecting higher earnings in the Natural Gas Liquids segment offset partially by lower expected earnings in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. We now estimate the partnership’s 2012 distributable cash flow to be in the range of $975 million to $1.025 billion, compared with its previous range of $925 million to $985 million. 
We will also present ONEOK Partners’ updated three-year projections for 2013 to 2015 in September that will include specific ranges for EBITDA and distribution growth. We also expect to release 2013 financial guidance at that time.
We hedge the commodities received for our services to lock-in margins on our expected equity volumes in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. For the rest of 2012, 76% of our natural gas volumes are hedged, while 70% of our NGLs are hedged. Hedging information for 2013 is included in the news release.
At the end of the second quarter, the partnership had $92.9 million in cash, $24 million of commercial paper outstanding, a debt to capitalization ratio of 44%, and a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.3 times. We extended the maturity date of our $1.2 billion revolving credit agreement by one year to August 2017.
Now, Pierce will review the partnership’s operating performance.

Increased",1018,"Thank you, Rob. As John said, the partnership had a strong second quarter. Operating income increased 13% driven primarily by higher margins in natural gas liquids segment from favourable NGL price differentials between Con-way and Mont Belvieu. Increased transportation capacity available for optimization activities and higher NGL volumes gathered. 
Earnings also increased as a result of higher volumes in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segments, specifically in the Williston Basin, from the startup of the new Garden Creek I plant that went into service in late December. The Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment’s second quarter financial results were relatively unchanged. Our natural gas volumes gathered and processed in the Williston Basin were offset by lower natural gas and NGL product prices on the unhedged equity portion of these commodities. The new Garden Creek I plant continues to operate near its capacity of 100 million cubic feet per day. Operationally, the plant is exceeding our expectations and we continue on a record setting pace for new well connects in 2012. However, we have reduced the segment’s operating income guidance for 2012 primarily reflecting our expectation of lower net realized and expected commodity prices. We have provided those specific price assumptions in our earnings release. We still expect process volumes to be up 24% over last year and gathered volumes to be up 12% compared with last year. Low NGL prices did result in periods of ethane rejection in the midcontinent but did not have a material impact of this segment’s results. 
The natural gas pipeline segment’s second quarter results were higher due primarily to increased natural gas storage and transportation margins. 2012 guidance for this segment remains unchanged. Equity earnings from Northern Border pipeline are relatively flat. Northern Border is substantially contracted through March 2013 and has been successful in capturing 3 year or longer extensions as current contracts expire. It is also has two-thirds contracted on its long-haul capacity through 2014.
Our natural gas liquids segment continued to benefit from favourable NGL price differentials and more transportation capacity available for optimization activities and higher NGL volumes gathered. 
Our MB-1 fractionator was down for scheduled maintenance for 30 days in May and experienced some temporary mechanical issues preventing it from returning immediately to its 160,000 barrel per day capacity. As a result, our fractionation volumes were down 2% during the second quarter with the Mid-Continent fractionators making up some of the volumes that would have been fractionated in the Gulf Coast and increased volumes in the Mid-Continent. The partnership will realize margins from raw feed stored in the Gulf Coast as a result of the turnaround later in the year as we have forward sales in place. 
NGLs transported on our gathered lines were up 21%, averaging 523,000 barrels per day during the quarter. As a result of the increased NGL volumes gathered from the expansions Arbuckle pipeline and the Mid-Continent NGL gathering system in Texas and Western Oklahoma. 
We expect NGL gathering volumes to be up 22% over last year and fractionation volumes to be up 11% compared with the same period. We increased our operating income guidance for this segment to reflect higher than expected NGL optimization margins from increased NGL transportation capacity available for optimization activities and higher isomerisation margins. For the last six months of 2012, we have assumed $0.28 per gallon Con-way to Mont Belvieu average ethane in the ethane propane mix price differential.
Now, an update on our projects. First, all of our previously announced internal growth projects are within the forecasted project cost and timeline ranges. Second, last week we announced more internal growth projects totalling approximately $1 billion that now bring our 2011 to 2015 internal growth program from $5.7 billion to $6.6 billion. Our contractual dedications in the Williston Basin have grown to 2.7 million acres which is supporting the building of a new 100 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing facility, the Garden Creek II plant and related infrastructure. Upon completion, our processing capability in the Williston Basin will be approximately 500 million cubic feet per day.
We will also be installing additional pump stations on the Bakken NGL pipeline to increase its capacity to 135,000 barrels per day from an initial 60,000 barrels per day to take away liquids generated by our plants. We will be expanding our Gulf Coast fractionation capacity by constructing a new 75,000 barrel per day natural gas liquids fractionators MB-3 and related infrastructure at Mont Belvieu, Texas, plus the installation of a 40,000 barrel per day ethane, propane splitter at our Mont Belvieu storage facility. These projects are backed by firm supply commitments and area dedications.
Third, an update of our plan to build the 1300 mile Bakken Crude Express Pipeline. Discussions with crude oil producers indicate they project crude oil production to increase to well over 1 million barrels per day within the next five years requiring additional crude oil takeaway capacity. At the moment, we are in advanced stages of negotiations with two large anchor shippers who represent a majority of the 200,000 barrel per day initial pipeline capacity. We are also negotiating with multiple other producers for additional capacity. We expect to have committed in the near-term well before construction all the pipeline’s capacity that’s available for commitments. Final negotiations with the anchor tenants, as well as the open season results could increase the current pipeline capacity beyond 200,000 barrels. For obvious competitive reasons we are not disclosing the proposed rates at this time. However, it will be advantageous to rail with producers able to lock in rates for longer term compared with a contract for typical rail capacity. 
We continue to develop and evaluate a lengthy backlog of natural gas and NGL related infrastructure projects, including investments in processing plants, natural gas pipelines, NGL fractionation and storage facilities. Even with the recently announced projects totalling $1 billion, this backlog still totals more than $2 billion. 
As we have done in the past, we will announce the projects when we are sufficient producer and/or customer commitments to make them economically viable.
John, that concludes my remarks.

Over the past several months there certainly has been some downward pressure on NGL prices, primarily as a result of the following: an overall softening in",815,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Today I will provide a brief outlook of the NGL markets. Over the past several months there certainly has been some downward pressure on NGL prices, primarily as a result of the following: an overall softening in the crude oil markets, many of the petrochemical facilities were down for major scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, increased production growth in NGL rich sale areas and higher propane inventory levels due to a warmer than normal winter. 
With the major plant outages behind them the petchems have begun to consume the excess ethane inventory that has built-up and accordingly ethane inventories are expected to decline throughout the remainder of the year. The petchems expect to be operating at high utilization rates, well in excess of 90% with ethane as their primary feedstock. Ethane continues to be the preferred petrochemical feedstock versus oil-based feeds due to ethane’s continued price advantage driven by the continued low ethane to crude oil price ratio which is now well below 20%.
With new record, ethane consumption of well over 1 million barrels per day, we expect US ethane inventories in terms of days of supply to be back to within normal ranges as early as year end. We expect the price of ethane, particularly at Mont Belvieu to continue to strengthen in the near and longer term as it has recently. 
In particular, US Gulf coast petchem demand for purity ethane feed continues to grow and supplies of the traditional ethane propane mix continued to grow as well. This in our view is creating across our system an imbalance of excess ethane propane mix and not enough purity ethane to serve the petchems’ needs, accordingly the price relationship of ethane propane mix versus the premium price purity ethane has periodically widened to historical levels.
To meet the growing petrochemical demand for purity ethane, we have planned to construct a new facility in Mont Belvieu to slip purity ethane out of the traditional ethane propane mix. The new facility which is simply a specialized fractionator designed to fractionate an 80-20 ethane propane mix into purity will allow us to better serve our petrochemical customers, as well as compete more effectively for new markets and supplies.
A quick comment on propane. Due to the higher propane inventories, resulting primarily from the past mild winter and its reduced price relative to crude oil-based feeds, we have seen some petchems crack more propane compared with previous years. However with the petchems resuming normal operations following the major turnarounds, we are seeing some petrochemical facilities reduce their propane feed in favour of ethane. 
We do expect the propane surplus to decline as additional export capacity is developed over the next 12 months, with propane exports being maximized due to the continued pricing incentive for international propane buyers to purchase US Gulf Coast propane.
We also expect NGL fractionation capacity to remain in short supply but gradually increase as new fractionators including our own come online over the next few years. Fractionation capacity especially in the Gulf Coast is at a premium as growing unfractionated NGL supplies from the prolific shell developments, we continue to see the premium price to Gulf Coast NGL markets.
Accordingly, new pipeline capacity between Con-way and Mont Belvieu is being built to accommodate NGL growth from the shales. We continue to believe the NGL price differential between the market hubs will narrow to cost to build range of $0.08 to $0.10 per gallon over the next couple of years. 
In spite of the volatile and challenging commodity markets, we continue to focus on helping our supply and market connected customers get the products to where they need to be.
Our recently announced growth projects, the new MB-3 fractionator and EP splitter in Mont Belvieu and the expansion of the Bakken NGL pipeline are being built, so we can continue to provide reliable services to our customers through our integrated NGL asset base.
On the supply side, many rigs have moved away from dry gas regions and producers are focusing specifically on crude oil and liquids rich plays such as the Bakken, Cana-Woodford, Woodford, Granite Wash, Niobrara, Mississippian Lime and the Eagle Ford Shales. Fortunately, for us, our assets are well-positioned in all but one of these areas. While overall rig counts have decreased, rig counts in the Bakken and the Cana-Woodford especially in the core areas, where we operate are increasing.
As NGL growth continues at a rapid pace, we believe that over the next couple of years there will be some periodic oversupplies of ethane as new NGL production and infrastructure brings additional NGLs to market. 
As we approach and move through the 2015 through to 2017 timeframe, we do believe there will be sufficient demand for NGLs as new petrochemical expansions come on line and from growing Gulf Coast export activity.
John that concludes my remarks.

Before we take your questions I would like to add to what Rob said about our confidence in our dividend and distribution growth projections. 
Prices, especially lower ones, will affect ONEOK Partners earnings through our Percent of Proceeds contracts, particularly in our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing business. This commodity price risk will always be present in the gathering and processing business, which is why we have historically pursued hedging opportunities. However, as we continue to grow ONEOK Partners, the volume growth in our natural gas liquids and crude oil pipeline business will generate additional income that is fee-based and contracted on a shipper pay or fracker pay basis, significantly reducing future earnings risk.
I would also at this time like to thank our more than 4800 employees whose dedication and commitment allow us to operate our assets safely, reliably, and environmentally responsibly every day and create exceptional value for our investors and customers. Our entire management team appreciates their efforts to make our company successful.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize David Roth, our Senior Vice President of Administrative Services who will retire September 30. In his role he is responsible for IT, HR and corporate services. During his 33 years he has made countless contributions and many positive changes to our employee benefits, enhanced our IT capability dramatically, and advanced our employee development efforts. Through his leadership he has made ONEOK a much better place to work. During my 12 years at ONEOK, David has been a trusted and faithful colleague, but more importantly to me, over those years, one of my closest friends. With Dan assuming David’s responsibilities, I’m confident the Company will stay the course, but we will miss David Roth. 
So, on behalf of all ONEOK employees, we thank David for his contributions and wish him the best in his retirement years.
Operator, we are now ready to take questions.

One thing I would note and the comment was made well, we are going to - it’s seasonal, right. Sometimes, we are going to be significantly over the target range for coverage and sometimes a little under, and it will be because of market events that were not. 
They are transitory that we are not reacting to, but it was nice before when you had a whole slew of growth CapEx projects that were highly accretive and you happen to have a lot of extra cash flow. Now, that you are thinking about maybe a one-times coverage, and you just announced a week ago another $1 billion of CapEx, could you kind of speak to thoughts about how that might be financed?

We have changed our practice, because we haven't. I think what we were trying to do in our comments was to say that with sustained low pricing and keeping our distribution growth, we could see a one-times coverage. 
We are not saying that we are shifting from 1.05 to 1.15 and we are now going to set it at 1. So, I just want to be clear that, that was not the intention of our comments. Our comments were there is a lot of concern in low price environment, as to whether or not people are going to maintain their coverage ratio and grow their distribution. 
We believe in worst case that we may face if prices continue to remain low that we might be near that one. We might fall below that 1.05, but we are not rebasing the company to a one-times coverage ratio. 
So, I just want to be clear that we have not changed and we remain focused, and then there was a question earlier about which (inaudible) and our management team believes that what you would do is probably slow down your distribution growth in periods of extremely low price environment and maintain your coverage ratio. And then, of course, is your follow-on question about equity offering or additional financing. Even if we had those dates, we wouldn’t share them with you. 
So, I think you look at the balance sheet, although there is a lot of great things to be said about it clearly, at OKS, we need to raise some additional capital, some debt and we have got a great general partner and a company that likes to invest in ONEOK Partners. So, we see the capital markets being receptive to any demands we might put out there.

Pierce Norton, our Chief Operating Officer who will review the operating performance of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and update you on the partnership’s growth projects which I am pleased to say are on-time, on-budget and growing. And Terry Spencer, our President, who will update our NGL supply and demand outlook.
On this morning’s call, we will review our second quarter results and discuss our rationale for our updates to 2012 earnings guidance, reaffirm our ability to continue to grow ONEOK’s dividend and ONEOK Partners distribution over the next several years even in a lower commodity price environment, and update our progress with our growth projects, including our contracting status for the Bakken Crude Express pipeline and the $1 billion of additional projects we announced just last week.
Let’s start with our second quarter performance. ONEOK Partners turned in an exceptionally strong performance, driven by strong volume growth in the Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing businesses. Our Natural Gas Distribution segment turned in slightly higher results performing as expected and our energy services segment reported a loss because of the continuing challenges it faces in a low natural gas price environment with low price volatility.
Pierce will provide more detail on each segment’s operating performance in just a few minutes.
We updated our 2012 earnings guidance ranges increasing the range for ONEOK Partners to reflect our expectation of a continued strength of the natural gas liquids business. We decreased slightly the ONEOK guidance range to reflect lower than expected earnings at energy services and to a lesser extent the Natural Gas Distribution segment, partially offset by the strong contribution from the ONEOK Partners segment.
As Rob will discuss in a few minutes, we remain confident in our ability to grow ONEOK’s dividends and ONEOK Partners distributions over the next several years even with lower prices. The main driver of these increases will be the volume growth from ONEOK Partners capital investments. Since our last conference call, we have made a lot of progress contracting for our Bakken Crude Express pipeline, which Pierce will discuss in a few minutes. Demand for the capacity is strong and we may have opportunities to increase the pipeline’s capacity.
Rob will now review ONEOK’s financial highlights and then Pierce will review ONEOK’s operating performance. Rob?"

We comple",524,"ONEOK’s second quarter net income was $61 million compared with $55.1 million for the same period last year, driven primarily by the solid performance that ONEOK Partners offset partially by continued challenges in the Energy Services segment. We completed a 2:1 split of the company’s common stock on June 1, making our shares more accessible to a broader base of potential investors. Also in June, ONEOK executed $150 million accelerated share repurchase agreement funded by cash-on-hand and short-term borrowings, part of a Board approved $750 million share repurchase program through 2013, of which $300 million remain. Based on the repurchase of shares, we expect the average amount of diluted shares outstanding for 2012 to be approximately 211 million.
ONEOK’s year-to-date 2012 standalone cash flow report changes in working capital exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $82 million. In July, we declared a dividend of $0.33 per share on a split adjusted basis, an increase of 8% from the previous quarter.
With the partnership’s equity offering and private placement in March 2012, ONEOK as a general partner and significant limited partner owner is now expecting to receive $437 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners this year, a 31% increase over 2011.
We also updated 2012 guidance for ONEOK. Net income is expected to be in the range of $345 million to $375 million compared with its previous range of $360 million to $410 million. The updated guidance reflects lower expected earnings in the Energy Services and Natural Gas Distribution segments, offset partially by higher expected earnings in the ONEOK Partners segment. Pierce will discuss the specific guidance updates in a moment.
Our updated standalone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is expected to exceed capital expenditures and dividends by a range of $115 million to $145 million versus our previous guidance range of $155 million to $195 million. This change reflects our revised ONEOK earnings guidance. Today we are also affirming our expectation to increase the dividend by approximately 40% between 2012 and 2014 as incremental cash from the growth of ONEOK Partners flows to ONEOK. At our Investor Day in September, we will present our updated 3-year 2013 to 2015 projections that will include specific ranges for net income and dividend growth. We also expect to release 2013 financial guidance at that time.
ONEOK’s liquidity position remains good. At the end of the second quarter, on a standalone basis, we had $571.9 million of commercial paper outstanding, $22.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, with $626.4 million available under our $1.2 billion credit facility and our standalone total debt to capitalization ratio was 52%. ONEOK’s cash flow and liquidity position continue to give us excellent financial flexibility. ONEOK remains committed to providing sustainable value to our shareholders and solidifying our position as an attractive investment, whether it is by increasing our dividend, repurchasing ONEOK stock, and/or purchasing additional units of ONEOK Partners. We have used all of these options and don’t view them as mutually exclusive, and are fortunate to have the financial capability to do one or more under favourable conditions.
Now, Pierce will update you on ONEOK’s operating performance."

The distribution segment’s operating income guidance for 2012 has been slightly decreased to $215 million, reflecting lower margins due to warmer than normal weather.
Now a brief regulatory update. Kansas Gas Service filed a requested with the Kansas Corporation Commission to increase its overall annual revenues by $32.7 million. The request includes a $50.7 million increase in base rates and an $18 million reduction in amounts currently recovered through surcharges. If approved, we expect to implement new rates in January 2013.
In July 2012, Oklahoma Natural Gas received approval to increased base rates by $9.5 million annually. Our tariff was also modified, narrowing the range of allowed return on equity to between 10% and 11% compared with the previously approved range of 9.75% to 11.25%. So far in 2012, we have received approval for increasing totals of $10.1 million annually in various Texas jurisdictions under rate cases and capital recovery and cost of service mechanisms.
Now a brief overview of Energy Services. Second quarter 2012 earnings were reduced as a result of lower transportation margins impaired with 2011 and lower premium services’ margins due to lower natural gas prices. As we have said on previous earnings calls, we are aligning, or right-sizing the transportation and storage capacity to serve our premium services customers, which means we are turning back or renegotiating transportation in storage leases. We now expect our year-end 2012 natural gas storage position to be approximately 72 Bcf compared with our previous estimate of 65 Bcf.
We decreased guidance for the Energy Services segment to an operating loss of $60 million. This was primarily from the required $30 million non-cash reclassification of deferred losses to earnings on certain financial contracts related to our storage business, of which we have gains that will be recognized in earnings during 2012 and 2013 heating season, and the non-cash $10 million goodwill impairment charge. Both of these charges occurred in the first quarter 2012. This segment continues to be challenged by lower natural gas prices and volatility and narrow seasonal and location natural gas price differentials.

ONEOK Partners reported net income of $206.5 million, or $0.69 per unit compared with last year’s second quarter net income of $171.1 million, or $0.67 per unit. There were 219.8 million units outstanding for the second quarter this year compared with 203.8 million units outstanding for the same period in 2011. The equity offering and private placement in March 2012 included the issuance of 16 million additional units. Quarterly distributable cash flow increased 16% compared with the second quarter last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.29x. At the same time, we are increasing distributions to our unit holders. We increased the distribution $0.025 per unit for the second quarter and subject to Board approval, expect to increase another $0.025 per unit per quarter for the remainder of 2012.
The most common question we are asked relates to the potential impact of sustained low commodity prices, specifically NGL prices on our distribution growth rate. Based on a current forward-looking price tag developed by averaging Pyro and Wood MacKenzie prices for crude oil and natural gas and applying NGL price relationships to crude oil from CMAI, our average annual distribution growth rate would be at the low end of the 15% to 20% range for 2013 and 2014 with a coverage ratio of 1. Our long-term coverage ratio target remains at 1.05x to 1.15x. However, if low commodity prices are sustained our coverage ratios could be slightly below that. We will provide more specific price assumption with you at our Investor Day in September.
We have increased the partnership’s 2012 earnings guidance to a range of $860 million to $910 million compared with the previous range of $810 million to $870 million, reflecting higher earnings in the Natural Gas Liquids segment offset partially by lower expected earnings in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. We now estimate the partnership’s 2012 distributable cash flow to be in the range of $975 million to $1.025 billion, compared with its previous range of $925 million to $985 million.
We will also present ONEOK Partners’ updated three-year projections for 2013 to 2015 in September that will include specific ranges for EBITDA and distribution growth. We also expect to release 2013 financial guidance at that time.
We hedge the commodities received for our services to lock-in margins on our expected equity volumes in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. For the rest of 2012, 76% of our natural gas volumes are hedged, while 70% of our NGLs are hedged. Hedging information for 2013 is included in the news release.
At the end of the second quarter, the partnership had $92.9 million in cash, $24 million of commercial paper outstanding, a debt to capitalization ratio of 44%, and a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.3x. We extended the maturity date of our $1.2 billion revolving credit agreement by one year to August 2017.
Now, Pierce will review the partnership’s operating performance."

Increased transportation",1015,"As John said, the partnership had a strong second quarter. Operating income increased 13% driven primarily by higher margins in natural gas liquids segment from favourable NGL price differentials between Con-way and Mont Belvieu. Increased transportation capacity available for optimization activities and higher NGL volumes gathered.
Earnings also increased as a result of higher volumes in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segments, specifically in the Williston Basin, from the startup of the new Garden Creek I plant that went into service in late December. The Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment’s second quarter financial results were relatively unchanged. Our natural gas volumes gathered and processed in the Williston Basin were offset by lower natural gas and NGL product prices on the unhedged equity portion of these commodities. The new Garden Creek I plant continues to operate near its capacity of 100 million cubic feet per day. Operationally, the plant is exceeding our expectations and we continue on a record setting pace for new well connects in 2012. However, we have reduced the segment’s operating income guidance for 2012 primarily reflecting our expectation of lower net realized and expected commodity prices. We have provided those specific price assumptions in our earnings release. We still expect process volumes to be up 24% over last year and gathered volumes to be up 12% compared with last year. Low NGL prices did result in periods of ethane rejection in the midcontinent but did not have a material impact of this segment’s results.
The natural gas pipeline segment’s second quarter results were higher due primarily to increased natural gas storage and transportation margins. 2012 guidance for this segment remains unchanged. Equity earnings from Northern Border pipeline are relatively flat. Northern Border is substantially contracted through March 2013 and has been successful in capturing 3 year or longer extensions as current contracts expire. It is also has two-thirds contracted on its long-haul capacity through 2014.
Our natural gas liquids segment continued to benefit from favourable NGL price differentials and more transportation capacity available for optimization activities and higher NGL volumes gathered.
Our MB-1 fractionator was down for scheduled maintenance for 30 days in May and experienced some temporary mechanical issues preventing it from returning immediately to its 160,000 barrel per day capacity. As a result, our fractionation volumes were down 2% during the second quarter with the Mid-Continent fractionators making up some of the volumes that would have been fractionated in the Gulf Coast and increased volumes in the Mid-Continent. The partnership will realize margins from raw feed stored in the Gulf Coast as a result of the turnaround later in the year as we have forward sales in place.
NGLs transported on our gathered lines were up 21%, averaging 523,000 barrels per day during the quarter. As a result of the increased NGL volumes gathered from the expansions of Arbuckle pipeline and the Mid-Continent NGL gathering system in Texas and Western Oklahoma.
We expect NGL gathering volumes to be up 22% over last year and fractionation volumes to be up 11% compared with the same period. We increased our operating income guidance for this segment to reflect higher than expected NGL optimization margins from increased NGL transportation capacity available for optimization activities and higher isomerisation margins. For the last six months of 2012, we have assumed $0.28 per gallon Con-way to Mont Belvieu average ethane in the ethane propane mix price differential.
Now, an update on our projects. First, all of our previously announced internal growth projects are within the forecasted project cost and timeline ranges. Second, last week we announced more internal growth projects totalling approximately $1 billion that now bring our 2011 to 2015 internal growth program from $5.7 billion to $6.6 billion. Our contractual dedications in the Williston Basin have grown to 2.7 million acres which is supporting the building of a new 100 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing facility, the Garden Creek II plant and related infrastructure. Upon completion, our processing capability in the Williston Basin will be approximately 500 million cubic feet per day.
We will also be installing additional pump stations on the Bakken NGL pipeline to increase its capacity to 135,000 barrels per day from an initial 60,000 barrels per day to take away liquids generated by our plants. We will be expanding our Gulf Coast fractionation capacity by constructing a new 75,000 barrel per day natural gas liquids fractionators MB-3 and related infrastructure at Mont Belvieu, Texas, plus the installation of a 40,000 barrel per day ethane/propane splitter at our Mont Belvieu storage facility. These projects are backed by firm supply commitments and area dedications.
Third, an update of our plan to build the 1300 mile Bakken Crude Express Pipeline. Discussions with crude oil producers indicate they project crude oil production to increase to well over 1 million barrels per day within the next five years requiring additional crude oil takeaway capacity. At the moment, we are in advanced stages of negotiations with two large anchor shippers who represent a majority of the 200,000 barrel per day initial pipeline capacity. We are also negotiating with multiple other producers for additional capacity. We expect to have committed in the near-term well before construction all the pipeline’s capacity that’s available for commitments. Final negotiations with the anchor tenants, as well as the open season results could increase the current pipeline capacity beyond 200,000 barrels. For obvious competitive reasons we are not disclosing the proposed rates at this time. However, it will be advantageous to rail with producers able to lock in rates for longer term compared with a contract for typical rail capacity.
We continue to develop and evaluate a lengthy backlog of natural gas and NGL related infrastructure projects, including investments in processing plants, natural gas pipelines, NGL fractionation and storage facilities. Even with the recently announced projects totalling $1 billion, this backlog still totals more than $2 billion.
As we have done in the past, we will announce the projects when we are sufficient producer and/or customer commitments to make them economically viable.
John, that concludes my remarks."

Over the past several months there certainly has been some downward pressure on NGL prices, primarily as a result of the following: an overall softening in the crude oil markets, many of the petroch",807,"Today I will provide a brief outlook of the NGL markets. Over the past several months there certainly has been some downward pressure on NGL prices, primarily as a result of the following: an overall softening in the crude oil markets, many of the petrochemical facilities were down for major scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, increased production growth in NGL rich sale areas and higher propane inventory levels due to a warmer than normal winter.
With the major plant outages behind them the petchems have begun to consume the excess ethane inventory that has built-up and accordingly ethane inventories are expected to decline throughout the remainder of the year. The petchems expect to be operating at high utilization rates, well in excess of 90% with ethane as their primary feedstock. Ethane continues to be the preferred petrochemical feedstock versus oil-based feeds due to ethane’s continued price advantage driven by the continued low ethane to crude oil price ratio which is now well below 20%.
With near record, ethane consumption of well over 1 million barrels per day, we expect US ethane inventories in terms of days of supply to be back to within normal ranges as early as year end. We expect the price of ethane, particularly at Mont Belvieu to continue to strengthen in the near and longer term as it has recently.
In particular, US Gulf coast petchem demand for purity ethane feed continues to grow and supplies of the traditional ethane propane mix continued to grow as well. This in our view is creating across our system an imbalance of excess ethane propane mix and not enough purity ethane to serve the petchems’ needs, accordingly the price relationship of ethane propane mix versus the premium price purity ethane has periodically widened to historical levels.
To meet the growing petrochemical demand for purity ethane, we have planned to construct a new facility in Mont Belvieu to split purity ethane out of the traditional ethane propane mix. The new facility which is simply a specialized fractionator designed to fractionate an 80-20 ethane propane mix into purity will allow us to better serve our petrochemical customers, as well as compete more effectively for new markets and supplies.
A quick comment on propane. Due to the higher propane inventories, resulting primarily from the past mild winter and its reduced price relative to crude oil-based feeds, we have seen some petchems crack more propane compared with previous years. However with the petchems resuming normal operations following the major turnarounds, we are seeing some petrochemical facilities reduce their propane feed in favour of ethane.
We do expect the propane surplus to decline as additional export capacity is developed over the next 12 months, with propane exports being maximized due to the continued pricing incentive for international propane buyers to purchase US Gulf Coast propane.
We also expect NGL fractionation capacity to remain in short supply but gradually increase as new fractionators including our own come online over the next few years. Fractionation capacity especially in the Gulf Coast is at a premium as growing unfractionated NGL supplies from the prolific shell developments, continue to see the premium price to Gulf Coast NGL markets.
Accordingly, new pipeline capacity between Con-way and Mont Belvieu is being built to accommodate NGL growth from the sales. We continue to believe the NGL price differential between the market hubs will narrow to cost to build range of $0.08 to $0.10 per gallon over the next couple of years.
In spite of the volatile and challenging commodity markets, we continue to focus on helping our supply and market connected customers get the products to where they need to be.
Our recently announced growth projects, the new MB-3 fractionator and EP splitter in Mont Belvieu and the expansion of the Bakken NGL pipeline are being built, so we can continue to provide reliable services to our customers through our integrated NGL asset base.
On the supply side, many rigs have moved away from dry gas regions and producers are focusing specifically on crude oil and liquids rich plays such as the Bakken, Cana-Woodford, Woodford, Granite Wash, Niobrara, Mississippian Lime and the Eagle Ford Shales. Fortunately, for us, our assets are well-positioned in all but one of these areas. While overall rig counts have decreased, rig counts in the Bakken and the Cana-Woodford especially in the core areas, where we operate are increasing.
As NGL growth continues at a rapid pace, we believe that over the next couple of years there will be some periodic oversupplies of ethane as new NGL production and infrastructure brings additional NGLs to market.
As we approach and move through the 2015 to 2017 timeframe, we do believe there will be sufficient demand for NGLs as new petrochemical expansions come on line and from growing Gulf Coast export activity.
John that concludes my remarks."

Prices, especially lower ones, will affect ONEOK Partners earnings through our Percent of Proceeds contracts, particularly in our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing business. This commodity price risk will always be present in the gathering and processing business, which is why we have historically pursued hedging opportunities. However, as we continue to grow ONEOK Partners, the volume growth in our natural gas liquids and crude oil pipeline business will generate additional income that is fee-based and contracted on a shipper pay or fracker pay basis, significantly reducing future earnings risk.
I would also at this time like to thank our more than 4800 employees whose dedication and commitment allow us to operate our assets safely, reliably, and environmentally responsibly every day and create exceptional value for our investors and customers. Our entire management team appreciates their efforts to make our company successful.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize David Roth, our Senior Vice President of Administrative Services who will retire September 30. In his role he is responsible for IT, HR and corporate services. During his 33 years he has made countless contributions and many positive changes to our employee benefits, enhanced our IT capability dramatically, and advanced our employee development efforts. Through his leadership he has made ONEOK a much better place to work. During my 12 years at ONEOK, David has been a trusted and faithful colleague, but more importantly to me, over those years, one of my closest friends. With Dan assuming David’s responsibilities, I’m confident the Company will stay the course, but we will miss David Roth.
So, on behalf of all ONEOK employees, we thank David for his contributions and wish him the best in his retirement years.

Our comments were there is a lot of concern in low price environment, as to whether or not people are going to maintain their coverage ratio and grow their distribution.
We believe worst case that we may face if prices continue to remain low that we might be near that one. We might fall below that 1.05, but we are not rebasing the company to a one-times coverage ratio.

As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Joining me today are Rob Martinovich, our Chief Financial Officer who will review our quarterly financial performance and discuss our updated earnings guidance; Pierce Norton, our Chief Operating Officer who will review the operating performance of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and update you on the partnership’s growth projects which I am pleased to say are on-time, on-budget and growing; and Terry Spencer, our President, who will update our NGL supply and demand outlook.
On this morning’s call, we will review our second quarter results and discuss our rationale for our updates to 2012 earnings guidance, reaffirm our ability to continue to grow ONEOK’s dividend and ONEOK Partners distribution over the next several years even in a lower commodity price environment, and update our progress with our growth projects, including our contracting status for the Bakken Crude Express pipeline and the $1 billion of additional projects we announced just last week.
Let’s start with our second quarter performance. ONEOK Partners turned in an exceptionally strong performance, driven by strong volume growth in the Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing businesses. Our Natural Gas Distribution segment turned in slightly higher results performing as expected and our energy services segment reported a loss because of the continuing challenges it faces in a low natural gas price environment with low price volatility.
Pierce will provide more detail on each segment’s operating performance in just a few minutes.
We updated our 2012 earnings guidance ranges increasing the range for ONEOK Partners to reflect our expectation of a continued strength of the natural gas liquids business. We decreased slightly the ONEOK guidance range to reflect lower than expected earnings at energy services and to a lesser extent the Natural Gas Distribution segment, partially offset by the strong contribution from the ONEOK Partners segment.
As Rob will discuss in a few minutes, we remain confident in our ability to grow ONEOK’s dividends and ONEOK Partners distributions over the next several years even with lower prices. The main driver of these increases will be the volume growth from ONEOK Partners capital investments. Since our last conference call, we have made a lot of progress contracting for our Bakken Crude Express pipeline, which Pierce will discuss in a few minutes. Demand for the capacity is strong and we may have opportunities to increase the pipeline’s capacity.
Rob will now review ONEOK’s financial highlights and then Pierce will review ONEOK’s operating performance. Rob?"
293889,146298734,338909,"ONEOK Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2012",2012-08-01,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. ONEOK’s second quarter net income was $61 million compared with $55.1 million for the same period last year, driven primarily by the solid performance that ONEOK Partners offset partially by continued challenges",529,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. ONEOK’s second quarter net income was $61 million compared with $55.1 million for the same period last year, driven primarily by the solid performance that ONEOK Partners offset partially by continued challenges in the Energy Services segment. We completed a 2:1 split of the company’s common stock on June 1, making our shares more accessible to a broader base of potential investors. Also in June, ONEOK executed $150 million accelerated share repurchase agreement funded by cash-on-hand and short-term borrowings, part of a Board approved $750 million share repurchase program through 2013, of which $300 million remain. Based on the repurchase of shares, we expect the average amount of diluted shares outstanding for 2012 to be approximately 211 million.
ONEOK’s year-to-date 2012 standalone cash flow report changes in working capital exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $82 million. In July, we declared a dividend of $0.33 per share on a split adjusted basis, an increase of 8% from the previous quarter.
With the partnership’s equity offering and private placement in March 2012, ONEOK as a general partner and significant limited partner owner is now expecting to receive $437 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners this year, a 31% increase over 2011.
We also updated 2012 guidance for ONEOK. Net income is expected to be in the range of $345 million to $375 million compared with its previous range of $360 million to $410 million. The updated guidance reflects lower expected earnings in the Energy Services and Natural Gas Distribution segments, offset partially by higher expected earnings in the ONEOK Partners segment. Pierce will discuss the specific guidance updates in a moment.
Our updated standalone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is expected to exceed capital expenditures and dividends by a range of $115 million to $145 million versus our previous guidance range of $155 million to $195 million. This change reflects our revised ONEOK earnings guidance. Today we are also affirming our expectation to increase the dividend by approximately 40% between 2012 and 2014 as incremental cash from the growth of ONEOK Partners flows to ONEOK. At our Investor Day in September, we will present our updated 3-year 2013 to 2015 projections that will include specific ranges for net income and dividend growth. We also expect to release 2013 financial guidance at that time.
ONEOK’s liquidity position remains good. At the end of the second quarter, on a standalone basis, we had $571.9 million of commercial paper outstanding, $22.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, with $626.4 million available under our $1.2 billion credit facility and our standalone total debt to capitalization ratio was 52%. ONEOK’s cash flow and liquidity position continue to give us excellent financial flexibility. ONEOK remains committed to providing sustainable value to our shareholders and solidifying our position as an attractive investment, whether it is by increasing our dividend, repurchasing ONEOK stock, and/or purchasing additional units of ONEOK Partners. We have used all of these options and don’t view them as mutually exclusive, and are fortunate to have the financial capability to do one or more under favorable conditions.
Now, Pierce will update you on ONEOK’s operating performance."

Starting with our Natural Gas Distribution segment, second quarter 2012 earnings was up slightly due to higher rates and surcharge recoveries driven by regulatory activity in Texas and Kansas. The distribution segment’s operating income guidance for 2012 has been slightly decreased to $215 million, reflecting lower margins due to warmer than normal weather.
Now a brief regulatory update. Kansas Gas Service filed a requested with the Kansas Corporation Commission to increase its overall annual revenues by $32.7 million. The request includes a $50.7 million increase in base rates and an $18 million reduction in amounts currently recovered through surcharges. If approved, we expect to implement new rates in January 2013.
In July 2012, Oklahoma Natural Gas received approval to increased base rates by $9.5 million annually. Our tariff was also modified, narrowing the range of allowed return on equity to between 10% and 11% compared with the previously approved range of 9.75% to 11.25%. So far in 2012, we have received approval for increasing totals of $10.1 million annually in various Texas jurisdictions under rate cases and capital recovery and cost of service mechanisms.
Now a brief overview of Energy Services. Second quarter 2012 earnings were reduced as a result of lower transportation margins impaired with 2011 and lower premium services’ margins due to lower natural gas prices. As we have said on previous earnings calls, we are aligning, or right-sizing the transportation and storage capacity to serve our premium services customers, which means we are turning back or renegotiating transportation in storage leases. We now expect our year-end 2012 natural gas storage position to be approximately 72 Bcf compared with our previous estimate of 65 Bcf.
We decreased guidance for the Energy Services segment to an operating loss of $60 million. This was primarily from the required $30 million non-cash reclassification of deferred losses to earnings on certain financial contracts related to our storage business, of which we have gains that will be recognized in earnings during 2012 and 2013 heating season, and the non-cash $10 million goodwill impairment charge. Both of these charges occurred in the first quarter 2012. This segment continues to be challenged by lower natural gas prices and volatility and narrow seasonal and location natural gas price differentials.
John, that concludes my remarks for ONEOK."

In the second quarter, ONEOK Partners net income increased 21% compared with the second quarter of 2011, driven by higher natural gas liquids operating results. ONEOK Partners reported net income of $206.5 million, or $0.69 per unit compared with last year’s second quarter net income of $171.1 million, or $0.67 per unit. There were 219.8 million units outstanding for the second quarter this year compared with 203.8 million units outstanding for the same period in 2011. The equity offering and private placement in March 2012 included the issuance of 16 million additional units. Quarterly distributable cash flow increased 16% compared with the second quarter last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.29x. At the same time, we are increasing distributions to our unit holders. We increased the distribution $0.025 per unit for the second quarter and subject to Board approval, expect to increase another $0.025 per unit per quarter for the remainder of 2012.
The most common question we are asked relates to the potential impact of sustained low commodity prices, specifically NGL prices on our distribution growth rate. Based on a current forward-looking price tag developed by averaging Pyro and Wood MacKenzie prices for crude oil and natural gas and applying NGL price relationships to crude oil from CMAI, our average annual distribution growth rate would be at the low end of the 15% to 20% range for 2013 and 2014 with a coverage ratio of 1. Our long-term coverage ratio target remains at 1.05x to 1.15x. However, if low commodity prices are sustained our coverage ratios could be slightly below that. We will provide more specific price assumption with you at our Investor Day in September.
We have increased the partnership’s 2012 earnings guidance to a range of $860 million to $910 million compared with the previous range of $810 million to $870 million, reflecting higher earnings in the Natural Gas Liquids segment offset partially by lower expected earnings in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. We now estimate the partnership’s 2012 distributable cash flow to be in the range of $975 million to $1.025 billion, compared with its previous range of $925 million to $985 million.
We will also present ONEOK Partners’ updated 3-year projections for 2013 to 2015 in September that will include specific ranges for EBITDA and distribution growth. We also expect to release 2013 financial guidance at that time.
We hedge the commodities received for our services to lock-in margins on our expected equity volumes in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. For the rest of 2012, 76% of our natural gas volumes are hedged, while 70% of our NGLs are hedged. Hedging information for 2013 is included in the news release.
At the end of the second quarter, the partnership had $92.9 million in cash, $24 million of commercial paper outstanding, a debt to capitalization ratio of 44%, and a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.3x. We extended the maturity date of our $1.2 billion revolving credit agreement by one year to August 2017.

293889,146298734,338909,"ONEOK Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2012",2012-08-01,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob. As John said, the partnership had a strong second quarter. Operating income increased 13% driven primarily by higher margins in natural gas liquids segment from favorable NGL price differentials between Con-way and Mont Belvieu. Increased",1018,"Thank you, Rob. As John said, the partnership had a strong second quarter. Operating income increased 13% driven primarily by higher margins in natural gas liquids segment from favorable NGL price differentials between Con-way and Mont Belvieu. Increased transportation capacity available for optimization activities and higher NGL volumes gathered.
Earnings also increased as a result of higher volumes in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segments, specifically in the Williston Basin, from the startup of the new Garden Creek I plant that went into service in late December. The Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment’s second quarter financial results were relatively unchanged. Our natural gas volumes gathered and processed in the Williston Basin were offset by lower natural gas and NGL product prices on the unhedged equity portion of these commodities. The new Garden Creek I plant continues to operate near its capacity of 100 million cubic feet per day. 
Operationally, the plant is exceeding our expectations and we continue on a record setting pace for new well connects in 2012. However, we have reduced the segment’s operating income guidance for 2012 primarily reflecting our expectation of lower net realized and expected commodity prices. We have provided those specific price assumptions in our earnings release. We still expect process volumes to be up 24% over last year and gathered volumes to be up 12% compared with last year. Low NGL prices did result in periods of ethane rejection in the midcontinent but did not have a material impact of this segment’s results.
The natural gas pipeline segment’s second quarter results were higher due primarily to increased natural gas storage and transportation margins. 2012 guidance for this segment remains unchanged. Equity earnings from Northern Border pipeline are relatively flat. Northern Border is substantially contracted through March 2013 and has been successful in capturing 3 year or longer extensions as current contracts expire. It is also has 2/3 contracted on its long-haul capacity through 2014.
Our natural gas liquids segment continued to benefit from favorable NGL price differentials and more transportation capacity available for optimization activities and higher NGL volumes gathered.
Our MB-1 fractionator was down for scheduled maintenance for 30 days in May and experienced some temporary mechanical issues preventing it from returning immediately to its 160,000 barrel per day capacity. As a result, our fractionation volumes were down 2% during the second quarter with the Mid-Continent fractionators making up some of the volumes that would have been fractionated in the Gulf Coast and increased volumes in the Mid-Continent. The partnership will realize margins from raw feed stored in the Gulf Coast as a result of the turnaround later in the year as we have forward sales in place.
NGLs transported on our gathered lines were up 21%, averaging 523,000 barrels per day during the quarter. As a result of the increased NGL volumes gathered from the expansions of Arbuckle pipeline and the Mid-Continent NGL gathering system in Texas and Western Oklahoma.
We expect NGL gathering volumes to be up 22% over last year and fractionation volumes to be up 11% compared with the same period. We increased our operating income guidance for this segment to reflect higher than expected NGL optimization margins from increased NGL transportation capacity available for optimization activities and higher isomerisation margins. For the last 6 months of 2012, we have assumed $0.28 per gallon Con-way to Mont Belvieu average ethane in the ethane propane mix price differential.
Now, an update on our projects. First, all of our previously announced internal growth projects are within the forecasted project cost and timeline ranges. Second, last week we announced more internal growth projects totaling approximately $1 billion that now bring our 2011 to 2015 internal growth program from $5.7 billion to $6.6 billion. Our contractual dedications in the Williston Basin have grown to 2.7 million acres which is supporting the building of a new 100 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing facility, the Garden Creek II plant and related infrastructure. Upon completion, our processing capability in the Williston Basin will be approximately 500 million cubic feet per day.
We will also be installing additional pump stations on the Bakken NGL pipeline to increase its capacity to 135,000 barrels per day from an initial 60,000 barrels per day to take away liquids generated by our plants. We will be expanding our Gulf Coast fractionation capacity by constructing a new 75,000 barrel per day natural gas liquids fractionators MB-3 and related infrastructure at Mont Belvieu, Texas, plus the installation of a 40,000 barrel per day ethane/propane splitter at our Mont Belvieu storage facility. These projects are backed by firm supply commitments and area dedications.
Third, an update of our plan to build the 1300 mile Bakken Crude Express Pipeline. Discussions with crude oil producers indicate they project crude oil production to increase to well over 1 million barrels per day within the next 5 years requiring additional crude oil takeaway capacity. At the moment, we are in advanced stages of negotiations with 2 large anchor shippers who represent a majority of the 200,000 barrel per day initial pipeline capacity. We are also negotiating with multiple other producers for additional capacity. We expect to have committed in the near-term well before construction all the pipeline’s capacity that’s available for commitments. Final negotiations with the anchor tenants, as well as the open season results could increase the current pipeline capacity beyond 200,000 barrels. For obvious competitive reasons we are not disclosing the proposed rates at this time. However, it will be advantageous to rail with producers able to lock in rates for longer term compared with a contract for typical rail capacity.
We continue to develop and evaluate a lengthy backlog of natural gas and NGL related infrastructure projects, including investments in processing plants, natural gas pipelines, NGL fractionation and storage facilities. Even with the recently announced projects totaling $1 billion, this backlog still totals more than $2 billion.
As we have done in the past, we will announce the projects when we are sufficient producer and/or customer commitments to make them economically viable.
John, that concludes my remarks."

Today I will provide a brief outlook of the NGL markets. Over the past several months there certainly has been some downward pressure on NGL prices, primarily as a result of the following: an overall softening in",813,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Today I will provide a brief outlook of the NGL markets. Over the past several months there certainly has been some downward pressure on NGL prices, primarily as a result of the following: an overall softening in the crude oil markets, many of the petrochemical facilities were down for major scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, increased production growth in NGL rich sale areas and higher propane inventory levels due to a warmer than normal winter.
With the major plant outages behind them the petchems have begun to consume the excess ethane inventory that has built-up and accordingly ethane inventories are expected to decline throughout the remainder of the year. The petchems expect to be operating at high utilization rates, well in excess of 90% with ethane as their primary feedstock. Ethane continues to be the preferred petrochemical feedstock versus oil-based feeds due to ethane’s continued price advantage driven by the continued low ethane to crude oil price ratio which is now well below 20%.
With near record, ethane consumption of well over 1 million barrels per day, we expect U.S. ethane inventories in terms of days of supply to be back to within normal ranges as early as year end. We expect the price of ethane, particularly at Mont Belvieu to continue to strengthen in the near and longer term as it has recently.
In particular, U.S. Gulf coast petchem demand for purity ethane feed continues to grow and supplies of the traditional ethane propane mix continued to grow as well. This in our view is creating across our system an imbalance of excess ethane propane mix and not enough purity ethane to serve the petchems’ needs, accordingly the price relationship of ethane propane mix versus the premium price purity ethane has periodically widened to historical levels.
To meet the growing petrochemical demand for purity ethane, we have planned to construct a new facility in Mont Belvieu to split purity ethane out of the traditional ethane propane mix. The new facility which is simply a specialized fractionator designed to fractionate an 80-20 ethane propane mix into purity will allow us to better serve our petrochemical customers, as well as compete more effectively for new markets and supplies.
A quick comment on propane. Due to the higher propane inventories, resulting primarily from the past mild winter and its reduced price relative to crude oil-based feeds, we have seen some petchems crack more propane compared with previous years. However with the petchems resuming normal operations following the major turnarounds, we are seeing some petrochemical facilities reduce their propane feed in favor of ethane.
We do expect the propane surplus to decline as additional export capacity is developed over the next 12 months, with propane exports being maximized due to the continued pricing incentive for international propane buyers to purchase U.S. Gulf Coast propane.
We also expect NGL fractionation capacity to remain in short supply but gradually increase as new fractionators including our own come online over the next few years. Fractionation capacity especially in the Gulf Coast is at a premium as growing unfractionated NGL supplies from the prolific shell developments, continue to see the premium price to Gulf Coast NGL markets.
Accordingly, new pipeline capacity between Con-way and Mont Belvieu is being built to accommodate NGL growth from the sales. We continue to believe the NGL price differential between the market hubs will narrow to cost to build range of $0.08 to $0.10 per gallon over the next couple of years.
In spite of the volatile and challenging commodity markets, we continue to focus on helping our supply and market connected customers get the products to where they need to be.
Our recently announced growth projects, the new MB-3 fractionator and EP splitter in Mont Belvieu and the expansion of the Bakken NGL pipeline are being built, so we can continue to provide reliable services to our customers through our integrated NGL asset base.
On the supply side, many rigs have moved away from dry gas regions and producers are focusing specifically on crude oil and liquids rich plays such as the Bakken, Cana-Woodford, Woodford, Granite Wash, Niobrara, Mississippian Lime and the Eagle Ford Shales. Fortunately, for us, our assets are well-positioned in all but one of these areas. While overall rig counts have decreased, rig counts in the Bakken and the Cana-Woodford especially in the core areas, where we operate are increasing.
As NGL growth continues at a rapid pace, we believe that over the next couple of years there will be some periodic oversupplies of ethane as new NGL production and infrastructure brings additional NGLs to market.
As we approach and move through the 2015 to 2017 timeframe, we do believe there will be sufficient demand for NGLs as new petrochemical expansions come on line and from growing Gulf Coast export activity.
John, that concludes my remarks."

Before we take your questions I would like to add to what Rob said about our confidence in our dividend and distribution growth projections.
Prices, especially lower ones, will affect ONEOK Partners earnings through our Percent of Proceeds contracts, particularly in our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing business. This commodity price risk will always be present in the gathering and processing business, which is why we have historically pursued hedging opportunities. However, as we continue to grow ONEOK Partners, the volume growth in our natural gas liquids and crude oil pipeline business will generate additional income that is fee-based and contracted on a shipper pay or fracker pay basis, significantly reducing future earnings risk.
I would also at this time like to thank our more than 4800 employees whose dedication and commitment allow us to operate our assets safely, reliably, and environmentally responsibly every day and create exceptional value for our investors and customers. Our entire management team appreciates their efforts to make our company successful.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize David Roth, our Senior Vice President of Administrative Services who will retire September 30. In his role he is responsible for IT, HR and corporate services. During his 33 years he has made countless contributions and many positive changes to our employee benefits, enhanced our IT capability dramatically, and advanced our employee development efforts. Through his leadership he has made ONEOK a much better place to work. During my 12 years at ONEOK, David has been a trusted and faithful colleague, but more importantly to me, over those years, one of my closest friends. With Dan assuming David’s responsibilities, I’m confident the Company will stay the course, but we will miss David Roth.
So, on behalf of all ONEOK employees, we thank David for his contributions and wish him the best in his retirement years.

It is not going to be perfectly smooth and certainly, we will have these periods of time where we will have excess ethane. When many of the analysts analyze this ethane supply and demand balance, they would make the assumption that everyone of these fractionators that are coming on are going to be full day one, or at least get full at some point in time. That may not happen in every case. And as a result, it is going to make it kind of difficult to predict those supply and demand balances during that timeframe. And so, it really is going to look kind of lumpy, and we will have periods where the crackers will need everything we can give them, and they will consume everything we can give them, and other times, where they don't. So, we will have to weather that. It will be volatile. And we are well-positioned through that volatile timeframe and by the time, we make it to 2015, 2017, we will be in really good shape."

Joining me today are Rob Martinovich, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our quarterly  financial performance; Pierce Norton, our Chief Operating Officer, who will review our operating performance and update you on the partnership’s growth projects, which are on time and on budget; and Terry Spencer, our President, who will discuss our NGL supply and demand outlook. On this morning's call, we will review our third quarter results, discuss our affirmation of our 2012 earnings guidance and update our progress with our growth projects, including the projects we have recently completed and an update on the Bakken crude express pipeline. So let's start with our third quarter performance.
ONEOK Partners turned in a solid performance, driven by strong volume growth in the natural gas liquids and natural gas gathering and processing businesses. Partnerships volume growth is driven by our past capital investments, and we expect continued volume growth as a result of our current capital projects. 
Our Natural Gas Distribution segment turned in slightly lower results, and our Energy Services segment reported a loss, due to the continuing challenges it faces in a low natural gas price environment. Pierce will provide more detail in each segments operating performance in just a few minutes.
Yesterday, we affirmed our 2012 earnings guidance ranges, reflecting our confidence in both the natural gas liquids and the natural gas gathering and processing businesses of the partnership. However, we do expect to be in the lower half of the ONEOK net income guidance range, due to the difficult market conditions our Energy Services segment continues to experience. 
As Rob will discuss in a few minutes, we remain confident in our ability to grow both ONEOK's dividends and ONEOK Partners distributions over the next several years, even in a lower commodity price environment. The main driver of these increases will be volume growth at ONEOK Partners, as a result of our announced capital investments.
At this time, Rob will now review ONEOK's financial highlights, and then Pierce will review ONEOK's operating performance. Rob?"

ONEOK's third quarter net income was $65.2 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with $60.3 million, or $0.28 per diluted share for the same period last year, driven primarily by the solid performance at ONEOK Partners and growth in natural gas and natural gas liquids volumes. This was offset partially by lower realized natural gas and NGL product prices, lower NGL optimization margin and continued challenges in the Energy Services segment. 
In September, ONEOK completed its $150 million accelerated share repurchase agreement, leaded by cash on hand and short-term borrowings. Part of the Board approved $750 million share repurchase program through 2013, of which $300 million remains. Based on the repurchase of shares, we expect the average amount of diluted shares outstanding for 2012 to be approximately $211 million.
ONEOK's year-to-date 2012 stand-alone cash flow before changes in working capital exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $87 million. We expect our stand-alone cash flow before changes in the working capital in excess of capital expenditures and dividend payments for 2012 to be at the low end of the $115 million to $145 million range. 
In October, we declared a dividend of $0.33 per share, unchanged from the previous quarter. As John mentioned, our 2012 net income guidance is now expected to be in the lower half of the $345 million to $375 million range, due continued difficult market conditions for our Energy Services segment. 
At the end of the third quarter, on a stand-alone basis, we had $677 million of commercial paper outstanding, $15 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $521 million available under our $1.2 billion credit facility, and our stand-alone total debt to capitalization ratio was 54%.
ONEOK's cash flow and liquidity position continued to give us financial flexibility to increase our dividend, repurchase ONEOK stock and to repurchase additional units of ONEOK Partners. We have used all of these options and don't view them as mutually exclusive, and are fortunate to have the financial capability to do one or more under favorable conditions. 
Now Pierce will update you on ONEOK's operating performance."

Third quarter 2012 earnings came in slightly lower-than-expected. Net margins benefited from higher rates, but higher share-based compensation costs more than offset those increases. 
A brief regulatory update. Last week, Kansas Gas Service reached a settlement with the Kansas Corporation Commission staff and the Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board, which have approved by the Kansas Corporation Commission, that result in a $28 million increase in base rates and an $18 million reduction in amounts currently recovered through surcharges, effectively increasing its annual revenues by a net amount of $10 million. The Kansas Corporation Commission is expected to make a final ruling by January 2013. Energy Services third quarter 2013 earnings were lower-than-expected, as the segment continues to be challenged by narrow seasonal and location natural gas price differentials.
Transportation margins were down primarily due to lower hedge settlements in 2012 and the premium service margins were down due to lower demand fees. We continue to realign Energy Services leased transportation and storage capacity to serve our premium service customers, which means we are not renewing certain transportation and storage leases.
John, that concludes my remarks for ONEOK."

In the third quarter, ONEOK Partners net income increased 11%, compared with the third quarter of 2011, due primarily to volume growth in the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segment. ONEOK Partners reported net income of $232.3 million, or $0.78 per unit, compared with last year's third quarter net income of $209.7 million or $0.84 per unit. There were 219.8 million units outstanding for the third quarter this year, compared with 203.8 million units outstanding for the same period in 2011.
The equity offering and private placement in March 2012 included the issuance of 16 million additional units. Quality distributable cash flow increased 12% compared with the third quarter last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.34x. We increased the distribution 2.5 cents per unit for the third quarter, an increase of 4%. And subject to Board approval, we expect to increase another 2.5 cents per unit for the fourth quarter of 2012. In our recent Investor Day, we announced that we expect to increase declared distribution $0.02 per unit per quarter for 2013, subject to Board approval.
We've affirmed the partnership's 2012 guidance ranges of net income of $860 million to $910 million and distributable will cash flow of $975 million to $1.025 billion.
In September, ONEOK Partners completed a $1.3 billion public offering of senior notes, consisting of $400 million of 5-year senior notes at 2% and $900 million of 10-year senior notes at 3 3/8%. Interest expense for the third quarter was $47.8 million, compared with $55.7 million in the same period last year.  This decrease was primarily driven by higher capitalized interest related to the partnership's capital expenditures associated with our $5.7 billion to $6.6 billion growth program. The amount of interest expense capitalized are now noted on the income statement.
We hedged the commodities we received for our services to lock in margins on our expected equity volumes in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. For the rest of 2012, 77% of our natural gas volumes were hedged, while 71% of our NGLs are hedged. Hedging information for 2013 and 2014 is included in the news release.
At the end of the third quarter, the partnership had $964 million in cash and cash equivalents with no commercial paper or borrowings outstanding with debt to capitalization ratio of 52% and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.9x.

As John said, the partnership continue to perform well in the third quarter. Operating income was up, due primarily to higher natural gas volumes gathered and processed in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment, offset partially by lower realized natural gas and natural gas liquids product prices particularly ethane and propane. The Natural Gas Liquids segment benefited from higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated, offset partially by decreased optimization and marketing margins.
The natural gas gathering and processing segment's third quarter financial results were higher due primarily to volume growth, driven by increased drilling activity in our Williston Basin assets. Lower realized natural gas and NGL product prices on our unhedged portion of these commodities and higher compression and processing cost associated with the volume growth partially offset these increases.
The Garden Creek plant continues to operate in its capacity of 100 million cubic feet per day. Our 100 million cubic feet per day State Line 1 natural gas processing plant in the Williston Basin started in September. And we expect this plant to be at capacity by early next year.  For the year, we expect process volumes to be up 25% compared with 2011, and gathered volumes the be up 12% compared with 2011.
Lower NGL prices that result in periods of ethane rejection in the Mid-Continent, but did not have a material impact of the segments results. We continue on a record-setting pace for a new well connections and expect to connect more than 900 wells this year. During the third quarter, we connected approximately 280 wells to our system, compared with approximately 180 in the same period last year. This brings our year-to-date total 2012 to approximately 710, compared with approximately 420 in the same period last year. 
As of mid-October, rig count in North Dakota was at 186, a 15% reduction compared with an all-time high of 218 during May 2012. The largest factor driving this decrease is producers achieving significant increases in drilling efficiencies, where  a combination of newer, more efficient rigs and produces moving from single well sites to multipad drilling, spud to spud dates have decreased to 25 days or less from a historical average of 30 to 35 days. a 25% efficiency improvement, allowing producers to drill more wells with fewer rigs. The natural gas pipelines segment third quarter financial results were relatively unchanged, due primarily to higher contracted capacity with natural gas producers and our intrastate pipelines, offset by higher outside service cost associated with maintenance projects and higher employee-related costs. 
Equity earnings from Northern Border Pipeline were slightly lower. Northern Border is substantially contracted on its long-haul capacity through March 2014. Results of recontracted long-haul capacity with terms of 3 years or longer now 74% sold through the end of 2014.
In September 2012, Northern Border filed with the FERC a settlement with its customers to modify its transportation rates beginning in January 2013. This settlement is expected to be approved by the FERC before the end of the year. If approved, the long-term transportation rates will be approximately 11% lower than current rates. These lower rates were included in our recently announced 2013 financial guidance.
Our natural gas liquids segment benefited from higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated and higher isomerization margins, resulting from wide price differentials between normal butane and isobutane and higher isomerization volumes. As expected, we experienced lower optimization and marketing margins from narrow NGL priced differentials. And lower NGL transportation capacity available for optimization activities as more transportation capacity between the Conway and Mont Belvieu NGL market centers is contracted to produce fee-based earnings. The partnership also realized margins in the third quarter from the sale of NGL inventory held at the end of the second quarter of 2012, associated with the scheduled maintenance of the Mont Belvieu NGL fractionation facility MB-1, which returned to full capacity in late September. 
NGL's transported on our gathering lines were up 20%, averaging 530,000 barrels per day during the quarter. As a result of increased production through existing supply connections and new supply connections in the Mid-Continent and the Rocky Mountain regions 
For the year, we expect NGL gathering volumes to be up 22% over last year and fractionation volumes to be up 11% compared with last year. For the fourth quarter 2012, we are assuming a $0.10 per gallon Conway-to-Mont Belvieu average ethane price differential in the ethane/propane mix. A reminder, the ethane price differential is only one part of the optimization picture. Our integrated NGL assets and day-to-day business strategies provide us with opportunities to generate incremental margins with other and gel products. Now an update on our projects. 
First, all of our previously announced internal growth projects are on budget and on schedule. As I were previously mentioned, the Stateline 1 natural gas processing plant started in late September. Additionally, the 60,000 barrels per day expansion of our fractionator in Bushton, Kansas was also completed in September ahead of schedule. 
Several other projects are approaching completion, including the 60,000-barrel per day Bakken NGL pipeline and the Stateline II natural gas processing plant, both expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2013. We are currently conducting an open season process on our 1,300-mile Bakken crude oil expense line. We expect the process to conclude November 20. We continue to see interest in the pipeline and expect to announce the results after the Thanksgiving holiday.
Finally, we continue to develop and evaluate our backlog of natural gas and NGL-related infrastructure projects to still total more than 2 billion. These includes investments and processing plants, natural gas pipelines and NGL fractionation and storage facilities. As we have done in the past, we will announce the projects when we have significant producer and/or customer commitments to make them economically viable.
John, that concludes my remarks."

Today, I'll provide a brief outlook of the NGL markets.Over the past several months, NGL prices have somewhat stabilized, primarily as a result of increasing demand, as numerous petrochemical facilities return t",749,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide a brief outlook of the NGL markets.
Over the past several months, NGL prices have somewhat stabilized, primarily as a result of increasing demand, as numerous petrochemical facilities return to service after being down earlier in the year for major scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. 
Production growth from shale drilling continues in NGL rich supply areas with some limited ethane rejection occurring primarily in the Rockies to Mid-Continent and Midwest, due mainly to weak ethane prices at the Conway market center.
The U.S. Gulf Coast NGL inventory levels, especially for ethane and propane, are decreasing, as consumers, particularly the petrochemical manufacturers and international markets, continued to exhibit strong demand to take advantage of the attractive low price environment. With the major plant outages behind them, the petchems are consuming the excess ethane inventory, and we expect this drawdown to continue throughout the remainder of this year and into 2013.
The petchems are operating at higher utilization rates, with ethane as their primary feedstock, and we see no signs of that slowing down. Ethane continues to be the preferred petrochemical feedstock versus oil-based feeds due to ethane's price advantage, driven by the low ethane to crude oil price ratio, which is now below 15%. While we expect ethane prices to remain volatile, we do expect ethane prices to increase moderately in the near-term.
While we also expect NGL prices to improve relative to crude, we do not expect them to reach their historical price relationships. Higher propane inventories are flattening out from the buildup from last year's mild winter. With the reduced price relative to crude oil-based feeds, we have seen some petchems crack more propane compared with previous years. We expect the propane surplus to decline as additional expert capacity is developed over the next 12 to 24 months, due to the continued pricing incentive for international propane buyers to purchase U.S. Gulf Coast propane.
This new propane export capacity provides new markets for our industry, which is a good thing. A more normal winter and continued international demand should reduce propane inventories and strengthen pricing. Like ethane, we expect propane prices to improve but certainly not back to theirs are local pricing relationship to crude.
We expect NGL fractionation capacity to remain in short supply, but gradually increase, as new fractionators, including our own, are completed over the next few years. Fractionation capacity, especially in the Gulf Coast, remains at a premium, as growing unfractionated NGL supplies from the prolific shale developments continued to seek the premium priced to Gulf Coast NGL markets. Accordingly, new NGL pipeline capacity between Conway and Mont Belvieu is being built to accommodate NGL growth from the shale plays.
In recent weeks, we have seen Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane price differentials narrow to a low as $0.06 per gallon. Much of this narrowing his get some continued petrochemical maintenance outages, the continued but declining Gulf Coast ethane inventory overhang and Mid-Continent buying interest due to ethane rejection.
For the remainder of the year, we expect Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane price differentials to be approximately $0.10 per gallon. As the petchems return to near full capacity and ethane inventories continue to get worked off, we expect the Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane price differentials to average approximately $0.19 per gallon during 2013.
As we communicated at our recent Investor Day, our 3-year forecast assumes the Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane price differential will narrow to the cost of build range of approximately $0.10 per gallon in 2014 and 2015. 
In spite of the volatility and challenging commodity markets, we continue to focus on helping our supply and market-connected customers deliver the products to where they need to be.
The growth projects we announced in July, the new MB-3 fractionator and the E-P splitter in Mont Belvieu and the expansion of the Bakken NGL pipeline allow us to continue to provide reliable services through our customers through our integrated NGL asset base. 
As NGL growth continues at a rapid pace, we expect the ethane markets to be periodically over and under supply through 2013 and then trend more to an oversupplied state through 2015. And as we move through the 2015 to 2017 timeframe, we anticipate an under supplied position, as demand increases from the completion of expansions and new world-class petrochemical facilities.
Certainly, given the attractive outlook for NGL supplies, the petrochemical industry continues to find ways to consume excess ethane by maximizing their ethane fracing capability.
John, that concludes my remarks."

Joining me today are Rob Martinovich, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our quarterly  financial performance; Pierce Norton, our Chief Operating Officer, who will review our operating performance and update you on the partnership's growth projects, which are on time and on budget; and Terry Spencer, our President, who will discuss our NGL supply and demand outlook. On this morning's call, we will review our third quarter results, discuss our affirmation of our 2012 earnings guidance and update our progress with our growth projects, including the projects we have recently completed and an update on the Bakken Crude Express Pipeline. So let's start with our third quarter performance.
ONEOK Partners turned in a solid performance, driven by strong volume growth in the natural gas liquids and natural gas gathering and processing businesses. The partnership's volume growth is driven by our past capital investments, and we expect continued volume growth as a result of our current capital projects.
Our Natural Gas Distribution segment turned in slightly lower results, and our Energy Services segment reported a loss, due to the continuing challenges it faces in a low natural gas price environment. Pierce will provide more detail on each segments operating performance in just a few minutes.
Yesterday, we affirmed our 2012 earnings guidance ranges, reflecting our confidence in both the natural gas liquids and the natural gas gathering and processing businesses of the partnership. However, we do expect to be in the lower half of the ONEOK net income guidance range, due to the difficult market conditions our Energy Services segment continues to experience.
As Rob will discuss in a few minutes, we remain confident in our ability to grow both ONEOK's dividends and ONEOK Partners' distributions over the next several years, even in a lower commodity price environment. The main driver of these increases will be volume growth at ONEOK Partners as a result of our announced capital investments.
At this time, Rob will now review ONEOK's financial highlights, and then Pierce will review ONEOK's operating performance. Rob?"

ONEOK's third quarter net income was $65.2 million or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with $60.3 million or $0.28 per diluted share for the same period last year, driven primarily by the solid performance at ONEOK Partners and growth in natural gas and natural gas liquids volumes. This was offset partially by lower realized natural gas and NGL product prices, lower NGL optimization margins and continued challenges in the Energy Services segment.
In September, ONEOK completed its $150 million accelerated share repurchase agreement funded by cash on hand and short-term borrowings. Part of the board approved $750 million share repurchase program through 2013, of which $300 million remains. Based on the repurchase of shares, we expect the average amount of diluted shares outstanding for 2012 to be approximately 211 million.
ONEOK's year-to-date 2012 stand-alone cash flow before changes in working capital exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $87 million. We expect our stand-alone cash flow before changes in working capital in excess of capital expenditures and dividend payments for 2012 to be at the low end of the $115 million to $145 million range.
In October, we declared a dividend of $0.33 per share, unchanged from the previous quarter. As John mentioned, our 2012 net income guidance is now expected to be in the lower half of the $345 million to $375 million range, due continued difficult market conditions for our Energy Services segment.
At the end of the third quarter, on a stand-alone basis, we had $677 million of commercial paper outstanding, $15 million of cash and cash equivalents, $521 million available under our $1.2 billion credit facility, and our stand-alone total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 54%.
ONEOK's cash flow and liquidity position continue to give us financial flexibility to increase our dividend, repurchase ONEOK stock and/or purchase additional units of ONEOK Partners. We have used all of these options and don't view them as mutually exclusive, and are fortunate to have the financial capability to do one or more under favorable conditions.
Now Pierce will update you on ONEOK's operating performance."

Third quarter 2012 earnings came in slightly lower than expected. Net margins benefited from higher rates, but higher share-based compensation cost more than offset those increases.
A brief regulatory update. Last week, Kansas Gas Service reached a settlement with the Kansas Corporation Commission staff and the Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board, which if approved by the Kansas Corporation Commission would result in a $28 million increase in base rates and an $18 million reduction in amounts currently recovered through surcharges, effectively increasing its annual revenues by a net amount of $10 million. The Kansas Corporation Commission is expected to make a final ruling by January 2013. Energy Services third quarter 2013 earnings were lower than expected, as the segment continues to be challenged by narrow seasonal and location natural gas price differentials.
Transportation margins were down primarily due to lower hedge settlements in 2012, and our premium service margins were down due to lower demand fees. We continue to realign Energy Services' lease transportation and storage capacity to serve our premium service customers, which means we are not renewing certain transportation and storage leases.
John, that concludes my remarks for ONEOK."

In the third quarter, ONEOK Partners' net income increased 11%, compared with the third quarter of 2011, due primarily to volume growth in the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments. ONEOK Partners reported net income of $232.3 million or $0.78 per unit, compared with last year's third quarter net income of $209.7 million or $0.84 per unit. There were 219.8 million units outstanding for the third quarter this year, compared with 203.8 million units outstanding for the same period in 2011.
The equity offering and private placement in March 2012 included the issuance of 16 million additional units. Quarterly distributable cash flow increased 12% compared with the third quarter last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.34x. We increased the distribution $0.025 per unit for the third quarter, an increase of 4%. And subject to board approval, expect to increase it another $0.025 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2012. At our recent Investor Day, we announced that we expect to increase declared distributions $0.02 per unit per quarter for 2013, subject to board approval.
We've affirmed the partnership's 2012 guidance ranges of net income of $860 million to $910 million and distributable cash flow of $975 million to $1.025 billion.
In September, ONEOK Partners completed a $1.3 billion public offering of senior notes, consisting of $400 million of 5-year senior notes at 2% and $900 million of 10-year senior notes at 3 3/8%. Interest expense for the third quarter was $47.8 million, compared with $55.7 million in the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by higher capitalized interest related to the partnership's capital expenditures associated with our $5.7 billion to $6.6 billion growth program. The amount of interest expense capitalized are now noted on the income statement.
We hedge the commodities we receive for our services to lock-in margins on our expected equity volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment. For the rest of 2012, 77% of our natural gas volumes were hedged, while 71% of our NGLs are hedged. Hedging information for 2013 and 2014 is included in the news release.
At the end of the third quarter, the partnership had $964 million in cash and cash equivalents, no commercial paper or borrowings outstanding, with debt-to-capitalization ratio of 52% and a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.9x.

As John said, the partnership continued to perform well in the third quarter. Operating income was up, due primarily to higher natural gas volumes gathered and processed in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, offset partially by lower realized natural gas and natural gas liquids product prices, particularly ethane and propane. The natural gas liquids segment benefited from higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated, offset partially by decreased optimization and marketing margins.
The natural gas gathering and processing segment's third quarter financial results were higher due primarily to volume growth, driven by increased drilling activity in our Williston Basin assets. Lower realized natural gas and NGL product prices on our unhedged portions of these commodities and higher compression and processing cost associated with the volume growth partially offset these increases.
The Garden Creek plant continues to operate at its capacity of 100 million cubic feet per day. Our 100 million cubic feet per day Stateline I natural gas processing plant in the Williston Basin started in September, and we expect this plant to be at capacity by early next year. For the year, we expect processed volumes to be up 25% compared with 2011, and gathered volumes the be up 12% compared with 2011.
Lower NGL prices did result in periods of ethane rejection in the Mid-Continent, but did not have a material impact on this segment's results. We continue on a record-setting pace for new well connections and expect to connect more than 900 wells this year. During the third quarter, we connected approximately 280 wells to our system, compared with approximately 180 in the same period last year. This brings our year-to-date total 2012 to approximately 710, compared with approximately 420 in the same period last year.
As of mid-October, rig count in North Dakota was at 186, a 15% reduction compared with an all-time high of 218 during May 2012. The largest factor driving this decrease is producers achieving significant increases in drilling efficiencies, where a combination of newer, more efficient rigs and produces moving from single well sites to multi-pad drilling, spud to spud dates have decreased to 25 days or less from a historical average of 30 to 35 days, a 25% efficiency improvement, allowing producers to drill more wells with fewer rigs. The natural gas pipeline segment third quarter financial results were relatively unchanged, due primarily to higher contracted capacity with natural gas producers on our intrastate pipelines, offset by higher outside service cost associated with maintenance projects and higher employee-related cost.
Equity earnings from Northern Border Pipeline were slightly lower. Northern Border is substantially contracted on its long-haul capacity through March 2014. Results of recontracted long-haul capacity with terms of 3 years or longer, now 74% sold through the end of 2014.
In September 2012, Northern Border filed with the FERC a settlement with its customers to modify its transportation rates beginning in January 2013. This settlement is expected to be approved by the FERC before the end of the year. If approved, the long term transportation rates will be approximately 11% lower than current rates. These lower rates were included in our recently announced 2013 financial guidance.
Our natural gas liquids segment benefited from higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated and higher isomerization margins, resulting from wide price differentials between normal butane and isobutane and higher isomerization volumes. As expected, we experienced lower optimization and marketing margins from narrow NGL priced differentials, and lower NGL transportation capacity available for optimization activities as more transportation capacity between the Conway and Mont Belvieu NGL market centers is contracted to produce fee-based earnings. The partnership also realized margins in the third quarter from the sale of NGL inventory held at the end of the second quarter of 2012, associated with the scheduled maintenance of the Mont Belvieu NGL fractionation facility MB-1, which returned to full capacity in late September.
NGLs transported on our gathering lines were up 20%, averaging 530,000 barrels per day during the quarter, as a result of increased production through existing supply connections and new supply connections in the Mid-Continent and the Rocky Mountain regions.
For the year, we expect NGL gathering volumes to be up 22% over last year and fractionation volumes to be up 11% compared with last year. For the fourth quarter 2012, we are assuming a $0.10 per gallon Conway-to-Mont Belvieu average ethane price differential in the ethane/propane mix. A reminder, the ethane price differential is only one part of the optimization picture. Our integrated NGL assets and day-to-day business strategies provide us with opportunities to generate incremental margins with other NGL products.
Now an update on our projects. First, all of our previously announced internal growth projects are on-budget and on-schedule. As I previously mentioned, the Stateline I natural gas processing plant started in late September. Additionally, the 60,000 barrels per day expansion of our fractionator in Bushton, Kansas was also completed in September ahead of schedule.
Several other projects are approaching completion, including the 60,000-barrel per day Bakken NGL pipeline and the Stateline II natural gas processing plant, both expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2013. We are currently conducting an open season process on our 1,300-mile Bakken crude oil expense line. We expect the process to conclude November 20. We continue to see interest in the pipeline and expect to announce the results after the Thanksgiving holiday.
Finally, we continue to develop and evaluate our backlog of natural gas and NGL-related infrastructure projects that still total more than $2 billion. It includes investments in processing plants, natural gas pipelines and NGL fractionation and storage facilities. As we have done in the past, we will announce the projects when we have significant producer and/or customer commitments to make them economically viable.
John, that concludes my remarks."

Today, I'll provide a brief outlook of the NGL markets.Over the past several months, NGL prices have somewhat stabilized, primarily as a result of increasing demand, as numerous petrochemical facilities returned",746,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide a brief outlook of the NGL markets.
Over the past several months, NGL prices have somewhat stabilized, primarily as a result of increasing demand, as numerous petrochemical facilities returned to service after being down earlier in the year for major scheduled and unscheduled maintenance.
Production growth from shale drilling continues in NGL rich supply areas, with some limited ethane rejection occurring primarily in the Rockies, the Mid-Continent and Midwest, due mainly to weak ethane prices at the Conway market center.
U.S. Gulf Coast NGL inventory levels, especially for ethane and propane, are decreasing, as consumers, particularly the petrochemical manufacturers and international markets, continue to exhibit strong demand to take advantage of the attractive low price environment. With the major plant outages behind them, the petchems are consuming the excess ethane inventory, and we expect this drawdown to continue throughout the remainder of this year and into 2013.
The petchems are operating at high utilization rates, with ethane as their primary feedstock, and we see no signs of that slowing down. Ethane continues to be the preferred petrochemical feedstock versus oil-based feeds due to ethane's price advantage, driven by the low ethane to crude oil price ratio, which is now below 15%. While we expect ethane pricing to remain volatile, we do expect ethane prices to increase moderately in the near term.
While we also expect NGL prices to improve relative to crude, we do not expect them to reach their historical price relationships. Higher propane inventories are flattening out from the buildup from last year's mild winter. With the reduced price relative to crude oil-based feeds, we have seen some petchems crack more propane compared with previous years. We expect the propane surplus to decline as additional export capacity is developed over the next 12 to 24 months, due to the continued pricing incentive for international propane buyers to purchase U.S. Gulf Coast propane.
This new propane export capacity provides new markets for our industry, which is a good thing. A more normal winter and continued international demand should reduce propane inventories and strengthen pricing. Like ethane, we expect propane prices to improve, but certainly not back to their historical pricing relationship to crude.
We expect NGL fractionation capacity to remain in short supply, but gradually increase, as new fractionators, including our own, are completed over the next few years. Fractionation capacity, especially in the Gulf Coast, remains at a premium, as growing unfractionated NGL supplies from the prolific shale developments continue to seek the premium priced Gulf Coast NGL markets. Accordingly, new NGL pipeline capacity between Conway and Mont Belvieu is being built to accommodate NGL growth from the shale plays.
In recent weeks, we have seen Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane price differentials narrow to as low as $0.06 per gallon. Much of this narrowing is due to some continued petrochemical maintenance outages, the continued but declining Gulf Coast ethane inventory overhang and Mid-Continent buying interest due to ethane rejection.
For the remainder of the year, we expect Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane price differentials to be approximately $0.10 per gallon. As the petchems return to near full capacity and ethane inventories continue to get worked off, we expect the Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane price differentials to average approximately $0.19 per gallon during 2013.
As we communicated at our recent Investor Day, our 3-year forecast assumes the Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane price differential will narrow to the cost to build range of approximately $0.10 per gallon in 2014 and 2015.
In spite of the volatile and challenging commodity markets, we continue to focus on helping our supply and market-connected customers deliver the products to where they need to be.
The growth projects we announced in July, the new MB-3 fractionator and the E/P splitter in Mont Belvieu, and the expansion of the Bakken NGL pipeline allow us to continue to provide reliable services to our customers through our integrated NGL asset base.
As NGL growth continues at a rapid pace, we expect the ethane markets to be periodically over and undersupplied through 2013 and then trend more to an oversupplied state through 2015. And as we move through the 2015 to 2017 timeframe, we anticipate an undersupplied position, as demand increases from the completion of expansions and new world-class petrochemical facilities.
Certainly, given the attractive outlook for NGL supply, the petrochemical industry continues to find ways to consume excess ethane by maximizing their ethane cracking capability.
John, that concludes my remarks."

Joining me today are Rob Martinovich, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our quarterly  financial performance; Pierce Norton, our Chief Operating Officer, who will review our operating performance and update you on the partnership's growth projects, which are on time and on budget; and Terry Spencer, our President, who will discuss our NGL supply and demand outlook. On this morning's call, we will review our third quarter results, discuss our affirmation of our 2012 earnings guidance and update our progress with our growth projects, including the projects we have recently completed and an update on the Bakken Crude Express Pipeline. So let's start with our third quarter performance.
ONEOK Partners turned in a solid performance, driven by strong volume growth in the natural gas liquids and natural gas gathering and processing businesses. The partnership's volume growth is driven by our past capital investments, and we expect continued volume growth as a result of our current capital projects.
Our Natural Gas Distribution segment turned in slightly lower results, and our Energy Services segment reported a loss, due to the continuing challenges it faces in a low natural gas price environment. Pierce will provide more detail on each segments operating performance in just a few minutes.
Yesterday, we affirmed our 2012 earnings guidance ranges, reflecting our confidence in both the natural gas liquids and the natural gas gathering and processing businesses of the partnership. However, we do expect to be in the lower half of the ONEOK net income guidance range, due to the difficult market conditions our Energy Services segment continues to experience.
As Rob will discuss in a few minutes, we remain confident in our ability to grow both ONEOK's dividends and ONEOK Partners' distributions over the next several years, even in a lower commodity price environment. The main driver of these increases will be volume growth at ONEOK Partners as a result of our announced capital investments.
At this time, Rob will now review ONEOK's financial highlights, and then Pierce will review ONEOK's operating performance. Rob?"

ONEOK's third quarter net income was $65.2 million or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with $60.3 million or $0.28 per diluted share for the same period last year, driven primarily by the solid performance at ONEOK Partners and growth in natural gas and natural gas liquids volumes. This was offset partially by lower realized natural gas and NGL product prices, lower NGL optimization margins and continued challenges in the Energy Services segment.
In September, ONEOK completed its $150 million accelerated share repurchase agreement funded by cash on hand and short-term borrowings. Part of the board approved $750 million share repurchase program through 2013, of which $300 million remains. Based on the repurchase of shares, we expect the average amount of diluted shares outstanding for 2012 to be approximately 211 million.
ONEOK's year-to-date 2012 stand-alone cash flow before changes in working capital exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $87 million. We expect our stand-alone cash flow before changes in working capital in excess of capital expenditures and dividend payments for 2012 to be at the low end of the $115 million to $145 million range.
In October, we declared a dividend of $0.33 per share, unchanged from the previous quarter. As John mentioned, our 2012 net income guidance is now expected to be in the lower half of the $345 million to $375 million range, due continued difficult market conditions for our Energy Services segment.
At the end of the third quarter, on a stand-alone basis, we had $677 million of commercial paper outstanding, $15 million of cash and cash equivalents, $521 million available under our $1.2 billion credit facility, and our stand-alone total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 54%.
ONEOK's cash flow and liquidity position continue to give us financial flexibility to increase our dividend, repurchase ONEOK stock and/or purchase additional units of ONEOK Partners. We have used all of these options and don't view them as mutually exclusive, and are fortunate to have the financial capability to do one or more under favorable conditions.
Now Pierce will update you on ONEOK's operating performance."

Third quarter 2012 earnings came in slightly lower than expected. Net margins benefited from higher rates, but higher share-based compensation cost more than offset those increases.
A brief regulatory update. Last week, Kansas Gas Service reached a settlement with the Kansas Corporation Commission staff and the Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board, which if approved by the Kansas Corporation Commission would result in a $28 million increase in base rates and an $18 million reduction in amounts currently recovered through surcharges, effectively increasing its annual revenues by a net amount of $10 million. The Kansas Corporation Commission is expected to make a final ruling by January 2013. Energy Services third quarter 2013 earnings were lower than expected, as the segment continues to be challenged by narrow seasonal and location natural gas price differentials.
Transportation margins were down primarily due to lower hedge settlements in 2012, and our premium service margins were down due to lower demand fees. We continue to realign Energy Services' lease transportation and storage capacity to serve our premium service customers, which means we are not renewing certain transportation and storage leases.
John, that concludes my remarks for ONEOK."

In the third quarter, ONEOK Partners' net income increased 11%, compared with the third quarter of 2011, due primarily to volume growth in the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments. ONEOK Partners reported net income of $232.3 million or $0.78 per unit, compared with last year's third quarter net income of $209.7 million or $0.84 per unit. There were 219.8 million units outstanding for the third quarter this year, compared with 203.8 million units outstanding for the same period in 2011.
The equity offering and private placement in March 2012 included the issuance of 16 million additional units. Quarterly distributable cash flow increased 12% compared with the third quarter last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.34x. We increased the distribution $0.025 per unit for the third quarter, an increase of 4%. And subject to board approval, expect to increase it another $0.025 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2012. At our recent Investor Day, we announced that we expect to increase declared distributions $0.02 per unit per quarter for 2013, subject to board approval.
We've affirmed the partnership's 2012 guidance ranges of net income of $860 million to $910 million and distributable cash flow of $975 million to $1.025 billion.
In September, ONEOK Partners completed a $1.3 billion public offering of senior notes, consisting of $400 million of 5-year senior notes at 2% and $900 million of 10-year senior notes at 3 3/8%. Interest expense for the third quarter was $47.8 million, compared with $55.7 million in the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by higher capitalized interest related to the partnership's capital expenditures associated with our $5.7 billion to $6.6 billion growth program. The amounts of interest expense capitalized are now noted on the income statement.
We hedged the commodities we receive for our services to lock-in margins on our expected equity volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment. For the rest of 2012, 77% of our natural gas volumes are hedged, while 71% of our NGLs are hedged. Hedging information for 2013 and 2014 is included in the news release.
At the end of the third quarter, the partnership had $964 million in cash and cash equivalents, no commercial paper or borrowings outstanding, with debt-to-capitalization ratio of 52% and a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.9x.
Now Pierce will review the partnership's operating performance."

As John said, the partnership continued to perform well in the third quarter. Operating income was up, due primarily to higher natural gas volumes gathered and processed in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, offset partially by lower realized natural gas and natural gas liquids product prices, particularly ethane and propane. The natural gas liquids segment benefited from higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated, offset partially by decreased optimization and marketing margins.
The natural gas gathering and processing segment's third quarter financial results were higher due primarily to volume growth, driven by increased drilling activity in our Williston Basin assets. Lower realized natural gas and NGL product prices on our unhedged portions of these commodities and higher compression and processing cost associated with the volume growth partially offset these increases.
The Garden Creek plant continues to operate at its capacity of 100 million cubic feet per day. Our 100 million cubic feet per day Stateline I natural gas processing plant in the Williston Basin started in September, and we expect this plant to be at capacity by early next year. For the year, we expect processed volumes to be up 25% compared with 2011, and gathered volumes the be up 12% compared with 2011.
Lower NGL prices did result in periods of ethane rejection in the Mid-Continent, but did not have a material impact on this segment's results. We continue on a record-setting pace for new well connections and expect to connect more than 900 wells this year. During the third quarter, we connected approximately 280 wells to our system, compared with approximately 180 in the same period last year. This brings our year-to-date total 2012 to approximately 710, compared with approximately 420 in the same period last year.
As of mid-October, rig count in North Dakota was at 186, a 15% reduction compared with an all-time high of 218 during May 2012. The largest factor driving this decrease is producers achieving significant increases in drilling efficiencies, where a combination of newer, more efficient rigs and producers moving from single well sites to multi-pad drilling, spud-to-spud dates have decreased to 25 days or less from a historical average of 30 to 35 days, a 25% efficiency improvement, allowing producers to drill more wells with fewer rigs. The natural gas pipeline segment third quarter financial results were relatively unchanged, due primarily to higher contracted capacity with natural gas producers on our intrastate pipelines, offset by higher outside service cost associated with maintenance projects and higher employee-related cost.
Equity earnings from Northern Border Pipeline were slightly lower. Northern Border is substantially contracted on its long-haul capacity through March 2014. Results of recontracted long-haul capacity with terms of 3 years or longer, now 74% sold through the end of 2014.
In September 2012, Northern Border filed with the FERC a settlement with its customers to modify its transportation rates beginning in January 2013. This settlement is expected to be approved by the FERC before the end of the year. If approved, the long term transportation rates will be approximately 11% lower than current rates. These lower rates were included in our recently announced 2013 financial guidance.
Our natural gas liquids segment benefited from higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated and higher isomerization margins, resulting from wide price differentials between normal butane and isobutane and higher isomerization volumes. As expected, we experienced lower optimization and marketing margins from narrow NGL price differentials, and lower NGL transportation capacity available for optimization activities as more transportation capacity between the Conway and Mont Belvieu NGL market centers is contracted to produce fee-based earnings. The partnership also realized margins in the third quarter from the sale of NGL inventory held at the end of the second quarter of 2012, associated with the scheduled maintenance of the Mont Belvieu NGL fractionation facility MB-1, which returned to full capacity in late September.
NGLs transported on our gathering lines were up 20%, averaging 530,000 barrels per day during the quarter, as a result of increased production through existing supply connections and new supply connections in the Mid-Continent and the Rocky Mountain regions.
For the year, we expect NGL gathering volumes to be up 22% over last year and fractionation volumes to be up 11% compared with last year. For the fourth quarter 2012, we are assuming a $0.10 per gallon Conway-to-Mont Belvieu average ethane price differential in the ethane/propane mix. A reminder, the ethane price differential is only one part of the optimization picture. Our integrated NGL assets and day-to-day business strategies provide us with opportunities to generate incremental margins with other NGL products.
Now an update on our projects. First, all of our previously announced internal growth projects are on-budget and on-schedule. As I previously mentioned, the Stateline I natural gas processing plant started in late September. Additionally, the 60,000 barrels per day expansion of our fractionator in Bushton, Kansas was also completed in September ahead of schedule.
Several other projects are approaching completion, including the 60,000-barrel per day Bakken NGL pipeline and the Stateline II natural gas processing plant, both expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2013. We are currently conducting an open season process on our 1,300-mile Bakken crude oil express line. We expect the process to conclude November 20. We continue to see interest in the pipeline and expect to announce the results after the Thanksgiving holiday.
Finally, we continue to develop and evaluate our backlog of natural gas and NGL-related infrastructure projects that still total more than $2 billion. It includes investments in processing plants, natural gas pipelines and NGL fractionation and storage facilities. As we have done in the past, we will announce the projects when we have significant producer and/or customer commitments to make them economically viable.
John, that concludes my remarks."

Today, I'll provide a brief outlook of the NGL markets.
Over the past several months, NGL prices have somewhat stabilized, primarily as a result of increasing demand, as numerous petrochemical facilities returned to service after being down earlier in the year for major scheduled and unscheduled maintenance.
Production growth from shale drilling continues in NGL rich supply areas, with some limited ethane rejection occurring primarily in the Rockies, the Mid-Continent and Midwest, due mainly to weak ethane prices at the Conway market center.
U.S. Gulf Coast NGL inventory levels, especially for ethane and propane, are decreasing, as consumers, particularly the petrochemical manufacturers and international markets, continue to exhibit strong demand to take advantage of the attractive low price environment. With the major plant outages behind them, the petchems are consuming the excess ethane inventory, and we expect this drawdown to continue throughout the remainder of this year and into 2013.
The petchems are operating at high utilization rates, with ethane as their primary feedstock, and we see no signs of that slowing down. Ethane continues to be the preferred petrochemical feedstock versus oil-based feeds due to ethane's price advantage, driven by the low ethane to crude oil price ratio, which is now below 15%. While we expect ethane pricing to remain volatile, we do expect ethane prices to increase moderately in the near term.
While we also expect NGL prices to improve relative to crude, we do not expect them to reach their historical price relationships. Higher propane inventories are flattening out from the buildup from last year's mild winter. With the reduced price relative to crude oil-based feeds, we have seen some petchems crack more propane compared with previous years. We expect the propane surplus to decline as additional export capacity is developed over the next 12 to 24 months, due to the continued pricing incentive for international propane buyers to purchase U.S. Gulf Coast propane.
This new propane export capacity provides new markets for our industry, which is a good thing. A more normal winter and continued international demand should reduce propane inventories and strengthen pricing. Like ethane, we expect propane prices to improve, but certainly not back to their historical pricing relationship to crude.
We expect NGL fractionation capacity to remain in short supply, but gradually increase, as new fractionators, including our own, are completed over the next few years. Fractionation capacity, especially in the Gulf Coast, remains at a premium, as growing unfractionated NGL supplies from the prolific shale developments continue to seek the premium priced Gulf Coast NGL markets. Accordingly, new NGL pipeline capacity between Conway and Mont Belvieu is being built to accommodate NGL growth from the shale plays.
In recent weeks, we have seen Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane price differentials narrow to as low as $0.06 per gallon. Much of this narrowing is due to some continued petrochemical maintenance outages, the continued but declining Gulf Coast ethane inventory overhang and Mid-Continent buying interest due to ethane rejection.
For the remainder of the year, we expect Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane price differentials to be approximately $0.10 per gallon. As the petchems return to near full capacity and ethane inventories continue to get worked off, we expect the Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane price differentials to average approximately $0.19 per gallon during 2013.
As we communicated at our recent Investor Day, our 3-year forecast assumes the Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane price differential will narrow to the cost-to-build range of approximately $0.10 per gallon in 2014 and 2015.
In spite of the volatile and challenging commodity markets, we continue to focus on helping our supply and market-connected customers deliver the products to where they need to be.
The growth projects we announced in July, the new MB-3 fractionator and the E/P splitter in Mont Belvieu, and the expansion of the Bakken NGL pipeline allow us to continue to provide reliable services to our customers through our integrated NGL asset base.
As NGL growth continues at a rapid pace, we expect the ethane markets to be periodically over and undersupplied through 2013 and then trend more to an oversupplied state through 2015. And as we move through the 2015 to 2017 timeframe, we anticipate an undersupplied position, as demand increases from the completion of expansions and new world-class petrochemical facilities.
Certainly, given the attractive outlook for NGL supply, the petrochemical industry continues to find ways to consume excess ethane by maximizing their ethane cracking capability.
John, that concludes my remarks."

Or do you still see that $60 million kind of as being the right number and thus, we'll see a sequential improvement into the fourth quarter? Just trying to get a better sense of color on that, if at all possible."

As always, we appreciate your continued investment and interest in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Joining me this morning are Rob Martinovich, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our quarterly results and updated earnings guidance; Pierce Norton, our Chief Operating Officer, who will review the operating performance of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners'; and Terry Spencer, our President, who will review current market conditions, including our outlook on supply and demand for NGLs, and the implications of lower commodity prices, followed by a status report on the ONEOK Partners' growth projects. 
On this morning's conference call, I will briefly review our fourth quarter and year-end 2011 results, provide some perspective on our revised 2012 guidance, and conclude with some comments about our current and future growth. Let's start with ONEOK Partners' fourth quarter and year-end performance. Both the year and the quarter were exceptional. Results were driven by wider NGL differentials as well as higher volumes in our natural gas liquids and our natural gas gathering and processing segments. Our growth projects are on time and on budget and we continue to increase volume commitments for these projects. Our Garden Creek natural gas processing plant in the Williston Basin is operational, allowing producers the ability to capture additional value, while reducing the amount of flaring occurring in the Bakken shale. Our natural gas distribution segment performed well in the quarter and for the full year. Net margins were essentially flat with operating income affected primarily by higher share-based compensation costs. You will recall that we award all full time employees with one share of stock each time the closing price reaches a new $1.00 high. In 2011 we awarded 31 shares of stock at a cost of $16 million. Since the natural gas distribution segment has largest number of employees, and the allocations of this cost are on a per employee basis, it incurred a large portion of that expense. We believe it is a small price to pay for outstanding share price appreciation in 2011. Our energy services segment continues to struggle as a result of challenging market conditions, narrow seasonal and location differentials, low natural gas prices and volatility, moderate weather conditions, and an oversupply of natural gas. While we have lowered our expectations for this business in 2012, we continue to reduce our leased storage and transportation capacity, and operating cost, but the fact remains it's a very challenging market. We also updated our 2012 financial guidance, increasing our earnings expectation at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and raising our dividend and distribution growth forecasts for the year. Rob will provide more detail in a few minutes. Our updated 2012 ONEOK Partners' guidance includes higher natural gas liquids operating income than we originally forecast, $528 million today versus last fall's 2012 forecast of $395 million, but lower than the segment's 2011 actual results. Our updated NGL segment guidance is the result of an expected increase in ethane differentials between the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast, compared with what we assumed in our original 2012 guidance. However, we expect lower NGL optimization margins in 2012, as we continue to convert some capacity to firm fee-based contracts. In 2012, lower expected commodity prices will also impact the partnerships natural gas gathering and processing segment. We expect 2012 GMP segment results to be higher than 2011, but lower than we originally forecast last fall. 
Rob will now review ONEOK's financial highlights, and then Pierce will review ONEOK's operating performance. Rob?"

ONEOK's fourth quarter net income increased by 38% compared with the same period last year, driven by the strong performance at ONEOK Partners. For 2011, net income increased 8% versus 2010. Results in the distribution segment were lower due to higher employee related costs, while energy services had reduced results, due primarily to lower storage, marketing, and transportation margins, resulting from narrower seasonal spreads and natural gas price location differentials.

In 2011, ONEOK received approximately $333 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners, a 10% increase over 2010. ONEOK's income taxes on the distributions from the ONEOK Partners LP units it owns or deferred contributing to ONEOK's strong cash flow. We also updated guidance for ONEOK in 2012. 
Net income is expected to be in the range of $360 million to $410 million compared with its previous range of $355 million to $400 million. The updated guidance reflects higher anticipated earnings in the ONEOK Partner segment, offset partially by lower expected earnings in the energy services segment. In January, ONEOK completed a $700 million public offering of 4.25% senior notes due 2022. We used the proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our $1.2 billion commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes, providing additional capacity for various options, which may include repurchasing ONEOK common stock under our previously approved share repurchase program, purchase of additional common units of ONEOK Partners, and/or the payment of dividends to shareholders. 
Also, in January, we declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of $0.61 per share, a 17% increase since January 2011. Since January 2006, the company has increased the dividend 13x representing 118% increase during that period. Subject to Board approval, we also expect to increase the dividend $0.05 per share in July compared with our expectation last September of $0.04 per share. This increase is consistent with our goal to grow the dividend by 50% by 2014. ONEOK's liquidity position is excellent. 
At the end of the fourth quarter on a standalone basis, we had $842 million of commercial paper outstanding, $30.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $347.7 million of natural gas and storage, $356 million available under our new credit facility, and our total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 45%. ONEOK's significant cash flow and outstanding liquidity position continue to give us incredible financial flexibility. 
Now Pierce will update you on ONEOK's operating performance."

Let's start with our natural gas distribution segment. Fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings were lower compared with the same period last year, because of higher operating cost, primarily the share-based compensation cost discussed on previous conference calls. This segments portion of the 31 shares of stock awarded to employees in 2011 was $10 million. 2012 operating income guidance been updated to $223 million, reflecting the recent sale of the retail natural gas marketing business that has now accounted for as discontinued operations. 
Now a brief regulatory update. In Kansas, the Kansas Corporation Commission approved our application to increase the Gas System Reliability Surcharge by an additional $2.9 million effective January 2012. This capital recovery mechanism allows us to recover and to earn a return on safety-related and government mandated capital investments made between rate cases. Kansas Gas Service plans to file a rate case in mid-2012, its first since 2006. As part of that rate case, we are exploring rate design options that reduce our volumetric sensitivity. Oklahoma Natural Gas will make its annual performance base rates filing on or before March 1. We expect to request a modest increase in rates to recognize our investment in rate base and increases in operating cost. We continue our efforts to grow our rate base by investing in projects that provide benefits to our customers and our shareholders. In 2011, the distribution segment invested approximately $243 million of capital, including $25 million in automated meter reading devices. In 2012, we planned to invest approximately $270 million of capital, as in the past this includes pipeline integrity projects, pipeline replacements, extending services to new areas, automated meter reading devices, and increasing the systems delivery capabilities. 
Now let's turn to energy services. The lower earnings result reflects lower storage and marketing margins, due primarily to lower realized seasonal storage price differentials, and lower transportation margins, due primarily to narrower realized price location differentials, and lower hedge settlements in 2011. Full year 2011 operating income was $24 million. Location differentials are essentially non-existent between several market delivery points. Seasonal differentials remained narrow for 2012, with little or no price volatility but have improved somewhat for 2013. We've reduced energy services 2012 operating income guidance to 0 as this segment will continue to face extraordinarily challenging market conditions because of the increase in transportation pipeline capacity in recent years, and an oversupply of natural gas from shale plays. We continue to access how much transportation and storage capacity we need to service our premium customers, and look for opportunities to renegotiate transportation and storage rates. 
By the end of this year, more than 20% of our leased storage capacity and 15% of our leased transportation capacity will be up for renewal. And by 2015 more than 90% of the storage capacity and 75% of the transport capacity will be up for renewal, providing an opportunity to either renew them at lower market rates or cancel the leases. These explorations also give us additional opportunities to realign our capacity with customers' needs and rebase our cost structure. We now expect to reduce our target leased storage capacity from 65 Bcf at the end of 2012 to 60 Bcf at 2015, and our leased transportation capacity from 1 Bcf per day at the end of 2012 down to 0.8 Bcf per day by 2015. 
John, that concludes my remarks for ONEOK."

In the fourth quarter, ONEOK Partners' net income more than doubled compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. For 2011, net income increased 76% versus 2010. Distributable cash flow increased 89% compared with the fourth quarter last year, r",455,"Thanks, John. In the fourth quarter, ONEOK Partners' net income more than doubled compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. For 2011, net income increased 76% versus 2010. Distributable cash flow increased 89% compared with the fourth quarter last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 2.26x. For 2011, distributable cash flow increased 61% compared with 2010, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.66x. The higher earnings and resulting higher coverage ratio were primarily due to strong NGL optimization margins from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu. Similar to 2008 when commodity prices were record levels, we do not believe these wider NGL price differentials are sustainable long term. 
In 2008, we utilized the incremental cash flow to finance a portion of our $2 billion capital investment program that was completed in 2009, and we plan to utilize a portion of the incremental cash flow likewise in 2012, to help fund our current $3 billion capital growth program, reducing our debt and equity financing needs. At the same time, we are meaningfully increasing distributions to our unitholders. We increased the distribution $0.015 per unit for the fourth quarter and subject to Board approval, expect to increase it another $0.025 per quarter in 2012, higher than the $0.02 per quarter increase we announced last September. 
With the strong performance of the NGL segment expected to continue in 2012, although at a lower level than we experienced in 2011, we've increased the partnerships' 2012 earnings guidance by almost 10% to a range of $810 million to $870 million, compared with its previous range of $740 million to $800 million. We also estimate the partnerships' 2012 distributable cash flow to be in the range of $925 million to $985 million, compared with its previous range of $845 million to $915 million. We updated our 2012 capital expenditure guidance to $2 billion to reflect our latest forecast. This breaks down to $1.9 billion in growth capital and $109 million in maintenance capital. We have hedges in place to lock-in margins on our expected equity volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, where a portion of our margin is derived from the receipt of commodities. 
Our news release contains updated information on these hedges. Our 2012 natural gas hedges have increased to 73% from 42%, while our 2012 NGL hedges have increased to 72% from 43%. As is our practice, we continually monitor the commodity markets, and will place additional hedges as conditions warrant. At the end of the fourth quarter, the partnership had $35.1 million in cash and no commercial paper or other short-term borrowings, a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 53%, and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9x.

As John said, the partnership had an exceptional fourth quarter.

As John said, the partnership had an exceptional fourth quarter. Operating income almost doubled compared with the same period last year, driven primarily by higher margins in the natural gas liquid segment from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu, and increased fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities. Earnings also increased as a result of higher isomerization margins in the NGL segment, and solid performance in the natural gas gathering and processing segment from higher natural gas volumes processed. While we benefited from these favorable NGL price differentials, and higher NGL and condensate prices, our base business continues to grow. In the fourth quarter, natural gas volumes processed increased, as did NGL volumes gathered, fractionated, and NGL purity projects -- products distributed. More on that in a moment. 
The natural gas gathering and processing segments fourth quarter financial results were higher due primarily to higher natural gas volumes processed, specifically in the Williston Basin and higher net realized NGL and condensate prices. We decreased this segment’s operating income guidance for 2012 to $247 million, compared with the $297 million we provided last September to reflect lower commodity price assumptions. 
In 2012, we expect processed volumes to be up 24% and gathered volumes to be up 15%, both driven by our investments in the Williston Basin, the new Garden Creek plant that went into service in December, and the Stateline I plant that we expect to be in service sometime in the third quarter of this year. The natural gas pipeline segment's fourth quarter results were lower compared with the fourth quarter last year, due to lower transportation margins from narrow regional natural gas price differentials that decreased contracted capacity on Midwestern gas transmission and interruptible volumes across several of our pipelines. 
For 2011, equity earnings from Northern Border pipeline increased by 12% compared with 2010, as it maintained its position as a low cost provider in transporting Canadian source supply to markets in the Midwest. Northern Border is substantially contracted for long haul capacity through March 2013 and has been successful capturing 3 year or longer extensions, as current contracts expire. We decreased this segments' 2012 operating income guidance to $135 million, reflecting a lower assumed natural gas price as it relates to our retained fuel position. 
Almost 90% of the contracted capacity on our wholly owned top line serve end users directly, such as natural gas distribution companies and electric generators that need the natural gas to operate their businesses regardless of regional price differentials. In spite of narrow price differential environment, this business due to its highly contracted capacity continues to generate stable earnings with 82% of our pipeline capacity and 100% of our storage capacity contracted under firm long-term contracts. 
Our natural gas liquid segment continued to benefit in 2011 from record wide NGL price differentials and having more fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities. This segment also benefited from higher isomerization margins due to wider price differentials between normal butane and isobutane. Successful contract negotiations, associated with our exchange and storage services activities also helped earnings. We fractionated 10% more volumes during the fourth quarter 2011 compared with the same period last year, averaging 583,000 barrels per day, which includes volumes fractionated at the target facility from the fractionation services agreement that began during the second quarter in 2011. 
NGLs transported on our gathering lines were up 17% during the quarter compared with the same period last year, averaging 473,000 barrels per day during the quarter, as a result of increased volumes gathered on the Arbuckle Pipeline and in the Mid-Continent. Arbuckle Pipeline volumes are now reaching more than 200,000 barrels per day. Additional pump stations have been added as a part of the Arbuckle expansion that will increase capacity to 240,000 barrels per day in the early second quarter of 2012. We significantly increased our 2012 operating income guidance for this segment to reflect the wider NGL price differentials. 
For 2012, we have updated the Conway to Mont Belvieu ethane price differential to average $0.32 per gallon compared with $0.12 per gallon provided in September. While the current ethane price differential has softened to levels below $0.32 due to a number of short-term maintenance outages at U.S. Petrochemical plants, we anticipate ethane differentials will increase as the Petchems return to normal operations during the second quarter. Although we only provided expected Conway to Mont Belvieu differentials for ethane in our guidance, our opportunity to capture optimization margins is not solely based on the ethane differential. 
Our well positioned and vertically integrated assets can also benefit from Conway to Belvieu differentials from the other NGL products such as propane and butane. Additionally, we are also expecting to utilize less capacity for optimization activities in 2012 compared with 2011, attracting some of the capacity under fee-based long-term agreements with customers. We have a planned maintenance turnaround at our Mont Belvieu fractionator MB I scheduled for May. During this turnaround, raw NGL volumes that were currently being fractionated at MB I either will be sent to other fractionators, and/or placed in storage. Because of the events planning that goes into the turnaround, we expect this turnaround will not substantially affect our customers' operations. 
John, that concludes my remarks."

This morning I will discuss our outlook of the NGL markets and close with a status report on our growth projects. On the demand side, the petrochemical industry continues to find ways to consume more ethane, due to",1040,"Thanks John, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will discuss our outlook of the NGL markets and close with a status report on our growth projects. On the demand side, the petrochemical industry continues to find ways to consume more ethane, due to its strong price advantage versus oil based feedstocks. In the short-term, several petrochemical facilities are currently conducting maintenance turnarounds, reducing the immediate need for ethane which is primarily responsible for the current lower ethane prices in the Mont Belvieu market. 
We also understand that several of these petchems are in turnarounds to also increase their ethane cracking capabilities. In addition, the price weakness is exacerbated by the petchems that are down for maintenance, [ filling ] ethane into the market. The lower natural gas price environment also puts downward pressure on ethane prices. There has been some concern about the impact of lower natural gas prices on our businesses. On the supply side, rigs are continuing to move away from dry gas regions and producers are focusing specifically on crude oil and liquids rich plays such as the Bakken, Cana-Woodford, Woodford, Granite Wash, Niobrara, Mississippi and Lime, and the Eagle Ford Shale. 
Fortunately for us, our assets are well positioned in all but one of these areas. From what we have seen in drilling schedules we have been provided we do not expect any material impact on volumes that supply our plants or systems that serve these liquid rich regions. With oil prices showing little signs of pulling back, the weaker natural gas prices help to maintain or further widen the ethane to crude ratio improving the U.S. petrochems industries' competitive position globally, and increasing demand for more NGL feedstock, which benefits our NGL business. Once these planned turnarounds are completed in the next few months, demand from the petchems for ethane and the price of ethane should strengthen, particularly in Mont Belvieu. 
Some experts are projecting ethane demand will reach new record highs later this year and will continue to grow over the long-term, especially with the announcements of petrochemical plant restarts, expansions, and development of new world class petrochemical plants. As a consequence, we expect NGL fractionation capacity to remain tight, but gradually become more available as new fractionators come online over the next few years. As NGL growth continues at a rapid pace, we believe that over the next couple of years there will be some periodic oversupplies of ethane as new NGL infrastructure brings additional NGLs to market. As we approach and move through the 2015 and 2017 timeframe, we believe supply and demand will remain relatively balanced, as new petrochemical plants and expansions come online. 
Now an update on our projects. First, our Bakken projects are expected to resolve some of the challenges producers are facing in the Williston Basin, in particular the flaring of NGL rich natural gas. Our first of 3 new processing plants in the Bakken; Garden Creek was completed in late December. The Stateline I plant is expected to be in service in the third quarter of this year with completion of the Stateline II plant following in the first half of 2013. The Stateline natural gas processing plant projects remain on schedule and on budget. 
Oil production in the Bakken continues to grow rapidly, and oil transportation infrastructure continues to be developed to meet producer needs thus allowing the current pace of drilling to continue. As you all are aware, drilling economics in the Bakken are primarily driven by crude oil prices and not significantly impacted by the current low natural gas price environment. The 500-plus-mile 60,000 barrel per day Bakken NGL pipeline, along with the expansions of the Bushton fractionator and Overland Pass Pipeline are either on schedule or ahead of schedule and on budget. 
We have acquired more than 85% of the right away needed for the Bakken NGL pipeline. Engineering and design continues to move along and steel pipe and many of the required materials have been purchased. Of special note, the Bushton fractionator expansion is now ahead of our original schedule, and is expected to be completed sometime in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with our original plan to complete it in the first half of 2013. 
Let's turn to our Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast projects. The expansion of our Mid-Continent to Mont Belvieu NGL distribution pipeline, Sterling I is done, adding 15,000 barrels per day of additional capacity to ship purity NGL products south to Mont Belvieu. The construction of 230 miles of NGL gathering pipelines in the Cana-Woodford and Granite Wash is on schedule with completion expected early in the second quarter of 2012, bringing 75,000 to 80,000 barrels per day of raw NGL through our existing system in the Mid-Continent and the Arbuckle Pipeline. 
The expansion of Arbuckle to 240,000 barrels per day from 180,000 barrels per day by installing additional pump stations is well underway with incremental barrels already being transported, as Pierce noted, and we expect all the pump stations to be completed and in service also in the second quarter of 2012. The 570-mile Sterling III pipeline in the 75,000 barrel per day MB II fractionator are progressing as planned. We have increased our supply commitments for both projects with approximately 75% committed on the 193,000 barrel per day Sterling III, that's the level of supply commitment we target for this project to achieve its required returns. All the capacity is committed on our 75,000 barrel per day MB II fractionator. Our commercial team has done a terrific job securing these supply commitments well before these assets go into service in 2013. 
We continue to develop and evaluate a lengthy backlog of natural gas and NGL related infrastructure projects, including investments in processing plants and NGL fractionation and storage facilities. This backlog totals more than $1 billion and it's growing. Some of these investments will create additional redundancy and reliability and improve our connectivity to our petchem customers, while others will provide the critical infrastructure that producers and processors need to get their products to market. As we've done in the past, we will announce the projects when we have sufficient producer and/or customer commitments to make them economically viable. 
John, that concludes my remarks."

Before we take your questions, I'd like to provide you with some context on our 2011 results, our updated 2012 guidance, and our future growth. While Terry has provided you with a detailed rundown of our $3 billion in growth projects, it's important to keep in perspective these current projects and the $2 billion of projects we completed in 2009. While there has been a lot of current detention on the widening NGL differentials between the Mid-Continent and the Gulf Coast, short-term ethane price softness, and declining natural gas prices, let's not lose sight of the fact that the assets we've built and are building, increase our ability to add volumes to our system, both natural gas and natural gas liquids, and to collect a fee to gather, process, fractionate, store, and transport these commodities for producers, processors and customers. 
These services provide us and our customers and investors with sustainable long-term value, regardless of short-term moves and differentials in prices. It's the incremental earnings from these projects, now in service and now being built that give us the ability to grow our earnings at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners by an average of approximately 20% per year for the next 3 years, to increase distributions to ONEOK Partners' unitholders this year and beyond and to increase the ONEOK dividend 50% by 2014. While internal growth may not be as exciting or as headline grabbing as an acquisition, internal growth project opportunities provide our investors with far better returns than if we were to buy earnings at today's prices. And we're not done. 
As you've just heard, our internal growth backlog is in excess of $1 billion and growing, providing us with more earnings growth potential. In closing, I would like to again thank our employees who work safely, reliably and environmentally responsibly every day to operate our assets, creating exceptional value for our investors and customers.

As I said we can create more value investing in those projects than we can going out and buying earnings at today's prices. So a transforming transaction which I have in the past compared to when we acquired the coke NGL assets, when we acquired the gathering and processing assets from Dynegy and Kinder Morgan. When we acquired the Bushton plant NGL storage with Kinder Morgan. Those when we look back, although they may not be significant in size, from a dollar perspective they were significant and they gave us the opportunity to then invest more money as it relates building that infrastructure. 
So we, be clear, are not driven to do a transforming transaction so that we can go to the marketplace to say we've done one. We will continue to invest where we see opportunities to create more value as it relates to the future of ONEOK and what ONEOK might look like, it's hard to argue with success. We've been successful, we look at opportunities as I indicated to Yves, we look for opportunities and other commodities where we think we can apply the same capabilities we have, we also look as an organization as to where we can increase our capabilities, so that we can move into other markets. 
It's all an [ iterative ] process that we apply all this -- all these techniques to. But I can't tell you a year from now whether we will have another stool. There has been years where energy services has made $230 million and gathering and processing barely broke even. But our commitment is for long-term. So if we have this discussion a year from now, it will be heavily influenced by what we perceive to be reality between now and then. Did that help you at all James?"

Joining me this morning are Rob Martinovich, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our quarterly results and updated earnings guidance; Pierce Norton, our Chief Operating Officer, who will review the operating performance of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners'; and Terry Spencer, our President, who will review current market conditions, including our outlook on supply and demand for NGLs, and the implications of lower commodity prices, followed by a status report on the ONEOK Partners' growth projects. 
On this morning's conference call, I will briefly review our fourth quarter and year-end 2011 results, provide some perspective on our revised 2012 guidance, and conclude with some comments about our current and future growth. Let's start with ONEOK Partners' fourth quarter and year-end performance. Both the year and the quarter were exceptional. Results were driven by wider NGL differentials as well as higher volumes in our natural gas liquids and our natural gas gathering and processing segments. Our growth projects are on time and on budget and we continue to increase volume commitments for these projects. Our Garden Creek natural gas processing plant in the Williston Basin is operational, allowing producers the ability to capture additional value, while reducing the amount of flaring occurring in the Bakken shale. Our natural gas distribution segment performed well in the quarter and for the full year. Net margins were essentially flat with operating income affected primarily by higher share-based compensation costs. You will recall that we award all full time employees with one share of stock each time the closing price reaches a new $1.00 high. In 2011 we awarded 31 shares of stock at a cost of $16 million. Since the natural gas distribution segment has largest number of employees, and the allocations of this cost are on a per employee basis, it incurred a large portion of that expense. We believe it is a small price to pay for outstanding share price appreciation in 2011. Our energy services segment continues to struggle as a result of challenging market conditions, narrow seasonal and location differentials, low natural gas prices and volatility, moderate weather conditions, and an oversupply of natural gas. While we have lowered our expectations for this business in 2012, we continue to reduce our leased storage and transportation capacity, and operating cost, but the fact remains it's a very challenging market. We also updated our 2012 financial guidance, increasing our earnings expectation at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and raising our dividend and distribution growth forecasts for the year. Rob will provide more detail in a few minutes. Our updated 2012 ONEOK Partners' guidance includes higher natural gas liquids operating income than we originally forecast, $528 million today versus last fall's 2012 forecast of $395 million, but lower than the segment's 2011 actual results. Our updated NGL segment guidance is the result of an expected increase in ethane differentials between the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast, compared with what we assumed in our original 2012 guidance. However, we expect lower NGL optimization margins in 2012, as we continue to convert some capacity to firm fee-based contracts. In 2012, lower expected commodity prices will also impact the partnerships natural gas gathering and processing segment. We expect 2012 GMP segment results to be higher than 2011, but lower than we originally forecast last fall. 
Rob will now review ONEOK's financial highlights, and then Pierce will review ONEOK's operating performance. Rob?"

ONEOK's fourth quarter net income increased by 38% compared with the same period last year, driven by the strong performance at ONEOK Partners. For 2011, net income increased 8% versus 2010. Results in the distribution segment were lower due to higher employee related costs, while energy services had reduced results, due primarily to lower storage, marketing, and transportation margins, resulting from narrower seasonal spreads and natural gas price location differentials. 
ONEOK's 2011 standalone cash flow, before changes in working capital, exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $213.7 million. In 2011, ONEOK received approximately $333 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners, a 10% increase over 2010. ONEOK's income taxes on the distributions from the ONEOK Partners LP units it owns or deferred contributing to ONEOK's strong cash flow. We also updated guidance for ONEOK in 2012. 
Net income is expected to be in the range of $360 million to $410 million compared with its previous range of $355 million to $400 million. The updated guidance reflects higher anticipated earnings in the ONEOK Partner segment, offset partially by lower expected earnings in the energy services segment. In January, ONEOK completed a $700 million public offering of 4.25% senior notes due 2022. We used the proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our $1.2 billion commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes, providing additional capacity for various options, which may include repurchasing ONEOK common stock under our previously approved share repurchase program, purchase of additional common units of ONEOK Partners, and/or the payment of dividends to shareholders. 
Also, in January, we declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of $0.61 per share, a 17% increase since January 2011. Since January 2006, the company has increased the dividend 13x representing 118% increase during that period. Subject to Board approval, we also expect to increase the dividend $0.05 per share in July compared with our expectation last September of $0.04 per share. This increase is consistent with our goal to grow the dividend by 50% by 2014. ONEOK's liquidity position is excellent. 
At the end of the fourth quarter on a standalone basis, we had $842 million of commercial paper outstanding, $30.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $347.7 million of natural gas and storage, $356 million available under our new credit facility, and our total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 45%. ONEOK's significant cash flow and outstanding liquidity position continue to give us incredible financial flexibility. 
Now Pierce will update you on ONEOK's operating performance."

Let's start with our natural gas distribution segment. Fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings were lower compared with the same period last year, because of higher operating cost, primarily the share-based compensation cost discussed on previous conference calls. This segments portion of the 31 shares of stock awarded to employees in 2011 was $10 million. 2012 operating income guidance been updated to $223 million, reflecting the recent sale of the retail natural gas marketing business that has now accounted for as discontinued operations. 
Now a brief regulatory update. In Kansas, the Kansas Corporation Commission approved our application to increase the Gas System Reliability Surcharge by an additional $2.9 million effective January 2012. This capital recovery mechanism allows us to recover and to earn a return on safety-related and government mandated capital investments made between rate cases. Kansas Gas Service plans to file a rate case in mid-2012, its first since 2006. As part of that rate case, we are exploring rate design options that reduce our volumetric sensitivity. Oklahoma Natural Gas will make its annual performance base rates filing on or before March 1. We expect to request a modest increase in rates to recognize our investment in rate base and increases in operating cost. We continue our efforts to grow our rate base by investing in projects that provide benefits to our customers and our shareholders. In 2011, the distribution segment invested approximately $243 million of capital, including $25 million in automated meter reading devices. In 2012, we planned to invest approximately $270 million of capital, as in the past this includes pipeline integrity projects, pipeline replacements, extending services to new areas, automated meter reading devices, and increasing the systems delivery capabilities. 
Now let's turn to energy services. The lower earnings result reflects lower storage and marketing margins, due primarily to lower realized seasonal storage price differentials, and lower transportation margins, due primarily to narrower realized price location differentials, and lower hedge settlements in 2011. Full year 2011 operating income was $24 million. Location differentials are essentially non-existent between several market delivery points. Seasonal differentials remained narrow for 2012, with little or no price volatility but have improved somewhat for 2013. We've reduced energy services 2012 operating income guidance to 0 as this segment will continue to face extraordinarily challenging market conditions because of the increase in transportation pipeline capacity in recent years, and an oversupply of natural gas from shale plays. We continue to access how much transportation and storage capacity we need to service our premium customers, and look for opportunities to renegotiate transportation and storage rates. 
By the end of this year, more than 20% of our leased storage capacity and 15% of our leased transportation capacity will be up for renewal. And by 2015 more than 90% of the storage capacity and 75% of the transport capacity will be up for renewal, providing an opportunity to either renew them at lower market rates or cancel the leases. These explorations also give us additional opportunities to realign our capacity with customers' needs and rebase our cost structure. We now expect to reduce our target leased storage capacity from 65 Bcf at the end of 2012 to 60 Bcf at 2015, and our leased transportation capacity from 1 Bcf per day at the end of 2012 down to 0.8 Bcf per day by 2015. 
John, that concludes my remarks for ONEOK."

In the fourth quarter, ONEOK Partners' net income more than doubled compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. For 2011, net income increased 76% versus 2010.

In the fourth quarter, ONEOK Partners' net income more than doubled compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. For 2011, net income increased 76% versus 2010. Distributable cash flow increased 89% compared with the fourth quarter last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 2.26x. For 2011, distributable cash flow increased 61% compared with 2010, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.66x. The higher earnings and resulting higher coverage ratio were primarily due to strong NGL optimization margins from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu. Similar to 2008 when commodity prices were record levels, we do not believe these wider NGL price differentials are sustainable long term. 
In 2008, we utilized the incremental cash flow to finance a portion of our $2 billion capital investment program that was completed in 2009, and we plan to utilize a portion of the incremental cash flow likewise in 2012, to help fund our current $3 billion capital growth program, reducing our debt and equity financing needs. At the same time, we are meaningfully increasing distributions to our unitholders. We increased the distribution $0.015 per unit for the fourth quarter and subject to Board approval, expect to increase it another $0.025 per quarter in 2012, higher than the $0.02 per quarter increase we announced last September. 
With the strong performance of the NGL segment expected to continue in 2012, although at a lower level than we experienced in 2011, we've increased the partnerships' 2012 earnings guidance by almost 10% to a range of $810 million to $870 million, compared with its previous range of $740 million to $800 million. We also estimate the partnerships' 2012 distributable cash flow to be in the range of $925 million to $985 million, compared with its previous range of $845 million to $915 million. We updated our 2012 capital expenditure guidance to $2 billion to reflect our latest forecast. This breaks down to $1.9 billion in growth capital and $109 million in maintenance capital. We have hedges in place to lock-in margins on our expected equity volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, where a portion of our margin is derived from the receipt of commodities. 
Our news release contains updated information on these hedges. Our 2012 natural gas hedges have increased to 73% from 42%, while our 2012 NGL hedges have increased to 72% from 43%. As is our practice, we continually monitor the commodity markets, and will place additional hedges as conditions warrant. At the end of the fourth quarter, the partnership had $35.1 million in cash and no commercial paper or other short-term borrowings, a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 53%, and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9x. Now Pierce will review the partnerships' operating performance."

As John said, the partnership had an exceptional fourth quarter. Operating income almost doubled compared with the same period last year, driven primarily by higher margins in the natural gas liquid segment from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu, and increased fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities. Earnings also increased as a result of higher isomerization margins in the NGL segment, and solid performance in the natural gas gathering and processing segment from higher natural gas volumes processed. While we benefited from these favorable NGL price differentials, and higher NGL and condensate prices, our base business continues to grow. In the fourth quarter, natural gas volumes processed increased, as did NGL volumes gathered, fractionated, and NGL purity projects -- products distributed. More on that in a moment. 
The natural gas gathering and processing segments fourth quarter financial results were higher due primarily to higher natural gas volumes processed, specifically in the Williston Basin and higher net realized NGL and condensate prices. We decreased this segment’s operating income guidance for 2012 to $247 million, compared with the $297 million we provided last September to reflect lower commodity price assumptions. 
In 2012, we expect processed volumes to be up 24% and gathered volumes to be up 15%, both driven by our investments in the Williston Basin, the new Garden Creek plant that went into service in December, and the Stateline I plant that we expect to be in service sometime in the third quarter of this year. The natural gas pipeline segment's fourth quarter results were lower compared with the fourth quarter last year, due to lower transportation margins from narrow regional natural gas price differentials that decreased contracted capacity on Midwestern gas transmission and interruptible volumes across several of our pipelines. 
For 2011, equity earnings from Northern Border pipeline increased by 12% compared with 2010, as it maintained its position as a low cost provider in transporting Canadian source supply to markets in the Midwest. Northern Border is substantially contracted for long haul capacity through March 2013 and has been successful capturing 3 year or longer extensions, as current contracts expire. We decreased this segments' 2012 operating income guidance to $135 million, reflecting a lower assumed natural gas price as it relates to our retained fuel position. 
Almost 90% of the contracted capacity on our wholly owned top line serve end users directly, such as natural gas distribution companies and electric generators that need the natural gas to operate their businesses regardless of regional price differentials. In spite of narrow price differential environment, this business due to its highly contracted capacity continues to generate stable earnings with 82% of our pipeline capacity and 100% of our storage capacity contracted under firm long-term contracts. 
Our natural gas liquid segment continued to benefit in 2011 from record wide NGL price differentials and having more fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities. This segment also benefited from higher isomerization margins due to wider price differentials between normal butane and isobutane. Successful contract negotiations, associated with our exchange and storage services activities also helped earnings. We fractionated 10% more volumes during the fourth quarter 2011 compared with the same period last year, averaging 583,000 barrels per day, which includes volumes fractionated at the target facility from the fractionation services agreement that began during the second quarter in 2011. 
NGLs transported on our gathering lines were up 17% during the quarter compared with the same period last year, averaging 473,000 barrels per day during the quarter, as a result of increased volumes gathered on the Arbuckle Pipeline and in the Mid-Continent. Arbuckle Pipeline volumes are now reaching more than 200,000 barrels per day. Additional pump stations have been added as a part of the Arbuckle expansion that will increase capacity to 240,000 barrels per day in the early second quarter of 2012. We significantly increased our 2012 operating income guidance for this segment to reflect the wider NGL price differentials. 
For 2012, we have updated the Conway to Mont Belvieu ethane price differential to average $0.32 per gallon compared with $0.12 per gallon provided in September. While the current ethane price differential has softened to levels below $0.32 due to a number of short-term maintenance outages at U.S. Petrochemical plants, we anticipate ethane differentials will increase as the Petchems return to normal operations during the second quarter. Although we only provided expected Conway to Mont Belvieu differentials for ethane in our guidance, our opportunity to capture optimization margins is not solely based on the ethane differential. 
Our well positioned and vertically integrated assets can also benefit from Conway to Belvieu differentials from the other NGL products such as propane and butane. Additionally, we are also expecting to utilize less capacity for optimization activities in 2012 compared with 2011, attracting some of the capacity under fee-based long-term agreements with customers. We have a planned maintenance turnaround at our Mont Belvieu fractionator MB I scheduled for May. During this turnaround, raw NGL volumes that were currently being fractionated at MB I either will be sent to other fractionators, and/or placed in storage. Because of the events planning that goes into the turnaround, we expect this turnaround will not substantially affect our customers' operations. 
John, that concludes my remarks."

293889,146298622,2478132,"ONEOK Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2012",2012-02-21,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thanks John, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will discuss our outlook of the NGL markets and close with a status report on our growth projects. On the demand side, the petrochemical industry continues to find ways to consume more ethane, due to",1040,"Thanks John, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will discuss our outlook of the NGL markets and close with a status report on our growth projects. On the demand side, the petrochemical industry continues to find ways to consume more ethane, due to its strong price advantage versus oil based feedstocks. In the short-term, several petrochemical facilities are currently conducting maintenance turnarounds, reducing the immediate need for ethane which is primarily responsible for the current lower ethane prices in the Mont Belvieu market. 
We also understand that several of these petchems are in turnarounds to also increase their ethane cracking capabilities. In addition, the price weakness is exacerbated by the petchems that are down for maintenance, [ filling ] ethane into the market. The lower natural gas price environment also puts downward pressure on ethane prices. There has been some concern about the impact of lower natural gas prices on our businesses. On the supply side, rigs are continuing to move away from dry gas regions and producers are focusing specifically on crude oil and liquids rich plays such as the Bakken, Cana-Woodford, Woodford, Granite Wash, Niobrara, Mississippi and Lime, and the Eagle Ford Shale. 
Fortunately for us, our assets are well positioned in all but one of these areas. From what we have seen in drilling schedules we have been provided we do not expect any material impact on volumes that supply our plants or systems that serve these liquid rich regions. With oil prices showing little signs of pulling back, the weaker natural gas prices help to maintain or further widen the ethane to crude ratio improving the U.S. petrochems industries' competitive position globally, and increasing demand for more NGL feedstock, which benefits our NGL business. Once these planned turnarounds are completed in the next few months, demand from the petchems for ethane and the price of ethane should strengthen, particularly in Mont Belvieu. 
Some experts are projecting ethane demand will reach new record highs later this year and will continue to grow over the long-term, especially with the announcements of petrochemical plant restarts, expansions, and development of new world class petrochemical plants. As a consequence, we expect NGL fractionation capacity to remain tight, but gradually become more available as new fractionators come online over the next few years. As NGL growth continues at a rapid pace, we believe that over the next couple of years there will be some periodic oversupplies of ethane as new NGL infrastructure brings additional NGLs to market. As we approach and move through the 2015 and 2017 timeframe, we believe supply and demand will remain relatively balanced, as new petrochemical plants and expansions come online. 
Now an update on our projects. First, our Bakken projects are expected to resolve some of the challenges producers are facing in the Williston Basin, in particular the flaring of NGL rich natural gas. Our first of 3 new processing plants in the Bakken; Garden Creek was completed in late December. The Stateline I plant is expected to be in service in the third quarter of this year with completion of the Stateline II plant following in the first half of 2013. The Stateline natural gas processing plant projects remain on schedule and on budget. 
Oil production in the Bakken continues to grow rapidly, and oil transportation infrastructure continues to be developed to meet producer needs thus allowing the current pace of drilling to continue. As you all are aware, drilling economics in the Bakken are primarily driven by crude oil prices and not significantly impacted by the current low natural gas price environment. The 500-plus-mile 60,000 barrel per day Bakken NGL pipeline, along with the expansions of the Bushton fractionator and Overland Pass Pipeline are either on schedule or ahead of schedule and on budget. 
We have acquired more than 85% of the right away needed for the Bakken NGL pipeline. Engineering and design continues to move along and steel pipe and many of the required materials have been purchased. Of special note, the Bushton fractionator expansion is now ahead of our original schedule, and is expected to be completed sometime in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with our original plan to complete it in the first half of 2013. 
Let's turn to our Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast projects. The expansion of our Mid-Continent to Mont Belvieu NGL distribution pipeline, Sterling I is done, adding 15,000 barrels per day of additional capacity to ship purity NGL products south to Mont Belvieu. The construction of 230 miles of NGL gathering pipelines in the Cana-Woodford and Granite Wash is on schedule with completion expected early in the second quarter of 2012, bringing 75,000 to 80,000 barrels per day of raw NGL through our existing system in the Mid-Continent and the Arbuckle Pipeline. 
The expansion of Arbuckle to 240,000 barrels per day from 180,000 barrels per day by installing additional pump stations is well underway with incremental barrels already being transported, as Pierce noted, and we expect all the pump stations to be completed and in service also in the second quarter of 2012. The 570-mile Sterling III pipeline in the 75,000 barrel per day MB II fractionator are progressing as planned. We have increased our supply commitments for both projects with approximately 75% committed on the 193,000 barrel per day Sterling III, that's the level of supply commitment we target for this project to achieve its required returns. All the capacity is committed on our 75,000 barrel per day MB II fractionator. Our commercial team has done a terrific job securing these supply commitments well before these assets go into service in 2013. 
We continue to develop and evaluate a lengthy backlog of natural gas and NGL related infrastructure projects, including investments in processing plants and NGL fractionation and storage facilities. This backlog totals more than $1 billion and it's growing. Some of these investments will create additional redundancy and reliability and improve our connectivity to our petchem customers, while others will provide the critical infrastructure that producers and processors need to get their products to market. As we've done in the past, we will announce the projects when we have sufficient producer and/or customer commitments to make them economically viable. 
John, that concludes my remarks."

Before we take your questions, I'd like to provide you with some context on our 2011 results, our updated 2012 guidance, and our future growth. While Terry has provided you with a detailed rundown of our $3 billion in growth projects, it's important to keep in perspective these current projects and the $2 billion of projects we completed in 2009. While there has been a lot of current detention on the widening NGL differentials between the Mid-Continent and the Gulf Coast, short-term ethane price softness, and declining natural gas prices, let's not lose sight of the fact that the assets we've built and are building, increase our ability to add volumes to our system, both natural gas and natural gas liquids, and to collect a fee to gather, process, fractionate, store, and transport these commodities for producers, processors and customers. 
These services provide us and our customers and investors with sustainable long-term value, regardless of short-term moves and differentials in prices. It's the incremental earnings from these projects, now in service and now being built that give us the ability to grow our earnings at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners by an average of approximately 20% per year for the next 3 years, to increase distributions to ONEOK Partners' unitholders this year and beyond and to increase the ONEOK dividend 50% by 2014. While internal growth may not be as exciting or as headline grabbing as an acquisition, internal growth project opportunities provide our investors with far better returns than if we were to buy earnings at today's prices. And we're not done. 
As you've just heard, our internal growth backlog is in excess of $1 billion and growing, providing us with more earnings growth potential. In closing, I would like to again thank our employees who work safely, reliably and environmentally responsibly every day to operate our assets, creating exceptional value for our investors and customers. We never forget that our success as a company depends on the efforts of all of our employees, and I, along with the rest of our management team, appreciate their efforts.

Canada is one that while it’s a target rich environment and there is lot of activity, its fertile ground. It's an area quite frankly we're not familiar with doing business there. So we would have -- we would be apprehensive a bit to, and to your point as it relates to those BP assets, Provident assets in Canada, we would be very cautious moving into Canada."

So we brought it back to where we thought it would average over the year. And then as we moved into the winter, and we saw certain things occur it became obvious to us that those dynamics in the marketplace were going to result in a $0.12 or $0.10 spread that it was going to be higher.

As it relates to transforming transaction, we obviously haven't made one, but in my comments and I've also talked about the fact that we've created more value for our shareholders and our unitholders by the now $5 billion worth of investments and infrastructure both in the gas and the gas liquids business. 
As I said we can create more value investing in those projects than we can going out and buying earnings at today's prices. So a transforming transaction which I have in the past compared to when we acquired the coke NGL assets, when we acquired the gathering and processing assets from Dynegy and Kinder Morgan. When we acquired the Bushton plant NGL storage with Kinder Morgan. Those when we look back, although they may not be significant in size, from a dollar perspective they were significant and they gave us the opportunity to then invest more money as it relates building that infrastructure. 
So we, be clear, are not driven to do a transforming transaction so that we can go to the marketplace to say we've done one. We will continue to invest where we see opportunities to create more value as it relates to the future of ONEOK and what ONEOK might look like, it's hard to argue with success. We've been successful, we look at opportunities as I indicated to Yves, we look for opportunities and other commodities where we think we can apply the same capabilities we have, we also look as an organization as to where we can increase our capabilities, so that we can move into other markets. 
It's all an [ iterative ] process that we apply all this -- all these techniques to. But I can't tell you a year from now whether we will have another stool. There has been years where energy services has made $230 million and gathering and processing barely broke even. But our commitment is for long-term.

And we don't believe overtime the seasonal spreads are gone forever."

And then if so, how do you think about balancing distribution growth versus retaining some of the excess cash flow from these activities in order to fund future growth? Thanks."

And it's always a balance trying to target that coverage ratio that we've talked about before in the $105 million to $115 million but be prudent with regards to long-term trends and where we see the business performing. So we felt that it was appropriate adjustment to reflect the increase in the partnership and yet at the same time be mindful that as the comments that have been made today that that long-term view on the optimization spread is not sustainable between Conway and Mont Belvieu and thus be able to use that cash flow appropriately to partially fund our growth projects."
