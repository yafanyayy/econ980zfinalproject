Please be sure to reference our earnings release issued January 25th in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website, to supplement this webcast.

Before we go any further, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.

Strong sales growth across all businesses and acceleration in spending on our growth programs was the story for the quarter. Continued strong organic sales performance in the quarter with 9% volume growth is evidence that we continue to gain market share.

For the 2011 fourth quarter, the company reported record sales of $2.1 billion, an increase of 14% versus $1.8 billion in the 2010 quarter. Net earnings of $148 million increased 12% and earnings per share of $2.04 increased 11% versus a $1.83 in 2010.

In the earnings release and at the end of this podcast script, we provided a walk down of items to help explain results for the quarter and highlight what items were not reflected in our guidance. The 2011 fourth quarter included a $0.16 per share charge from the closure of 27 branches in the U.S. business and a $0.07 per share gain from the sale of our 49% ownership in a joint venture MRO Korea.

These two items combined represented a $0.09 net reduction to earnings per share, resulting in adjusted EPS of $2.13. The 2010 fourth quarter included a $0.04 per share benefit from the change to the company’s paid time off policy. Excluding these items in both years, earnings per share increased 19% in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the 2010 quarter.

In a few moments we’ll take a closer look at sales results for the quarter. In the meantime, let’s walk down the income statement. Our gross profit margin for the quarter increased 180 basis points versus last year. The increase in the company’s gross profit margin was driven by a number of factors that are explained at the segment level. In addition, the inclusion of the Fabory business for the quarter contributed to gross margin expansion, but was a drag on the company’s operating margin.

Company operating earnings of $221 million for the 2011 fourth quarter increased 5%. If you exclude the $18 million pre-tax expense from the branch closures in the 2011 quarter and the $4 million pre-tax benefit from the change in paid time off policy in the 2010 quarter, operating earnings were up 16% for the quarter. Adjusting for these items, company operating margin for the quarter increased by 20 basis points to 11.6% versus the prior-year, the strong margin expansion in the first three quarters of 2011 was tempered in the final quarter by $31 million in incremental growth-related spending. This included new sales representatives, eCommerce, advertising and expenses for our new 800,000 square foot distribution center in northern California. In addition, the Fabory business posted an operating loss for the quarter.

Net earnings and earnings per share for the 2011 fourth quarter also included a benefit from a lower tax rate than in the 2010 fourth quarter. The effective tax rate was 32.9% and 36.6% in the 2011 and 2010 fourth quarters, respectively. The lower tax rate resulted primarily from a lower state tax expense, tax law changes in Japan enacted in late November of 2011, and higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. The $31 million in incremental growth-related expenses contributed to this lower tax rate, as the spending was concentrated in the United States, which has Grainger’s largest and most profitable business, with one of the highest tax rates in the company.

Let’s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we’ll cover the following topics. First, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of December, second, our operating performance by segment. Third, cash generation and capital deployment and finally we’ll wrap up with a discussion on our 2012 guidance and other key items of interest.

As mentioned earlier, total company sales for the quarter increased 14% versus the prior-year. There were 63 selling days in the quarter, the same as the 2010 fourth quarter. Strong volume growth was responsible for the majority of the revenue increase contributing 9 percentage points, followed by 5 percentage points from acquisitions, 2 percentage points from price, partially offset by a 2 percentage point drag from product sales related to the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

Let’s move on to sales by segment. We report two segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations in Europe, Japan, Mexico, India, Colombia, China, Puerto Rico, Panama and our newest location in the Dominican Republic, are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses.

Sales in the United States segment, which accounted for about 77% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 8%. The sales increase in the United States was driven primarily by 8% volume growth and 3 percentage points from price. This growth was partially offset by a 2 percentage points drag from oil spill-related sales in 2010 and a 1 percentage point headwind from lower sales of seasonal products due to the unusually warm weather in the 2011 quarter.

All U.S end-markets, except reseller, posted growth versus the 2010 fourth quarter. Heavy manufacturing and commercial were up in the low double digits. Light manufacturing and retail were up in the high single digits. Government was up in the mid single digits. Contractor was up in the low single digits and reseller was down in the mid-teens due to the difficult comparison with strong oil spill related sales in the 2010 fourth quarter.

Now let’s turn our attention to our Canadian business, which accounted for about 12% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 13% in U.S. dollars and were up 14% in local currency. Volume growth contributed 13 percentage points to the sales increase, while acquisitions completed during the last 12 months contributed 1 additional percentage point. This growth was partially offset by a 1 percentage point headwind from foreign exchange. The sales increase in Canada was led by strong growth to customers in the Construction, Heavy Manufacturing, Agriculture and Mining sectors of the economy.

Let’s conclude our review of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations in Europe, Japan, Mexico, India, Colombia, China, Puerto Rico, Panama and the Dominican Republic and currently represents about 11% of total company sales. Sales for this group were up 95%, primarily the result of the incremental sales from Fabory, combined with strong revenue growth in Japan and Mexico. Excluding Fabory, sales for the Other Businesses increased 26% in the quarter.

Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for October and November and shared some information regarding December sales performance during the month. Total company sales increased 10% in December 2011 versus December of 2010. Both months had 21 selling days. Contributing to higher daily sales growth in December were 9 percentage points due to volume, which is consistent with the quarter and ahead of the 8% volume growth for the full-year, 4 percentage points from acquisitions and 2 percentage points due to price. This sales growth was partially offset by a 3 percentage point drag related to the oil spill and a 2 percentage point headwind due to lower sales of seasonal products.

In the United States, sales for the month of December increased 5%. This growth consisted of 8 percentage points of volume and 2 percentage points from price, offset by a 3 percentage point drag related to the oil spill and a 2 percentage point drag from lower sales of seasonal products. Here is how each of our U.S. customer end-markets performed in December.

Heavy Manufacturing was up in the low double digits. Commercial and Retail were up in the high single digits. Light Manufacturing and Government were up in the mid single digits. Contractor was down in the low single digits, and Reseller was down in the high twenties due to the difficult comparison with strong oil spill related sales in December of 2010.

In Canada, sales in December increased 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency. Volume accounted for about 12 percentage points of the growth, offset by 2 percentage points from foreign exchange and 1 percentage point from lower sales of seasonal products. From a customer end-market standpoint, we saw the strongest growth in sales to the Heavy Manufacturing, Retail and Commercial Segments.

With five selling days left in the month, daily sales growth in January is trending above December and slightly above the high-end of our 10% to 14% range for the full year. In the U.S. business, we’re seeing stronger growth among customers in the Heavy and Light Manufacturing end-markets, and a recovery in the Contractor market which was hurt by the warm weather in December.

While sales growth from our new Territory Sales Representatives in tracking to plan, a disproportionate amount of our organic revenue growth is being driven by large contract customers with lower gross profit margins. Month-to-date sales results in Canada and Mexico are also running ahead of our daily sales growth in the 2011 fourth quarter. Consistent with December and the fourth quarter, a portion of the sales growth in January is attributable to the incremental sales from Fabory.

Now I’d like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.

276060,118575511,210466,"W.W. Grainger, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2012",2012-01-25,"Earnings Calls","W.W. Grainger, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Laura. The story behind the company’s operating results in the quarter can best be told by reviewing segment performance. So, let’s begin with the United States.Reported operating earnings in the United States increased 5% versus the 2010",1286,"Thanks, Laura. The story behind the company’s operating results in the quarter can best be told by reviewing segment performance. So, let’s begin with the United States.

Reported operating earnings in the United States increased 5% versus the 2010 fourth quarter up 15% excluding the charge related to the 2011 branch closures and the 2010 paid time off benefit. The growth and operating earnings was primarily driven by the 8% sales growth and improved gross profit margins.

Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 170 basis points driven primarily by price increases exceeding cost increases, positive selling mix from a decline in sales of lower margin sourced products primarily attributable to the oil spill in 2010, growth of our private label business, and lower excess and obsolete requirements.

Operating expenses in the U.S. increased 15% on a reported basis, 10% excluding the two items just noted. The 10% increase in operating expenses was driven by higher volume related expenses and growth-related spending including new sales representatives, eCommerce, advertising and incremental expenses for the 800,000 square foot distribution center in Northern California.

One of the growth programs that contributed to the operating expense growth in the quarter was our sales force expansion. We hired our 6th wave of Territory Sales Representatives or TSRs, and now have more than 500 of these new sales representatives calling on customers across the United States.

As we shared at our Analyst Meeting in November, we’re very excited about the additional reach these sellers provide as they call on both existing and prospective customers. We estimate that TSRs will account for approximately 1 percentage point of our expected sales growth in 2012 and 2 percentage points in 2013. On average, a TSR cost approximately 40% less than an Account Manager and are generating sales with a gross profit margin north of 50%. As we build out our coverage, we expect to hire another 300 TSRs in 2012.

Another growth program we’re aggressively funding is eCommerce. In 2011, we transacted approximately $2 billion in sales through eCommerce, representing about 25% of total company sales. We’re also in the midst of transitioning to a new U.S. platform that should allow for more functionality, speed and personalization. Most recently, we officially launched our new mobile site that interacts seamlessly with Grainger.com. It enables users with smart phones to search for products, create personal lists, view real-time inventory availability, approve and place orders. Customers can then choose to have those products shift from a distribution center or picked up at a local branch through the branch locator tool. Our mobile platform fully leverages our multi-channel business model.

Let’s now look at the strong operating performance of our business in Canada. Operating earnings increased 121% in U.S dollars and 123% in local currency. Gross profit margins in Canada increased 250 basis points, due primarily to effective price cost management, and growth of our private label business.

Operating expenses in Canada increased 1%, primarily the result of effective cost management and easy comparisons with the 2010 quarter that included start-up related costs for the new distribution center in British Columbia.

Operating earnings at our other businesses, which again includes our operations in Europe, Latin America and Asia were flat versus the 2010 fourth quarter at $5 million. Lead by Japan, Mexico and Columbia, earnings improved over the prior-year fourth quarter in virtually all countries with the exception of recent startups and Fabory, our business in Europe acquired on August 31, 2011.

Excluding Fabory, operating earnings for this group were $6 million in the quarter. From an EPS perspective, Fabory generated $0.04 per share of dilution for the company in the quarter and $0.02 per share of dilution for the four months, since the acquisition.

As a reminder, we originally expected Fabory to be earnings neutral for 2011, but performance was not as strong as expected due to softer sales and customer mix, primarily due to the economic climate in Europe.

Lastly, let’s take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $164 million versus $104 million in 2010. We used the cash generated to invest in the business and pay $48 million in dividends, which reflects the 22% increase in the quarterly dividend rate announced last April or $0.66 per share.

We also bought back 284,000 shares of stock for $50 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $66 million, which was primarily invested in expanding the capacity of our distribution center network in the United States.

Now, let’s take a look at the full-year. Operating cash flow was $724 million in 2011 versus $596 million in 2010. Capital expenditures for the year were $197 million and $128 million in 2010. Most of the year-over-year increase in capital spending was attributable to investments in our distribution network.

In addition, we funded a portion of the Fabory acquisition with cash and paid down debt. We bought back 1 million shares of stock during 2011 for $151 million and have approximately 7.1 million shares remaining on the current authorization.

In addition, we paid shareholders $181 million of dividends in 2011. So, for the full-year, we returned a total of $332 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.

At our Annual Analyst Meeting in November, we issued sales and earnings guidance for 2012, and we reiterated that guidance today. We continue to expect 2012 sales to grow in the range of 10% to 14%, and 2012 EPS in the range of $9.90 to $10.65. We also expect operating margin expansion of 20 to 50 basis points including Fabory and 50 to 80 basis points on an organic basis.

Here are a few additional considerations as you refine your models. Organic sales growth in the 2012 first quarter is off to a strong start, benefiting from a number of new large customer contracts that began with initial lift in early January.

Keep in mind that a healthy portion of our top-line growth is also coming from emerging markets including acquisitions like Fabory, which should continue to contribute about 4 to 5 percentage points of our growth in the first eight months of the year, albeit at lower operating margins.

We’ll have 64 selling days in the first quarter, which is the same number as the 2011 first quarter. Gross profit margins in the 2012 first quarter should expand versus the 2011 fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2011. But we’ll be tempered by faster organic growth from larger contract customers with lower gross profit margins.

Organic growth investments are expected to ramp up throughout the 2012 first quarter similar to the 2011 fourth quarter. As we move through the year, difficult prior-year operating expense comparisons will ease, particularly, as we anniversary the opening of the Northern California distribution center and the Fabory acquisition in the third quarter, which should then allow for better earnings leverage.

We expect the effective tax rate for 2012 to be 37.9%. And as a result, we expect 2012 first quarter earnings per share to grow inline with sales growth with improved earnings leverage later in the year.

Finally, we remain committed to delivering top quartile total shareholder return, which is forecasted at 18% to 19% in 2012, as detailed on Exhibit 04.

Third, cash generation and capital deployment and finally we’ll wrap up with a discussion on our 2012 guidance and other key items of interest.
As mentioned earlier, total company sales for the quarter increased 14% versus the prior-year. There were 63 selling days in the quarter, the same as the 2010 fourth quarter. Strong volume growth was responsible for the majority of the revenue increase contributing 9 percentage points, followed by 5 percentage points from acquisitions, 2 percentage points from price, partially offset by a 2 percentage point drag from product sales related to the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
Let’s move on to sales by segment. We report two segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations in Europe, Japan, Mexico, India, Colombia, China, Puerto Rico, Panama and our newest location in the Dominican Republic, are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses.
Sales in the United States segment, which accounted for about 77% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 8%. The sales increase in the United States was driven primarily by 8% volume growth and 3 percentage points from price. This growth was partially offset by a 2 percentage points drag from oil spill-related sales in 2010 and a 1 percentage point headwind from lower sales of seasonal products due to the unusually warm weather in the 2011 quarter.
All U.S end-markets, except reseller, posted growth versus the 2010 fourth quarter. Heavy manufacturing and commercial were up in the low double digits.

Contractor was up in the low single digits and reseller was down in the mid-teens due to the difficult comparison with strong oil spill related sales in the 2010 fourth quarter.

Excluding Fabory, sales for the Other Businesses increased 26% in the quarter.
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for October and November and shared some information regarding December sales performance during the month. Total company sales increased 10% in December 2011 versus December of 2010. Both months had 21 selling days. Contributing to higher daily sales growth in December were 9 percentage points due to volume, which is consistent with the quarter and ahead of the 8% volume growth for the full-year, 4 percentage points from acquisitions and 2 percentage points due to price. This sales growth was partially offset by a 3 percentage point drag related to the oil spill and a 2 percentage point headwind due to lower sales of seasonal products.
In the United States, sales for the month of December increased 5%. This growth consisted of 8 percentage points of volume and 2 percentage points from price, offset by a 3 percentage point drag related to the oil spill and a 2 percentage point drag from lower sales of seasonal products. Here is how each of our U.S. customer end-markets performed in December.
Heavy Manufacturing was up in the low double digits. Commercial and Retail were up in the high single digits. Light Manufacturing and Government were up in the mid single digits. Contractor was down in the low single digits, and Reseller was down in the high twenties due to the difficult comparison with strong oil spill related sales in December of 2010.

Volume accounted for about 12 percentage points of the growth, offset by 2 percentage points from foreign exchange and 1 percentage point from lower sales of seasonal products. From a customer end-market standpoint, we saw the strongest growth in sales to the Heavy Manufacturing, Retail and Commercial Segments.
With five selling days left in the month, daily sales growth in January is trending above December and slightly above the high-end of our 10% to 14% range for the full year. In the U.S. business, we’re seeing stronger growth among customers in the Heavy and Light Manufacturing end-markets, and a recovery in the Contractor market which was hurt by the warm weather in December.

As a reminder, we originally expected Fabory to be earnings neutral for 2011, but performance was not as strong as expected due to softer sales and customer mix, primarily due to the economic climate in Europe.
Lastly, let’s take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $164 million versus $104 million in 2010. We used the cash generated to invest in the business and pay $48 million in dividends, which reflects the 22% increase in the quarterly dividend rate announced last April or $0.66 per share.
We also bought back 284,000 shares of stock for $50 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $66 million, which was primarily invested in expanding the capacity of our distribution center network in the United States.
Now, let’s take a look at the full-year. Operating cash flow was $724 million in 2011 versus $596 million in 2010. Capital expenditures for the year were $197 million and $128 million in 2010. Most of the year-over-year increase in capital spending was attributable to investments in our distribution network.
In addition, we funded a portion of the Fabory acquisition with cash and paid down debt. We bought back 1 million shares of stock during 2011 for $151 million and have approximately 7.1 million shares remaining on the current authorization.
In addition, we paid shareholders $181 million of dividends in 2011. So, for the full-year, we returned a total of $332 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
At our Annual Analyst Meeting in November, we issued sales and earnings guidance for 2012, and we reiterated that guidance today. We continue to expect 2012 sales to grow in the range of 10% to 14%, and 2012 EPS in the range of $9.90 to $10.65. We also expect operating margin expansion of 20 to 50 basis points including Fabory and 50 to 80 basis points on an organic basis.
Here are a few additional considerations as you refine your models. Organic sales growth in the 2012 first quarter is off to a strong start, benefiting from a number of new large customer contracts that began with initial lift in early January.
Keep in mind that a healthy portion of our top-line growth is also coming from emerging markets including acquisitions like Fabory, which should continue to contribute about 4 to 5 percentage points of our growth in the first eight months of the year, albeit at lower operating margins.
We’ll have 64 selling days in the first quarter, which is the same number as the 2011 first quarter. Gross profit margins in the 2012 first quarter should expand versus the 2011 fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2011, but will be tempered by faster organic growth from larger contract customers with lower gross profit margins.
Organic growth investments are expected to ramp up throughout the 2012 first quarter similar to the 2011 fourth quarter. As we move through the year, difficult prior-year operating expense comparisons will ease, particularly, as we anniversary the opening of the Northern California distribution center and the Fabory acquisition in the third quarter, which should then allow for better earnings leverage.
We expect the effective tax rate for 2012 to be 37.9%. And as a result, we expect 2012 first quarter earnings per share to grow inline with sales growth with improved earnings leverage later in the year.
Finally, we remain committed to delivering top quartile total shareholder return, which is forecasted at 18% to 19% in 2012, as detailed on Exhibit 04.

Before we go any further, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute forward-looking information.

Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.
Strong sales growth across all businesses and acceleration in spending on our growth programs was the story for the quarter. Continued strong organic sales performance in the quarter with 9% volume growth is evidence that we continue to gain market share.
For the 2011 fourth quarter, the company reported record sales of $2.1 billion, an increase of 14% versus $1.8 billion in the 2010 quarter. Net earnings of $148 million increased 12% and earnings per share of $2.04 increased 11% versus $1.83 in 2010.
In the earnings release and at the end of this podcast script, we provided a walk down of items to help explain results for the quarter and highlight what items were not reflected in our guidance. The 2011 fourth quarter included a $0.16 per share charge from the closure of 27 branches in the U.S. business and a $0.07 per share gain from the sale of our 49% ownership in a joint venture MRO Korea.
These two items combined represented a $0.09 net reduction to earnings per share, resulting in adjusted EPS of $2.13. The 2010 fourth quarter included a $0.04 per share benefit from the change to the company’s paid time off policy. Excluding these items in both years, earnings per share increased 19% in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the 2010 quarter.
In a few moments we’ll take a closer look at sales results for the quarter. In the meantime, let’s walk down the income statement. Our gross profit margin for the quarter increased 180 basis points versus last year. The increase in the company’s gross profit margin was driven by a number of factors that are explained at the segment level. In addition, the inclusion of the Fabory business for the quarter contributed to gross margin expansion, but was a drag on the company’s operating margin.
Company operating earnings of $221 million for the 2011 fourth quarter increased 5%. If you exclude the $18 million pre-tax expense from the branch closures in the 2011 quarter and the $4 million pre-tax benefit from the change in paid time off policy in the 2010 quarter, operating earnings were up 16% for the quarter. Adjusting for these items, company operating margin for the quarter increased by 20 basis points to 11.6% versus the prior-year, the strong margin expansion in the first three quarters of 2011 was tempered in the final quarter by $31 million in incremental growth-related spending. This included new sales representatives, eCommerce, advertising and expenses for our new 800,000 square foot distribution center in northern California. In addition, the Fabory business posted an operating loss for the quarter.
Net earnings and earnings per share for the 2011 fourth quarter also included a benefit from a lower tax rate than in the 2010 fourth quarter. The effective tax rate was 32.9% and 36.6% in the 2011 and 2010 fourth quarters, respectively. The lower tax rate resulted primarily from a lower state tax expense, tax law changes in Japan enacted in late November of 2011, and higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. The $31 million in incremental growth-related expenses contributed to this lower tax rate, as the spending was concentrated in the United States, which has Grainger’s largest and most profitable business, with one of the highest tax rates in the company.
Let’s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we’ll cover the following topics. First, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of December, second, our operating performance by segment. Third, cash generation and capital deployment and finally we’ll wrap up with a discussion on our 2012 guidance and other key items of interest.
As mentioned earlier, total company sales for the quarter increased 14% versus the prior-year. There were 63 selling days in the quarter, the same as the 2010 fourth quarter. Strong volume growth was responsible for the majority of the revenue increase contributing 9 percentage points, followed by 5 percentage points from acquisitions, 2 percentage points from price, partially offset by a 2 percentage point drag from product sales related to the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
Let’s move on to sales by segment. We report two segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations in Europe, Japan, Mexico, India, Colombia, China, Puerto Rico, Panama and our newest location in the Dominican Republic, are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses.
Sales in the United States segment, which accounted for about 77% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 8%. The sales increase in the United States was driven primarily by 8% volume growth and 3 percentage points from price. This growth was partially offset by a 2 percentage points drag from oil spill-related sales in 2010 and a 1 percentage point headwind from lower sales of seasonal products due to the unusually warm weather in the 2011 quarter.
All U.S end-markets, except reseller, posted growth versus the 2010 fourth quarter. Heavy manufacturing and commercial were up in the low double digits. Light manufacturing and retail were up in the high single digits. Government was up in the mid single digits. Contractor was up in the low single digits and reseller was down in the mid-teens due to the difficult comparison with strong oil spill related sales in the 2010 fourth quarter.
Now let’s turn our attention to our Canadian business, which accounted for about 12% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 13% in U.S. dollars and were up 14% in local currency. Volume growth contributed 13 percentage points to the sales increase, while acquisitions completed during the last 12 months contributed 1 additional percentage point. This growth was partially offset by a 1 percentage point headwind from foreign exchange. The sales increase in Canada was led by strong growth to customers in the Construction, Heavy Manufacturing, Agriculture and Mining sectors of the economy.
Let’s conclude our review of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations in Europe, Japan, Mexico, India, Colombia, China, Puerto Rico, Panama and the Dominican Republic and currently represents about 11% of total company sales. Sales for this group were up 95%, primarily the result of the incremental sales from Fabory, combined with strong revenue growth in Japan and Mexico. Excluding Fabory, sales for the Other Businesses increased 26% in the quarter.
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for October and November and shared some information regarding December sales performance during the month. Total company sales increased 10% in December 2011 versus December of 2010. Both months had 21 selling days. Contributing to higher daily sales growth in December were 9 percentage points due to volume, which is consistent with the quarter and ahead of the 8% volume growth for the full-year, 4 percentage points from acquisitions and 2 percentage points due to price. This sales growth was partially offset by a 3 percentage point drag related to the oil spill and a 2 percentage point headwind due to lower sales of seasonal products.
In the United States, sales for the month of December increased 5%. This growth consisted of 8 percentage points of volume and 2 percentage points from price, offset by a 3 percentage point drag related to the oil spill and a 2 percentage point drag from lower sales of seasonal products. Here is how each of our U.S. customer end-markets performed in December.
Heavy Manufacturing was up in the low double digits. Commercial and Retail were up in the high single digits. Light Manufacturing and Government were up in the mid single digits. Contractor was down in the low single digits, and Reseller was down in the high twenties due to the difficult comparison with strong oil spill related sales in December of 2010.
In Canada, sales in December increased 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency. Volume accounted for about 12 percentage points of the growth, offset by 2 percentage points from foreign exchange and 1 percentage point from lower sales of seasonal products. From a customer end-market standpoint, we saw the strongest growth in sales to the Heavy Manufacturing, Retail and Commercial Segments.
With five selling days left in the month, daily sales growth in January is trending above December and slightly above the high-end of our 10% to 14% range for the full year. In the U.S. business, we’re seeing stronger growth among customers in the Heavy and Light Manufacturing end-markets, and a recovery in the Contractor market which was hurt by the warm weather in December.
While sales growth from our new Territory Sales Representatives is tracking to plan, a disproportionate amount of our organic revenue growth is being driven by large contract customers with lower gross profit margins. Month-to-date sales results in Canada and Mexico are also running ahead of our daily sales growth in the 2011 fourth quarter. Consistent with December and the fourth quarter, a portion of the sales growth in January is attributable to the incremental sales from Fabory.
Now I’d like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

The story behind the company’s operating results in the quarter can best be told by reviewing segment performance. So, let’s begin with the United States.Reported operating earnings in the United States increased 5% versus the 2010 fo",1287,"Thanks, Laura. The story behind the company’s operating results in the quarter can best be told by reviewing segment performance. So, let’s begin with the United States.
Reported operating earnings in the United States increased 5% versus the 2010 fourth quarter up 15% excluding the charge related to the 2011 branch closures and the 2010 paid time off benefit. The growth and operating earnings was primarily driven by the 8% sales growth and improved gross profit margins.
Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 170 basis points driven primarily by price increases exceeding cost increases, positive selling mix from a decline in sales of lower margin sourced products primarily attributable to the oil spill in 2010, growth of our private label business, and lower excess and obsolete requirements.
Operating expenses in the U.S. increased 15% on a reported basis, 10% excluding the two items just noted. The 10% increase in operating expenses was driven by higher volume related expenses and growth-related spending including new sales representatives, eCommerce, advertising and incremental expenses for the 800,000 square foot distribution center in Northern California.
One of the growth programs that contributed to the operating expense growth in the quarter was our sales force expansion. We hired our 6th wave of Territory Sales Representatives or TSRs, and now have more than 500 of these new sales representatives calling on customers across the United States.
As we shared at our Analyst Meeting in November, we’re very excited about the additional reach these sellers provide as they call on both existing and prospective customers. We estimate that TSRs will account for approximately 1 percentage point of our expected sales growth in 2012 and 2 percentage points in 2013. On average, a TSR costs approximately 40% less than an Account Manager and are generating sales with a gross profit margin north of 50%. As we build out our coverage, we expect to hire another 300 TSRs in 2012.
Another growth program we’re aggressively funding is eCommerce. In 2011, we transacted approximately $2 billion in sales through eCommerce, representing about 25% of total company sales. We’re also in the midst of transitioning to a new U.S. platform that should allow for more functionality, speed and personalization. Most recently, we officially launched our new mobile site that interacts seamlessly with Grainger.com. It enables users with smart phones to search for products, create personal lists, view real-time inventory availability, approve and place orders. Customers can then choose to have those products shipped from a distribution center or picked up at a local branch through the branch locator tool. Our mobile platform fully leverages our multi-channel business model.
Let’s now look at the strong operating performance of our business in Canada. Operating earnings increased 121% in U.S dollars and 123% in local currency. Gross profit margins in Canada increased 250 basis points, due primarily to effective price cost management, and growth of our private label business.
Operating expenses in Canada increased 1%, primarily the result of effective cost management and easy comparisons with the 2010 quarter that included start-up related costs for the new distribution center in British Columbia.
Operating earnings at our other businesses, which again includes our operations in Europe, Latin America and Asia were flat versus the 2010 fourth quarter at $5 million. Led by Japan, Mexico and Columbia, earnings improved over the prior-year fourth quarter in virtually all countries with the exception of recent startups and Fabory, our business in Europe acquired on August 31, 2011.
Excluding Fabory, operating earnings for this group were $6 million in the quarter. From an EPS perspective, Fabory generated $0.04 per share of dilution for the company in the quarter and $0.02 per share of dilution for the four months, since the acquisition.
As a reminder, we originally expected Fabory to be earnings neutral for 2011, but performance was not as strong as expected due to softer sales and customer mix, primarily due to the economic climate in Europe.
Lastly, let’s take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $164 million versus $104 million in 2010. We used the cash generated to invest in the business and pay $48 million in dividends, which reflects the 22% increase in the quarterly dividend rate announced last April or $0.66 per share.
We also bought back 284,000 shares of stock for $50 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $66 million, which was primarily invested in expanding the capacity of our distribution center network in the United States.
Now let’s take a look at the full-year. Operating cash flow was $724 million in 2011 versus $596 million in 2010. Capital expenditures for the year were $197 million and $128 million in 2010. Most of the year-over-year increase in capital spending was attributable to investments in our distribution network.
In addition, we funded a portion of the Fabory acquisition with cash and paid down debt. We bought back 1 million shares of stock during 2011 for $151 million and have approximately 7.1 million shares remaining on the current authorization.
In addition, we paid shareholders $181 million of dividends in 2011. So, for the full-year, we returned a total of $332 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
At our Annual Analyst Meeting in November, we issued sales and earnings guidance for 2012, and we reiterated that guidance today. We continue to expect 2012 sales to grow in the range of 10% to 14%, and 2012 EPS in the range of $9.90 to $10.65. We also expect operating margin expansion of 20 to 50 basis points including Fabory and 50 to 80 basis points on an organic basis.
Here are a few additional considerations as you refine your models. Organic sales growth in the 2012 first quarter is off to a strong start, benefiting from a number of new large customer contracts that began with initial lift in early January.
Keep in mind that a healthy portion of our top-line growth is also coming from emerging markets including acquisitions like Fabory, which should continue to contribute about 4 to 5 percentage points of our growth in the first eight months of the year, albeit at lower operating margins.
We’ll have 64 selling days in the first quarter, which is the same number as the 2011 first quarter. Gross profit margins in the 2012 first quarter should expand versus the 2011 fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2011, but will be tempered by faster organic growth from larger contract customers with lower gross profit margins.
Organic growth investments are expected to ramp up throughout the 2012 first quarter similar to the 2011 fourth quarter. As we move through the year, difficult prior-year operating expense comparisons will ease, particularly, as we anniversary the opening of the Northern California distribution center and the Fabory acquisition in the third quarter, which should then allow for better earnings leverage.
We expect the effective tax rate for 2012 to be 37.9%. And as a result, we expect 2012 first quarter earnings per share to grow in line with sales growth with improved earnings leverage later in the year.
Finally, we remain committed to delivering top quartile total shareholder return, which is forecasted at 18% to 19% in 2012, as detailed on Exhibit 04.

Strong sales growth and consistent execution was the story for the quarter. This performance was largely driven by continued enhancements to the foundation of our business and aggressive investment in our growth programs. As a result of the strong start to 2012, we have increased and narrowed the ranges for our sales and EPS guidance as referenced in today’s earnings release. We now expect sales to grow 12% to 14% and are forecasting EPS of $10.40 to $10.80 for the full year 2012. At the end of this recording, we’ll talk more about our revised guidance and our assumptions.

We’ll start with total company results, and then take a closer look at our segments. Company sales increased 16% versus the 2011 first quarter. We had 64 selling days in both quarters. Operating earnings increased 16%, while net earnings increased 19%. As highlighted in our release, earnings per share of $2.57 for the quarter is an all-time company record and represents an 18% increase versus 2011.

In a few moments we’ll take a closer look at sales results for the quarter; let’s now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Gross profit margins increased 40 basis points to 44.4%, as we successfully expanded gross margins across the business. Due to our size and scale, we were able to increase prices with the market and ahead of product cost inflation. We’ll provide more detail when we review the business by segment.

It is important to note that our gross profit margin follows a fairly consistent annual pattern, with generally highest gross margins in the first quarter. This is primarily driven by supplier funding for our annual customer trade shows in the quarter.

Company operating margins were essentially flat with the prior year at 13.9%. This was a function of strong sales growth and gross margin expansion offset by higher operating expenses driven by Fabory’s incremental expenses, growth-related spending, and higher corporate expenses, including stock-based compensation and expenses related to M&A activity and other corporate support expenses.

Let’s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we’ll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of March; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we’ll wrap up with a discussion of our revised 2012 guidance.

As mentioned earlier, company sales increased 16% for the quarter. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 17% in January, 18% in February, and 15% in March. Of the 16% sales growth for the quarter, volume contributed 10 percentage points, acquisitions added 5 percentage points, and price added 3 percentage points. Foreign exchange and lower sales of seasonal products each represented a 1 percentage point drag on daily sales growth for the quarter.

Let’s move on to sales by segment. We report two segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations in Asia, Europe, and Latin America are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses.

Sales in the United States, which account for about 77% of total company revenue, increased 11% in the quarter, consisting of 9% volume growth and 3% from price, partially offset by a drag of 1 percentage point due to lower sales of seasonal products. By month, daily sales in the United States were up 11% in January, up 12% in February, and up 9% in March.

Now we’ll cover sales performance by customer end-market in the United States. We believe that increasing our product line, expanding customer sales coverage, and increasing our eCommerce capabilities is enabling the company to grow faster than the economy and gain additional market share.

As a result, sales to every customer end-market we serve in the United States, including Government, were positive in the quarter as follows. Natural Resources, formerly Agriculture and Mining, and Heavy Manufacturing were up in the mid-teens. Commercial, Retail, and Light Manufacturing were up in the low double-digits. Reseller was up in the high single-digits, and Government and Contractors were up in the mid-single-digits.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, we announced the possible divestiture of our Specialty Brands. Since that time, we have not received an acceptable offer. We plan to continue to operate the businesses and evaluate future options.

Now let’s turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represent about 12% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 13% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currency. On a daily basis in Canadian dollars, sales were up 19% in January, up 14% in February, and up 11% in March. The 14% local currency sales growth in the quarter consisted of 13% volume growth and 1 percentage point from price.

From a customer standpoint, sales growth in Canada was driven by strength in the Construction, Agriculture and Mining, Transportation, Retail/Wholesale, and Heavy Manufacturing customer end-markets.

Let’s conclude our review of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, and currently represents about 11% of total company sales.

Sales for this group increased 104%, the result of strong growth in Japan and Mexico, coupled with the incremental sales from Fabory, our business in Europe acquired in August of 2011. Excluding Fabory, sales for our Other Businesses increased 33%.

Beginning in the second quarter, our Other Businesses will include the results of our newly acquired business in Brazil. This business, formerly known as AnFreixo S.A., is a leading broad line distributor of maintenance, repair, and operating (MRO) supplies and had 2011 sales of approximately US$37 million. The acquisition provides us with a solid entry point for physical operations in Brazil, the largest MRO market in Latin America.

Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for January and February and shared some information regarding sales performance in the month. Let’s now take a closer look at March. There were 22 selling days in March of 2012, one less than 2011. Total company sales were up 15% on a daily basis in March of 2012 versus March of 2011. The 15% growth consisted of 8% volume growth, 3 percentage points from price inflation, and 5 percentage points from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1 percentage point drag from foreign exchange.

In the United States, March daily sales were up 9%. This growth consisted of 6 percentage points of volume and 3 percentage points from price. Sales trends in March are more representative of our expectation for revenue growth going forward.

Conversely, sales growth in January and February was unusually strong due to the following factors: number one, customer pre-buying in advance of our February price increase, particularly in our lighting product line; number two, a higher advertising spend; and number three, easier comparisons in January and February versus March.

Consistent with the quarter, we saw positive daily sales growth in March to each of our U.S. customer end-markets as follows: Natural Resources increased in the low 20s; Heavy Manufacturing and Commercial increased in the low double-digits; Light Manufacturing, Reseller, and Retail were up in the high single-digits; Government was up in the mid-single-digits; and Contractor was up in the low single-digits.

Daily sales in Canada for March increased 10% in U.S. dollars, up 11% in local currency. The 11% local currency daily sales growth consisted of 11% volume and 1 percentage point from price, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline attributable to lower sales of seasonal products.

Similar to the quarter, customers in the Construction, Agriculture and Mining, Transportation, Retail/Wholesale, and Heavy Manufacturing customer end-markets accounted for the largest increases in sales growth. The growth rate in March was influenced by difficult comparisons, particularly in the Government sector, where spending reached record levels in 2011.

Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 110% in March, the result of strong growth in Japan and Mexico along with sales for our business in Europe. Excluding Fabory, sales for the Other Businesses increased 38% in March.

Sales growth in the month of April started a bit slowly, primarily due to the religious holidays, but is expected to be roughly in line with the growth in March.

Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.

This performance was driven by 11% sales growth, higher gross margins, and positive expense leverage.

Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 10 basis points driven by price increases exceeding cost inflation, partially offset by higher freight costs and unfavorable mix, as lower sales of seasonal products slowed the sales growth of private label products. Expense leverage in the United States was positive despite higher growth-related spending on new sales representatives, eCommerce, and advertising.

Let’s move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings increased 24% versus the prior year, 26% in local currency. Strong sales growth coupled with higher gross margins and effective cost management contributed to operating margins increasing 100 basis points to 10.9%. Gross margins increased 60 basis points, primarily driven by improved customer mix and higher prices.

Operating performance for our Other Businesses improved versus a year ago, the result of our focus on improving growth and operating results. This group posted operating earnings of $11 million for the quarter versus $6 million a year ago. Strong operating performance in Japan and Mexico, coupled with $1 million in operating earnings from Fabory, drove the improved results for this group.

Below the operating line, interest expense, net of interest income, was $2.5 million in the 2012 first quarter versus $1.4 million in the 2011 first quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to interest on the debt of €120 million used to finance a portion of the Fabory acquisition.

As mentioned at our November Analyst Meeting and in the 2011 Form 10-K, we were originally forecasting an effective tax rate of 37.9% for the full year 2012. In the 2012 first quarter, the effective tax rate was 37.4%, primarily due to higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and a lower blended state tax rate.

The difference between the actual effective tax rate and the forecasted rate resulted in a $0.02 per share benefit for the quarter. We are now expecting the full year 2012 effective tax rate to be in the range of 37.4% to 37.7%.

Lastly, let’s take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $106 million versus $118 million in 2011. The year-over-year reduction in cash flow was driven by lower trade accounts payable balances, due to the timing of inventory purchases, and a higher contribution to the company’s retirement plan tied to strong company performance and higher payroll expense in the prior year.

We used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business and return $109 million to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $41 million. We paid dividends of $47 million and bought back 291,000 shares of stock. As of quarter-end, the company has approximately 6.8 million shares remaining on its share repurchase authorization.

As reported in our 2012 first quarter earnings release, we raised and narrowed both sales and earnings guidance for the full year 2012. We now expect sales growth in the range of 12% to 14% and earnings per share in the range of $10.40 to $10.80. While our sales guidance is below our first quarter 2012 performance, we expect EPS to expand over the prior year at an increasing rate for the remainder of 2012.

Let’s look more closely at the underlying elements of our revised expectations. First, sales growth in the first quarter, particularly January and February, was stronger than we had forecasted.

Second, unlike the first quarter, we are forecasting operating margin expansion over prior-year in each remaining quarter of 2012. This expansion should come from a more even contribution from both gross margin expansion and better expense leverage.

Gross profit margins in the second quarter should be higher than the prior year but below the 2012 first quarter, which includes supplier support provided for the annual customer trade shows. Year-over-year, gross profit margins for the remaining quarters should exceed 2011 but will remain relatively consistent with the second quarter of 2012. Again, better expense and earnings leverage should come in the back half of the year as we lap our growth investments, such as new sales representatives and eCommerce.

Third, our international business have posted improved performance, which we expect to continue. We believe Fabory will continue to deliver $0.03 to $0.06 of earnings accretion in 2012, while our newly acquired business in Brazil should be $0.03 to $0.05 dilutive this year.

Finally, the lower tax rate of 37.4% to 37.7% forecasted for 2012 should contribute $0.04 to $0.09 per share for the full year. As noted earlier, the first quarter included about a $0.02 benefit from the lower tax rate versus our original forecast.

Please also reference our 2012 first quarter earnings release issued today, April 17, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this webcast.

These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.
Strong sales growth and consistent execution was the story for the quarter. This performance was largely driven by continued enhancements to the foundation of our business and aggressive investment in our growth programs. As a result of the strong start to 2012, we have increased and narrowed the ranges for our sales and EPS guidance as referenced in today’s earnings release. We now expect sales to grow 12% to 14% and are forecasting EPS of $10.40 to $10.80 for the full year 2012. At the end of this recording, we’ll talk more about our revised guidance and our assumptions.
We’ll start with total company results, and then take a closer look at our segments. Company sales increased 16% versus the 2011 first quarter. We had 64 selling days in both quarters. Operating earnings increased 16%, while net earnings increased 19%. As highlighted in our release, earnings per share of $2.57 for the quarter is an all-time company record and represents an 18% increase versus 2011.
In a few moments we’ll take a closer look at sales results for the quarter; let’s now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Gross profit margins increased 40 basis points to 44.4%, as we successfully expanded gross margins across the business. Due to our size and scale, we were able to increase prices with the market and ahead of product cost inflation. We’ll provide more detail when we review the business by segment.
It is important to note that our gross profit margin follows a fairly consistent annual pattern, with generally highest gross margins in the first quarter. This is primarily driven by supplier funding for our annual customer trade shows in the quarter.
Company operating margins were essentially flat with the prior year at 13.9%. This was a function of strong sales growth and gross margin expansion offset by higher operating expenses driven by Fabory’s incremental expenses, growth-related spending, and higher corporate expenses, including stock-based compensation and expenses related to M&A activity and other corporate support expenses.
Let’s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we’ll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of March; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we’ll wrap up with a discussion of our revised 2012 guidance.
As mentioned earlier, company sales increased 16% for the quarter. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 17% in January, 18% in February, and 15% in March. Of the 16% sales growth for the quarter, volume contributed 10 percentage points, acquisitions added 5 percentage points, and price added 3 percentage points. Foreign exchange and lower sales of seasonal products each represented a 1 percentage point drag on daily sales growth for the quarter.
Let’s move on to sales by segment. We report 2 segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations in Asia, Europe, and Latin America are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses.
Sales in the United States, which account for about 77% of total company revenue, increased 11% in the quarter, consisting of 9% volume growth and 3% from price, partially offset by a drag of 1 percentage point due to lower sales of seasonal products. By month, daily sales in the United States were up 11% in January, up 12% in February, and up 9% in March.
Now we’ll cover sales performance by customer end-market in the United States. We believe that increasing our product line, expanding customer sales coverage, and increasing our eCommerce capabilities is enabling the company to grow faster than the economy and gain additional market share.
As a result, sales to every customer end-market we serve in the United States, including Government, were positive in the quarter as follows. Natural Resources, formerly Agriculture and Mining, and Heavy Manufacturing were up in the mid-teens. Commercial, Retail, and Light Manufacturing were up in the low double-digits. Reseller was up in the high single-digits, and Government and Contractors were up in the mid-single-digits.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, we announced the possible divestiture of our Specialty Brands. Since that time, we have not received an acceptable offer. We plan to continue to operate the businesses and evaluate future options.
Now let’s turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represent about 12% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 13% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currency. On a daily basis in Canadian dollars, sales were up 19% in January, up 14% in February, and up 11% in March. The 14% local currency sales growth in the quarter consisted of 13% volume growth and 1 percentage point from price.
From a customer standpoint, sales growth in Canada was driven by strength in the Construction, Agriculture and Mining, Transportation, Retail/Wholesale, and Heavy Manufacturing customer end-markets.
Let’s conclude our review of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, and currently represents about 11% of total company sales.
Sales for this group increased 104%, the result of strong growth in Japan and Mexico, coupled with the incremental sales from Fabory, our business in Europe acquired in August of 2011. Excluding Fabory, sales for our Other Businesses increased 33%.
Beginning in the second quarter, our Other Businesses will include the results of our newly acquired business in Brazil. This business, formerly known as AnFreixo S.A., is a leading broad line distributor of maintenance, repair, and operating (MRO) supplies and had 2011 sales of approximately U.S.$37 million. The acquisition provides us with a solid entry point for physical operations in Brazil, the largest MRO market in Latin America.
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for January and February and shared some information regarding sales performance in the month. Let’s now take a closer look at March. There were 22 selling days in March of 2012, one less than 2011. Total company sales were up 15% on a daily basis in March of 2012 versus March of 2011. The 15% growth consisted of 8% volume growth, 3 percentage points from price inflation, and 5 percentage points from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1 percentage point drag from foreign exchange.
In the United States, March daily sales were up 9%. This growth consisted of 6 percentage points of volume and 3 percentage points from price. Sales trends in March are more representative of our expectation for revenue growth going forward.
Conversely, sales growth in January and February was unusually strong due to the following factors: number one, customer pre-buying in advance of our February price increase, particularly in our lighting product line; number two, a higher advertising spend; and number three, easier comparisons in January and February versus March.
Consistent with the quarter, we saw positive daily sales growth in March to each of our U.S. customer end-markets as follows: Natural Resources increased in the low 20s; Heavy Manufacturing and Commercial increased in the low double-digits; Light Manufacturing, Reseller, and Retail were up in the high single-digits; Government was up in the mid-single-digits; and Contractor was up in the low single-digits.
Daily sales in Canada for March increased 10% in U.S. dollars, up 11% in local currency. The 11% local currency daily sales growth consisted of 11% volume and 1 percentage point from price, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline attributable to lower sales of seasonal products.
Similar to the quarter, customers in the Construction, Agriculture and Mining, Transportation, Retail/Wholesale, and Heavy Manufacturing customer end-markets accounted for the largest increases in sales growth. The growth rate in March was influenced by difficult comparisons, particularly in the Government sector, where spending reached record levels in 2011.
Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 110% in March, the result of strong growth in Japan and Mexico along with sales for our business in Europe. Excluding Fabory, sales for the Other Businesses increased 38% in March.
Sales growth in the month of April started a bit slowly, primarily due to the religious holidays, but is expected to be roughly in line with the growth in March.
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

The difference between the actual effective tax rate and the forecasted rate resulted in a $0.02 per share benefit for the quarter. We are now expecting the full year 2012 effective tax rate to be in the range of 37.4% to 37.7%.
Lastly, let’s take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $106 million versus $118 million in 2011. The year-over-year reduction in cash flow was driven by lower trade accounts payable balances, due to the timing of inventory purchases, and a higher contribution to the company’s retirement plan tied to strong company performance and higher payroll expense in the prior year.
We used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business and return $109 million to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $41 million. We paid dividends of $47 million and bought back 291,000 shares of stock. As of quarter-end, the company has approximately 6.8 million shares remaining on its share repurchase authorization.
As reported in our 2012 first quarter earnings release, we raised and narrowed both sales and earnings guidance for the full year 2012. We now expect sales growth in the range of 12% to 14% and earnings per share in the range of $10.40 to $10.80. While our sales guidance is below our first quarter 2012 performance, we expect EPS to expand over the prior year at an increasing rate for the remainder of 2012.
Let’s look more closely at the underlying elements of our revised expectations. First, sales growth in the first quarter, particularly January and February, was stronger than we had forecasted.
Second, unlike the first quarter, we are forecasting operating margin expansion over prior-year in each remaining quarter of 2012. This expansion should come from a more even contribution from both gross margin expansion and better expense leverage.
Gross profit margins in the second quarter should be higher than the prior year but below the 2012 first quarter, which includes supplier support provided for the annual customer trade shows. Year-over-year, gross profit margins for the remaining quarters should exceed 2011 but will remain relatively consistent with the second quarter of 2012. Again, better expense and earnings leverage should come in the back half of the year as we lap our growth investments, such as new sales representatives and eCommerce.
Third, our international business have posted improved performance, which we expect to continue. We believe Fabory will continue to deliver $0.03 to $0.06 of earnings accretion in 2012, while our newly acquired business in Brazil should be $0.03 to $0.05 dilutive this year.
Finally, the lower tax rate of 37.4% to 37.7% forecasted for 2012 should contribute $0.04 to $0.09 per share for the full year. As noted earlier, the first quarter included about a $0.02 benefit from the lower tax rate versus our original forecast.

Please also reference our 2012 second quarter earnings release issued today, July 18th, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website, to supplement this web cast. 
Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute forward-looking information.  These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty.  Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. 
Healthy sales growth, consistent execution, and impressive margin expansion was the storyline for the quarter.  This performance was largely driven by continued enhancements to the foundation of our business and aggressive investment in our growth programs. </TAG>

As a result, we reiterated our 2012 sales growth guidance of 12 to 14% and raised the bottom end of our earnings per-share guidance as referenced in today’s earnings release. We will now expect EPS of $10.50 to $10.80 for the full year 2012.  At the end of this recording we’ll talk more about our guidance and related assumptions.
We’ll start with total company results, and then take a closer look at our segments. 
Company sales increased 12% versus the 2011 second quarter. We had 64 selling days in both quarters.   Operating earnings increased 18 %, while net earnings increased 12 %. 
As highlighted in the earnings release, earnings per share of $2.63 for the quarter represents an all-time company record and represents a 12% increase versus 2011.  The 2011 quarter included a $0.12 per-share benefit from the settlement of tax examinations; excluding this benefit, the earnings per share increased 18 % versus 2011. 
In a few moments we’ll analyze our sales results for the quarter.  Let’s now walk down the operating section of the income statement. 
Gross profit margins increased 40 basis points to 43.5 %.  Our purchasing scale enables us to manage price changes in line with the market and ahead of product cost inflation.  We’ll provide more detail when we review the business by segment. 
It is important to note that our gross profit margin follows a fairly consistent annual pattern with generally the highest gross margins in the first quarter of each year.  This is primarily driven by supplier funding for our annual customer trade shows early in the year, which is accounted for as a credit to cost of goods sold.  
So the sequential decline in our gross profit margin from 44.4% in the 2012 first quarter to 43.5% in the 2012 second quarter is normal and expected. 
Our company operating margin increased 80 basis points to 14%.  This improvement was driven by solid sales growth, gross margin expansion and positive expense leverage.  Operating expenses grew 11%, including $24 million in incremental growth-related spending in the quarter, and the operating expenses from the businesses in Europe and Brazil, which we acquired during the last 12 months.
Let’s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter.  In doing so, we’ll cover the following topics:  First, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of June.  Second, operating performance by segment.  Third, cash generation and capital deployment.  And finally, we’ll wrap up with a discussion of our 2012 guidance.  
As mentioned earlier, company sales increased 12% for the quarter.  Daily sales growth by month was as follows; 12% in April, 13% in May, and 12% in June.  The 12% sales growth for the quarter included 5 percentage points from acquisitions and a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. 
As a point of reference, foreign exchange represented a 1 percentage point headwind in the 2012 first quarter.  
On an organic basis, sales for the quarter increased 9% including 6 percentage points from volume and 3 percentage points from price. 
Let’s move on to sales by segment.  We report two segments; the United States and Canada.  Our remaining operations in Asia, Europe, and Latin America are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. 
Sales in the United States, which accounts for 77% of total company revenue, increased 7% in the quarter, consisting of 4% volume growth and 3% from price.  Despite the hot weather in late June, sales of seasonal products were not a factor in the quarter or the month of June.  Daily sales in the United States increased 7% in April, 8% in May and 7% in June.
Let’s review sales performance by customer and market in the United States.  Our growth drivers, which include increasing our product line, expanding customer sales coverage, enhancing our eCommerce capabilities, and increasing our inventory management solutions are enabling Grainger to grow faster than the economy and gain additional market share.  This is evident when you look at the variety of customer end markets we serve in the United States and performance for each.  Heavy Manufacturing was up in the high-single digits;  Light Manufacturing, Commercial, Retail, Reseller and Natural Resources were up in the mid-single digits;  Government was up in the low-single digits; and Contractors declined in the low-single digits. 
Now let’s turn our attention to the Canadian business.  Sales in Canada represent 12% of total company revenues.  For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 9% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currency.  The 14% local currency sales growth in the quarter consisted of 12% volume growth and 2 percentage points from price. 
From a customer standpoint, sales performance in Canada was driven by strong growth in the Commercial, Oil & Gas, Utilities and Contractor end markets.  On a daily basis in Canadian dollars, sales increased 13% in April, 14% in May and 14% in June.
Let’s conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses.  Again, this group includes our operations in Asia, Europe and Latin America and currently represents about 11% of total company sales. 
Sales for this group increased 84%, which consisted of a 75-percentage-point contribution from the acquired businesses in Europe and Brazil, 21 percentage points from volume, led by strong growth in Japan, partially offset by a 12-percentage-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. 
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for April and May and shared some information regarding performance in those months.  Let’s now take a look at June. 
There were 21 selling days in June of 2012, one less than in 2011.  Total company sales were up 12% on a daily basis in June of 2012 versus June of 2011.  The daily sales growth in June included 5 precentage points from acquisitions and a 2 percentage-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange.  Organic sales increased 9% on a daily basis, consisting of 6% volume growth and 3 percentage points from price inflation. 
In the United States, June daily sales were up 7%.  This growth consisted of 4 percentage points of volume and 3 percentage points from price.  We saw positive daily sales growth in all but one of our U.S. customer end markets as follows:  Heavy and Light Manufacturing increased in the low-double digits; Government, Commercial, Reseller, Retail and Natural Resources increased in the mid-single digits; and Contractor was essentially flat.
The mid-single digit sales growth to our Government customers is worth noting.  As we shared with our May sales release, the fiscal year end for many state and local governments end in June.  Thanks to our strong relationships with these government agencies, coupled with the value of the service we provide, we enjoyed a strong finish to the month. 
This level of growth to the Government was achieved despite a 2% decline in sales to the U.S. Postal Service, related to their aggressive restructuring program. 
Daily sales in Canada for June increased 8 % in U.S. dollars, up 14% in local currency.  The 14% local currency daily sales growth consisted of 12 percentage points from volume and 2 percentage points from price. 
Similar to the quarter, sales growth in Canada was driven by strong performance in the Commercial, Oil & Gas, Utilities, and Contractor end markets. 
Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 86% in June, consisting of 75 percentage points from acquisitions, 25 percentage points from volume, partially offset by a negative 14 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange. 

Sales in the month of July are off to a good start.  Despite the challenges of having the Fourth of July on a Wednesday, daily sales growth to date is trending in line with the 12% growth in June. 
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.

Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, let’s jump right into performance by reporting segment. 
Operating earnings in the United States increased 15% versus the 2011 second quarter.  And the U.S. operating margin increased 120 basis points to 17.8%.  This impressive performance was driven by 7% sales growth, higher gross margins and positive expense leverage.  
Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 20 basis points driven by price increases exceeding cost inflation, partially offset by unfavorable customer and product mix. 
Expense leverage in the United States was positive despite $24 million in incremental growth-related spending on areas such as new sales representatives, eCommerce and advertising. 
Let’s move on to our business in Canada.  Operating earnings increased 15% versus the prior year, up 20% in local currency.  Strong sales growth, coupled with higher gross profit margins and positive expense leverage contributed to operating margins increasing 60 basis points to 12%. 
Gross margins increased 10 basis points, primarily driven by improved customer mix. 
Operating performance for our Other Businesses improved versus a year ago, the result of our focus on enhancing growth and operating performance.  This group posted operating earnings of $11 million for the quarter versus $9 million a year ago.  Strong operating performance in Japan and Mexico was responsible for this improvement. 
In addition, approximately $1 million in operating earnings from Fabory in the quarter were offset by losses from the acquired business in Brazil.  Consistent with our expectations, investments in expanding the sales force and product offering are creating some near-term headwinds for our business in Brazil. 
Below the operating line, interest expense, net of interest income, was $2.3 million in the 2012 second quarter versus $1.5 million in the 2011 second quarter.  This increase was primarily attributable to interest on the debt of €120 million incurred in 2011 to finance a portion of the Fabory acquisition. 
The effective tax rate for the 2012 second quarter was 37.9% versus 38.3% in 2011, adjusted for the $0.12 per-share benefit noted earlier.  The lower rate was primarily due to higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and a lower blended state tax rate.

Lastly, let’s take a look at cash flow for the quarter.  Operating cash flow was $132 million versus $191 million in 2011.  The year-over-year reduction in cash flow was driven by higher investments in receivables and inventory tied to sales growth along with a reduction in current liabilities tied to higher payments for income taxes. 
We used the cash generated during the quarter, along with cash on hand, to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $56 million versus $52 million in 2011. We paid dividends of $58 million in the quarter, reflecting the 21% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of this year.  In addition, we bought back 760,000 shares of stock and ended the quarter with about 6 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization.  In total, we returned $207 million to shareholders in the quarter.
As reported in our 2012 second quarter earnings release, we reiterated our 2012 sales guidance of 12 to 14% and raised the low end of our 2012 earnings per-share guidance by $0.10.  We now expect earnings per share of $10.50 to $10.80.  Keep in mind, if economic growth slows and the dollar continues to strengthen, the lower end of our sales range is more probable than the higher end.  If that happens, we plan to reassess and adjust spending levels. 
Let’s look more closely at the underlying elements of our current expectations.   First, sales in the back half of the year are expected to grow in the 10 to 13% range. 
As a reminder, we reach the anniversary of the Fabory acquisition at the end of August.  In addition, we will lose a selling day in the 2012 third quarter and gain it back in the fourth quarter versus 2011. 
Second, we continue to forecast operating margin expansion, over prior year, in the remaining quarters of 2012.  Gross profit margins for the remaining quarters should remain relatively consistent with the 43.5% reported for the 2012 second quarter. 
Incremental growth related spending in the 2012 third quarter should be in line with the $24 million incremental spend in the 2012 second quarter.  Better expense and earnings leverage should come in the 2012 fourth quarter as we lap some of the aggressive growth investments in 2011, such as new sales representatives and eCommerce, and benefit from having a full quarter of Fabory in the base.  
Although comparisons will be easier in the 2012 fourth quarter, we plan to continue to invest in our growth drivers given the opportunity to gain share in this large, fragmented market.
Third, our Other Businesses have posted improved performance, which should continue to be driven by our business in Japan.  As for our newest businesses, we continue to expect AnFreixo to be slightly dilutive in 2012, while Fabory may post a small loss if the economy and currency in Europe weaken further. 
Fourth, we now expect foreign exchange to be a headwind on both the top and bottom lines for the full year.  Given the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, foreign exchange could represent as much as a 1 percentage point drag on sales and $0.04 to $0.06 per share in earnings dilution for the year. 
Finally, our 2012 guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 37.4 to 37.7%. 
Thank you for your interest in Grainger.  Please mark your calendar for the release of July sales on Friday, August 10th.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Laura Brown at 847-535-0409 or me at 847-535-0881.

Second, we continue to forecast operating margin expansion, over prior year, in the remaining quarters of 2012.  Gross profit margins for the remaining quarters should remain relatively consistent with the 43.5% reported for the 2012 second quarter.
Incremental growth related spending in the 2012 third quarter should be in line with the $24 million incremental spend in the 2012 second quarter.  Better expense and earnings leverage should come in the 2012 fourth quarter as we lap some of the aggressive growth investments in 2011, such as new sales representatives and eCommerce, and benefit from having a full quarter of Fabory in the base.
Although comparisons will be easier in the 2012 fourth quarter, we plan to continue to invest in our growth drivers given the opportunity to gain share in this large, fragmented market.
Third, our Other Businesses have posted improved performance, which should continue to be driven by our business in Japan.  As for our newest businesses, we continue to expect AnFreixo to be slightly dilutive in 2012, while Fabory may post a small loss if the economy and currency in Europe weaken further.
Fourth, we now expect foreign exchange to be a headwind on both the top and bottom lines for the full year.  Given the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, foreign exchange could represent as much as a 1 percentage point drag on sales and $0.04 to $0.06 per share in earnings dilution for the year.
Finally, our 2012 guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 37.4% to 37.7%.
Thank you for your interest in Grainger.  Please mark your calendar for the release of July sales on Friday, August 10th.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Laura Brown at 847-535-0409 or me at 847-535-0881.

With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. We will share with you some information regarding Grainger's Third Quarter 2012 Results via this audio webcast. Please also reference our 2012 third quarter earnings release issued today, October 16, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this webcast.
Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of  future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute  forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market  conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and  uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to  forward-looking statements.
Before I discuss the quarter, I'd like to first highlight the $0.66 per share reserve for the expected settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, which includes the following 2 parts: Number one, a $70 million pretax charge for the proposed settlement in principle with the DOJ over the interpretation of contract language signed more than 10 years ago with the General services administration and the U.S. Postal Service.; and second, a $6 million pretax reserve related to tax freight and miscellaneous billings for these customers.
We are close to having this long-standing dispute behind us. It is to note that does not contain any admission of any wrongdoing by the company and avoids costly and lengthy litigation. The GSA contract rates back to 1999 and the government remains one of our larger customer end markets. As a case in point, throughout the multi-year audit, the government continue to buy from Grainger, and in fact, increased its purchasing during that time. In 2011 alone, our sales to the GSA and the U.S. Postal Service totaled approximately $200 million. Additional information regarding this case can be found in the earnings release issued on October 16 along with previously filed 10-Qs and 10-Ks.
Please note that the following analysis and commentary for the remainder of this podcast excludes the effect of the $0.66 charge. From a segment presentation standpoint, the entire charge is recorded in the United States segment.
We'll start with total company results and then take a closer look at our segments. Performance for the quarter was driven by sales growth and market share gains, coupled with strong gross margin expansion. Company sales increased 8% versus the 2011 third quarter. We had 63 selling days in the quarter, 1 less than the previous year, which cost us approximately $33 million to $38 million of revenue growth. Sales growth on a daily basis increased 10%. Operating earnings increased 9%, while net earnings increased 11%. Earnings per share, excluding the $0.66 charge were $2.81 for the quarter, representing an increase of 12% versus the 2011 third quarter.
It is important to note that one less selling day represented approximately $0.05 to $0.10 per share in lower earnings on an incremental basis. With fewer selling days, only expenses that actually variable are avoided, while fixed and semi-variable cost must be absorbed by a lower sales base.
In a few moments, we'll analyze our sales results for the quarter. Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Gross profit margins increased 40 basis points to 43.6% versus 43.2% in 2011. Our purchasing scale enables us to manage price changes in line with the market and ahead of product cost inflation. We'll provide more detail when we review the business by segment.
Company operating margin increased 20 basis points to 14.5% versus 14.3% a year ago. This improvement was driven by solid sales growth and gross margin expansion. Operating expenses grew 9%, including $19 million in incremental growth-related spending in the quarter and inclusion of operating expenses in the Europe and Brazil, which we acquired since the start of 2011 third quarter.
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter in the month of September; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with the discussion of our revised 2012 guidance.
As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 8% on a reported basis and 10% on a daily basis. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 11% in July, 10% in August and 9% in September. The 10% daily sales growth for the quarter included 3 percentage points from acquisitions and a 1 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. We reached the anniversary of the acquisition of the business in Europe on August 31. Accordingly, the quarter includes 2 months of incremental sales and operating results. On an organic basis, which excludes acquisitions and foreign exchange, daily sales for the quarter increased 8% with 4 percentage points from volume and 4 percentage points from price. Daily organic sales growth by month was as follows: 8% in July, 7% in August and 8% in September.
Let's move on the sales by segment. We report 2 segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations in Asia, Europe and Latin America are reported under our group entitled Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounts for 77% of total company revenue increased 4% in the quarter, 5% on a daily basis. The 5% sales growth consisted of 4% from price and 1% from volume. Daily sales in the United States increased 6% in July, 4% in August and 6% in September.
Let's review sales performance by customer and market in the United States. Our growth drivers, which include increasing our product line, expanding customer sales coverage, enhancing our e-commerce capabilities and increasing our inventory management solutions are enabling Grainger to serve customers more effectively in the following end markets in the United States. Here is the sales performance for each respective customer and market for the quarter: light and heavy manufacturing were up in the high-single digits; commercial and government were up in the mid-single digits; retail was in the mid-single digits; and naturals resources, reseller and contractors were down in the low-single digits.
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represent 12% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 10% in US dollars and 11% in local currency. On a daily basis, sales in local currency increased 13% consisting of 11% volume growth and 2 percentage points from price. By month, daily sales in Canadian dollars increased 16% in July, 13% in August and 11% in September.
From a customer standpoint, sales performance in Canada was driven by strong growth in the Western provinces led by the commercial, oil and gas, forestry, contractor and utilities end markets. 
Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations in Asia, Europe and Latin America and currently represents about 11% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 54%, which consisted of a 39 percentage point contribution from the acquired businesses in Europe and Brazil, 24 percentage points from volume led by strong growth in Japan and Mexico, partially offset by 9 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange.
Early in the quarter, we reported sales results for July and August and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at September. There were 19 selling days in September of 2012 versus 21 days in the same month of 2011. Total company sales increased 9% on a daily basis in September of 2012 or since September of 2011. The daily sales growth in September included 1 percentage point from the business acquired in Brazil. Organic sales increased 8% on a daily basis consisting of 4% volume growth and 4 percentage points from price inflation.
In the United States, September daily sales increased 6%. This growth consisted of 4 percentage points from price and 2 percentage points from volume. September customer and market performance in the United States was as follows: government, heavy and light manufacturing were up in the high single digits; commercial was up in the mid-single digits; retail was up in the low-single digits; and natural resources, reseller and contractor where they'll in the low-single digits. As we shared in the August sales release, the fiscal year end for the federal government ended in September. Thanks to our strong relationships with many of these government agencies, coupled with the value of the service we provide, we enjoyed a strong finish to the month of September. This level of growth to the government was achieved despite a decline in sales to the U.S. Postal Service related to its aggressive restructuring program. And as noted above, despite the lengthy government audit, we have continued to grow our business relationship with the government.
Daily sales in Canada for September increased 14% in U.S. dollars, up 11% in local currency. The 11% local currency daily sales growth consisted of 10 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point for price. Similar to the quarter, sales growth in Canada was driven by strong performance in the commercial, oil and gas, contractor and utilities end markets. Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 25% in September, consisting of 6 percentage points from acquisitions, 24 percentage points from volume, partially offset by a negative 5 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange.
Daily sales growth to date in October is currently trending slightly below the 8% organic daily growth posted in the third quarter. Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

Since we've already analyzed company operating performance, let's jump right into performance by reporting segment. Again, we have excluded the $0.66 per share charge described in the beginning of this podcast. Operating earnings in the United States increased 7% versus the 2011 third quarter and the U.S. operation increased 50 basis points to 18.2%. This performance was driven by 4% sales growth and higher gross margins.
Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 50 basis points, driven by price increases exceeding cost inflation, partially offset by unfavorable customer mix. Operating expenses increased in line with the sales increase and were primarily driven by $19 million in incremental growth-related spending on areas such as new sales representatives, e-commerce and advertising.
Let's move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings increased 37% versus prior year, up 38% in local currency. Strong sales growth, coupled with higher gross profit margins and positive expense leverage contributed to operating margins increasing 240 basis points to 12.5%.
Gross margins increased 140 basis points, with roughly 2/3 of the expansion coming from the timing of supplier rebates and advertising credits. Operating performance for our Other Businesses declined versus a year ago posting operating earnings of $9 million for the quarter versus $11 million in 2011.
Strong performance improvement in Japan and Mexico was partially offset by losses from the acquired businesses in Europe and Brazil along with losses at some of our start businesses in developing markets. The operating loss in Europe was primarily driven by lower sales tied to the economy and lower gross margins related to unfavorable customer mix.
Contributing to the loss in Europe were adjustments tied to the completion of the purchase price allocation. In Brazil, continued investments in expanding the sales force and product offering contributed to a small operating loss from this newly acquired business.
Below the operating line, interest expense net of interest income was $4 million in the 2012 third quarter versus $2 million in the 2011 third quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher average debt outstanding and higher average interest rates in 2012 versus 2011. In addition, interest expense adjustments related to capital leases for the acquired business in Europe also contributed to the increase in 2012.
The effective tax rate for the 2012 third quarter was 37.1% versus 38.7% in 2011. The lower rate was primarily due to higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and a lower blended state tax rate. As a reminder, we continue to expect the effective tax rate for the full year 2012 to be in the range of 37.4% to 37.7%.
Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $338 million versus $251 million in 2011. We used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $59 million versus $47 million in 2011. We paid dividends of $57 million in the quarter, reflecting the 21% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of this year. In addition, we bought back 421,000 shares of stock for $85 million and ended the quarter with 5.6 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $142 million to shareholders in the quarter.
On July 18, 2012, in our second quarter earnings podcast, we indicated that if economic growth slows and/or the dollar continues to strengthen, the lower end of our sales range is more probable than the higher end. As reported in our 2012 third quarter earnings release, we slightly lowered and narrowed our 2012 sales guidance to a new range of 11% to 12% growth. At the same time, we reiterated our 2012 earnings per share guidance of $10.50 to $10.80.
Let's look more closely at the underlying elements of our current expectations. First, we are forecasting daily sales growth of 6% to 9% in the fourth quarter. While we gained an extra selling day in the 2012 fourth quarter versus the 2011 quarter, the holiday calendar will be working against us in December. Both Christmas and New Year's Day fall on Tuesdays, so we will be open for business on Monday, December 24 and Monday, December 31 but are forecasting a minimal sales contribution on either day.
Second, our gross profit margin for the fourth quarter should approximate the 43.6% reported for the 2012 third quarter. Third, we are forecasting strong operating margin expansion in the 2012 fourth quarter, as we lap heavy investment spending in the prior year quarter. The absolute level of spending should be on par with growth spending in the 2012 third quarter and relatively small on an incremental basis versus the fourth quarter of 2011.
Fourth, while our business in Canada posted strong performance in the 2012 third quarter, we are forecasting more moderate sales growth and margin expansion into 2012 fourth quarter. Going forward, we will be investing in the foundational elements of the business namely, supply chain and information technology to support the impressive growth of this $1 billion business.
In addition, we'll also begin to invest in growth drivers to accelerate market share gains, primarily in Eastern Canada, which represents nearly 70% of the country's market opportunity.
Fifth, the performance of our Other Businesses should continue to be driven primarily by Japan and Mexico. Conversely, we expect both Europe and Brazil to be slightly dilutive in the 2012 fourth quarter.
Sixth, we expect foreign exchange to be a slight headwind on both the top and bottom lines in the fourth quarter.
Finally, our 2012 guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 37.4% to 37.7% for the full year.
In conclusion, we remain confident in our strategy to gain share and extend our leadership position in the large and fragmented MRO market. We will continue to invest in what matters to our customers, more products and services, more sales coverage and enhanced e-commerce capabilities to provide outstanding customer service.
At the same time, we will continue to drive margin expansion by growing our private label program and harvesting productivity through our continuous improvement programs, all with the objective of delivering solid returns to shareholders.

At the same time, we reiterated our 2012 earnings per share guidance of $10.50 to $10.80. Let's look more closely at the underlying elements of our current expectations.
First, we are forecasting daily sales growth of 6% to 9% in the fourth quarter. While we gain an extra selling day in the 2012 fourth quarter versus the 2011 quarter, the holiday calendar will be working against us in December. Both Christmas and New Year's Day fall on Tuesdays. So we will be open for business on Monday, December 24, and Monday, December 31, but are forecasting a minimal sales contribution on either day.
Second, our gross profit margin for the fourth quarter should approximate the 43.6% reported for the 2012 third quarter.
Third, we are forecasting strong operating margin expansion in the 2012 fourth quarter as we lap heavy investment spending in the prior year quarter. The absolute level of spending should be on par with growth spending in the 2012 third quarter and relatively small on an incremental basis versus the fourth quarter of 2011.
Fourth, while our business in Canada posted strong performance in the 2012 third quarter, we are forecasting more moderate sales growth and margin expansion in the 2012 fourth quarter. Going forward, we will be investing in the foundational elements of the business, namely supply chain and information technology to support the impressive growth of this $1 billion business. In addition, we'll also begin to invest in growth drivers to accelerate market share gains primarily in Eastern Canada, which represents nearly 70% of the country's market opportunity.
Fifth, the performance of our Other Businesses should continue to be driven primarily by Japan and Mexico. Conversely, we expect both Europe and Brazil to be slightly dilutive in the 2012 fourth quarter.
Sixth, we expect foreign exchange to be a slight headwind on both the top and bottom lines in the fourth quarter.
Finally, our 2012 guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 37.4% to 37.7% for the full year.
In conclusion, we remain confident in our strategy to gain share and extend our leadership position in the large and fragmented MRO market. We will continue to invest in what matters to our customers, more products and services, more sales coverage and enhanced e-commerce capabilities, to provide outstanding customer service. At the same time, we will continue to drive margin expansion by growing our private label program and harvesting productivity through our continuous improvement programs, all with the objective of delivering solid returns to shareholders.

With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. We will share with you some information regarding Grainger's Third Quarter 2012 Results via this audio webcast. Please also reference our 2012 third quarter earnings release issued today, October 16, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this webcast.
Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.
Before I discuss the quarter, I'd like to first highlight the $0.66 per share reserve for the expected settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, which includes the following 2 parts: number one, a $70 million pretax charge for the proposed settlement in principle with the DOJ over the interpretation of contract language signed more than 10 years ago with the General Services Administration and the U.S. Postal Service; and second, a $6 million pretax reserve related to tax, freight and miscellaneous billings for these customers.
We are close to having this longstanding dispute behind us. It is important to note that the proposed settlement does not any admission of wrongdoing by the company and avoids costly and lengthy litigation. The GSA contract dates back to 1999 and the government remains one of our larger customer end markets. As a case in point, throughout the multi-year audit, the government continued to buy from Grainger and in fact, increased its purchasing during that time. In 2011 alone, our sales to the GSA and the U.S. Postal Service totaled approximately $200 million. Additional information regarding this case can be found in the earnings release issued on October 16, along with previously filed 10-Qs and 10-Ks.
Please note that the following analysis and commentary for the remainder of this podcast excludes the effect of the $0.66 charge. From a segment presentation standpoint, the entire charge is recorded in the United States segment.
We'll start with total company results and then take a closer look at our segments. Performance for the quarter was driven by sales growth and market share gains, coupled with strong gross margin expansion. Company sales increased 8% versus the 2011 third quarter. We had 63 selling days in the quarter, 1 less than the previous year, which cost us approximately $33 million to $38 million.  Sales growth on a daily basis increased 10%. Operating earnings increased 9%, while net earnings increased 11%. Earnings per share, excluding the $0.66 charge, were $2.81 for the quarter, representing an increase of 12% versus the 2011 third quarter. It is important to note that one less selling day represented approximately $0.05 to $0.10 per share in lower earnings on an incremental basis. With fewer selling days, only expenses that are truly variable are avoided, while fixed and semi-variable costs must be absorbed by a lower sales base.
In a few moments, we'll analyze our sales results for the quarter. Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Gross profit margins increased 40 basis points to 43.6% versus 43.2% in 2011. Our purchasing scale enables us to manage price changes in line with the market and ahead of product cost inflation. We'll provide more detail when we review the business by segment.
Company operating margin increased 20 basis points to 14.5% versus 14.3% a year ago. This improvement was driven by solid sales growth and gross margin expansion. Operating expenses grew 9%, including $19 million in incremental growth-related spending in the quarter and inclusion of operating expenses in Europe and Brazil, which we acquired since the start of the 2011 third quarter.
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter in the month of September; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with the discussion of our revised 2012 guidance.
As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 8% on a reported basis and 10% on a daily basis. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 11% in July, 10% in August and 9% in September. The 10% daily sales growth for the quarter included 3 percentage points from acquisitions and a 1 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. We reached the anniversary of the acquisition of the business in Europe on August 31. Accordingly, the quarter includes 2 months of incremental sales and operating results. On an organic basis, which excludes acquisitions and foreign exchange, daily sales for the quarter increased 8%, with 4 percentage points from volume and 4 percentage points from price. Daily organic sales growth by month was as follows: 8% in July, 7% in August and 8% in September.
Let's move onto sales by segment. We report 2 segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations in Asia, Europe and Latin America are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses.
Sales in the United States, which account for 77% of total company revenue, increased 4% in the quarter, 5% on a daily basis. The 5% sales growth consisted of 4% from price and 1% from volume. Daily sales in the United States increased 6% in July, 4% in August and 6% in September.
Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Our growth drivers, which include increasing our product line, expanding customer sales coverage, enhancing our e-commerce capabilities and increasing our inventory management solutions are enabling Grainger to serve customers more effectively in the following end markets in the United States. Here is the sales performance for each respective customer end market in the quarter: Light and heavy manufacturing were up in the high single digits. Commercial and government were up in the mid-single digits. Retail was up in the low single digits. And Naturals Resources, reseller and contractors were down in the low single digits.
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represent 12% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 10% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency. On a daily basis, sales in local currency increased 13%, consisting of 11% volume growth and 2 percentage points from price. By month, daily sales in Canadian dollars increased 16% in July, 13% in August and 11% in September. From a customer standpoint, sales performance in Canada was driven by strong growth in the Western provinces led by the commercial, oil and gas, forestry, contractor and utilities end markets. 
Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations in Asia, Europe and Latin America and currently represents about 11% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 54%, which consisted of a 39-percentage-point contribution from the acquired businesses in Europe and Brazil, 24 percentage points from volume led by strong growth in Japan and Mexico, partially offset by a 9-percentage-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange.
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for July and August and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at September. There were 19 selling days in September of 2012 versus 21 days in the same month of 2011. Total company sales increased 9% on a daily basis in September of 2012 versus September of 2011. The daily sales growth in September included 1 percentage point from the business acquired in Brazil. Organic sales increased 8% on a daily basis, consisting of 4% volume growth and 4 percentage points from price inflation.
In the United States, September daily sales increased 6%. This growth consisted of 4 percentage points from price and 2 percentage points from volume. September customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Government, heavy and light manufacturing were up in the high single digits. Commercial was up in the mid-single digits. Retail was up in the low single digits. And natural resources, reseller and contractor where down in the low single digits.
As we shared with our August sales release, the fiscal year end for the federal government ended in September. Thanks to our strong relationships with many of these government agencies, coupled with the value of the service we provide, we enjoyed a strong finish to the month of September. This level of growth to the government was achieved despite a decline in sales to the U.S. Postal Service related to its aggressive restructuring program. And as noted above, despite the lengthy government audit, we have continued to grow our business relationship with the government.
Daily sales in Canada for September increased 14% in U.S. dollars, up 11% in local currency. The 11% local currency daily sales growth consisted of 10 percentage points for volume and 1 percentage point for price. Similar to the quarter, sales growth in Canada was driven by strong performance in the commercial, oil and gas, contractor and utilities end markets.
Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 25% in September, consisting of 6 percentage points from acquisitions, 24 percentage points from volume, partially offset by a negative 5 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange.
Daily sales growth to date in October is currently trending slightly below the 8% organic daily growth posted in the third quarter.
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

Since we've already analyzed company operating performance, let's jump right into performance by reporting segment. Again, we have excluded the $0.66 per share charge described at the beginning of this podcast. Operating earnings in the United States increased 7% versus the 2011 third quarter, and the U.S. operating increased 50 basis points to 18.2%. This performance was driven by 4% sales growth and higher gross margins. Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 50 basis points, driven by price increases exceeding cost inflation, partially offset by unfavorable customer mix. Operating expenses increased in line with the sales increase and were primarily driven by $19 million in incremental growth-related spending on areas such as new sales representatives, e-commerce and advertising.
Let's move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings increased 37% versus the prior year, up 38% in local currency. Strong sales growth, coupled with higher gross profit margins, and positive expense leverage, contributed to operating margins increasing 240 basis points to 12.5%. Gross margins increased 140 basis points, with roughly 2/3 of the expansion coming from the timing of supplier rebates and advertising credits.
Operating performance for our Other Businesses declined versus a year ago, posting operating earnings of $9 million for the quarter versus $11 million in 2011. Strong performance improvement in Japan and Mexico was partially offset by losses from the acquired businesses in Europe and Brazil, along with losses at some of our startup businesses in developing markets. The operating loss in Europe was primarily driven by lower sales tied to the economy and lower gross margins related to unfavorable customer mix. Contributing to the loss in Europe were adjustments tied to the completion of the purchase price allocation. In Brazil, continued investments in expanding the sales force and product offering contributed to a small operating loss from this newly acquired business.
Below the operating line, interest expense, net of interest income, was $4 million in the 2012 third quarter versus $2 million in the 2011 third quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher average debt outstanding and higher average interest rates in 2012 versus 2011. In addition, interest expense adjustments related to capital leases for the acquired business in Europe also contributed to the increase in 2012.
The effective tax rate for the 2012 third quarter was 37.1% versus 38.7% in 2011. The lower rate was primarily due to higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and a lower blended state tax rate. As a reminder, we continue to expect the effective tax rate for the full year 2012 to be in the range of 37.4% to 37.7%.
Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $338 million versus $251 million in 2011. We used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $59 million versus $47 million in 2011. We paid dividends of $57 million in the quarter, reflecting the 21% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of this year. In addition, we bought back 421,000 shares of stock for $85 million and ended the quarter with 5.6 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $142 million to shareholders in the quarter.
On July 18, 2012, in our second quarter earnings podcast, we indicated that if economic growth slows and/or the dollar continues to strengthen, the lower end of our sales range is more probable than the higher end.

Capital expenditures for the quarter were $59 million versus $47 million in 2011. We paid dividends of $57 million in the quarter, reflecting the 21% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of this year. In addition, we bought back 421,000 shares of stock for $85 million and ended the quarter with 5.6 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $142 million to shareholders in the quarter.
On July 18, 2012, in our second quarter earnings podcast, we indicated that if economic growth slows and/or the dollar continues to strengthen, the lower end of our sales range is more probable than the higher end. As reported in our 2012 third quarter earnings release, we slightly lowered and narrowed our 2012 sales guidance to a new range of 11% to 12% growth. At the same time, we reiterated our 2012 earnings per share guidance of $10.50 to $10.80. Let's look more closely at the underlying elements of our current expectations.
First, we are forecasting daily sales growth of 6% to 9% in the fourth quarter. While we gain an extra selling day in the 2012 fourth quarter versus the 2011 quarter, the holiday calendar will be working against us in December. Both Christmas and New Year's Day fall on Tuesdays. So we will be open for business on Monday, December 24, and Monday, December 31, but are forecasting a minimal sales contribution on either day.
Second, our gross profit margin for the fourth quarter should approximate the 43.6% reported for the 2012 third quarter.
Third, we are forecasting strong operating margin expansion in the 2012 fourth quarter as we lap heavy investment spending in the prior year quarter. The absolute level of spending should be on par with growth spending in the 2012 third quarter and relatively small on an incremental basis versus the fourth quarter of 2011.
Fourth, while our business in Canada posted strong performance in the 2012 third quarter, we are forecasting more moderate sales growth and margin expansion in the 2012 fourth quarter. Going forward, we will be investing in the foundational elements of the business, namely supply chain and information technology to support the impressive growth of this $1 billion business. In addition, we'll also begin to invest in growth drivers to accelerate market share gains primarily in Eastern Canada, which represents nearly 70% of the country's market opportunity.
Fifth, the performance of our Other Businesses should continue to be driven primarily by Japan and Mexico. Conversely, we expect both Europe and Brazil to be slightly dilutive in the 2012 fourth quarter.
Sixth, we expect foreign exchange to be a slight headwind on both the top and bottom lines in the fourth quarter.
Finally, our 2012 guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 37.4% to 37.7% for the full year.
In conclusion, we remain confident in our strategy to gain share and extend our leadership position in the large and fragmented MRO market. We will continue to invest in what matters to our customers, more products and services, more sales coverage and enhanced e-commerce capabilities, to provide outstanding customer service. At the same time, we will continue to drive margin expansion by growing our private label program and harvesting productivity through our continuous improvement programs, all with the objective of delivering solid returns to shareholders.
