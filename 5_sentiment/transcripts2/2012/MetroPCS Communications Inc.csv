As we begin 2012, I'd like to address upfront the key issues that are likely in most investors' mind: competition, margins, CapEx and spectrum. 
As the competition, nearly 3 years ago, we began a major effort to plan, design and select vendors for our next-generation data centric network, 4G LTE Broadband. The spectrum efficiency potential for advanced broadband services provided that very low latency levels for exceptional customer experience and the promise of an order of magnitude reduction in investment were tremendously attractive. However, the challenge was to stimulate and shape the 4G LTE smartphone ecosystem so that affordable handsets could be available as soon as possible, fuel the growth of the No-Contract segment, without significant handset subsidies I may add. We believe this objective will be achieved during the second half of 2012, when 4G LTE service for all will be initiated and provide competitive advantage, we seek to accomplish.
As to margins, the move to broadband data-centric service puts pressure on operating margins during the transition period from CDMA to LTE data. Incentive voice service, a.k.a VoLTE. However, the competition of world production focusing on 4G LTE and large worldwide shipments and handsets, combined with our cost efficient LTE network and our initiative to reduce backhaul cost with investments in microwave backhaul networks, both CPGA and CPU will be further reduced. 
As to CapEx, we expect to reduce the investment in infrastructure by approximately 10x on our 5x5 megahertz-band relative to our past procurement experience with CDMA equipment. Clearly, data usage has increased also and data transmission speeds have also increased as improvements in spectrum efficiency, measured on a bits per hertz basis has more than kept pace.  Overall, we expect CapEx investment to moderate as our subscriber base makes the transition of CDMA to 4G LTE. 
As to spectrum, we continue to pursue all options available while we identify our network to provide additional new current capacity to meet our quarterly of service requirements.
Today, I'm pleased to report another quarter, and importantly, another year of strong performance and solid execution across key financial and operating areas. In 2011, we reported the highest adjusted EBITDA in company history. As we move into 2012, we plan to take further advantage of the investment we have made in 4G LTE network, and will serve as a platform for continued growth. From our vantage point and consistent with our new marketing message, everyone is moving the Metro. 
While 2010 was focused on driving adoption of our Wireless for All tax and regulatory fee-inclusive service plans, 2011 was really about all the Android for All. Since introducing Android smartphones in late 2010, at the end of the year, we had reached approximately 35% penetration in smartphones. This is an outstanding rate of growth and demonstrates the tremendous appetite for smartphones among our subscribers.
Throughout 2011, we introduce a number of new and attractive Android smartphones and increased capacity at our 3G CDMA network to ensure service quality.  We believe we continue to be well-positioned to provide customers with what they demand. Android For All represents a transformation of our business. In just over a year, we've been able to a seismic shift in our subscriber base. We moved quickly from talk and text-only feature phones to now offering a number of data-centric Android smartphones.  We added approximately 2.7 million subscribers since the beginning of 2010, and also upgraded over 100% of our subscriber base in 2 years at 54% in 2011 alone.
Positioning ourselves in the future, we are also at the forefront of 4G LTE network deployment, which will allow us to launch 4G LTE For All. We are quite simply moving the industry in the direction of low-cost 4G LTE handsets. We have already made significant investments in and already introduced 4G LTE service to all of our major metropolitan areas, anticipate full coverage by the end of 2012. 
Consistent with what we planned for 3 years ago, we see significant momentum for 4G LTE, building as we serve subscribers who are data-centric. Currently, we offer 4G LTE smartphones and plan on introducing many more in 2012 as OEMs on a worldwide basis increasingly focus their production efforts on 4G LTE devices.
Recently, the Global Mobile Suppliers Association announced from June 2011 to January 2012 the number of 4G LTE-enabled devices surged sixfold to 269. These devices were manufactured by 57 companies. In addition, 49 operators globally have launched 4G LTE networks. Clearly, this is a global movement, and here in the U.S., we will continue to evolve our 4G LTE network and push for more affordable, high-performance handsets and services that deliver rich communication services.  With this global adoption, we anticipate costs will come down dramatically as economies of scale grow. With these economies of scale, the prices we and our subscribers pay should decline.
Wireless is clearly moving towards 4G LTE. With our current 4G LTE network and with the additions of declining 4G LTE smartphone pricing, we are excited to launch 4G LTE For All, which features affordable 4G LTE smartphones. During the second half of 2012, 4G LTE smartphones in the $99 to $149 retail range will enable our customers to migrate on to this low-cost, spectrum-efficient network.
In the not-too-distant future, LTE and VoLTE provides us with the opportunity to realize significant cost savings on CapEx and OpEx and should directly benefit free cash flow.  As we migrate existing subscribers from our 3G CDMA network onto our 4G LTE network, we'll have the opportunity to reform our existing CDMA spectrum, which we can use additional capacity on our 4G LTE network.
As a leading service provider in the no contract space, we continue to focus on providing a postpaid experience on a No-Contract basis at significant savings to customers.
In a 4G LTE environment, we will continue to have this opportunity, but also believe we can have reductions in churn and the potential for margin expansion through cost-reduction that is based on a worldwide industry focus on a single technology. 
4G LTE is what everybody's waiting for this year. 4G LTE network and enabled smartphones will revolutionize the wireless experience for the subscriber and could open you potential avenues for growth. As 4G LTE devices proliferate, many within the wireless believe that future industry reduction rates could reach 300% to 400% and we believe a large percentage of these subscribers will want devices on a no-contract basis.  As the fifth-largest facilities base provider in the U.S., we believe 4G LTE will help maintain our leadership position as the prominent, low-cost provider in a data-centric world.
Change is the only constant, and with our low-cost operating structure and our ability to be flexible, we believe we have significant competitive advantage.  Importantly, we have in service today the 4G LTE network built to handle the evolving wireless experience. 
2012 is an exciting year for us all at MetroPCS because this is the year where we will begin to move and more fully utilize our 4G LTE network We have built. And more subscribers will be able to enjoy the next level of wireless service.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom"

Good morning, everyone. I want to cover a few topics on today's call. Fourth quarter and year-end 2011 operational results, provide an update on our network and discuss our opportunities for 2012  as the ecosystem for 4G LTE handsets develop. 
We exited 2011 reporting solid growth with $1.2 million net subscriber additions. We now serve over 9.3 million subscribers, up 15% from the end of 2010. Importantly, this growth is the result of continued positive annual growth in all of our markets, and is the sixth consecutive year in which we've reported full year net subscriber additions of over $1 million. We firmly believe that the No-Contract space is viable, relevant and growing.  There's a definite continued interest from consumers in No-Contract plans that provide service, which have previously only been available to postpaid customers.
In recent marketing studies we've conducted, we see subscriber growth coming from 4 main areas: New-to-wireless; previous contract subscribers; converting from prepaid plans; and customers reconnecting to the Metro network, each one having an equal distribution of about 20% to 25%.
Financially, both for the fourth quarter and the full year 2011, we reported record adjusted EBITDA and for the year, managed EBITDA margins around 30%. This requires a balance between growth and profitability, and managing this balance continues to be a focus for the company.
Looking closely at the fourth quarter, subscriber growth of 197,000 net subscribers was driven by seasonal trends and the voice-centric family plan promotion we ran during the quarter. Across our network at the end of the fourth quarter, we are 9.3% penetrated, up from 8.4% a year ago on a covered pot basis of approximately $100 million.
Fourth quarter 2011 ARPU was up $0.76 year-over-year, primarily driven by the continued uptake of smartphone plans and partially offset by family plans. 
During the fourth quarter, we believe our family plan promotion was well-timed and positioned us to bring in new subscribers during the quarter. At the end of 2011, 45% of our subscriber base was on the family plan, up from 40% in the third quarter. Our family plan subscribers have historically have a lower churn percentage than our non-family plan subscribers and also received a meaningful economic benefit on an annualized basis.
Fourth quarter churn of 3.7% was down 80 basis points on a sequential basis. The sequential improvement in churn is due to improved network performance resulting from the investments we made in our CDMA network to meet the increased data demands, as well as typical seasonal effects.
On competition during the fourth quarter, simply put, all else remains competitive. We've seen some pricing action primarily focused in big box. Not an area we are focused on, but we continue to monitor closely. We believe we have an advantage through our distribution network with our focus on indirect dealers, located in the areas where people live, work and play. We believe Metro's unique local distribution model and brand development are key factors for growth in our local markets and one of our key competitive advantages.  We continue to focus on managing our low-cost network, another of our key competitive advantages and executing on our strategy of balancing growth with profitability.
In 2011, we continue to build out of our 4G LTE network and also work to ensure that our CDMA network could handle the demands put on it by the popularity of Android smartphones. At the end of the year, about 35% of our base was on the smartphone plan. As a result of this tremendous increase in smartphone uses, we densified our network through cell splitting and 6-sector cell technology. Additionally, in very dense areas with high usage, we surgically-placed Ev-DO carriers, in 2011, invested in our CDMA network to improve our quality of service by significantly increasing capacity.
We are excited as our 4G LTE build continues throughout the year, and with 4G LTE launched in all markets, we will continue to expand our coverage throughout 2012.  We are pleased with our 4G LTE smartphone ecosystem development and are seeing an acceleration in the migration of our based 4G LTE services.
Throughout 2011, we saw a strong interest in our CDMA Android smartphones among our subscribers. This was an evolution for our subscriber base, which had previously utilized feature phones. In the fourth quarter, 41% of what we sold was Android, and for the full year, 38% was Android. 
2012 is all about the 4G LTE smartphone, and we are focused on further driving demand and retaining customers. We are confident that low priced 4G LTE smartphones will come to market during the second half of 2012. As these smartphones become available, we will have an opportunity to accelerate the customer migration to our high-capacity 4G LTE Broadband network. 
Coinciding with this evolution in smartphones, we recently launched a new branding and advertising campaign themed Everyone Is Moving to Metro. With the increased dependence on smartphones, MetroPCS service increasingly becomes an integral part of customers lives. This aspirational campaign focuses on the positive attributes of our network, 4G LTE technology, and our service offerings while communicating our current consumer offers. 
Our customer base is evolving. In only a year, many of our subscribers have migrated from the feature phone with limited capabilities will fully functioning Android smartphone with that test of thousands of applications. This development is exciting, and with all this comes rising expectations from the subscriber. We'll continue to push brand awareness, have a full suite of offers, have compelling line of smartphones and our nationwide coverage. We will continue to monitor network performance and provide capacity to satisfy increasing data demands so our subscribers have a positive wireless experience.
We're pleased with our results for 2011, and we're excited about our future prospects. We believe we are the clear leaders in the paying advance and No-Contract space. I look forward to providing additional operational developments throughout the year. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Braxton."

We ended the quarter with 197,000 net additions and ended the year with approximately 1.2 million net additions. We currently serve over 9.3 million total subscribers, an increase of 15% from the fourth quarter of 2010 and up 41% over the last 2 years.  Our quarterly adjusted EBITDA was a record for the company at $362 million, up 15% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. 
For the year, our adjusted EBITDA was over $1.3 billion, also a record high for the company. Over the past 5 years, we have grown adjusted EBITDA to 15% CAGR, nearly doubling the amount from $667 million in 2007 to over $1.3 billion in 2011. 
We have a very strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity for $2.2 billion and cash and short-term investments at year-end. This liquidity positions us very well for future strategic opportunities, including spectrum acquisitions.  We continue to evaluate various options to enhance our current spectrum holdings. We believe further investments in spectrum most significantly reduce future CapEx. We'll have a positive impact on free cash flows and will further leverage our 4G LTE investment. 
Our total leverage as of December 31, 2011 was 3.6x computed in accordance with the governing our senior notes. We believe our maturity schedule is very manageable, with our first substantial maturity of approximately $1 billion coming due in November 2016. Our weighted average cost of debt for the fourth quarter was approximately 6%. 
The majority of our debt is fixed by its nature or through interest rate swaps. Clearly, we believe we are very well-positioned from a balance sheet perspective.
Churn for the quarter was 3.7%. The sequential 80 basis points decrease is primarily driven by normal seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods, as well as improved network performance resulting from the investment in our CDMA network to meet increased data demands. 
Our fourth quarter 2011 ARPU was $40.55, up $0.76 on a year-over-year basis. The increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to the continued demand for our Wireless for All and 4G LTE service plans, offset by an increase in family plan penetration from 32% of our customer base in 2010 to 45% of our customer base in 2011. Sequential decrease from fourth quarter ARPU was primarily due to the promotional activities during the quarter, as well as the seasonal timing of net additions in December.
Our CPGA continues to be among the lowest of any facilities-based carrier in the U.S. For the fourth quarter, our CPGA was $166, up $4 over the fourth quarter of 2010. This increase is primarily driven by increased promotional activities. 
Our CPU for the quarter was $20 as compared to $18.83 in the prior year's fourth quarter. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the increase in retention expense on existing customers, costs associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade and roaming expenses associated with MetroUSA, offset by continued scaling of our business.
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $362 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 31.9%. For the year, we have recorded record adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.1%. 
I'd now like to highlight a few items from the income statement, cash flow statement. In the fourth quarter, our service revenue and cost of service grew 17% and 21% respectively to $1.1 billion and $384 million respectively over the same quarter in 2010. The increases are primarily due to the growth of our subscriber base. 
We generated $308 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter. The decrease of $7 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by decrease in cash flows provided by changes in working capital. We incurred capital expenditures of $190 million during the fourth quarter. During the last 12 months our unlevered free cash flow was $442 million.
Our results demonstrate our continued focus and ability to grow the business while generating cash flows over the long term. Our current estimate for total 2012 capital expenditures is $900 million to $1 billion. We generated $91 million in consolidated net income during the fourth quarter or $0.25 per share. For the full year 2011, we generated $301 million in consolidated net income or $0.82 per share.

What I really saying as an impact CPGA, it's more of a 2013 event because even the cost of say approximately $200, there will be a significant subsidy to get into the $99 price point. But I do believe firmly that 2013 will be a year in which we can see substantial reductions in the LTE versions, and thereby, if that cost is reduced, then we think we have an opportunity to reduce our subsidies."

They'll have 4 data screens, they'll have 1.2 gigahertz dual-core processors. They will have batteries of 1900 milliamps or greater. We think handsets will be key for us to maintain our competitive edge. But I think the thing you're asking about into the first quarter in as much competition as to how's the seasonality inside of the first quarter so let me talk about tax season and what we see there. And maybe that'll hit a big topic for everybody. January we think was generally a little bit muted, and a lot of that was based upon return delays. There's a couple of things he found as we dug into it. Number one we didn't see tax legislation from the up until the end of December. So computers didn't get updated until the first couple of weeks of January. We've also seen problems with the IRS' program called Where's My Refund. That tool has had some issues of people to understand if their returns have actually been filed and accepted and then we've seen delay between 2 or 3 weeks. So January appeared a little bit muted we do see February with typical seasonal trends which we enjoy so the one part of the quarter that's too early to tell is what does March look like yet. And is there a longer tail in tax season based upon these delays. That we don't know yet but we do understand that for us to meet competition, we have 2 bases to serve and we have to have all the doors ready, you to have the inventory in the stores, we have a full set of promotions because he have the swing doors I do want to bring our existing customers by the delivered to keep churn low. But we have to find new recruits to come into during the first quarter is usually the opportune time to do it."

The changes that the IRS did with refund anticipation loans and the preapproval of that caused a significant lag. And I'm sure that a lot of people in this call heard about the additional fraud preventions that are being put in that are causing an additional delay this year. So this is really the latest we've seen refunds hitting in our operating history. But it does appear that the refunds are picking up, and that is one of the key drivers to our first quarter. But again, we saw some of the same trends last year. And specifically, you asked about CPGA on this quarter, I think Roger definitely positioned what the expectations are from the future. From looking at the type of promotion that we have in first quarter, which is very different from our fourth quarter promotion. Remember, in the fourth quarter we really had a family plan-oriented promotion, and that was the key driver for the pressure that we saw sequentially in ARPU. That is not the promotion for the first quarter of 2012. We expect to see again continued drive to our higher-end rate plans, and not that ARPU pressure that we saw growing from last year. Our promotions for the first quarter really shifted back to handset-driven promotions. And I think the expectation is that while you have record low CPGA in the fourth quarter, CPGA for year-over-year actually will increase probably in the 10% range for the first quarter of 2012.  And one final thing there, the 10% it depends a lot upon on what ultimate volume is. Because a key driver on CPGA is the total amount of growth is to cover your front costs. Remember all of our store expenses, all of our fixed costs are embedded in CPGA. So if you have more volume, that will somewhat mute the CPGA increase.

We've been explicitly clear with everybody on our volume demands, on what we need out of the handset, about what we think it can do to our existing base, as well as new entrants and the branding campaign to kind of piggyback this. The Everyone's Moving to Metro was designed specifically to have a 6-month branding runway. So when we moved to this LTE For All process, everybody knows who we are. And at that point in time, our contracted base that's out there as they come into their content renewal season and we get ready for fourth quarter 2012, we think we're going to be well-positioned with our name being known to a brand-new segment, people that have choice but are looking for speed and a fully functioning handset.

Because a lot of our customers use our phones only for Internet connection so that 100% is a good number but we actually benefit by that because it keeps reaffirming their belief in MetroPCS, which does help turn. Secondarily, it helps us sell more phones because a lot of people come into the store to make payments with somebody else who's not presently a customer.

We've talked about upgrades, we're hoping to see some moderation of that but probably not a significant moderation as we continue to benefit penetrate the base of smartphones during 2012. And those factors would be offset by some additional scale in our business. So when you put all this together, what does it really mean for a margin standpoint. We don't think that there is a catalyst to really significantly increase margins in 2012. But given our view of the business and the discipline and our continued focus on cost, nor do we see a significant catalyst to decrease margins. This continues to be a year of transition.

We see the forward link in many cases from our own systems standpoint is in some instances limited by the backhaul. Would new concept comment something that industrywide so in order to create the kind of experience that we want, which is a high throughput, very low latency type service, which by the way as reflected itself even in a fairly high-priced handsets with a $300 range, with LG, has caused fairly significant increase early this year for LG's -- excuse me, for LTE service. So with a single handset that's in the $350 range, we see a very strong demand for that product unusually strong. I think signaling the fact that people see that this service is really very attractive and no one can discount the latency because that's how quickly a screen pops up after one is launched and requested. So to do this, we have committed to first purchase microwave spectrum in all of our markets that would allow us, in the 100 to 200 megahertz range, to accomplish backhaul that we think would be necessary going into later 2012, particularly 2013. And that microwave backhaul will be foundational because we'll all in the industry want to densify our network. And there is no really better way to do it other than a well-designed let me call it a mesh network. And I mean by that is that we do not have to coordinate individual links. We bought the microwave spectrum in the entire market as I mentioned, 100 to 200 megahertz. So we have adequate bandwidth and/or picocells or microcells that one would want to drop in. Even data cells for that matter could be located in hotspots together kind of support for the data traffic that we expect in our major markets. So we see this as foundational, growing the system, densify the network because the LTE capacity based on our model will be one that we'll want to continue to expand. And we can do it no better way than to access what's the most difficult thing to get, which is backhaul, once you put in the site. Ours is always available, backhaul isn't."

So I think that for us, the movement to LTE is the opportunity to strengthen ARPU because at that rate and with that plan, we are so much more competitive than anyone else. And note that the spread increased by $10 there, iPhone plan to get to unlimited service. And this is going to be a key factor in our thinking going forward. But it's really our target, which we have now for 3 years to provide this very high performance service and we expect to get paid for it."

As we begin 2012, I'd like to address upfront, the key issues that are likely on most investors' mind: competition, margins, CapEx and spectrum. 
As to competition, nearly 3 years ago, we began a major effort to plan, design and select vendors for our next-generation data centric network, 4G LTE Broadband. The spectrum efficiency potential for advanced broadband services provided that very low latency levels for exceptional customer experience and the promise of an order of magnitude reduction in investment were tremendously attractive. However, the challenge was to stimulate and shape the 4G LTE smartphone ecosystem so that affordable handsets could be available as soon as possible, fuel the growth of the No-Contract segment, without significant handset subsidies I might add. We believe this objective will be achieved during the second half of 2012, when 4G LTE Service for All will be initiated and provide competitive advantage, we seek to accomplish.
As to margins, the move to broadband data-centric service puts pressure on operating margins during the transition period from CDMA to LTE data, and soon-to-be voice service, a.k.a VoLTE. However, the combination of world production focusing on 4G LTE and large worldwide shipments of handsets, combined with our cost-efficient LTE network and our initiative to reduce backhaul cost with investments in microwave backhaul networks, both CPGA and CPU will be further reduced. 
As to CapEx, we expect to reduce the investment in infrastructure by approximately 10x on our 5x5 megahertz band relative to our past procurement experience with CDMA equipment. Clearly, data usage has increased also, and data transmission speeds have also increased as improvements in spectrum efficiency, measured on a bits per hertz basis has more than kept pace.  Overall, we expect CapEx investment to moderate as our subscriber base makes the transition of CDMA to 4G LTE. 
As to spectrum, we continue to pursue all options available while we densify our network to provide additional new current capacity to meet our quarterly of service requirements.
Today, I'm pleased to report another quarter, and importantly, another year of strong performance and solid execution across key financial and operating areas. In 2011, we reported the highest adjusted EBITDA in company history. As we move into 2012, we plan to take further advantage of the investment we have made in 4G LTE network, and will serve as a platform for continued growth. From our vantage point and consistent with our new marketing message, everyone is moving the Metro. 
While 2010 was focused on driving adoption of our Wireless for All tax and regulatory fee-inclusive service plans, 2011 was really about all the Android for All. Since introducing Android smartphones in late 2010, at the end of the year, we had reached approximately 35% penetration in smartphones. This is an outstanding rate of growth and demonstrates the tremendous appetite for smartphones among our subscribers.
Throughout 2011, we introduced a number of new and attractive Android smartphones, and increased capacity at our 3G CDMA network to ensure service quality.  We believe we continue to be well-positioned to provide customers with what they demand. Android For All represents a transformation of our business. In just over a year, we've been able -- through a seismic shift in our subscriber base, we moved quickly from talk and text-only feature phones to now offering a number of data-centric Android smartphones.  We added approximately 2.7 million subscribers since the beginning of 2010, and also upgraded over 100% of our subscriber base in 2 years with 54% in 2011 alone.
Positioning ourselves in the future, we are also at the forefront of 4G LTE network deployment, which will allow us to launch 4G LTE for All. We are quite simply moving the industry in the direction of low-cost 4G LTE handsets. We have already made significant investments and already introduced 4G LTE service in all of our major metropolitan areas, and anticipate full coverage by the end of 2012. 
Consistent with what we planned for 3 years ago, we see significant momentum for 4G LTE, building as we serve subscribers who are data-centric. Currently, we offer 4G LTE smartphones and plan on introducing many more in 2012, as OEMs on a worldwide basis increasingly focus their production efforts on 4G LTE devices.
Recently, the Global Mobile Suppliers Association announced from June 2011 to January 2012, the number of 4G LTE-enabled devices surged sixfold to 269. These devices were manufactured by 57 companies. In addition, 49 operators globally, have launched 4G LTE networks. Clearly, this is a global movement, and here in the U.S., we will continue to evolve our 4G LTE network and push for more affordable, high-performance handsets and services that deliver rich communication services.  With this global adoption, we anticipate costs will come down dramatically as economies of scale grow. With these economies of scale, the prices we and our subscribers pay should decline.
Wireless is clearly moving towards 4G LTE. With our current 4G LTE network and with the additions of declining 4G LTE smartphone pricing, we are excited to launch 4G LTE for All, which features affordable 4G LTE smartphones. During the second half of 2012, 4G LTE smartphones in the $99 to $149 retail range will enable our customers to migrate on to this low-cost, spectrum-efficient network.
In the not-too-distant future, LTE and VoLTE provides us with the opportunity to realize significant cost savings on CapEx and OpEx and should directly benefit free cash flow.  As we migrate existing subscribers from our 3G CDMA network onto our 4G LTE network, we'll have the opportunity to reform our existing CDMA spectrum, which we can use additional capacity on our 4G LTE network.
As a leading service provider in the no contract space, we continue to focus on providing a postpaid experience on a no-contract basis at significant savings to customers.
In a 4G LTE environment, we will continue to have this opportunity, but also believe we can have reductions in churn and the potential for margin expansion through cost reduction that is based on a worldwide industry focus on a single technology. 
4G LTE is what everybody's waiting for this year. 4G LTE network and enabled smartphones will revolutionize the wireless experience for the subscriber and could open new potential avenues for growth. As 4G LTE devices proliferate, many within the wireless believe that future industry reduction rates could reach 300% to 400%, and we believe a large percentage of these subscribers will want devices on a no-contract basis. As the fifth largest facilities base provider in the U.S., we believe 4G LTE will help maintain our leadership position as the prominent, low cost provider in a data-centric world.
Change is the only constant, and with our low cost operating structure and our ability to be flexible, we believe we have significant competitive advantage. Importantly, we have in service today, the 4G LTE network built to handle the evolving wireless experience. 
2012 is an exciting year for us all at MetroPCS because this is the year where we will begin to move and more fully utilize our 4G LTE network we have built. And more subscribers will be able to enjoy the next level of wireless service.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom"

Good morning, everyone. I want to cover a few topics on today's call. Fourth quarter and year-end 2011 operational results, provide an update on our network and discuss our opportunities for 2012 as the ecosystem for 4G LTE handsets develop. 
We exited 2011 reporting solid growth with 1.2 million net subscriber additions. We now serve over 9.3 million subscribers, up 15% from the end of 2010. Importantly, this growth is the result of continued positive annual growth in all of our markets, and is the sixth consecutive year in which we've reported full year net subscriber additions of over 1 million. We firmly believe that the no-contract space is viable, relevant and growing.  There's a definite continued interest from consumers in no-contract plans that provide service, which have previously only been available to postpaid customers.
In recent marketing studies we've conducted, we see subscriber growth coming from 4 main areas: New-to-wireless; previous contract subscribers; converting from prepaid plans; and customers reconnecting to the Metro network. Each one having an equal distribution of about 20% to 25%.
Financially, both for the fourth quarter and the full year 2011, we reported record adjusted EBITDA and for the year, managed EBITDA margins around 30%. This requires a balance between growth and profitability, and managing this balance continues to be a focus of the company.
Looking closely at the fourth quarter, subscriber growth of 197,000 net subscribers was driven by seasonal trends and the voice-centric family plan promotion we ran during the quarter. Across our network, at the end of the fourth quarter, we are 9.3% penetrated, up from 8.4% a year ago, on a covered pop basis of approximately $100 million.
Fourth quarter 2011 ARPU was up $0.76 year-over-year, primarily driven by the continued uptake of smartphone plans and partially offset by family plans. 
During the fourth quarter, we believe our family plan promotion was well-timed and positioned us to bring in new subscribers during the quarter. At the end of 2011, 45% of our subscriber base was on a family plan, up from 40% in the third quarter. Our family plan subscribers have historically have a lower churn percentage than our non-family plan subscribers and also receive a meaningful economic benefit on an annualized basis.
Fourth quarter churn of 3.7% was down 80 basis points on a sequential basis. The sequential improvement in churn was due to improved network performance resulting from the investments we made in our CDMA network to meet the increased data demands, as well as typical seasonal effects.
Touching on competition during the fourth quarter, simply put, wireless remains competitive. We've seen some pricing action primarily focused in big box. Not an area we are focused on, but we continue to monitor closely. We believe we have an advantage through our distribution network with our focus on indirect dealers, located in the areas where people live, work and play. We believe Metro's unique local distribution model and brand development are key factors for growth in our local markets and one of our key competitive advantages.  We continue to focus on managing our low-cost network, another of our key competitive advantages, and executing on our strategy of balancing growth with profitability.
In 2011, we continue to build out of our 4G LTE network and also work to ensure that our CDMA network could handle the demands put on it by the popularity of Android smartphones. At the end of the year, about 35% of our base was on a smartphone plan. As a result of this tremendous increase in smartphone uses, we densified our network through cell splitting and 6-sector cell technology. Additionally, in very dense areas with high usage, we surgically placed Ev-DO carriers. In 2011, we invested in our CDMA network to improve our quality of service by significantly increasing capacity.
We are excited as our 4G LTE build continues throughout the year, and with 4G LTE launched in all markets, we will continue to expand our coverage throughout 2012. We are pleased with our 4G LTE smartphone ecosystem development and are seeing an acceleration in the migration of our based 4G LTE services.
Throughout 2011, we saw a strong interest in our CDMA Android smartphones among our subscribers. This was an evolution for our subscriber base, which had previously utilized feature phones. In the fourth quarter, 41% of what we sold was Android, and for the full year, 38% was Android. 
2012 is all about the 4G LTE smartphone, and we are focused on further driving demand and retaining customers. We are confident that low-priced 4G LTE smartphones will come to market during the second half of 2012. As these smartphones become available, we will have an opportunity to accelerate the customer migration to our high-capacity 4G LTE broadband network. 
Coinciding with this evolution in smartphones, we recently launched a new branding and advertising campaign themed Everyone Is Moving in Metro. With the increased dependence on smartphones, MetroPCS service increasingly becomes an integral part of customers' lives. This aspirational campaign focuses on the positive attributes of our network, 4G LTE technology, and our service offerings while communicating our current consumer offers. 
Our customer base is evolving. In only a year, many of our subscribers have migrated from a feature phone with limited capabilities to a fully functioning Android smartphone with access to thousands of applications. This development is exciting, and with all this comes rising expectations from the subscriber. We'll continue to push brand awareness, our full suite of offers, our compelling line of smartphones and our nationwide coverage. We will continue to monitor network performance and provide capacity to satisfy increasing data demands, so our subscribers have a positive wireless experience.
We are pleased with our results for 2011, and we're excited about our future prospects. We believe we are the clear leaders in paying advance, no-contract space. I look forward to providing additional operational developments throughout the year. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Braxton."

We ended the quarter with 197,000 net additions and ended the year with approximately 1.2 million net additions. We currently serve over 9.3 million total subscribers, an increase of 15% from the fourth quarter of 2010, and up 41% over the last 2 years. Our quarterly adjusted EBITDA was a record for the company at $362 million, up 15% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. 
For the year, our adjusted EBITDA was over $1.3 billion, also a record high for the company. Over the past 5 years, we have grown adjusted EBITDA to 15% CAGR, nearly doubling the amount from $667 million in 2007 to over $1.3 billion in 2011. 
We have a very strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity with $2.2 billion in cash and short-term investments at year-end. This liquidity positions us very well for future strategic opportunities, including spectrum acquisitions. We continue to evaluate various options to enhance our current spectrum holdings. We believe further investments in spectrum will significantly reduce future CapEx, will have a positive impact on free cash flows and will further leverage our 4G LTE investment. 
Our total leverage as of December 31, 2011 was 3.6x computed in accordance with the intentious governing of our senior notes. We believe our maturity schedule is very manageable, with our first substantial maturity of approximately $1 billion coming due in November 2016. Our weighted average cost of debt for the fourth quarter was approximately 6%. 
The majority of our debt is fixed by its nature or through interest rate swaps. Clearly, we believe we are very well-positioned from a balance sheet perspective.
Churn for the quarter was 3.7%. The sequential 80 basis point decrease is primarily driven by normal seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods, as well as improved network performance resulting from the investment in our CDMA network to meet increased data demands. 
Our fourth quarter 2011 ARPU was $40.55, up $0.76 on a year-over-year basis. The increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to the continued demand for our Wireless for All and 4G LTE service plans, offset by an increase in family plan penetration from 32% of our customer base in 2010, to 45% of our customer base in 2011. Sequential decrease from fourth quarter ARPU was primarily due to the promotional activities during the quarter, as well as the seasonal timing of net additions in December.
Our CPGA continues to be among the lowest of any facilities-based carrier in the U.S. For the fourth quarter, our CPGA was $166, up $4 over the fourth quarter of 2010. This increase is primarily driven by increased promotional activities. 
Our CPU for the quarter was $20 as compared to $18.83 in the prior year's fourth quarter. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the increase in retention expense on existing customers, costs associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade and roaming expenses associated with MetroUSA, offset by continued scaling of our business.
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $362 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 31.9%. For the year, we have recorded record adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.1%. 
I'd now like to highlight a few items from the income statement, cash flow statement. In the fourth quarter, our service revenue and cost of service grew 17% and 21% respectively, to $1.1 billion and $384 million respectively, over the same quarter in 2010. The increases are primarily due to the growth of our subscriber base. 
We generated $308 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter, a decrease of $7 million from the prior year's fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by decrease in cash flows provided by changes in working capital. We incurred capital expenditures of $190 million during the fourth quarter. During the last 12 months, our unlevered free cash flow was $442 million.
Our results demonstrate our continued focus and ability to grow the business while generating cash flows over the long term. Our current estimate for total 2012 capital expenditures is $900 million to $1 billion. We generated $91 million in consolidated net income during the fourth quarter or $0.25 per share. For the full year 2011, we generated $301 million in consolidated net income or $0.82 per share.

What I'm really saying, as it impacts CPGA, it's more of a 2013 event because even at a cost of, say, approximately $200, there will be a significant subsidy to get into the $99 price point. But I do believe firmly, that 2013 will be a year in which we can see substantial reductions in the LTE versions, and thereby, if that cost is reduced, then we think we have an opportunity to reduce our subsidies."

We have to serve our core segment, continue to serve the best deal in town, value segment. And then we have to open up to new segments, we have to look to people who see us as a viable alternative to a 2-year commit, and we think we're going to be doing that by new handsets in the next 3 to 6 months. Handsets that will come in at 8 millimeters. They'll have 4 data screens, they will have 1.2 gigahertz dual-core processors. They will have batteries of 1900 milliamps or greater. So we think handsets will be key for us to maintain our competitive edge. But I think the thing you're asking about into the first quarter isn't as much competition as how's the seasonality inside of the first quarter. So let me talk about tax season and what we see there. And maybe that'll hit a big topic for everybody. January, we think, was generally a little bit muted, and a lot of that was based upon return delays. There's a couple of things we found as we dug into it. Number one, we didn't see tax legislation firmed up until the end of December. So computers didn't get updated until the first couple of weeks of January. We've also seen problems with the IRS' program called Where's My Refund and that tool has had some issues for people to understand if their returns actually have been filed and accepted, and then we've seen a delay between 2 or 3 weeks. So January appeared a little bit muted. We do see February with typical seasonal trends which we enjoy. So the one part of the quarter that's too early to tell is what does March look like yet, and is there a longer tail on tax season based upon these delays? That we don't know yet but we do understand that for us to meet competition, we have 2 bases to serve and we have to have all the doors ready, we to have the inventory in the stores, we have to have a full set of promotions because we have to swing doors, not only to bring our existing customers back in the door to keep churn low, but we have to find new recruits to come in the door and the first quarter is usually the opportune time to do that."

The changes that the IRS did with refund anticipation loans and the pre-approval of that caused a significant lag. And I'm sure that a lot of people in this call have heard about the additional fraud preventions that are being put in that are causing an additional delay this year. So this is really the latest we've seen refunds hitting in our operating history. But it does appear that the refunds are picking up, and that is one of the key drivers to our first quarter. But again, we saw some of the same trends last year. And specifically, you asked about CPGA on this quarter, I think Roger definitely positioned what the expectations are from the future. From looking at the type of promotion that we have in first quarter, which is very different from our fourth quarter promotion. Remember, in the fourth quarter, we really had a family plan-oriented promotion, and that was the key driver for the pressure that we saw sequentially in ARPU. That is not the promotion for the first quarter of 2012. We expect to see again, continued drive to our higher-end rate plans, and not that ARPU pressure that we saw growing from last year. Our promotions for the first quarter really shifted back to handset-driven promotions. And I think the expectation is that while you have record low CPGA in the fourth quarter, CPGA for year-over-year actually will increase probably in the 10% range for the first quarter of 2012. And one final thing there, the 10%, it depends a lot upon what ultimate volume is. Because a key driver on CPGA is the total amount of growth to cover your front costs. Remember, all of our store expenses, all of our fixed costs are embedded in CPGA. So if you have more volume, that will somewhat mute the CPGA increase. If you end up having lower volume, that will accentuate the CPGA increase."

So when Braxton was alluding to a little bit of the CPGA bump in the first quarter, part of that's going to come from a higher-priced handset, which is going to be and Android handset. We do think that the seasonal trends inside the gross adds will continue, but as we talked about, right now, we're in the middle of the first quarter, but we also saw a more muted January.

But we've been explicitly clear with everybody on our volume demands, on what we need out of the handset, about what we think it can do to our existing base, as well as new entrants and the branding campaign to kind of piggyback this. The Everyone's Moving in Metro was designed specifically to have a 6-month branding runway. So that when we move to this LTE for All process, everybody knows who we are. And at that point in time, our contracted base that's out there, as they come into their contract renewal season and we get ready for fourth quarter 2012, we think we're going to be well-positioned with our name being known, known to a brand-new segment, people that have choice but are looking for speed and a fully functioning handset.

There is a more fully baked version in wideband CDMA. So it's probably a 2013 reality. But we will have at least 1, if not 2, handsets that will be completely VoLTE-capable.

So as we introduce new handsets and they come in to our store a member, pay by the month, they come in, 68% of the base pays in cash. As they come in to our dealers and our dealers carry a full line of equipment, they see when we launch new products. The one thing we know from our base is that handsets are fashion, handsets are function. People have a personality attached to a handset and there's an absolute desire to do more because our handsets have a 4 for 1 utility, right? Its mobile voice, fixed voice in the home, and that's the same thing with broadband, right? It's mobile broadband, fixed broadband in the home. Because a lot of our customers use our phone only for the only-Internet connection. So that 100% is a good number but we actually benefit by that because it keeps reaffirming their belief in MetroPCS, which does help churn. Secondarily, it helps us sell more phones because a lot of people come into the store to make payments with somebody else who's not presently a customer. That works on the viral nature of how we advertise, at how we move a product, keeps our CPGA lower. It keeps our net promoter score higher. So those are good things we think. We also have seen in the last 60 days, a very nice increase to LTE. We're seeing customers who want speed because they want to do more, I think every report you'll read is about increased daily usage, which we're all mindful of.

So we felt that there was a lot of pent-up demand from a run rate of about 30% of the base in the '09  and the '10. What changed at the end of '10 was the launch of the Android and the real proliferation of smartphones in the marketplace. And we've seen very rapid uptake of the smartphone this year and a very rapid uptake of our base upgrading to it. And that's why you got earlier in 2011, even a more significant bump in our upgrade rates. That did somewhat moderate in the fourth quarter.

From a cost of service standpoint, we will continue to put in backhaul, we have a major market wave backhaul initiative in place that Roger will touch base on -- here in a second, which we think will be very positive and very cost efficient in the future. But we are going to continue to add network expenses to our business as we continue to build out the 4G LTE footprint. We've talked about upgrades, we're hoping to see some moderation of that but probably not a significant moderation as we continue to benefit -- penetrate the base in smartphones during 2012. And those factors would be offset by some additional scale in our business. So when you put all this together, what does it really mean from a margin standpoint. We don't think that there's a catalyst to really significantly increase margins in 2012. But given our view of the business and the discipline and our continued focus on cost, nor do we see a significant catalyst to decrease margins. This continues to be a year of transition. You've heard Roger and Tom spend a lot of time talking about 4G LTE developing in the latter half of the year, where we can start putting scale on that network.

We see that the forward link in many cases, from our own system's standpoint is in some instances, limited by the backhaul. As that new concept is something that's industry-wide, so that in order to create the kind of experience that we want, which is a high throughput, very low latency-type service, which by the way, as reflected itself even in a fairly high-priced handset on the $300 range, with LG, has caused fairly significant increase early this year for LG's -- excuse me, for LTE service. So with a single handset that's in the $350 range, we see a very strong demand for that product, unusually strong. I think signaling the fact that people see that this service is really very attractive and no one can discount the latency because that's how quickly a screen pops up after one is launched and requested. So to do this, we have committed to first purchase microwave spectrum in all of our markets that would allow us, in the 100 to 200 megahertz range, to accomplish backhaul that we think would be necessary going into later 2012, particularly 2013. And that microwave backhaul will be foundational because we'll all, in the industry, want to densify our network. And there is no really better way to do it other than a well-designed, let me call it a mesh network. And I mean that by that, is that we do not have to coordinate individual links. We bought the microwave spectrum in the entire market, as I mentioned, 100 to 200 megahertz. So we have adequate bandwidth and/or picocells or microcells that one would want to drop in. Even data cells for that matter. Could be located in hotspots to give the kind of support for the data traffic that we expect in our major markets. So we see this as foundational for growing the system, densify the network, because the LTE capacity based on our model will be one that we'll want to continue to expand. And we can do it no better way than to access what's the most difficult thing to get, which is backhaul, once you put it in the site. Ours is always available, backhaul isn't."

But there's another benefit, and that is we do see a fairly significant difference in retention characteristics for family plan customers versus nonfamily plans.

And note that the spread increased by $10 there, iPhone plan to get to unlimited service. And this is going to be a key factor in our thinking going forward. But it's really our target, which we've aimed at now for 3 years, to provide this very high performance service and we expect to get paid for it."

As we begin 2012, I'd like to address upfront, the key issues that are likely on most investors' mind: competition, margins, CapEx and spectrum. 
As to competition, nearly 3 years ago, we began a major effort to plan, design and select vendors for our next-generation data centric network, 4G LTE Broadband. The spectrum efficiency potential for advanced broadband services, provided at very low latency levels for exceptional customer experience and the promise of an order of magnitude reduction in investment, were tremendously attractive. However, the challenge was to stimulate and shape the 4G LTE smartphone ecosystem so that affordable handsets could be available as soon as possible, fuel the growth of the no-contract segment, without significant handset subsidies I might add. We believe this objective will be achieved during the second half of 2012, when 4G LTE Service for All will be initiated and provide competitive advantage we seek to accomplish.
As to margins, the move to broadband data-centric service puts pressure on operating margins during the transition period from CDMA to LTE data, and soon-to-be voice service, a.k.a VoLTE. However, the combination of world production focusing on 4G LTE and large worldwide shipments of handsets, combined with our cost-efficient LTE network and our initiative to reduce backhaul cost with investments in microwave backhaul networks, both CPGA and CPU will be further reduced. 
As to CapEx, we expect to reduce the investment in infrastructure by approximately 10x on our 5x5 megahertz band relative to our past procurement experience with CDMA equipment. 
Clearly, data usage has increased also, and data transmission speeds have also increased as improvements in spectrum efficiency measured on a bits per hertz basis has more than kept pace. Overall, we expect CapEx investment to moderate as our subscriber base makes the transition of CDMA to 4G LTE. 
As to spectrum, we continue to pursue all options available while we densify our network to provide additional near-term capacity to meet our quarterly of service requirements.
Today, I'm pleased to report another quarter, and importantly, another year of strong performance and solid execution across key financial and operating areas. In 2011, we reported the highest adjusted EBITDA in company history. As we move into 2012, we plan to take further advantage of the investment we have made in 4G LTE network, and will serve as a platform for continued growth. From our vantage point and consistent with our new marketing message, everyone is moving the Metro. 
While 2010 was focused on driving adoption of our Wireless for All tax and regulatory fee-inclusive service plans, 2011 was really about all the Android for All. Since introducing Android smartphones in late 2010, at the end of the year, we had reached approximately 35% penetration in smartphones. This is an outstanding rate of growth and demonstrates the tremendous appetite for smartphones among our subscribers.
Throughout 2011, we introduced a number of new and attractive Android smartphones, and increased capacity at our 3G CDMA network to ensure service quality. We believe we continue to be well-positioned to provide customers with what they demand. Android For All represents a transformation of our business. In just over a year, we've been able -- through a seismic shift in our subscriber base, we’ve moved quickly from talk and text-only feature phones to now offering a number of data-centric Android smartphones. We added approximately 2.7 million subscribers since the beginning of 2010, and also upgraded over 100% of our subscriber base in 2 years with 54% in 2011 alone.
Positioning ourselves in the future, we are also at the forefront of 4G LTE network deployment, which will allow us to launch 4G LTE for All. We are quite simply moving the industry in the direction of low-cost 4G LTE handsets. We have already made significant investments in and already introduced 4G LTE service in all of our major metropolitan areas, and anticipate full coverage by the end of 2012. 
Consistent with what we planned for 3 years ago, we see significant momentum for 4G LTE, building as we serve subscribers who are data-centric. Currently, we offer 4G LTE smartphones and plan on introducing many more in 2012, as OEMs on a worldwide basis increasingly focus their production efforts on 4G LTE devices.
Recently, the Global Mobile Suppliers Association announced from June 2011 to January 2012, the number of 4G LTE-enabled devices surged six-fold to 269. These devices were manufactured by 57 companies. In addition, 49 operators globally, have launched 4G LTE networks. Clearly, this is a global movement, and here in the U.S., we will continue to evolve our 4G LTE network and push for more affordable, high-performance handsets and services that deliver rich communication services. With this global adoption, we anticipate costs will come down dramatically as economies of scale grow. With these economies of scale, the prices we and our subscribers pay should decline.
Wireless is clearly moving towards 4G LTE. With our current 4G LTE network and with the additions of declining 4G LTE smartphone pricing, we are excited to launch 4G LTE for All, which features affordable 4G LTE smartphones. During the second half of 2012, 4G LTE smartphones in the $99 to $149 retail range will enable our customers to migrate on to this low-cost, spectrum-efficient network.
In the not-too-distant future, LTE and VoLTE provides us with the opportunity to realize significant cost savings on CapEx and OpEx and should directly benefit free cash flow.  As we migrate existing subscribers from our 3G CDMA network onto our 4G LTE network, we'll have the opportunity to reform our existing CDMA spectrum, which we can use additional capacity on our 4G LTE network.
As a leading service provider in the no contract space, we continue to focus on providing a postpaid experience on a no-contract basis at significant savings to customers. In a 4G LTE environment, we will continue to have this opportunity, but also believe we can have reductions in churn and the potential for margin expansion through cost reduction that is based on a worldwide industry focus on a single technology. 
4G LTE is what everybody's been waiting for this year. 4G LTE network and the enabled smartphones will revolutionize the wireless experience for the subscriber and could open new potential avenues for growth. As 4G LTE devices proliferate, many within the wireless believe that future industry reduction rates could reach 300% to 400%, and we believe a large percentage of these subscribers will want devices on a no-contract basis. As the fifth largest facilities base provider in the U.S., we believe 4G LTE will help maintain our leadership position as the prominent, low cost provider in a data-centric world.
Change is the only constant, and with our low cost operating structure and our ability to be flexible, we believe we have significant competitive advantage. Importantly, we have in service today, the 4G LTE network built to handle the evolving wireless experience. 
2012 is an exciting year for us all at MetroPCS because this is the year where we will begin to move and more fully utilize our 4G LTE network we have built. And more subscribers will be able to enjoy the next level of wireless service.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom"

Good morning, everyone. I want to cover a few topics on today's call. Fourth quarter and year-end 2011 operational results provide an update on our network and discuss our opportunities for 2012 as the ecosystem for 4G LTE handsets develop. 
We exited 2011 reporting solid growth with 1.2 million net subscriber additions. We now serve over 9.3 million subscribers, up 15% from the end of 2010. Importantly, this growth is the result of continued positive annual growth in all of our markets, and is the sixth consecutive year in which we've reported full year net subscriber additions of over 1 million. We firmly believe that the no-contract space is viable, relevant and growing. There's a definite continued interest from consumers in no-contract plans that provide service, which have previously only been available to postpaid customers.
In recent marketing studies we've conducted, we see subscriber growth coming from 4 main areas: New-to-wireless; previous contract subscribers; converting from prepaid plans; and customers reconnecting to the Metro network. Each one having an equal distribution of about 20% to 25%.
Financially, both for the fourth quarter and the full year 2011, we reported record adjusted EBITDA and for the year, managed EBITDA margins around 30%. This requires a balance between growth and profitability, and managing this balance continues to be a focus of the company.
Looking closely at the fourth quarter, subscriber growth of 197,000 net subscribers was driven by seasonal trends and the voice-centric family plan promotion we ran during the quarter. Across our network, at the end of the fourth quarter, we are 9.3% penetrated, up from 8.4% a year ago, on a covered pop basis of approximately $100 million.
Fourth quarter 2011 ARPU was up $0.76 year-over-year, primarily driven by the continued uptake of smartphone plans and partially offset by family plans. 
During the fourth quarter, we believe our family plan promotion was well-timed and positioned us to bring in new subscribers during the quarter. At the end of 2011, 45% of our subscriber base was on a family plan, up from 40% in the third quarter. Our family plan subscribers have historically have a lower churn percentage than our non-family plan subscribers and also receive a meaningful economic benefit on an annualized basis.
Fourth quarter churn of 3.7% was down 80 basis points on a sequential basis. The sequential improvement in churn was due to improved network performance resulting from the investments we made in our CDMA network to meet the increased data demands, as well as typical seasonal effects.
Touching on competition during the fourth quarter, simply put, wireless remains competitive. We've seen some pricing action primarily focused in big box. Not an area we are focused on, but we continue to monitor closely. We believe we have an advantage through our distribution network with our focus on indirect dealers, located in the areas where people live, work and play. We believe Metro's unique local distribution model and brand development are key factors for growth in our local markets and one of our key competitive advantages. We continue to focus on managing our low-cost network, another of our key competitive advantages, and executing on our strategy of balancing growth with profitability.
In 2011, we continue to build out of our 4G LTE network and also work to ensure that our CDMA network could handle the demands put on it by the popularity of Android smartphones. At the end of the year, about 35% of our base was on a smartphone plan. As a result of this tremendous increase in smartphone uses, we densified our network through cell splitting and 6-sector cell technology. Additionally, in very dense areas with high usage, we surgically placed Ev-DO carriers. In 2011, we invested in our CDMA network to improve our quality of service by significantly increasing capacity.
We are excited as our 4G LTE build continues throughout the year, and with 4G LTE launched in all markets, we will continue to expand our coverage throughout 2012. We are pleased with our 4G LTE smartphone ecosystem development and are seeing an acceleration in the migration of our based 4G LTE services.
Throughout 2011, we saw a strong interest in our CDMA Android smartphones among our subscribers. This was an evolution for our subscriber base, which had previously utilized feature phones. In the fourth quarter, 41% of what we sold was Android, and for the full year, 38% was Android. 
2012 is all about the 4G LTE smartphone, and we are focused on further driving demand and retaining customers. We are confident that low-priced 4G LTE smartphones will come to market during the second half of 2012. As these smartphones become available, we will have an opportunity to accelerate the customer migration to our high-capacity 4G LTE broadband network. 
Coinciding with this evolution in smartphones, we recently launched a new branding and advertising campaign themed Everyone Is Moving in Metro. With the increased dependence on smartphones, MetroPCS service increasingly becomes an integral part of customers' lives. This aspirational campaign focuses on the positive attributes of our network, 4G LTE technology, and our service offerings while communicating our current consumer offers. 
Our customer base is evolving. In only a year, many of our subscribers have migrated from a feature phone with limited capabilities to a fully functioning Android smartphone with access to thousands of applications. This development is exciting, and with all this comes rising expectations from the subscriber. We'll continue to push brand awareness, our full suite of offers, our compelling line of smartphones and our nationwide coverage. We will continue to monitor network performance and provide capacity to satisfy increasing data demands, so our subscribers have a positive wireless experience.
We are pleased with our results for 2011, and we're excited about our future prospects. We believe we are the clear leaders in paying advance, no-contract space. I look forward to providing additional operational developments throughout the year. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Braxton."

We ended the quarter with 197,000 net additions and ended the year with approximately 1.2 million net additions. We currently serve over 9.3 million total subscribers, an increase of 15% from the fourth quarter of 2010, and up 41% over the last 2 years. Our quarterly adjusted EBITDA was a record for the company at $362 million, up 15% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. 
For the year, our adjusted EBITDA was over $1.3 billion, also a record high for the company. Over the past 5 years, we have grown adjusted EBITDA to 15% CAGR, nearly doubling the amount from $667 million in 2007 to over $1.3 billion in 2011. 
We have a very strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity with $2.2 billion in cash and short-term investments at year-end. This liquidity positions us very well for future strategic opportunities, including spectrum acquisitions. We continue to evaluate various options to enhance our current spectrum holdings. We believe further investments in spectrum will significantly reduce future CapEx, will have a positive impact on free cash flows and will further leverage our 4G LTE investment. 
Our total leverage as of December 31, 2011 was 3.6x computed in accordance with the intentious governing of our senior notes. We believe our maturity schedule is very manageable, with our first substantial maturity of approximately $1 billion coming due in November 2016. Our weighted average cost of debt for the fourth quarter was approximately 6%. 
The majority of our debt is fixed by its nature or through interest rate swaps. Clearly, we believe we are very well-positioned from a balance sheet perspective.
Churn for the quarter was 3.7%. The sequential 80 basis point decrease is primarily driven by normal seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods, as well as improved network performance resulting from the investment in our CDMA network to meet increased data demands. 
Our fourth quarter 2011 ARPU was $40.55, up $0.76 on a year-over-year basis. The increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to the continued demand for our Wireless for All and 4G LTE service plans, offset by an increase in family plan penetration from 32% of our customer base in 2010, to 45% of our customer base in 2011. Sequential decrease in fourth quarter ARPU was primarily due to the promotional activities during the quarter, as well as the seasonal timing of net additions in December.
Our CPGA continues to be among the lowest of any facilities-based carrier in the U.S. For the fourth quarter, our CPGA was $166, up $4 over the fourth quarter of 2010. This increase is primarily driven by increased promotional activities. 
Our CPU for the quarter was $20 as compared to $18.83 in the prior year's fourth quarter. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the increase in retention expense on existing customers, costs associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade and roaming expenses associated with MetroUSA, offset by continued scaling of our business.
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $362 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 31.9%. For the year, we have recorded record adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.1%. 
I'd now like to highlight a few items from the income statement, cash flow statement. In the fourth quarter, our service revenue and cost of service grew 17% and 21% respectively, to $1.1 billion and $384 million respectively, over the same quarter in 2010. The increases are primarily due to the growth of our subscriber base. 
We generated $308 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter, a decrease of $7 million from the prior year's fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in cash flows provided by changes in working capital. We incurred capital expenditures of $190 million during the fourth quarter. During the last 12 months, our unlevered free cash flow was $442 million.
Our results demonstrate our continued focus and ability to grow the business while generating cash flows over the long term. Our current estimate for total 2012 capital expenditures is $900 million to $1 billion. We generated $91 million in consolidated net income during the fourth quarter or $0.25 per share. For the full year 2011, we generated $301 million in consolidated net income or $0.82 per share.

We'll see the first reductions -- the first kind of wave in will be in the second half of this year. What I'm really saying, as it impacts CPGA, it's more of a 2013 event because even at a cost of, say, approximately $200, there will be a significant subsidy to get into the $99 price point. But I do believe firmly, that 2013 will be a year in which we can see substantial reductions in the LTE versions, and thereby, if that cost is reduced, then we think we have an opportunity to reduce our subsidies."

We have to serve our core segment, continue to serve the best deal in town, value segment. And then we have to open up to new segments, we have to look to people who see us as a viable alternative to a 2-year commit, and we think we're going to be doing that by new handsets in the next 3 to 6 months. Handsets that will come in at 8 millimeters. They'll have 4 data screens, they will have 1.2 gigahertz dual-core processors. They will have batteries of 1900 milliamps or greater. So we think the handsets will be key for us to maintain our competitive edge. But I think the thing you're asking about into the first quarter isn't as much competition as how's the seasonality inside of the first quarter. So let me talk about tax season and what we see there. And maybe that'll hit a big topic for everybody. January, we think, was generally a little bit muted, and a lot of that was based upon return delays. There's a couple of things we found as we dug into it. Number one, we didn't see tax legislation firmed up until the end of December, so computers didn't get updated until the first couple of weeks of January. We've also seen problems with the IRS' program called Where's My Refund and that tool has had some issues for people to understand if their returns actually have been filed and accepted, and then we've seen a delay between 2 or 3 weeks. So January appeared a little bit muted. We do see February with typical seasonal trends which we enjoy. So the one part of the quarter that's too early to tell is, what does March look like yet and is there a longer tail on tax season based upon these delays? That we don't know yet, but we do understand that for us to meet competition -- we have 2 bases to serve and we have to have all the doors ready, we have to have inventory in the stores, we have to have a full set of promotions because we have to swing doors, not only to bring our existing customers back in the door to keep churn low, but we have to find new recruits to come in the door and the first quarter is usually the opportune time to do that."

The changes that the IRS did with refund anticipation loans and the pre-approval of that caused a significant lag. And I'm sure that a lot of people in this call have heard about the additional fraud preventions that are being put in that are causing an additional delay this year. So this is really the latest we've seen refunds hitting in our operating history. But it does appear that the refunds are picking up, and that is one of the key drivers to our first quarter. But again, we saw some of the same trends last year. And specifically, you asked about CPGA on this quarter, I think Roger definitely positioned what the expectations are from the future. From looking at the type of promotion that we have in first quarter, which is very different from our fourth quarter promotion. Remember, in the fourth quarter, we really had a family plan-oriented promotion, and that was the key driver for the pressure that we saw sequentially in ARPU. That is not the promotion for the first quarter of 2012. We expect to see again, continued drive to our higher-end rate plans, and not that ARPU pressure that we saw growing from last year. Our promotions for the first quarter really shifted back to handset-driven promotions. And I think the expectation is that while you have record low CPGA in the fourth quarter, CPGA for year-over-year actually will increase, probably in the 10% range for the first quarter of 2012. And one final thing there, the 10%, it depends a lot upon what ultimate volume is. Because a key driver on CPGA is the total amount of growth is to cover your front costs. Remember, all of our store expenses, all of our fixed costs are embedded in CPGA. So if you have more volume, that will somewhat mute the CPGA increase. If you end up having lower volume, that will accentuate the CPGA increase."

So when Braxton was alluding to a little bit of the CPGA bump in the first quarter, part of that's going to come from a higher-priced handset, which is going to be and Android handset. We do think that the seasonal trends inside the gross adds will continue, but as we talked about, right now, we're in the middle of the first quarter, but we also saw a more muted January.

But we've been explicitly clear with everybody on our volume demands, on what we need out of the handset, about what we think it can do to our existing base, as well as new entrants and the branding campaign to kind of piggyback this. The Everyone's Moving in Metro was designed specifically to have a 6-month branding runway. So that when we move to this LTE for All process, everybody knows who we are. And at that point in time, our contracted base that's out there, as they come into their contract renewal season and we get ready for fourth quarter 2012, we think we're going to be well-positioned with our name being known, known to a brand-new segment, people that have choice but are looking for speed and a fully functioning handset.

There is a more fully baked version in wideband CDMA. So it's probably a 2013 reality. But we will have at least 1, if not 2, handsets that will be completely VoLTE-capable.

It's mobile broadband, fixed broadband in the home, because a lot of our customers use our phone only for the only-Internet connection.

Secondarily, it helps us sell more phones because a lot of people come into the store to make payments with somebody else who's not presently a customer. That works on the viral nature of how we advertise, at how we move a product, keeps our CPGA lower. It keeps our net promoter score higher. So those are good things we think.

And we're really focused on doing that as soon as possible during the year. So if we were going to weigh CapEx, I would weigh more of the CapEx to the first half of the year versus the second half of the year. From a cost of service standpoint, we will continue to put in backhaul, we have a major market wave backhaul initiative in place that Roger will touch base on -- here in a second, which we think will be very positive and very cost efficient in the future. But we are going to continue to add network expenses to our business as we continue to build out the 4G LTE footprint. We've talked about upgrades, we're hoping to see some moderation of that but probably not a significant moderation as we continue to benefit -- penetrate the base in smartphones during 2012. And those factors would be offset by some additional scale in our business. So when you put all this together, what does it really mean from a margin standpoint? We don't think that there's a catalyst to really significantly increase margins in 2012. But given our view of the business and the discipline and our continued focus on cost, nor do we see a significant catalyst to decrease margins. This continues to be a year of transition. You've heard Roger and Tom spend a lot of time talking about 4G LTE developing in the latter half of the year, where we can start putting scale on that network. We really expect to see the margin expansion occur in 2013. Roger, do you want to talk a little bit about the market wave?"

We see that the forward link in many cases, from our own system's standpoint is in some instances, limited by the backhaul. That’s not a new concept, it’s something that's industry-wide, so that in order to create the kind of experience that we want, which is a high throughput, very low latency-type service, which by the way, as reflected itself even in a fairly high-priced handset on the $300 range, with LG, has caused fairly significant increase in early this year for LG's -- excuse me, for LTE service. So with a single handset that's in the $350 range, we see a very strong demand for that product, unusually strong. I think signaling the fact that people see that this service is really very attractive and no one can discount the latency because that's how quickly a screen pops up after one is launched and requested. So to do this, we have committed to first purchase microwave spectrum in all of our markets that would allow us, in the 100 to 200 megahertz range, to accomplish backhaul that we think would be necessary going into later 2012, particularly 2013. And that microwave backhaul will be foundational because we'll all, in the industry, want to densify our network. And there is no really better way to do it other than a well-designed, let me call it a mesh network. And I mean by that, is that we do not have to coordinate individual links. We bought the microwave spectrum in the entire market, as I mentioned, 100 to 200 megahertz. So we have adequate bandwidth and/or picocells or microcells that one would want to drop in, even data cells for that matter, could be located in hotspots to give the kind of support for the data traffic that we expect in our major markets. So we see this as foundational for growing the system, densify the network, because the LTE capacity based on our model will be one that we'll want to continue to expand. And we can do it no better way than to access what's the most difficult thing to get, which is backhaul, once you put it in the site. Ours is always available, backhaul isn't."

But there's another benefit, and that is we do see a fairly significant difference in retention characteristics for family plan customers versus nonfamily plans.

So I think that for us, the movement to LTE is the opportunity to strengthen ARPU because at that rate and with that plan, we are so much more competitive than anyone else. And note that the spread increased by $10 there, iPhone plan to get to unlimited service. And this is going to be a key factor in our thinking going forward. But it's really our target, which we've aimed at now for 3 years, to provide this very high performance service and we expect to get paid for it."

As we begin 2012, I'd like to address upfront, the key issues that are likely on most investors' mind: competition, margins, CapEx and spectrum. 
As to competition, nearly 3 years ago, we began a major effort to plan, design and select vendors for our next-generation data centric network, 4G LTE Broadband. The spectrum efficiency potential for advanced broadband services, provided at very low latency levels for exceptional customer experience and the promise of an order of magnitude reduction in investment, were tremendously attractive. However, the challenge was to stimulate and shape the 4G LTE smartphone ecosystem so that affordable handsets could be available as soon as possible, fuel the growth of the no-contract segment, without significant handset subsidies I might add. We believe this objective will be achieved during the second half of 2012, when 4G LTE Service for All will be initiated and provide competitive advantage we seek to accomplish.
As to margins, the move to broadband data-centric service puts pressure on operating margins during the transition period from CDMA to LTE data, and soon-to-be voice service, a.k.a VoLTE. However, the combination of world production focusing on 4G LTE and large worldwide shipments of handsets, combined with our cost-efficient LTE network and our initiative to reduce backhaul cost with investments in microwave backhaul networks, both CPGA and CPU will be further reduced. 
As to CapEx, we expect to reduce the investment in infrastructure by approximately 10x on our 5x5 megahertz band relative to our past procurement experience with CDMA equipment. 
Clearly, data usage has increased also, and data transmission speeds have also increased as improvements in spectrum efficiency measured on a bits per hertz basis has more than kept pace. Overall, we expect CapEx investment to moderate as our subscriber base makes the transition of CDMA to 4G LTE. 
As to spectrum, we continue to pursue all options available while we densify our network to provide additional near-term capacity to meet our quarterly of service requirements.
Today, I'm pleased to report another quarter, and importantly, another year of strong performance and solid execution across key financial and operating areas. In 2011, we reported the highest adjusted EBITDA in company history. As we move into 2012, we plan to take further advantage of the investment we have made in 4G LTE network, and will serve as a platform for continued growth. From our vantage point and consistent with our new marketing message, everyone is moving the Metro. 
While 2010 was focused on driving adoption of our Wireless for All tax and regulatory fee-inclusive service plans, 2011 was really about all the Android for All. Since introducing Android smartphones in late 2010, at the end of the year, we had reached approximately 35% penetration in smartphones. This is an outstanding rate of growth and demonstrates the tremendous appetite for smartphones among our subscribers.
Throughout 2011, we introduced a number of new and attractive Android smartphones, and increased capacity at our 3G CDMA network to ensure service quality. We believe we continue to be well-positioned to provide customers with what they demand. Android For All represents a transformation of our business. In just over a year, we've been able -- through a seismic shift in our subscriber base, we’ve moved quickly from talk and text-only feature phones to now offering a number of data-centric Android smartphones. We added approximately 2.7 million subscribers since the beginning of 2010, and also upgraded over 100% of our subscriber base in 2 years with 54% in 2011 alone.
Positioning ourselves in the future, we are also at the forefront of 4G LTE network deployment, which will allow us to launch 4G LTE for All. We are quite simply moving the industry in the direction of low-cost 4G LTE handsets. We have already made significant investments in and already introduced 4G LTE service in all of our major metropolitan areas, and anticipate full coverage by the end of 2012. 
Consistent with what we planned for 3 years ago, we see significant momentum for 4G LTE, building as we serve subscribers who are data-centric. Currently, we offer 4G LTE smartphones and plan on introducing many more in 2012, as OEMs on a worldwide basis increasingly focus their production efforts on 4G LTE devices.
Recently, the Global Mobile Suppliers Association announced from June 2011 to January 2012, the number of 4G LTE-enabled devices surged sixfold to 269. These devices were manufactured by 57 companies. In addition, 49 operators globally, have launched 4G LTE networks. Clearly, this is a global movement, and here in the U.S., we will continue to evolve our 4G LTE network and push for more affordable, high-performance handsets and services that deliver rich communication services. With this global adoption, we anticipate costs will come down dramatically as economies of scale grow. With these economies of scale, the prices we and our subscribers pay should decline.
Wireless is clearly moving towards 4G LTE. With our current 4G LTE network and with the additions of declining 4G LTE smartphone pricing, we are excited to launch 4G LTE for All, which features affordable 4G LTE smartphones. During the second half of 2012, 4G LTE smartphones in the $99 to $149 retail range will enable our customers to migrate on to this low-cost, spectrum-efficient network.
In the not-too-distant future, LTE and VoLTE provides us with the opportunity to realize significant cost savings on CapEx and OpEx and should directly benefit free cash flow.  As we migrate existing subscribers from our 3G CDMA network onto our 4G LTE network, we'll have the opportunity to reform our existing CDMA spectrum, which we can use additional capacity on our 4G LTE network.
As a leading service provider in the no contract space, we continue to focus on providing a postpaid experience on a no-contract basis at significant savings to customers. In a 4G LTE environment, we will continue to have this opportunity, but also believe we can have reductions in churn and the potential for margin expansion through cost reduction that is based on a worldwide industry focus on a single technology. 
4G LTE is what everybody's been waiting for this year. 4G LTE network and the enabled smartphones will revolutionize the wireless experience for the subscriber and could open new potential avenues for growth. As 4G LTE devices proliferate, many within the wireless believe that future industry reduction rates could reach 300% to 400%, and we believe a large percentage of these subscribers will want devices on a no-contract basis. As the fifth largest facilities base provider in the U.S., we believe 4G LTE will help maintain our leadership position as the prominent, low cost provider in a data-centric world.
Change is the only constant, and with our low cost operating structure and our ability to be flexible, we believe we have significant competitive advantage. Importantly, we have in service today, the 4G LTE network built to handle the evolving wireless experience. 
2012 is an exciting year for us all at MetroPCS because this is the year where we will begin to move and more fully utilize our 4G LTE network we have built. And more subscribers will be able to enjoy the next level of wireless service.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom"

Good morning, everyone. I want to cover a few topics on today's call. Fourth quarter and year-end 2011 operational results provide an update on our network and discuss our opportunities for 2012 as the ecosystem for 4G LTE handsets develop. 
We exited 2011 reporting solid growth with 1.2 million net subscriber additions. We now serve over 9.3 million subscribers, up 15% from the end of 2010. Importantly, this growth is the result of continued positive annual growth in all of our markets, and is the sixth consecutive year in which we've reported full year net subscriber additions of over 1 million. We firmly believe that the no-contract space is viable, relevant and growing. There's a definite continued interest from consumers in no-contract plans that provide service, which have previously only been available to postpaid customers.
In recent marketing studies we've conducted, we see subscriber growth coming from 4 main areas: New-to-wireless; previous contract subscribers; converting from prepaid plans; and customers reconnecting to the Metro network. Each one having an equal distribution of about 20% to 25%.
Financially, both for the fourth quarter and the full year 2011, we reported record adjusted EBITDA and for the year, managed EBITDA margins around 30%. This requires a balance between growth and profitability, and managing this balance continues to be a focus of the company.
Looking closely at the fourth quarter, subscriber growth of 197,000 net subscribers was driven by seasonal trends and the voice-centric family plan promotion we ran during the quarter. Across our network, at the end of the fourth quarter, we are 9.3% penetrated, up from 8.4% a year ago, on a covered pop basis of approximately $100 million.
Fourth quarter 2011 ARPU was up $0.76 year-over-year, primarily driven by the continued uptake of smartphone plans and partially offset by family plans. 
During the fourth quarter, we believe our family plan promotion was well-timed and positioned us to bring in new subscribers during the quarter. At the end of 2011, 45% of our subscriber base was on a family plan, up from 40% in the third quarter. Our family plan subscribers have historically have a lower churn percentage than our non-family plan subscribers and also receive a meaningful economic benefit on an annualized basis.
Fourth quarter churn of 3.7% was down 80 basis points on a sequential basis. The sequential improvement in churn was due to improved network performance resulting from the investments we made in our CDMA network to meet the increased data demands, as well as typical seasonal effects.
Touching on competition during the fourth quarter, simply put, wireless remains competitive. We've seen some pricing action primarily focused in big box. Not an area we are focused on, but we continue to monitor closely. We believe we have an advantage through our distribution network with our focus on indirect dealers, located in the areas where people live, work and play. We believe Metro's unique local distribution model and brand development are key factors for growth in our local markets and one of our key competitive advantages. We continue to focus on managing our low-cost network, another of our key competitive advantages, and executing on our strategy of balancing growth with profitability.
In 2011, we continue to build out of our 4G LTE network and also work to ensure that our CDMA network could handle the demands put on it by the popularity of Android smartphones. At the end of the year, about 35% of our base was on a smartphone plan. As a result of this tremendous increase in smartphone uses, we densified our network through cell splitting and 6-sector cell technology. Additionally, in very dense areas with high usage, we surgically placed Ev-DO carriers. In 2011, we invested in our CDMA network to improve our quality of service by significantly increasing capacity.
We are excited as our 4G LTE build continues throughout the year, and with 4G LTE launched in all markets, we will continue to expand our coverage throughout 2012. We are pleased with our 4G LTE smartphone ecosystem development and are seeing an acceleration in the migration of our based 4G LTE services.
Throughout 2011, we saw a strong interest in our CDMA Android smartphones among our subscribers. This was an evolution for our subscriber base, which had previously utilized feature phones. In the fourth quarter, 41% of what we sold was Android, and for the full year, 38% was Android. 
2012 is all about the 4G LTE smartphone, and we are focused on further driving demand and retaining customers. We are confident that low-priced 4G LTE smartphones will come to market during the second half of 2012. As these smartphones become available, we will have an opportunity to accelerate the customer migration to our high-capacity 4G LTE broadband network. 
Coinciding with this evolution in smartphones, we recently launched a new branding and advertising campaign themed Everyone Is Moving in Metro. With the increased dependence on smartphones, MetroPCS service increasingly becomes an integral part of customers' lives. This aspirational campaign focuses on the positive attributes of our network, 4G LTE technology, and our service offerings while communicating our current consumer offers. 
Our customer base is evolving. In only a year, many of our subscribers have migrated from a feature phone with limited capabilities to a fully functioning Android smartphone with access to thousands of applications. This development is exciting, and with all this comes rising expectations from the subscriber. We'll continue to push brand awareness, our full suite of offers, our compelling line of smartphones and our nationwide coverage. We will continue to monitor network performance and provide capacity to satisfy increasing data demands, so our subscribers have a positive wireless experience.
We are pleased with our results for 2011, and we're excited about our future prospects. We believe we are the clear leaders in paying advance, no-contract space. I look forward to providing additional operational developments throughout the year. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Braxton."

We ended the quarter with 197,000 net additions and ended the year with approximately 1.2 million net additions. We currently serve over 9.3 million total subscribers, an increase of 15% from the fourth quarter of 2010, and up 41% over the last 2 years. Our quarterly adjusted EBITDA was a record for the company at $362 million, up 15% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. 
For the year, our adjusted EBITDA was over $1.3 billion, also a record high for the company. Over the past 5 years, we have grown adjusted EBITDA to 15% CAGR, nearly doubling the amount from $667 million in 2007 to over $1.3 billion in 2011. 
We have a very strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity with $2.2 billion in cash and short-term investments at year-end. This liquidity positions us very well for future strategic opportunities, including spectrum acquisitions. We continue to evaluate various options to enhance our current spectrum holdings. We believe further investments in spectrum will significantly reduce future CapEx, will have a positive impact on free cash flows and will further leverage our 4G LTE investment. 
Our total leverage as of December 31, 2011 was 3.6x computed in accordance with the intentious governing of our senior notes. We believe our maturity schedule is very manageable, with our first substantial maturity of approximately $1 billion coming due in November 2016. Our weighted average cost of debt for the fourth quarter was approximately 6%. 
The majority of our debt is fixed by its nature or through interest rate swaps. Clearly, we believe we are very well-positioned from a balance sheet perspective.
Churn for the quarter was 3.7%. The sequential 80 basis point decrease is primarily driven by normal seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods, as well as improved network performance resulting from the investment in our CDMA network to meet increased data demands. 
Our fourth quarter 2011 ARPU was $40.55, up $0.76 on a year-over-year basis. The increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to the continued demand for our Wireless for All and 4G LTE service plans, offset by an increase in family plan penetration from 32% of our customer base in 2010, to 45% of our customer base in 2011. Sequential decrease in fourth quarter ARPU was primarily due to the promotional activities during the quarter, as well as the seasonal timing of net additions in December.
Our CPGA continues to be among the lowest of any facilities-based carrier in the U.S. For the fourth quarter, our CPGA was $166, up $4 over the fourth quarter of 2010. This increase is primarily driven by increased promotional activities. 
Our CPU for the quarter was $20 as compared to $18.83 in the prior year's fourth quarter. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the increase in retention expense on existing customers, costs associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade and roaming expenses associated with MetroUSA, offset by continued scaling of our business.
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $362 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 31.9%. For the year, we have recorded record adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.1%. 
I'd now like to highlight a few items from the income statement, cash flow statement. In the fourth quarter, our service revenue and cost of service grew 17% and 21% respectively, to $1.1 billion and $384 million respectively, over the same quarter in 2010. The increases are primarily due to the growth of our subscriber base. 
We generated $308 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter, a decrease of $7 million from the prior year's fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in cash flows provided by changes in working capital. We incurred capital expenditures of $190 million during the fourth quarter. During the last 12 months, our unlevered free cash flow was $442 million.
Our results demonstrate our continued focus and ability to grow the business while generating cash flows over the long term. Our current estimate for total 2012 capital expenditures is $900 million to $1 billion. We generated $91 million in consolidated net income during the fourth quarter or $0.25 per share. For the full year 2011, we generated $301 million in consolidated net income or $0.82 per share.

And then secondly, is there anything that you're seeing in the competitive environment that would suggest that we won't see the typical first quarter seasonality that we normally do?"

What I'm really saying, as it impacts CPGA, it's more of a 2013 event because even at a cost of, say, approximately $200, there will be a significant subsidy to get into the $99 price point. But I do believe firmly, that 2013 will be a year in which we can see substantial reductions in the LTE versions, and thereby, if that cost is reduced, then we think we have an opportunity to reduce our subsidies."

We have to serve our core segment, continue to serve the best deal in town, value segment. And then we have to open up to new segments, we have to look to people who see us as a viable alternative to a 2-year commit, and we think we're going to be doing that by new handsets in the next 3 to 6 months. Handsets that will come in at 8 millimeters. They'll have 4 data screens, they will have 1.2 gigahertz dual-core processors. They will have batteries of 1900 milliamps or greater. So we think the handsets will be key for us to maintain our competitive edge. But I think the thing you're asking about into the first quarter isn't as much competition as how's the seasonality inside of the first quarter. So let me talk about tax season and what we see there. And maybe that'll hit a big topic for everybody. January, we think, was generally a little bit muted, and a lot of that was based upon return delays. There's a couple of things we found as we dug into it. Number one, we didn't see tax legislation firmed up until the end of December, so computers didn't get updated until the first couple of weeks of January. We've also seen problems with the IRS' program called Where's My Refund and that tool has had some issues for people to understand if their returns actually have been filed and accepted, and then we've seen a delay between 2 or 3 weeks. So January appeared a little bit muted. We do see February with typical seasonal trends which we enjoy. So the one part of the quarter that's too early to tell is, what does March look like yet and is there a longer tail on tax season based upon these delays? That we don't know yet, but we do understand that for us to meet competition -- we have 2 bases to serve and we have to have all the doors ready, we have to have inventory in the stores, we have to have a full set of promotions because we have to swing doors, not only to bring our existing customers back in the door to keep churn low, but we have to find new recruits to come in the door and the first quarter is usually the opportune time to do that."

The changes that the IRS did with refund anticipation loans and the pre-approval of that caused a significant lag. And I'm sure that a lot of people in this call have heard about the additional fraud preventions that are being put in that are causing an additional delay this year. So this is really the latest we've seen refunds hitting in our operating history. But it does appear that the refunds are picking up, and that is one of the key drivers to our first quarter. But again, we saw some of the same trends last year. And specifically, you asked about CPGA on this quarter, I think Roger definitely positioned what the expectations are from the future. From looking at the type of promotion that we have in first quarter, which is very different from our fourth quarter promotion. Remember, in the fourth quarter, we really had a family plan-oriented promotion, and that was the key driver for the pressure that we saw sequentially in ARPU. That is not the promotion for the first quarter of 2012. We expect to see again, continued drive to our higher-end rate plans, and not that ARPU pressure that we saw growing from last year. Our promotions for the first quarter really shifted back to handset-driven promotions. And I think the expectation is that while you have record low CPGA in the fourth quarter, CPGA for year-over-year actually will increase, probably in the 10% range for the first quarter of 2012. And one final thing there, the 10%, it depends a lot upon what ultimate volume is. Because a key driver on CPGA is the total amount of growth is to cover your front costs. Remember, all of our store expenses, all of our fixed costs are embedded in CPGA. So if you have more volume, that will somewhat mute the CPGA increase. If you end up having lower volume, that will accentuate the CPGA increase."

And I just wanted to get your latest perspective as to why you think the velocity of devices moves so quickly through your base, which tends to be more of a value-conscious base, and then how you look at the opportunity to improve the totality of that number and what it could mean for margins on a 2 to 3-year view for the company?"

The first thing is you're asking me to give up a little bit of the secret sauce, so I'll be happy to do that. We see people 12 times a year. So as we introduce new handsets and they come in to our store a member, pay by the month, they come in, 68% of the base pays in cash. As they come in to our dealers and our dealers carry a full line of equipment, they see when we launch new products. The one thing we know from our base is that handsets are fashion, handsets are function. People have a personality attached to a handset and there's an absolute desire to do more because our handsets have a 4 for 1 utility, right? Its mobile voice, fixed voice in the home, and that's the same thing with broadband, right? It's mobile broadband, fixed broadband in the home, because a lot of our customers use our phone only for the only-Internet connection. So that 100% is a good number but we actually benefit by that because it keeps reaffirming their belief in MetroPCS, which does help churn. Secondarily, it helps us sell more phones because a lot of people come into the store to make payments with somebody else who's not presently a customer. That works on the viral nature of how we advertise, at how we move a product, keeps our CPGA lower. It keeps our net promoter score higher. So those are good things we think. We also have seen in the last 60 days, a very nice increase to LTE. We're seeing customers who want speed because they want to do more, I think every report you'll read is about increased data usage, which we're all mindful of. But that also means that what we're building, as Roger alluded to, this bridge that we've talked about getting to LTE for All, we are confident that it's the right path to be on."

And what happened in 2010 is, remember, we've launched the Wireless for All, but we did away with the first month free and did a corresponding reduction in our handset prices. So we felt that there was a lot of pent-up demand from a run rate of about 30% of the base in the '09 and into '10. What changed at the end of '10 was the launch of the Android and the real proliferation of smartphones in the marketplace. And we've seen very rapid uptake of the smartphone this year and a very rapid uptake of our base upgrading to it. And that's why you got earlier in 2011, even a more significant bump in our upgrade rates. That did somewhat moderate in the fourth quarter. And we believe it could continue to moderate and be helpful from a margin standpoint going forward, as people really have embraced the smartphone and most of our bases there. So I think that you bring up a great point there."

And we're really focused on doing that as soon as possible during the year. So if we were going to weigh CapEx, I would weigh more of the CapEx to the first half of the year versus the second half of the year. From a cost of service standpoint, we will continue to put in backhaul, we have a major market wave backhaul initiative in place that Roger will touch base on -- here in a second, which we think will be very positive and very cost efficient in the future. But we are going to continue to add network expenses to our business as we continue to build out the 4G LTE footprint. We've talked about upgrades, we're hoping to see some moderation of that but probably not a significant moderation as we continue to benefit -- penetrate the base in smartphones during 2012. And those factors would be offset by some additional scale in our business. So when you put all this together, what does it really mean from a margin standpoint? We don't think that there's a catalyst to really significantly increase margins in 2012. But given our view of the business and the discipline and our continued focus on cost, nor do we see a significant catalyst to decrease margins. This continues to be a year of transition. You've heard Roger and Tom spend a lot of time talking about 4G LTE developing in the latter half of the year, where we can start putting scale on that network. We really expect to see the margin expansion occur in 2013. Roger, do you want to talk a little bit about the market wave?"

We see that the forward link in many cases, from our own system's standpoint is in some instances, limited by the backhaul. That’s not a new concept, it’s something that's industry-wide, so that in order to create the kind of experience that we want, which is a high throughput, very low latency-type service, which by the way, as reflected itself even in a fairly high-priced handset on the $300 range, with LG, has caused fairly significant increase in early this year for LG's -- excuse me, for LTE service. So with a single handset that's in the $350 range, we see a very strong demand for that product, unusually strong. I think signaling the fact that people see that this service is really very attractive and no one can discount the latency because that's how quickly a screen pops up after one is launched and requested. So to do this, we have committed to first purchase microwave spectrum in all of our markets that would allow us, in the 100 to 200 megahertz range, to accomplish backhaul that we think would be necessary going into later 2012, particularly 2013. And that microwave backhaul will be foundational because we'll all, in the industry, want to densify our network. And there is no really better way to do it other than a well-designed, let me call it a mesh network. And I mean by that, is that we do not have to coordinate individual links. We bought the microwave spectrum in the entire market, as I mentioned, 100 to 200 megahertz. So we have adequate bandwidth and/or picocells or microcells that one would want to drop in, even data cells for that matter, could be located in hotspots to give the kind of support for the data traffic that we expect in our major markets. So we see this as foundational for growing the system, densify the network, because the LTE capacity based on our model will be one that we'll want to continue to expand. And we can do it no better way than to access what's the most difficult thing to get, which is backhaul, once you put it in the site. Ours is always available, backhaul isn't."

First quarter is normally the strongest sales quarter for the year for the Contract segment. However, our net gains in EBITDA in the first quarter 2012 significantly outperformed expectations. Combinations of uncertainty in the economy a",704,"Thank you, Keith. First quarter is normally the strongest sales quarter for the year for the Contract segment. However, our net gains in EBITDA in the first quarter 2012 significantly outperformed expectations. Combinations of uncertainty in the economy and growing competition in 3G data service makes our early investment initiatives in 4G LTE that much more important. 
Anticipating more competition in 3G data services, as well as continued economic headwinds, we elected in the first quarter to emphasize handset promotions that broadly appeal to individuals, not just family plan subscribers that was offered in the first quarter of 2011. Result was a large proportion of existing subscribers upgrading their handsets. Consequently the increase in upgrade retention expense created additional EBITDA pressure in the first quarter of 2012 of approximately $70 million. 
First quarter operations provided a clearer picture regarding the significant demand of high-speed data services. Whilst considerable softness is said in the CDMA data service segment of our business, our 4G LTE subscribers nearly doubled in the first quarter. This occurred in spite of the average price of the handsets approach $300 and equally important -- for the during the 4G LTE segment is now at the 2% level. 
With these facts in mind we intend to focus on operating margins and free cash flow over subscriber growth and then we can mainstream our LTE for all initiatives with affordable handsets later this year. We believe acceleration of 4G LTE adoption in the U.S. will rapidly drive lower smartphone cost and higher volume. As handset designs standardize on the iPhone, touchscreen and substrate design, product differentiation will be accomplished by screen size, resolution and processing power enabling cost reduction that can be substantial. 
We expect full-featured affordable handsets and screens will become available in the second half of 2012 in the sub$150 retail range. We believe that demand will be ARPU accretive, high percentage of our customers electing the $50, $60 and $70 rate plans. There's no question that smartphone data consumption characterizes wireless service opportunities and challenges going forward. Speed does matter, and with our 4G LTE network targeted for system-wide completion by third quarter, the challenge is to effectively manage all network traffic such that the spectrum re-firming can occur at the earliest practical time. 
With smartphone momentum that were capacity requirements bring focus on technology, as well as spectrum resources. The opportunity to expand capacity on 4G LTE networks is orders of magnitude utilizing pico cells within macro cells whereby capacity can be approved by multiples of 3, 4 or more times. We continue to see spectrum opportunities but enhancing network capacity through technology gains is as cost effective near-term alternative. 
Once our microwave backhaul is in place and fully operational we expect a significant cost reduction improvement relative to fiber and T1 circuits. Microwave backhaul is key for data throughput and future cost-effective of pico cells. High-speed data at low latency is a key driver for user satisfaction but so is the expanded menu of rich communication services or RCS that will serve to differentiate our premium 4G LTE service from our competitors' 3G data services. 
RCS supports simultaneous voice communication with multimedia messaging linking presents with address book contacts and more by the end of 2012. Objective continues to be providing our subscribers with a premium postpaid service experience on a no-contract basis. 4G LTE services is not only high-speed data service but also about the menu of services that it can support. 
Beginning the fall of 2012, we intend to move at a high gear with our marketing initiatives that focus on 4G LTE handsets and services to extend our wireless leadership as the best deal in town. Affordable handsets our key to our LTE for all initiatives and several of these handsets are currently in our labs for acceptance testing. 
Our objectives are clear: prioritize operating margins and free cash flow over subscriber growth until we have affordable 4G LTE handsets later this year; two, capitalize on our 4G LTE for all initiatives and begin to introduce capable handsets later in the second half of the year to begin spectrum; and finally, build network capacity for future growth. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Clearly, the first quarter 2012 was challenging from a growth a",916,"Good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to focus my comments on 3 areas. First quarter 2012 results discussed the drivers impacting these results and lastly, review our roadmap going forward. Clearly, the first quarter 2012 was challenging from a growth and profitability perspective and results were below expectations. 
Regarding first quarter 2012 results. Our first quarter promotional investments primarily consisting of instant rebates or rebates generated just over $1 million gross additions during the first quarter. Consistent with lower gross margin addition activity in the quarter, we recorded net subscriber additions of approximately 132,000. 
Although our sales activity was muted, we did see retentive benefits from our promotions as our base continue to upgrade their handsets during the quarter. During the quarter, the transition of our customer base is important as mature users now benefit from our new handset selection and remained loyal to our brand. We believe this loyalty continues to show itself in positive net turn over scores that demonstrate the true viral nature and impact of our service in the communities that we operate in. 
As a result of this activity churn for the quarter was an all-time low for the company at 3.1%. Most churn was driven in part by the over 1.5 million upgrades recorded during the quarter which represented 16% of our customer base. Our increased upgrade expenses, primarily driven by handset promotions, contributed to higher cost in the quarter. Our customer base continues to demand the experience afforded by a smartphone. At the end of the first quarter, approximately 46% of all subscribers are on a smartphone plan, up from roughly 1/3 at the end of 2011. 
Looking at upgrade activity. 76% of all upgrades ended up on a rate plan of $50 or higher. Additionally, 46% of the upgrades during the quarter were feature phone users that migrated upward to a smartphone. Progress that impacted the first quarter. Our strategy continues to focus on offering customers the best deal in town without taxes and regulatory fees included in our pricing. We believe there are a number of factors as to why we saw a decrease in gross additions in the first quarter of 2012. 
We believe factors include overall competition, delayed tax refunds and end-users' desire for high-speed data. Looking at the quarter, we saw some competitive 3G data offerings in the postpaid and spaces that put pressure on our acquisition model. As you may recall on the fourth quarter of 2011 call, we spoke about the delay in tax refunds. We did not know how this delay would impact the quarter but it appears that the delayed lead to consumers using their refunds and other more immediate needs as discrete fund dynamic disrupted purchasing cycles that we have seen in past years. 
Finally since introducing Android smartphones in late 2010, we have placed the majority of our smartphones on our CDMA network. Speed has become an increasing part of the customers buying decision and consequently, speed and superior experience of our 4G LTE network is compelling and a driver of new customer acquisition. In order to provide our customers with a high-speed data experience they expect, we need to provide handsets at affordable costs that drives new user adoption. 
Looking at our operational roadmap going forward, our focus on completing the build of our 4G LTE network. At the end of the first quarter, we built approximately 80% of our total footprint covering roughly 9,500 cell sites. We anticipate covering our full CDMA footprint with 3G LTE-based stations by third quarter 2012. 
Network speed and coverage quality gaining importance as consumers now differentiate between service providers, network backhaul becomes critical to the user experience. Invested in implementing microwave backhaul in our dense urban poor. This delivery will allow for the increased use of data. By deploying microwave backhaul, we will be able to take advantage of lower cost, highly targeted small sale deployments, which will be added to the network fork capacity outflow. 
We anticipate first wave of affordable 4G LTE smartphones to be introduced prior to the back-to-school season. Within the near-term roadmap affordable 4G LTE smartphones our short-term reliance on an CDMA smartphones for new customers acquisition will diminish during the second half of 2012. Currently, Samsung, LG, Huawei, CTE and other manufacturers are developing low-cost handset solutions that will hopefully retail in the sub $150 range as our 4G LTE for all campaign gets into full swing. 
In preparation for 4G LTE smartphones becoming widely available, we recently announced the change in our pricing to our 4G LTE service plans. This change helps build the foundation for the second half of 2012. We currently offer the nation's most affordable 4G LTE service as low as $40 a month. All plans still offer unlimited talk and text. With these data tiers, consumers have greater control, allowing them to select the data plan that meets their needs. 
We are the only wireless service provider to offer a no contract unlimited 4G LTE plan, $70 a month with taxes and fees included. With a challenging quarter behind us, we believe the industry is transitioning to high-speed data delivery and we are well on our way to a full 4G LTE deployment. We remain focused and believe our unique distribution model, no contract, tax and regulatory fee inclusive service plans and near-term 4G LTE smartphone roadmap, we can successfully work to meet our long-term goal of balancing growth with profitability. Now I'll turn the call over to Braxton."

Our weighted average cost of debt for the first quarter was 5.9%. The majority of our debt is fixed by its nature or through interest rate swaps. Clearly, we believe we are very well-positioned from a balance sheet perspective. 
Churn for the quarter was 3.1%, matches the lowest reported churn in company history. First quarter churn was down 60 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 and was flat when compared to the first quarter of 2011. The sequential decline in churn we believe was primarily driven by a continued investment in our networks, aggressive retention programs and normal seasonal trends. 
The first quarter 2012 ARPU was $40.56, up $0.14 on a year-over-year basis, but flat with the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to continued demand for 4G LTE service plans, offset by an increase in family plan penetration from 35% of our customer base as of March 31, 2011, to 44% of our customer base as of March 31, 2012. 
Also impacting ARPU this quarter was the addition of family plan subscribers heavily weighted to the back end of the fourth quarter of 2011. For the first quarter, our CPGA was $235, up $78 over the first quarter of 2011. This increase is primarily driven by increased promotional activities and lower gross additions as compared to the 3 months ended March 31, 2011. 
CPU for the quarter was $22.87 as compared to $19.79 in the prior year's first quarter. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the increase in retention expense for existing customers, cost associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade and roaming expenses with Metro USA. During the quarter, we experienced $7.13 in CPU directly related to handset upgrades compared to $4.60 the prior year's first quarter. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $262 million, a decrease of 8% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 22.6%. Over the trailing 12-month period, adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.3 billion. I'd now like to highlight a few items from the income statement and cash flow statement. 
In the first quarter our service revenue and cost of service grew 10% and 14%, respectively to approximately $1.2 billion and $389 million, respectively over the same quarter in 2011. The increases are primarily due to growth in our subscriber base. We generated $137 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter. We generated $21 million in consolidated net income during the first quarter, or $0.06 per share. 
We incurred capital expenditures of $144 million during the quarter. We reaffirm our 4-year 2012 guidance for capital expenditures of $900 million to $1 billion. Now we'll move to Q&A. Operator?"

And then thirdly in terms of your strategy, it totally makes sense to manage the business for margin and cash flow while you wait for cost-effective LTE handsets to become available. What was the thinking around this quarter though, where it seems like you pushed handset subsidy dramatically and still didn't get doors swinging singing. I guess, my concern is we saw subsidies go up so much and still didn't see incremental demand. What would those adds have been like if you hadn't incurred that level of cost to drive demand or were you just very unproductive this quarter."

As we stated, we would've certainly liked to see more people, new customers come through the door but as we talked about in the beginning of March, we had a delayed tax season.

First of all, there was a very large volume differential between what we thought we were going to achieve from a gross additions standpoint versus what we actually achieved. Secondly, the mix of handsets and remember there were different pricing schemes within the handsets before we had an MIR and the actual mix of what's sold was different than we have assumed. The take rates on the rebates were higher than we initially had indicated. I think the final factor is that the brand advertising that we put out in the market, we did try to increase that in the first quarter, and that definitely also had an impact. Really looking forward, we talked about backing out the handset subsidies. We also have a numerator denominator affect and there are a lot of fixed cost within CPGA and to the extent that you have lower gross additions, you're not getting the scale and you do ultimately drive a higher CPGA and that certainly should be the expectation given the gross as in the statements that we are focused on cash flows and profitability versus growth. I think the final comment, Phil, is when you look at the change year-over-year it really wasn't about the acquisition. We did spend incremental subsidy on the gross at became and by the volume drop pretty much offset that. The real change from the profitability and the trajectory that we had over a year ago was in fact, near the upgrades and we give you a very specific cost per user. I'll point you to the supplemental deck where we have highlighted historically, what our upgrade costs were and you can do the math on it but that's really where the issue was."

That is that the focus that we're finding in the 4G world, we were early into this business and we saw the opportunity. We didn't want to spend another $1 billion on a complete 3G network. We felt that we can leapfrog to 4G and now that possibility is coming very, very evident to us. So the thought is we're early into the leadership but we've worked in some of the handset manufacturers now for 2 almost I would say 2.5 years. There is a broad differential between the people moving up to the contract space that want very high cost handsets and full feature and using this as the top of the line to attract while they sell off their embedded base, which is on the 3G legacy type networks. So we are cutting new ground. The good news is that what we're looking at is standardization worldwide on a single technology and we firmly believe that the manufacturers out there that are working with us season opportunity to gain volume and leadership early because they know there's going to be a tremendous experience curve, cost-reduction with this technology. So we think that in a nutshell, the big guys are going to the very high cost handsets. I think this will be a premium service into the near future, certainly to '13 and maybe beyond so that we expect that this is going to be a space that we can occupy, not just by ourselves but the focus here is much different than what we see in the handset manufacturers market looking at the kind of full feature phones we have versus the very stylish, very, very high end phones and you can see them in that but not displace in tablets that are going to go through future iPhones. You are going to see that Galaxy type displays that are going to go into further Galaxy lines and it's just going left versus going right and we see this space as being an opportunity for us, not an impediment."

In the meantime, as I mentioned the near-term alternative is to focus on basically the LTE network where we can quote manufacturer capacity whereby we simply can't do that except to further densify our network on CDMA. So we do have the opportunity, it is densification but it's different. I think the microwave backhaul, which will take us from 2012 into 2013 to complete will be a key element because you can almost always get power but you can't always get backhaul capabilities.

First quarter is normally the strongest sales quarter for the year for the no Contract segment. However, our net gains and EBITDA in the first quarter 2012 significantly underperformed expectations. The combinations of uncertainty in the",711,"Thank you, Keith. First quarter is normally the strongest sales quarter for the year for the no Contract segment. However, our net gains and EBITDA in the first quarter 2012 significantly underperformed expectations. The combinations of uncertainty in the economy and growing competition in 3G data service makes our early investment initiatives in 4G LTE that much more important. 
Anticipating more competition in 3G data service, as well as continued economic headwinds, we elected in the first quarter to emphasize handset promotions that broadly appeal to individuals, not just family plan subscribers that was offered in the first quarter of 2011. The result was a large proportion of existing subscribers upgrading their handsets. Consequently the increase in upgrade retention expense created additional EBITDA pressure in the first quarter of 2012 of approximately $70 million.
First quarter operations provided a clearer picture regarding the significant demand for high-speed data services. Whilst considerable softness existed in the CDMA data service segment of our business, our 4G LTE subscribers nearly doubled in the first quarter. This occurred in spite of the average price of handsets approached $300 and equally important, churn for the 4G LTE segment is now at the 2% level. 
With these facts in mind, we intend to focus on operating margins and free cash flow over subscriber growth until we can mainstream our LTE for all initiatives with affordable handsets later this year. We believe the acceleration of 4G LTE adoption in the U.S. will rapidly drive lower smartphone cost and higher volume. As handset designs standardized on the iPhone, touchscreen and substrate design, product differentiation will be accomplished by screen size, resolution and processing power, enabling cost reduction that can be substantial. 
We expect full-featured affordable handsets with 3.5-inch to 4-inch screens will become available on the second half of 2012 in the sub-$150 retail range. We believe that demand will be ARPU accretive, given the high percentage of our customers electing the $50, $60 and $70 rate plans. There's no question that smartphone data consumption characterizes wireless service opportunities and challenges going forward. Speed does matter, and with our 4G LTE network targeted for system-wide completion by third quarter, the challenge is to effectively manage all network traffic such that the spectrum refarming can occur at the earliest practical time. 
With smartphone momentum, network capacity requirements bring focus on technology, as well as spectrum resources. The opportunity to expand capacity on 4G LTE networks is orders of magnitude utilizing picocells within macro cells whereby capacity can be approved by multiples of 3x, 4x or more times. We continue to see spectrum opportunities, but enhancing network capacity through technology gains presents a cost effective, nearer-term alternative. 
Once our microwave backhaul network is in place and fully operational, we expect a significant cost reduction improvement relative to fiber and T1 circuits. Microwave backhaul is key for data throughput and future cost-effective implementation of picocells. High-speed data at low latency is a key driver for user satisfaction, but so is the expanded menu of rich communication services or RCS that will serve to differentiate our premium 4G LTE services from our competitors' 3G data services. 
RCS supports simultaneous voice communication with multimedia messaging linking presence with address book contacts and more by the end of 2012. Our objective continues to be providing our subscribers with a premium postpaid service experience on a no-contract basis. 4G LTE service is not only about high-speed data service, but also about the menu of services that it can support.
Beginning the fall of 2012, we intend to move in the high gear with our marketing initiatives that focus on 4G LTE handsets and services to extend our wireless leadership as the best deal in town. Affordable handsets is our key to our LTE for all initiatives and several of these handsets are currently in our labs for acceptance testing. 
Our objectives are clear: prioritize operating margins and free cash flow over subscriber growth until we have affordable 4G LTE handsets later this year; two, capitalize on our 4G LTE for all initiatives and begin to introduce multi-capable handsets later in the second half of the year to begin refarming spectrum; and finally, build network capacity for future growth. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to focus my comments on 3 areas. First quarter 2012 results discussed the drivers impacting these results and lastly, review our roadmap going forward. Clearly, the first quarter 2012 was challenging",933,"Thanks, Roger. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to focus my comments on 3 areas. First quarter 2012 results discussed the drivers impacting these results and lastly, review our roadmap going forward. Clearly, the first quarter 2012 was challenging from a growth and profitability perspective and results were below expectations.
Regarding first quarter 2012 results. Our first quarter promotional investments primarily consisting of instant rebates or mail-in rebates generated just over $1 million gross additions during the first quarter. Consistent with lower gross addition activity in the quarter, we recorded net subscriber additions of approximately 132,000.
Although our sales activity was muted, we did see retentive benefits from our promotions as our base continued to upgrade their handsets during the quarter. During the quarter, the transition of our customer base is important as mature users now benefit from our new handset selection and remained loyal to our brand. We believe this loyalty continues to show itself in positive net promoter scores that demonstrate the true viral nature and impact of our service in the communities that we operate in.
As a result of this operated activity, churn for the quarter was at an all-time low for the company at 3.1%. Low churn was driven in part by the over 1.5 million upgrades recorded during the quarter, which represented 16% of our customer base. Our increased upgrade expenses, primarily driven by handset promotions, contributed to higher cost in the quarter. Our customer base continues to demand the experience afforded by a smartphone. At the end of the first quarter, approximately 46% of all subscribers are on a smartphone plan, up from roughly 1/3 at the end of 2011.
Looking at upgrade activity. 76% of all upgrades ended up on a rate plan of $50 or higher. Additionally, 46% of the upgrades during the quarter were feature phone users that migrated upward to a smartphone. 
Progress that impacted the first quarter. Our strategy continues to focus on offering customers the best deal in town with taxes and regulatory fees included in our service plan pricing. We believe there are a number of factors as to why we saw a decrease in gross additions in the first quarter of 2012.
We believe factors include overall competition, delayed tax refunds and end-users' desire for high-speed data. Looking at the quarter, we saw some competitive 3G data offerings in the postpaid and MB&O spaces that put pressure on our acquisition model. As you may recall on the fourth quarter of 2011 call, we spoke about the delay in tax refunds. We did not know how this delay would impact the quarter, but it appears that the delay led to consumers using their refunds for other more immediate needs as discrete fund delay dynamic disrupted purchasing cycles that we have seen in past years.
Finally, since introducing Android smartphones in the late 2010, we have placed the majority of our smartphones on our CDMA network. Speed has become an increasing part of a customer's buying decision and consequently, the speed and superior experience of our 4G LTE network is compelling and a driver of new customer acquisition. In order to provide our customers with a high-speed data experience they expect, we need to provide handsets at an affordable cost that drives new user adoption.
Looking at our operational roadmap going forward, we are focused on completing the build of our 4G LTE network. At the end of the first quarter, we have built approximately 80% of our total footprint covering roughly 9,500 cell sites. We anticipate covering our full CDMA footprint with 3G LTE-based stations by third quarter of 2012. 
With network speed and coverage quality gaining importance as consumers now differentiate between service providers, network backhaul becomes critical to the user experience. We have invested in and are implementing microwave backhaul in dense urban poor. This delivery will allow for the increased use of data. By deploying microwave backhaul, we will be able to take advantage of lower cost, highly targeted small cell deployments, which will be added to the network for capacity offload. 
We anticipate first wave of affordable 4G LTE smartphones to be introduced prior to the back-to-school season. Given a near-term roadmap to affordable 4G LTE smartphones, our short-term reliance on CDMA smartphones for new customer acquisition will diminish during the second half of 2012. Currently, Samsung, LG, Huawei, ZTE and other manufacturers are developing low-cost handset solutions that will hopefully retail in the sub-$150 range as our 4G LTE for all campaign gets into full swing. 
In preparation for 4G LTE smartphones becoming widely available, we recently announced the change in our pricing to our 4G LTE service plans. This change helps build the foundation for the second half of 2012. We currently offer the nation's most affordable 4G LTE service for as low as $40 a month. All plans still offer unlimited talk and text. With these data tiers, consumers have greater control, allowing them to select the data plan that meets their needs. 
We are the only wireless service provider to offer a no contract unlimited 4G LTE plan, $70 a month with taxes and fees included. With a challenging quarter behind us, we believe the industry is transitioning to high-speed data delivery and we are well on our way to a full 4G LTE deployment. We remain focused and believe our unique distribution model, no contract, tax and regulatory fee inclusive service plans and near-term 4G LTE smartphone roadmap, we can successfully work to meet our long-term goal of balancing growth with profitability. Now I'll turn the call over to Braxton."

Good morning. Our first quarter results were challenging. We ended the quarter with 132,000 net additions and currently serve approximately 9.5 million total subscribers, an increase of 7% from the first quarter of 2011 and up 57% over the past 3 years.
We have a very strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity with approximately $2.2 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. We believe this liquidity positions us very well for future strategic opportunities, including spectrum acquisitions. We continue to evaluate various options to enhance our current spectrum holders. We believe further investment in spectrum will significantly reduce future CapEx will have a positive impact on free cash flows and further leverage our 4G LTE investment. 
Our total leverage as of March 31, 2012 was approximately 3.6x computed in accordance with the indentures governing our senior notes. We believe our maturity schedule is very manageable with our first substantial maturity of approximately $1 billion coming due in November 2016. Our weighted average cost of debt for the first quarter was 5.9%. The majority of our debt is fixed by its nature or through interest rate swaps. Clearly, we believe we are very well-positioned from a balance sheet perspective.
Churn for the quarter was 3.1%, and matches the lowest reported churn in company history. First quarter churn was down 60 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 and was flat when compared to the first quarter of 2011. The sequential decline in churn we believe was primarily driven by a continued investment in our network, aggressive retention programs and normal seasonal trends. 
Our first quarter 2012 ARPU is $40.56, up $0.14 on a year-over-year basis, and flat with the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to continued demand for RALs and 4G LTE service plans, offset by an increase in family plan penetration from 35% of our customer base as of March 31, 2011, to 44% of our customer base as of March 31, 2012. 
Also impacting ARPU this quarter was the addition of family plan subscribers heavily-weighted to the back end of the fourth quarter of 2011. For the first quarter, our CPGA was $235, up $78 over the first quarter of 2011. This increase is primarily driven by increased promotional activities and lower gross additions as compared to the 3 months ended March 31, 2011.
Our CPU for the quarter was $22.87 as compared to $19.79 in the prior year's first quarter. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the increase in retention expense for existing customers, cost associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade and roaming expenses with Metro USA. During the quarter, we experienced $7.13 in CPU directly related to handset upgrades compared to $4.60 in the prior year's first quarter. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $262 million, a decrease of 8% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 22.6%. Over the trailing 12-month period, adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.3 billion. I'd now like to highlight a few items from the income statement and cash flow statement. 
In the first quarter our service revenue and cost of service grew 10% and 14% respectively, to approximately $1.2 billion and $389 million, respectively over the same quarter in 2011. The increases are primarily due to growth in our subscriber base. We generated $137 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter. We generated $21 million in consolidated net income during the first quarter, or $0.06 per share. 
We incurred capital expenditures of $144 million during the quarter. We reaffirm our 4-year 2012 guidance for capital expenditures of $900 million to $1 billion. Now we'll move to Q&A. Operator?"

The primary promotion in the second quarter is a $25 talk and text plan. That does have a very different dynamic when it comes to acquisition cost. More importantly, you saw the key driver on our miss this quarter was about $70 million of incremental upgrade expense as compared to the prior year. The $25 plan, we think is very high from an MPV basis. There's no data, there's no web access, it's a talk and text plan and we think it -- from a promotional standpoint, it's the right thing for us to do during the second quarter. It will obviously be somewhat of a drag on ARPU, but Tom talked about the substantial uptick that we're seeing in our new LTE rate plans, the new pricing that we did on that, so we hope to execute it fairly neutral ARPU during the next quarter."

We have the spectrum, so we want to make sure we address that, so our backhaul is suitable for the maximum downlink speeds available to us. So we see a tremendous a lift in terms of capacity. The issue will be is, to get our phone service that is LTE handsets sufficiently embedded in our base, so we can take advantage of the refarming that would be a possible to us in 2013 for the VoLTE-capable handsets to use up that, shall we say, displace that capacity in CDMA.

Sec",303,"Phil, that's a fair question. I think there were several factors impacting it. First of all, there was a very large volume differential between what we thought we were going to achieve from a gross addition standpoint versus what we actually achieved. Secondly, the mix of handsets and remember there were different pricing schemes within the handsets before we had an MIR and the actual mix of what's sold was different than we've assumed. The take rates on mail-in rebates were higher than we initially had indicated. I think the final factor is that the brand advertising that we put out in the market, we did try to increase that in the first quarter, and that definitely also had an impact. Really looking forward, we've talked about packing off the handset subsidies, but -- you also have the numerator denominator effect and there are a lot of fixed cost within CPGA, and to the extent that you have lower gross additions, you're not getting the scale and you do ultimately drive a higher CPGA and that certainly should be the expectation given the gross adds and the statement that we're going to focus on, cash flows and profitability versus growth. I think the final comment, Phil, is when you look at the change year-over-year, it really wasn't about the acquisition. We did spend incremental subsidy on the gross adds that came in, but the volume drop pretty much offset that. The real change from the possibility and the trajectory that we had over a year ago was in fact, near the upgrades and we've give you very specific cost per user. I'll point you to the supplemental deck where we have highlighted historically what our upgrade costs were and you can do the math on it, but that's really where the issue was."

There'll be a $30 to $40 plus differential between what we can buy on CDMA Android versus LTE. I think the issue is that the attractiveness of the service is so very, very powerful and what we've had to do in the first quarter is really to make up for this speed deficit, if you will, in the LTE versus the CDMA phones -- smartphones that we've been selling. So I think that we have a non -- shall we say first quarter will not carry over into the second half. There is no need for that and we don't intend to do it and we intend to be very much selective.

That is that, the focus that we're finding in the 4G world, we were early into this business, we saw as the opportunity. We didn't want to spend another $1 billion on a complete 3G network. We felt that we can leapfrog to 4G and now that possibility is coming very, very evident to us. So the thought is that, we're early in the leadership, we work with some of the handset manufacturers now for 2, almost, I would say 2.5 years. There is a broad differential between the people moving up to the contract space that want very high cost handsets and full feature and they're using this as the top of the line to attract while they sell off their embedded base, which is on the 3G legacy type networks. So we are cutting new ground. The good news is that, what we're looking at is standardization worldwide on a single technology and we firmly believe that the manufacturers out there, they're working with us, seizes an opportunity to gain volume and leadership early because they know there's going to be a tremendous experience curve, cost-reduction with this technology. So we think that in a nutshell, the big guys are going for the very high cost handsets. I think this will be a premium service into the near future, certainly the '13 and maybe beyond, so that we expect that this is going to be a space that we can occupy, not just by ourselves, but the focus here is much different than what we see in the handset manufacturers market looking at the kind of full feature phones we have versus the very stylish, very, very high end phones and you can see them in the retina displays, in tablets which are going to go into future iPhones. You're going to see the Galaxy type displays that are going to go into further Galaxy lines and it's just a going left versus going right and we see this space as being an opportunity for us, not an impediment."

In the meantime, as I mentioned, the near-term alternative is to focus on basically the LTE network where we can quote manufacturer capacity whereby we simply can't do that except to further densify our network on CDMA. So we do have the opportunity, it is densification, but it's different. I think the microwave backhaul, which will take us from 2012 into 2013 to complete will be a key element because you can almost always get power, but you can't always get backhaul capabilities.

31463,183351167,290174,"MetroPCS Communications, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","MetroPCS Communications, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Keith.

The combination of uncertainty in the",708,"Thank you, Keith. First quarter is normally the strongest sales quarter for the year for the No Contract segment. However, our net gains and EBITDA in the first quarter 2012 significantly underperformed expectations. The combination of uncertainty in the economy and growing competition in 3G data service makes our early investment initiatives in 4G LTE that much more important. 
Anticipating more competition in 3G data service, as well as continued economic headwinds, we elected in the first quarter to emphasize handset promotions that broadly appeal to individuals, not just family plan subscribers, that was offered in the first quarter of 2011. The result was a large proportion of existing subscribers upgraded their handsets. Consequently the increase in upgrade retention expense created additional EBITDA pressure in the first quarter of 2012 of approximately $70 million.
First quarter operations provided a clearer picture regarding the significant demand for high-speed data services. Whereas considerable softness existed in the CDMA data service segment of our business, our 4G LTE subscribers nearly doubled in the first quarter. This occurred in spite of the average price of handsets approached $300, and equally important, churn for the 4G LTE segment is now at the 2% level. 
With these facts in mind, we intend to focus on operating margins and free cash flow over subscriber growth until we can mainstream our LTE for all initiatives with affordable handsets later this year. We believe the acceleration of 4G LTE adoption in the U.S. will rapidly drive lower smartphone cost and higher volume. As handset designs standardize on the iPhone, touchscreen and substrate design, product differentiation will be accomplished by screen size, resolution and processing power, enabling cost reduction that can be substantial. 
We expect full-featured affordable handsets with 3.5-inch to 4-inch screens will become available in the second half of 2012 in the sub-$150 retail range. We believe that demand will be ARPU accretive, given the high percentage of our customers electing the $50, $60 and $70 rate plans. There's no question that smartphone data consumption characterizes wireless service opportunities and challenges going forward. Speed does matter, and with our 4G LTE network targeted for system-wide completion by third quarter, the challenge is to effectively manage all network traffic such that the spectrum refarming can occur at the earliest practical time. 
With smartphone momentum, network capacity requirements bring focus on technology, as well as spectrum resources. The opportunity to expand capacity on 4G LTE networks is orders of magnitude utilizing picocells within macro cells whereby capacity can be approved by multiples of 3x, 4x or more times. We continue to seek spectrum opportunities, but enhancing network capacity through technology gains presents a cost-effective, nearer-term alternative. 
Once our microwave backhaul network is in place and fully operational, we expect a significant cost reduction improvement relative to fiber and T1 circuits. Microwave backhaul is key for data throughput and future cost-effective implementation of picocells. High-speed data at low latency is a key driver for user satisfaction, but so is the expanded menu of rich communication services, or RCS, that will serve to differentiate our premium 4G LTE services from our competitors' 3G data services. 
RCS supports simultaneous voice communication with multimedia messaging linking presence with address book contacts and more by the end of 2012. Our objective continues to be providing our subscribers with a premium postpaid service experience on a no-contract basis. 4G LTE service is not only about high-speed data service but also about the menu of services that it can support.
Beginning the fall of 2012, we intend to move into high gear with our marketing initiatives that focus on 4G LTE handsets and services to extend our wireless leadership as the best deal in town. Affordable handsets are key to our LTE for All initiatives, and several of these handsets are currently in our labs for acceptance testing. 
Our objectives are clear: Prioritize operating margins and free cash flow over subscriber growth until we have affordable 4G LTE handsets later this year; two, capitalize on our 4G LTE for all initiatives and begin to introduce multi-capable handsets later in the second half of the year to begin refarming spectrum; and finally, build network capacity for future growth. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

First quarter 2012 results, discuss the drivers impacting these results, and lastly, review our roadmap going forward. Clearly, the first quarter of 2012 was challenging from a growth and profitability perspective, and results were below expectations.
Regarding first quarter 2012 results. Our first quarter promotional investments, primarily consisting of instant rebates or mail-in rebates, generated just over $1 million gross additions during the first quarter. Consistent with lower gross addition activity in the quarter, we recorded net subscriber additions of approximately 132,000.
Although our sales activity was muted, we did see retentive benefits from our promotions as our base continued to upgrade their handsets during the quarter. During the quarter, the transition of our customer base is important as mature users now benefit from our new handset selection and remain loyal to our brand. We believe this loyalty continues to show itself in positive net promoter scores that demonstrate the true viral nature and impact of our service in the communities that we operate in.
As a result of this operated activity, churn for the quarter was at an all-time low for the company at 3.1%. Low churn was driven in part by the over 1.5 million upgrades recorded during the quarter, which represented 16% of our customer base. Our increased upgrade expenses, primarily driven by handset promotions, contributed to higher cost in the quarter. Our customer base continues to demand the experience afforded by a smartphone. At the end of the first quarter, approximately 46% of all subscribers are on a smartphone plan, up from roughly 1/3 at the end of 2011.
Looking at upgrade activity. 76% of all upgrades ended up on a rate plan of $50 or higher. Additionally, 46% of the upgrades during the quarter were feature phone users that migrated upward to a smartphone. 
Progress that impacted the first quarter. Our strategy continues to focus on offering customers the best deal in town with all taxes and regulatory fees included in our service plan pricing. We believe there are a number of factors as to why we saw a decrease in gross additions in the first quarter of 2012.
We believe factors include overall competition, delayed tax refunds and end-users' desire for high-speed data. Looking at the quarter, we saw some competitive 3G data offerings in the postpaid and MB&O spaces that put pressure on our acquisition model. As you may recall, on the fourth quarter of 2011 call, we spoke about the delay in tax refunds. We did not know how this delay would impact the quarter, but it appears that the delay led to consumers using their refunds for other, more immediate needs as discrete fund delay dynamic disrupted purchasing cycles that we have seen in past years.
Finally, since introducing Android smartphones in the late 2010, we have placed the majority of our smartphones on our CDMA network. Speed has become an increasing part of a customer's buying decision, and consequently, the speed and superior experience of our 4G LTE network is compelling and a driver of new customer acquisition. In order to provide our customers with the high-speed data experience they expect, we need to provide handsets at an affordable cost that drives new user adoption.
Looking at our operational roadmap going forward, we are focused on completing the build of our 4G LTE network. At the end of the first quarter, we have built approximately 80% of our total footprint covering roughly 9,500 cell sites. We anticipate covering our full CDMA footprint with 3G LTE-based stations by third quarter of 2012. 
With network speed and coverage quality gaining importance as consumers now differentiate between service providers, network backhaul becomes critical to the user experience. We have invested in and are implementing microwave backhaul in dense urban poor [ph]. This delivery will allow for the increased use of data. By deploying microwave backhaul, we will be able to take advantage of lower cost, highly targeted small cell deployments, which will be added to the network for capacity offloads. 
We anticipate first wave of affordable 4G LTE smartphones to be introduced prior to the back-to-school season. Given a near-term roadmap to affordable 4G LTE smartphones, our short-term reliance on CDMA smartphones for new customer acquisition will diminish during the second half of 2012. Currently, Samsung, LG, Huawei, ZTE and other manufacturers are developing low-cost handset solutions that will hopefully retail in the sub-$150 range as our 4G LTE for all campaign gets into full swing. 
In preparation for 4G LTE smartphones becoming widely available, we recently announced the change in our pricing to our 4G LTE service plans. This change helps build the foundation for the second half of 2012. We currently offer the nation's most affordable 4G LTE service for as low as $40 a month. All plans still offer unlimited talk and text. With these data tiers, consumers have greater control, allowing them to select the data plan that meets their needs. 
We are the only wireless service provider to offer a no-contract, unlimited 4G LTE plan, $70 a month with taxes and fees included. With a challenging quarter behind us, we believe the industry is transitioning to high-speed data delivery, and we are well on our way to a full 4G LTE deployment. We remain focused and believe our unique distribution model, no contract, tax and regulatory fee inclusive service plans and near-term 4G LTE smartphone roadmap, we can successfully work to meet our long-term goal of balancing growth with profitability. Now I'll turn the call over to Braxton."

Good morning. Our first quarter results were challenging. We ended the quarter with 132,000 net additions and currently serve approximately 9.5 million total subscribers, an increase of 7% from the first quarter of 2011 and up 57% over the past 3 years.
We have a very strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity with approximately $2.2 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. We believe this liquidity positions us very well for future strategic opportunities, including spectrum acquisitions. We continue to evaluate various options to enhance our current spectrum holdings. We believe further investment in spectrum will significantly reduce future CapEx, will have a positive impact on free cash flows and further leverage our 4G LTE investment. 
Our total leverage as of March 31, 2012, was approximately 3.6x computed in accordance with the indentures governing our senior notes. We believe our maturity schedule is very manageable with our first substantial maturity of approximately $1 billion coming due in November 2016. Our weighted average cost of debt for the first quarter was 5.9%. The majority of our debt is fixed by its nature or through interest rate swaps. Clearly, we believe we are very well-positioned from a balance sheet perspective.
Churn for the quarter was 3.1% and matches the lowest reported churn in company history. First quarter churn was down 60 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 and was flat when compared to the first quarter of 2011. The sequential decline in churn we believe was primarily driven by a continued investment in our network, aggressive retention programs and normal seasonal trends. 
Our first quarter 2012 ARPU was $40.56, up $0.14 on a year-over-year basis and flat with the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to continued demand for RALs and 4G LTE service plans, offset by an increase in family plan penetration from 35% of our customer base as of March 31, 2011, to 44% of our customer base as of March 31, 2012. 
Also impacting ARPU this quarter was the addition of family plan subscribers heavily-weighted to the back end of the fourth quarter of 2011. For the first quarter, our CPGA was $235, up $78 over the first quarter of 2011. This increase was primarily driven by increased promotional activities and lower gross additions as compared to the 3 months ended March 31, 2011.
Our CPU for the quarter was $22.87 as compared to $19.79 in the prior year's first quarter. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the increase in retention expense for existing customers, costs associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade and roaming expenses with Metro USA. During the quarter, we experienced $7.13 in CPU directly related to handset upgrades compared to $4.60 in the prior year's first quarter. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $262 million, a decrease of 8% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 22.6%. Over the trailing 12-month period, adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.3 billion. 
I'd now like to highlight a few items from the income statement and cash flow statement. In the first quarter, our service revenue and cost of service grew 10% and 14% respectively to approximately $1.2 billion and $389 million, respectively, over the same quarter in 2011. The increases are primarily due to growth in our subscriber base. We generated $137 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter. We generated $21 million in consolidated net income during the first quarter, or $0.06 per share. 
We incurred capital expenditures of $144 million during the quarter. We reaffirm our 4-year 2012 guidance for capital expenditures of $900 million to $1 billion. Now we'll move to Q&A. Operator?"

The primary promotion in the second quarter is a $25 talk and text plan. That does have a very different dynamic when it comes to acquisition cost. More importantly, you saw the key driver on our miss this quarter was about $70 million of incremental upgrade expense as compared to the prior year. The $25 plan, we think is very high from an MPV basis. There's no data, there's no web access; it's a talk and text plan, and we think it, from a promotional standpoint, is the right thing for us to do during the second quarter. It will obviously be somewhat of a drag on ARPU, but Tom talked about the substantial uptick that we're seeing in our new LTE rate plans, the new pricing that we did on that, so we hope to execute a fairly neutral ARPU during the next quarter."

But we can keep those customers on the network, give them the level of expectation to the best we can, as we transition the network to a full 4G LTE services and work on giving our customers what they've asked for over the long haul, and that's really good high-speed data."

And then thirdly, just in terms of your strategy, it totally makes sense to manage the business for margin and cash flow while you wait for 3G -- for cost-effective LTE handsets to become available. What was the thinking around this quarter, though, where it seems like you pushed handset subsidies dramatically and still didn't get doors swinging. I guess my concern is, we saw subsidies go up so much and still didn't see incremental demand. What would gross adds have been like if you hadn't incurred that level of cost to drive demand, or were your assets just very unproductive this quarter?"

As we stated, we would have certainly liked to see more people, new customers, come through the door, but as we talked about in the beginning of March, we had a delayed tax season. I think we spoke about at the end of the fourth -- of our last call, and that delay gave us uncertainty into the latter part of the quarter, which is always a really heavy acquisition timeframe, so all the numbers got distorted by not having the same gross additions as we had in years prior."

We've now provided fiber to a large majority of our sites in the core. We will be implementing microwave to take over because of cost benefits. Microwave is repriced by the $100 a foot on the dish side, so we could see very low fixed cost. We have the spectrum, so we want to make sure we address that so our backhaul is suitable for the maximum downlink speeds available to us. So we see a tremendous a lift in terms of capacity. The issue will be, is to get our phone service, that is, LTE handsets, sufficiently embedded in our base so we can take advantage of the refarming that would be a possible to us in 2013 for the VoLTE-capable handsets to use up that, shall we say, displace that capacity in CDMA. The fact is that we have, I think, a great opportunity in making that move. This is not an easy task, but the budget this year is meant to give us that foundation so we have the densification we need and also the extensive deployment of LTE system-wide."

Sec",304,"Phil, that's a fair question. I think there were several factors impacting it. First of all, there was a very large volume differential between what we thought we were going to achieve from a gross addition standpoint versus what we actually achieved. Secondly, the mix of handsets, and remember, there were different pricing schemes within the handsets before we had an MIR, and the actual mix of what sold was different than what we've assumed. The take rates on the mail-in rebates were higher than we initially had indicated. I think the final factor is that the brand advertising that we put out in the market, we did try to increase that in the first quarter, and that definitely also had an impact. Really looking forward, we've talked about packing off the handset subsidies, but -- you also have the numerator-denominator effect, and there are a lot of fixed cost within CPGA, and to the extent that you have lower gross additions, you're not getting the scale, and you do ultimately drive a higher CPGA, and that certainly should be the expectation given the gross adds and the statement that we're going to focus on, cash flows and profitability versus growth. I think the final comment, Phil, is when you look at the change year-over-year, it really wasn't about the acquisition. We did spend incremental subsidy on the gross adds that came in, but the volume drop pretty much offset that. The real change from the profitability and the trajectory that we had over a year ago was, in fact, near the upgrades, and we've given you very specific costs per user. I'll point you to the supplemental deck where we have highlighted historically what our upgrade costs were, and you can do the math on it, but that's really where the issue was."

I think the issue is that the attractiveness of the service is so very, very powerful, and what we've had to do in the first quarter is really to make up for this speed deficit, if you will, in the LTE versus the CDMA phones -- smartphones that we've been selling.

We felt that we can leapfrog to 4G, and now that possibility is coming very, very evident to us. So the thought is that, we're early in the leadership, and we've worked with some of the handset manufacturers now for 2, almost, I would say 2.5 years. There is a broad differential between the people moving up to the contract space that want very high-cost handsets and full feature and they're using this as the top of the line to attract while they sell off their embedded base, which is on the 3G legacy type networks. So we are cutting new ground. The good news is that what we're looking at is standardization worldwide on a single technology, and we firmly believe that the manufacturers out there that are working with us see this as an opportunity to gain volume and leadership early because they know there's going to be a tremendous experience curve, cost reduction with this technology. So we think that in a nutshell, the big guys are going for the very high-cost handsets. I think this will be a premium service into the near future, certainly the '13 and maybe beyond, so that we expect that this is going to be a space that we can occupy, not just by ourselves, but the focus here is much different than what we see in the handset manufacturers market looking at the kind of full-feature phones we have versus the very stylish, very, very high-end phones, and you can see them in the retina displays, in tablets, which are going to go into future iPhones. You're going to see the Galaxy-type displays that are going to go into further Galaxy lines, and it's just a going left versus going right, and we see this space as being an opportunity for us, not an impediment."

And I think the answer is, we're going to do our very, global best to find out, but the fact is that if spectrum becomes available, given the fact that we have raised considerable funds that we have earmarked for the possibilities of acquiring such spectrum, that certainly we're open to that. In the meantime, as I mentioned, the near-term alternative is to focus on basically the LTE network where we can quote manufacturer capacity, whereby we simply can't do that except to further densify our network on CDMA. So we do have the opportunity; it is densification, but it's different. I think the microwave backhaul, which will take us from 2012 into 2013 to complete, will be a key element because you can almost always get power, but you can't always get backhaul capability. So our focus is basically on the technology side while we go hunting for a spectrum at cost we can afford."

31463,183351167,291953,"MetroPCS Communications, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","MetroPCS Communications, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Keith. First quarter is normally the strongest sales quarter for the year for the No Contract segment. However, our net gains and EBITDA in the first quarter 2012 significantly underperformed expectations. The combination of uncertainty in the",708,"Thank you, Keith. First quarter is normally the strongest sales quarter for the year for the No Contract segment. However, our net gains and EBITDA in the first quarter 2012 significantly underperformed expectations. The combination of uncertainty in the economy and growing competition in 3G data service makes our early investment initiatives in 4G LTE that much more important. 
Anticipating more competition in 3G data service, as well as continued economic headwinds, we elected in the first quarter to emphasize handset promotions that broadly appeal to individuals, not just family plan subscribers, that was offered in the first quarter of 2011. The result was a large proportion of existing subscribers upgraded their handsets. Consequently the increase in upgrade retention expense created additional EBITDA pressure in the first quarter of 2012 of approximately $70 million.
First quarter operations provided a clearer picture regarding the significant demand for high-speed data services. Whereas considerable softness existed in the CDMA data service segment of our business, our 4G LTE subscribers nearly doubled in the first quarter. This occurred in spite of the average price of handsets approached $300, and equally important, churn for the 4G LTE segment is now at the 2% level. 
With these facts in mind, we intend to focus on operating margins and free cash flow over subscriber growth until we can mainstream our LTE for all initiatives with affordable handsets later this year. We believe the acceleration of 4G LTE adoption in the U.S. will rapidly drive lower smartphone cost and higher volume. As handset designs standardize on the iPhone, touchscreen and substrate design, product differentiation will be accomplished by screen size, resolution and processing power, enabling cost reduction that can be substantial. 
We expect full-featured affordable handsets with 3.5-inch to 4-inch screens will become available in the second half of 2012 in the sub-$150 retail range. We believe that demand will be ARPU accretive, given the high percentage of our customers electing the $50, $60 and $70 rate plans. There's no question that smartphone data consumption characterizes wireless service opportunities and challenges going forward. Speed does matter, and with our 4G LTE network targeted for system-wide completion by third quarter, the challenge is to effectively manage all network traffic such that the spectrum refarming can occur at the earliest practical time. 
With smartphone momentum, network capacity requirements bring focus on technology, as well as spectrum resources. The opportunity to expand capacity on 4G LTE networks is orders of magnitude utilizing picocells within macro cells whereby capacity can be approved by multiples of 3x, 4x or more times. We continue to seek spectrum opportunities, but enhancing network capacity through technology gains presents a cost-effective, nearer-term alternative. 
Once our microwave backhaul network is in place and fully operational, we expect a significant cost reduction improvement relative to fiber and T1 circuits. Microwave backhaul is key for data throughput and future cost-effective implementation of picocells. High-speed data at low latency is a key driver for user satisfaction, but so is the expanded menu of rich communication services, or RCS, that will serve to differentiate our premium 4G LTE services from our competitors' 3G data services. 
RCS supports simultaneous voice communication with multimedia messaging linking presence with address book contacts and more by the end of 2012. Our objective continues to be providing our subscribers with a premium postpaid service experience on a no-contract basis. 4G LTE service is not only about high-speed data service but also about the menu of services that it can support.
Beginning the fall of 2012, we intend to move into high gear with our marketing initiatives that focus on 4G LTE handsets and services to extend our wireless leadership as the best deal in town. Affordable handsets are key to our LTE for All initiatives, and several of these handsets are currently in our labs for acceptance testing. 
Our objectives are clear: Prioritize operating margins and free cash flow over subscriber growth until we have affordable 4G LTE handsets later this year; two, capitalize on our 4G LTE for all initiatives and begin to introduce multi-capable handsets later in the second half of the year to begin refarming spectrum; and finally, build network capacity for future growth. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

First quarter 2012 results, discuss the drivers impacting these results, and lastly, review our roadmap going forward. Clearly, the first quarter of 2012 was challenging from a growth and profitability perspective, and results were below expectations.
Regarding first quarter 2012 results. Our first quarter promotional investments, primarily consisting of instant rebates or mail-in rebates, generated just over $1 million gross additions during the first quarter. Consistent with lower gross addition activity in the quarter, we recorded net subscriber additions of approximately 132,000.
Although our sales activity was muted, we did see retentive benefits from our promotions as our base continued to upgrade their handsets during the quarter. During the quarter, the transition of our customer base is important as mature users now benefit from our new handset selection and remain loyal to our brand. We believe this loyalty continues to show itself in positive net promoter scores that demonstrate the true viral nature and impact of our service in the communities that we operate in.
As a result of this operated activity, churn for the quarter was at an all-time low for the company at 3.1%. Low churn was driven in part by the over 1.5 million upgrades recorded during the quarter, which represented 16% of our customer base. Our increased upgrade expenses, primarily driven by handset promotions, contributed to higher cost in the quarter. Our customer base continues to demand the experience afforded by a smartphone. At the end of the first quarter, approximately 46% of all subscribers are on a smartphone plan, up from roughly 1/3 at the end of 2011.
Looking at upgrade activity. 76% of all upgrades ended up on a rate plan of $50 or higher. Additionally, 46% of the upgrades during the quarter were feature phone users that migrated upward to a smartphone. 
Progress that impacted the first quarter. Our strategy continues to focus on offering customers the best deal in town with all taxes and regulatory fees included in our service plan pricing. We believe there are a number of factors as to why we saw a decrease in gross additions in the first quarter of 2012.
We believe factors include overall competition, delayed tax refunds and end-users' desire for high-speed data. Looking at the quarter, we saw some competitive 3G data offerings in the postpaid and MB&O spaces that put pressure on our acquisition model. As you may recall, on the fourth quarter of 2011 call, we spoke about the delay in tax refunds. We did not know how this delay would impact the quarter, but it appears that the delay led to consumers using their refunds for other, more immediate needs as discrete fund delay dynamic disrupted purchasing cycles that we have seen in past years.
Finally, since introducing Android smartphones in the late 2010, we have placed the majority of our smartphones on our CDMA network. Speed has become an increasing part of a customer's buying decision, and consequently, the speed and superior experience of our 4G LTE network is compelling and a driver of new customer acquisition. In order to provide our customers with the high-speed data experience they expect, we need to provide handsets at an affordable cost that drives new user adoption.
Looking at our operational roadmap going forward, we are focused on completing the build of our 4G LTE network. At the end of the first quarter, we have built approximately 80% of our total footprint covering roughly 9,500 cell sites. We anticipate covering our full CDMA footprint with 3G LTE-based stations by third quarter of 2012. 
With network speed and coverage quality gaining importance as consumers now differentiate between service providers, network backhaul becomes critical to the user experience. We have invested in and are implementing microwave backhaul in dense urban poor [ph]. This delivery will allow for the increased use of data. By deploying microwave backhaul, we will be able to take advantage of lower cost, highly targeted small cell deployments, which will be added to the network for capacity offloads. 
We anticipate first wave of affordable 4G LTE smartphones to be introduced prior to the back-to-school season. Given a near-term roadmap to affordable 4G LTE smartphones, our short-term reliance on CDMA smartphones for new customer acquisition will diminish during the second half of 2012. Currently, Samsung, LG, Huawei, ZTE and other manufacturers are developing low-cost handset solutions that will hopefully retail in the sub-$150 range as our 4G LTE for all campaign gets into full swing. 
In preparation for 4G LTE smartphones becoming widely available, we recently announced the change in our pricing to our 4G LTE service plans. This change helps build the foundation for the second half of 2012. We currently offer the nation's most affordable 4G LTE service for as low as $40 a month. All plans still offer unlimited talk and text. With these data tiers, consumers have greater control, allowing them to select the data plan that meets their needs. 
We are the only wireless service provider to offer a no-contract, unlimited 4G LTE plan, $70 a month with taxes and fees included. With a challenging quarter behind us, we believe the industry is transitioning to high-speed data delivery, and we are well on our way to a full 4G LTE deployment. We remain focused and believe our unique distribution model, no contract, tax and regulatory fee inclusive service plans and near-term 4G LTE smartphone roadmap, we can successfully work to meet our long-term goal of balancing growth with profitability. Now I'll turn the call over to Braxton."

Good morning. Our first quarter results were challenging. We ended the quarter with 132,000 net additions and currently serve approximately 9.5 million total subscribers, an increase of 7% from the first quarter of 2011 and up 57% over the past 3 years.
We have a very strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity with approximately $2.2 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. We believe this liquidity positions us very well for future strategic opportunities, including spectrum acquisitions. We continue to evaluate various options to enhance our current spectrum holdings. We believe further investment in spectrum will significantly reduce future CapEx, will have a positive impact on free cash flows and further leverage our 4G LTE investment. 
Our total leverage as of March 31, 2012, was approximately 3.6x computed in accordance with the indentures governing our senior notes. We believe our maturity schedule is very manageable with our first substantial maturity of approximately $1 billion coming due in November 2016. Our weighted average cost of debt for the first quarter was 5.9%. The majority of our debt is fixed by its nature or through interest rate swaps. Clearly, we believe we are very well-positioned from a balance sheet perspective.
Churn for the quarter was 3.1% and matches the lowest reported churn in company history. First quarter churn was down 60 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 and was flat when compared to the first quarter of 2011. The sequential decline in churn we believe was primarily driven by a continued investment in our network, aggressive retention programs and normal seasonal trends. 
Our first quarter 2012 ARPU was $40.56, up $0.14 on a year-over-year basis and flat with the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to continued demand for RALs and 4G LTE service plans, offset by an increase in family plan penetration from 35% of our customer base as of March 31, 2011, to 44% of our customer base as of March 31, 2012. 
Also impacting ARPU this quarter was the addition of family plan subscribers heavily-weighted to the back end of the fourth quarter of 2011. For the first quarter, our CPGA was $235, up $78 over the first quarter of 2011. This increase was primarily driven by increased promotional activities and lower gross additions as compared to the 3 months ended March 31, 2011.
Our CPU for the quarter was $22.87 as compared to $19.79 in the prior year's first quarter. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the increase in retention expense for existing customers, costs associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade and roaming expenses with Metro USA. During the quarter, we experienced $7.13 in CPU directly related to handset upgrades compared to $4.60 in the prior year's first quarter. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $262 million, a decrease of 8% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 22.6%. Over the trailing 12-month period, adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.3 billion. 
I'd now like to highlight a few items from the income statement and cash flow statement. In the first quarter, our service revenue and cost of service grew 10% and 14% respectively to approximately $1.2 billion and $389 million, respectively, over the same quarter in 2011. The increases are primarily due to growth in our subscriber base. We generated $137 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter. We generated $21 million in consolidated net income during the first quarter, or $0.06 per share. 
We incurred capital expenditures of $144 million during the quarter. We reaffirm our 4-year 2012 guidance for capital expenditures of $900 million to $1 billion. Now we'll move to Q&A. Operator?"

The primary promotion in the second quarter is a $25 talk and text plan. That does have a very different dynamic when it comes to acquisition cost. More importantly, you saw the key driver on our miss this quarter was about $70 million of incremental upgrade expense as compared to the prior year. The $25 plan, we think is very high from an MPV basis. There's no data, there's no web access; it's a talk and text plan, and we think it, from a promotional standpoint, is the right thing for us to do during the second quarter.

What was the thinking around this quarter, though, where it seems like you pushed handset subsidies dramatically and still didn't get doors swinging.

We've now provided fiber to a large majority of our sites in the core. We will be implementing microwave to take over because of cost benefits. Microwave is repriced by the $100 a foot on the dish side, so we could see very low fixed cost. We have the spectrum, so we want to make sure we address that so our backhaul is suitable for the maximum downlink speeds available to us. So we see a tremendous a lift in terms of capacity. The issue will be, is to get our phone service, that is, LTE handsets, sufficiently embedded in our base so we can take advantage of the refarming that would be a possible to us in 2013 for the VoLTE-capable handsets to use up that, shall we say, displace that capacity in CDMA.

Sec",304,"Phil, that's a fair question. I think there were several factors impacting it. First of all, there was a very large volume differential between what we thought we were going to achieve from a gross addition standpoint versus what we actually achieved. Secondly, the mix of handsets, and remember, there were different pricing schemes within the handsets before we had an MIR, and the actual mix of what sold was different than what we've assumed. The take rates on the mail-in rebates were higher than we initially had indicated. I think the final factor is that the brand advertising that we put out in the market, we did try to increase that in the first quarter, and that definitely also had an impact. Really looking forward, we've talked about packing off the handset subsidies, but -- you also have the numerator-denominator effect, and there are a lot of fixed cost within CPGA, and to the extent that you have lower gross additions, you're not getting the scale, and you do ultimately drive a higher CPGA, and that certainly should be the expectation given the gross adds and the statement that we're going to focus on, cash flows and profitability versus growth. I think the final comment, Phil, is when you look at the change year-over-year, it really wasn't about the acquisition. We did spend incremental subsidy on the gross adds that came in, but the volume drop pretty much offset that. The real change from the profitability and the trajectory that we had over a year ago was, in fact, near the upgrades, and we've given you very specific costs per user. I'll point you to the supplemental deck where we have highlighted historically what our upgrade costs were, and you can do the math on it, but that's really where the issue was."

That is that, the focus that we're finding in the 4G world, we were early into this business, we saw it as the opportunity. We didn't want to spend another $1 billion on a complete 3G network. We felt that we can leapfrog to 4G, and now that possibility is coming very, very evident to us. So the thought is that, we're early in the leadership, and we've worked with some of the handset manufacturers now for 2, almost, I would say 2.5 years. There is a broad differential between the people moving up to the contract space that want very high-cost handsets and full feature and they're using this as the top of the line to attract while they sell off their embedded base, which is on the 3G legacy type networks. So we are cutting new ground. The good news is that what we're looking at is standardization worldwide on a single technology, and we firmly believe that the manufacturers out there that are working with us see this as an opportunity to gain volume and leadership early because they know there's going to be a tremendous experience curve, cost reduction with this technology. So we think that in a nutshell, the big guys are going for the very high-cost handsets. I think this will be a premium service into the near future, certainly the '13 and maybe beyond, so that we expect that this is going to be a space that we can occupy, not just by ourselves, but the focus here is much different than what we see in the handset manufacturers market looking at the kind of full-feature phones we have versus the very stylish, very, very high-end phones, and you can see them in the retina displays, in tablets, which are going to go into future iPhones. You're going to see the Galaxy-type displays that are going to go into further Galaxy lines, and it's just a going left versus going right, and we see this space as being an opportunity for us, not an impediment."

In the meantime, as I mentioned, the near-term alternative is to focus on basically the LTE network where we can quote manufacturer capacity, whereby we simply can't do that except to further densify our network on CDMA. So we do have the opportunity; it is densification, but it's different. I think the microwave backhaul, which will take us from 2012 into 2013 to complete, will be a key element because you can almost always get power, but you can't always get backhaul capability.

With this focus,",586,"Thank you, Keith. The exciting transition towards 4G LTE is close at hand. As we stated on our first quarter call, during the second and third quarters, we would focus on operating margins and enhancing cash flows over subscriber growth. With this focus, I am pleased to report both the highest part of the adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margins in history. Our revolution began at MetroPCS in 2010 with a proliferation of smartphones. Now only 2.5 years later, the revolution continues as 4G LTE is about to transform the wireless experience for the no contract segment. At the end of the third quarter, affordable 4G LTE handsets will be available and we will be very near completion of our 4G LTE network build-out with over 97% of all our POPs covered.  With these 2 elements of our next generation business complete, we can rapidly accelerate our 4G LTE for all initiatives. 
We have been the best deal in town in the voice-centric world, and we are aiming to the best deal in town in this evolving data-centric world, taxes the regulatory fees included of course. With over leading position in 4G LTE, we have an advanced network fully operational that is more advanced than so many others in the wireless industry. Worldwide production driving the experience curve is rapidly moving 4G LTE standardization chipset and handsets design that will be the lower yield cost in the future. This should drive lower cost to reduce handsets subsidies and help manage CPGA costs in the future years. 
Furthermore, we are taking steps in the network to ensure that we can support our business growth with our current spectrum holdings. However, we continue to look at spectrum acquisition opportunities for the most cost-effective approach to meet our capacity requirements. By the end of the year, most of our markets will be 4G LTE ready with the 5 by 5 megahertz channel bandwidth. We are also industry leader in deployment of VoLTE cable handsets, since VoLTE is foundational to refarm CDMA spectrum for LTE service. During the third quarter, we plan to introduce the first VoLTE-enabled handset. We decided to introduce VoLTE additional handsets this year to further capitalize the benefits of this technology and prepare for reforming spectrum. 
We're also focused on developing and deploying rich communication services or RCS this year, which supports simultaneous voice communication with -- multimedia messaging as well as other advanced data services. RCS will further differentiate premium 4G LTE services from competitors for 3G data services. Once launched, for the first time, MetroPCS customers with RCS will love the feature set available to them that has previously only been available to postpaid writers. We will offer this to our subscribers with an unmatched value. Accounts with RCS enables us to significantly distance ourselves from MVNOs and other service providers, which do not offer such services. 
Our objectives are clear. We will capitalize in our 4G LTE For All initiative when it is ready, and move towards VoLTE later in 2012 and 2013. With our move towards VoLTE, we've been able to migrate customers off our CDMA network and on to our more efficient 4G LTE network. This migration, combined with other initiatives such as microwave backhaul, will provide us with the capacity to need for plan subscriber growth. With affordable 4G LTE smartphones and an advanced 4G LTE network, we believe we are well positioned to drive revenue growth and earnings performance in the future. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I want to focus my comments today on our need to transition the business to 4G LTE services. Our second quarter results as well as provide an update on our 4G LTE For All initiatives, our transition from 3G to 4G LTE. The industry continues to be challenging and competitive. With that being said, the global movement towards 4G LTE is clear and is happening now. The handset ecosystem for 4G LTE continues to develop and during this transition, the best way for MetroPCS to manage the business is to balance growth, retention, ARPU, rapid expansion and EBITDA. We believe the company needs to grow its subscriber base over the long term. By focusing on our 4G LTE services, we will be able to differentiate our product offerings and return the company to its legacy of subscriber growth. 
While in this current transition period, we are managing the business to generate adjusted EBITDA while preparing for the launch of 4G LTE For All later in the third quarter. Throughout the quarter, we focused on generating EBITDA versus subscriber growth. With lower handset subsidies and moderated marketing spend throughout the second quarter, both upgrades and gross additions declined on a year-over-year and on a sequential basis. In the the second quarter, gross additions totaled 781,000, down 38% year-over-year. As expected, upgrade activity also declined in the quarter coming in at 9% of total subscribers, compared to 13% in the second quarter of 2011 and 16% in the first quarter of 2012. As you can see in our supplemental slide deck, upgrade cost this quarter accounted for $3.06 of CPU versus $3.73 in the second quarter of 2011 and $7.13 in the first quarter of 2012.  With lower gross additions, combined with continued investments in our network, we managed churn to 3.4% for the second quarter. 
During the quarter, approximately 50% of what we sold was a smartphone. And at the end of the quarter, 47% of all subscribers were on a smartphone plan. At the end of the second quarter, 42% of subscribers were on family plans. 
During the quarter, we were on a $25 unlimited talk and text plan. We believe this plan addresses the need of a specific demographic of customers and have been pleased with the uptake on this promotion. From a network utilization standpoint, the talk and text plan uses a significantly less capacity on our network than a typical data smartphones customer. Moving into the third quarter, we are continuing the $25 talk and text promotion. 
The evolution of 4G LTE. We anticipate that is more affordable 4G LTE smartphones become available to our customers, our 4G LTE network will be ready to handle their data requirements. At the end of the second quarter, we are nearing completion, having built approximately 90% of our total footprint with 4G LTE, up from 80% at the end of the first quarter. We continue to expect additional 4G LTE smartphones to become available throughout the remainder of the year. We are working closely with various OEMs and plan to introduce 4G LTE smartphones in the $99 to $149 price range in late August. We believe that in addition to the various 4G LTE smartphones at the $149 level, we will launch additional smartphones at various price points during the remainder of the year.  Importantly, we will also introduce multi-capable smartphones as well as a DTV smartphone later this year. 
When we approach the fourth year of this year, we plan to have 4G LTE For All in full swing. With a lightning fast 4G LTE network, we believe it will be an exciting holiday season with existing 3G Android customers having the ability to upgrade to 4G LTE service, and we hope to expand our subscriber base by being the only facilities-based no-contract provider selling 4G LTE service in the United States. A combination of the 4G LTE network, feature yet low-cost devices and service plans that offer unparalleled value, will be the drivers of our 4G LTE For All promotions that will be kicked off later in the third quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Braxton."

Our second quarter results demonstrate the ability of our business to generate significant cash. With lower promotional activity during the second quarter, we generate both the higher adjusted EBITDA in company history and also",772,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning. Our second quarter results demonstrate the ability of our business to generate significant cash. With lower promotional activity during the second quarter, we generate both the higher adjusted EBITDA in company history and also the highest consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins company history at 41%. We ended the quarter with approximately 9.3 million total subscribers, an increase of 2% from the second quarter of 2011 and up 49% over the past 3 years. Churn for the quarter was 3.4%, down 50 basis points when compared to the second quarter of 2011. This decline in churn was primarily driven by continued investment in our network and lower year-to-date subscriber growth. 
Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we have substantial liquidity, with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. We believe this liquidity positions us very well for future strategic opportunities including spectrum acquisitions.
We continue to evaluate various options to enhance our current spectrum holdings. We believe further investment spectrum will significantly reduce future CapEx, will have a positive impact on free cash flow and further leverage our 4G LTE investment. Our total leverage as of June 30, 2012, was approximately 3.3x, computed in accordance with the indentures governing our senior notes. We believe our maturity schedule is very manageable with our first substantial maturity of approximately $1 billion coming due in 2016. Our weighted average cost of debt for the second quarter was 5.8%. The majority of our debt is fixed by its nature through interest rate swaps. We believe we are very well positioned from a balance sheet perspective.
Our second quarter 2012 ARPU was $40.62, up $0.13 on a year-over-year basis and up $0.06 in the first quarter of 2012. The year-over-year increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to continued demand for our wireless and 4G LTE service plans, offset by promotional service plans and an increase in family plan penetration from 38% of our customer base as of June 30, 2011, to 42% of our customer base as of June 30, 2012. For the second quarter, our CPGA was $191, up $13 over the second quarter of 2011. This increase is primarily driven by lower gross additions, partially offset by decreased promotional activities as compared to the 3 months ended June 30, 2011. On a sequential basis, CPGA declined $45 primarily due to less promotional handset activity. With the introduction of 4G LTE For All in late third quarter and during the fourth quarter, we do not expect the traditional decrease in fourth quarter CPGA off from second and third quarter levels. 
Our CPU for the quarter was $18.40 as compared to $18.94 in the prior year second quarter. This year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by decrease from retention expense for existing customers, as well as a decrease of long-distance cost of taxes and regulatory. These items were partially offset by an increase in costs associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade and roaming expenses associated with Metro USA. During the quarter, we experienced $3.06 in CPU directly related to handset upgrades, compared to $3.73 in the prior year second quarter and compared to $7.13 from the first quarter of 2012.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $477 million, an increase of 33% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 41.1%. Over the first half of 2012, we have generated over $739 million in adjusted EBITDA compared to $643 million in the first half of 2011, representing an increase of 15%. With the launch of 4G LTE For All late in the third quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to decrease sequentially as a result from lower subscribers, promotional activities, higher upgrades, which will press for CPU and higher CPGA. 
I'd now like to highlight a -- few items on the income statement and cash flow statement. In the second quarter, our service revenue and cost of service grew 4% and 1% respectively to approximately $1.2 billion and $368 million respectively over the same quarter from 2011. The increases are primarily due to the growth of our subscriber base over the second quarter of 2011. We generated $320 million in cash from operating activities in the second quarter. We generated $149 million in consolidated net income during the second quarter or $0.41 per share. We incurred capital expenditures of $182 million during the second quarter. Over the first 6 months of 2012, we spent a total of $326 million in capital expenditures. We reaffirmed our full year 2012 guidance for capital expenditures of $900 million to $1 billion.

So we see parity in terms of handsets will be I think is certainly in the hunt on download speeds will be on those, which we would think necessarily for the main services our customers want, which are highly focused towards YouTube and Pandora and applications as such. So we think we have is a very substantial service. It's much superior to most 3G services excluding those that concatenate the frequencies to get the plus. And download speeds, once minimum is reached, I think the service satisfaction is up exponentially. So we hope to have the -- with the handsets being affordable and in the general region what you can buy the 3G phones for, that's one element. The other element is we will be building and introducing later this year what I mentioned is the RCS platform or our move to IMS, which I think will bring about the very substantial change, which is really I guess a phrase an ability for our customers to share life experiences. They can call and simultaneously send videos or still images or determine presence on their phonebook or for that matter, enhanced messaging service. So we think we will have a full set of services that have not been present for the no contract segment."

The good news is that in the last 5 months of the year, we'll be introducing what looks like between 6 and 7 LTE handsets, which will give our consumers much greater choice. And as we mentioned, we'll have some of those handsets between the $99 and $149 range as we introduce the LTE for All program.

But with the lack of spectrum, we will need to continue working on the capacity of our network, and we don't see a catalyst for any significant decreases in CapEx.

I think in due course, they will go away. I think it remains a more distant option for us. Clearly, the spectrum is valuable if interference from broadcasters could be eliminated in a predictable way. At this point, the FCC has lifted up to arm's-length agreements and everybody seems to have short arms. So going on to the Clearwire, there is definite spectrum there and as you know, the 2.5 gigahertz is slightly less effective in terms of range. In fact, it's conservatively short on range, still would be very useful for companies like ourselves which operate principally in the larger markets where we have more dense conditions. The real other side of the issue of course is the time division, which is probably the only possible way of using the spectrum, and TD LTE is still in its experimental phases. And So there is time and of market questions there. But as far as spectrum, all spectrum can be used and we like all spectrum. The problem is what point in time can it be commercialized. So as far as other spectrum goes, the Verizon transaction and AWS that was announced several weeks ago, they are pretty clear about that. There always are some trading opportunities. Certainly, we look forward to that to the extent they exist. But as you mentioned, offer that lease spectrum from Clearwire, that is -- I think the option that's sitting out there is not the desired option from our standpoint because at the end of the day, I think it's a high-cost option. But nevertheless, there may be an option. With our focus is what I indicated that we're intensifying our networks. We're getting to what we think is an important and critical part of getting the full 10MHz bandwidth be available for LTE and use that as a platform for reaffirming efforts. We think it's getting very efficient. We'll be improving the network, making sure that we have -- in some places we'll have quad poles, which gives us a very strong forward and substantial uplink. We'll be converting them to my mobile where we think it makes sense in many of our locations. And probably most importantly that we've acquired microwave backhaul spectrum in all our markets, and we have a major program which is now factored into our 2012 even though we'll go into 2013 first half, the CapEx for significant capacity on backhaul. And that has the cost application, cost reduction implication, operating cost that is, as well as capacity implication because you can't get more out of the forward link then you can truck away on the backhaul side. So we think all of the initiatives gives us a very strong opportunity to grow our business, and the game of having spectrum is as you know, a very difficult one. So we'll be very opportunistic."

And we're excited that we have approximately 8% of our customers on the LTE network, but we're still nowhere near the scale on the investment that there. So we do feel a lot of opportunity. I think what's surprising me a little bit is even as cost efficient as we are, we are constantly striving to do things better and to provide more efficiencies in our operations. During the quarter, we first quarter, we implemented some innovative solutions in our long distance area, both from international standpoint and domestic standpoint, that drove some costs out of providing long-distance services in the business. We're very, very focused on taxes and regulatory fees because remember, when less tax regulatory fee inclusive with Wireless for All, those items had a significant impact on us, and it's through a lot of hard work we were able to provide some efficiencies in that area.

I think there, our focus continues to be not the cross-platform business, which iPad, notebooks, iPhones, et cetera, but more singly on the smartphone itself. And today, we don't have -- we don't see a great deal in the end-to-end business for us. That could change and we are exploring that -- so my point I guess is that I would expect that we could stabilize and get some lift in ARPU as we move towards more towards an LTE service company.

So we have, I think, an adequate service. If we can add additional spectrum, of course that can grow dramatically. On test trials here in Dallas. We have 20 megahertz we've tested on or a 10x10, we've had speeds that are not average. Because I've quoted average speeds, but we've we're achieved speeds that up to 80 megahertz -- megabits. So there is tremendous speed available with the proper configuration, and I think the growth here is going to be very important over time. So average speeds would be roughly 2x of that, a bit higher than 2x. So I think the capacity will be here. We were very focused on and getting our network teed up so that we can go to our refarming without the need of having to have additional spectrum, which I think with the possible exception of 1 or 2 markets, we will achieve by first quarter of next year. LTE roaming, I think part of that is we do have under discussion now with parties LTE roaming agreements. As was noted in the prior discussion, Clearwire is interested in transactions because as they move to LTE system assuming that they can accomplish that. So I think we will have LTE partners in the future.

So number two, Roger spoke about the prospect of offering a premium service and possibly seeing some of their plans being cannibalized as that something you'll have to look at and see if that's the right way to proceed on their side. But what we look at from our customers that is they've always been attractive just by handset value, by service and support. I think the support we now bring within LTE network, we've yet to be able to read bring them the price for LTE handsets that we will at the beginning of the fourth quarter into third. So we think that those 2 things are somewhat bifurcated? Yes, there's going to be more competition in the prepaid segment because that's where some of the growth is going to recur as the economy stays where it is and potential customers not to have any commitment for 24 months. So we think for the first time ever, we're going to be able to market our products and services in the no contract segment with premium devices at a value price with service plans that will be unmatched; and at the same time be able to get our messaging locally and in media all wrapped around one consistent theme, that the network is for 4G LTE and the services that are provided are no contract taxes and fees inclusive. So we think we have some separation between the 2, and it might also help the segment grow as more people look into the prepaid segment of the house as opposed to postpaid contracts."

We have been the best deal in town in the voice-centric world, and we are aiming to the best deal in town in this evolving data-centric world, taxes the regulatory fees included, of course. With over leading position in 4G LTE, we have an advanced network, fully operational, that is more advanced than many others in the wireless industry. Worldwide production, driving the experience curve, is rapidly moving 4G LTE standardization in chipsets and handsets design that will lead to lower unit cost in the future. This should drive lower cost to reduce handsets subsidies and help manage CPGA costs in future years.
Furthermore, we are taking steps in the network to ensure that we can support our business growth with our current spectrum holdings. However, we continue to look at spectrum acquisition opportunities for the most cost-effective approach to meet our capacity requirements. By the end of the year, most of our markets will be 4G LTE ready with a 5x5 megahertz channel bandwidth. We are also an industry leader in deployment of VoLTE cable handsets, since VoLTE servers is foundational to reform CDMA spectrum for LTE service. During the third quarter, we plan on introducing the first VoLTE-enabled handset. We decided to introduce VoLTE additional handsets this year to further capitalize on the benefits of this technology and prepare for reforming spectrum.
We also are focused on developing and deploying rich communication services, or RCS, this year, which supports simultaneous voice communication with media -- multimedia messaging as well as other advanced data services. RCS will further differentiate premium 4G LTE services from competitors' 3G data services. Once launched, for the first time, MetroPCS customers with RCS will have a feature set available to them that has previously only been available to postpaid subscribers. We will offer this to our subscribers at an unmatched value. Consequently, RCS enables us to significantly distance ourselves from MVNOs and other service providers, which do not offer such services.
Our objectives are clear. We will capitalize on our 4G LTE For All initiative when it is ready, and move towards VoLTE later in 2012 and 2013. With our move towards VoLTE, we've been able to migrate customers off our CDMA network and on to our more efficient 4G LTE network. This migration, combined with other initiatives such as microwave backhaul, will provide us with capacity needed for plan subscriber growth. With affordable 4G LTE smartphones and an advanced 4G LTE network, we believe we'll be well positioned to drive revenue growth and earnings performance in the future. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I want to focus my comments today on our need to transition the business to 4G LTE services, our second quarter results as well as provide an update on our 4G LTE For All initiatives, our transition from 3G to 4G",695,"Thank you, Roger. Good morning, everyone. I want to focus my comments today on our need to transition the business to 4G LTE services, our second quarter results as well as provide an update on our 4G LTE For All initiatives, our transition from 3G to 4G LTE. The industry continues to be challenging and competitive. With that being said, the global movement towards 4G LTE is clear and it's happening now. The handset ecosystem for 4G LTE continues to develop and during this transition, the best way for MetroPCS to manage the business is to balance growth, retention, ARPU, brand expansion and EBITDA. We believe the company needs to grow its subscriber base over the long term. By focusing on our 4G LTE services, we will be able to differentiate our product offerings and return the company to its legacy of subscriber growth.
While in this current transition period, we are managing the business to generate adjusted EBITDA while preparing for the launch of 4G LTE For All later in the third quarter. Throughout the quarter, we focused on generating EBITDA versus subscriber growth. With lower handset subsidies and moderated marketing spend throughout the second quarter, both upgrades and gross additions declined on a year-over-year and on a sequential basis. In the second quarter, gross additions totaled 781,000, down 38% year-over-year. As expected, upgrade activity also declined in the quarter coming in at 9% of total subscribers, compared to 13% in the second quarter of 2011 and 16% in the first quarter of 2012. As you can see in our supplemental slide deck, upgrade cost this quarter accounted for $3.06 of CPU versus $3.73 in the second quarter of 2011, and $7.13 in the first quarter of 2012.  With lower gross additions, combined with continued investments in our network, we managed churn to 3.4% for the second quarter.
During the quarter, approximately 50% of what we sold was a smartphone. And at the end of the quarter, 47% of all subscribers were on a smartphone plan. At the end of the second quarter, 42% of subscribers were on family plans.
During the quarter, we were on a $25 unlimited talk and text plan. We believe this plan addresses the need of a specific demographic of customers and have been pleased with the uptake on this promotion. From a network utilization standpoint, the talk and text plan uses a significantly less capacity on our network than a typical data-intensive smartphone customer. Moving into the third quarter, we are continuing the $25 talk and text promotion.
The evolution of 4G LTE. We anticipate that as more affordable 4G LTE smartphones become available to our customers, our 4G LTE network will be ready to handle their data requirements. At the end of the second quarter, we are nearing completion, having built approximately 90% of our total footprint with 4G LTE, up from 80% at the end of the first quarter. We continue to expect additional 4G LTE smartphones to become available throughout the remainder of the year. We are working closely with various OEMs and plan to introduce 4G LTE smartphones in the $99 to $149 price range in late August. We believe that in addition to the various 4G LTE smartphones at the $149 level, we will launch additional smartphones at various price points during the remainder of the year. Importantly, we will also introduce multi-capable smartphones as well as a DTV smartphone later this year.
When we approach the fourth quarter of this year, we plan to have 4G LTE For All in full swing. With a lightning-fast 4G LTE network, we believe it will be an exciting holiday season, with existing 3G Android customers having the ability to upgrade to 4G LTE service, and we hope to expand our subscriber base by being the only facilities-based no-contract provider selling 4G LTE service in the United States. The combination of a 4G LTE network, full feature yet low-cost devices and service plans that offer unparalleled value, will be the drivers of our 4G LTE For All promotion that will be kicked off later in the third quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Braxton."

Our second quarter results demonstrate the ability of our business to generate significant cash. With lower promotional activity during the second quarter, we generated both the highest adjusted EBITDA in company history and also the highest consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins in company history at 41%. We ended the quarter with approximately 9.3 million total subscribers, an increase of 2% from the second quarter 2011, and up 49% over the past 3 years. Churn for the quarter was 3.4%, down 50 basis points when compared to the second quarter of 2011. This decline in churn was primarily driven by continued investments in our network and lower year-to-date subscriber growth.
Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we have substantial liquidity, with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. We believe this liquidity positions us very well for future strategic opportunities including spectrum acquisitions.
We continue to evaluate various options to enhance our current spectrum holdings. We believe further investment spectrum will significantly reduce future CapEx, will have a positive impact on free cash flows and further leverage our 4G LTE investment. Our total leverage as of June 30, 2012, was approximately 3.3x, computed in accordance with the indentures governing our senior notes. We believe our maturity schedule is very manageable with our first substantial maturity of approximately $1 billion coming due in 2016. Our weighted average cost of debt for the second quarter was 5.8%. The majority of our debt is fixed by its nature or through interest rate swaps. We believe we are very well positioned from a balance sheet perspective.
Our second quarter 2012 ARPU was $40.62, up $0.13 on a year-over-year basis, and up $0.06 from the first quarter of 2012. The year-over-year increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to the continued demand for our Wireless For All and 4G LTE service plans, offset by promotional service plans and an increase in family plan penetration from 38% of our customer base as of June 30, 2011, to 42% of our customer base as of June 30, 2012. For the second quarter, our CPGA was $191, up $13 over the second quarter of 2011. This increase is primarily driven by lower gross additions, partially offset by decreased promotional activities, as compared to the 3 months ended June 30, 2011. On a sequential basis, CPGA declined $45, primarily due to less promotional handset activity. With the introduction of 4G LTE For All in late third quarter and during the fourth quarter, we do not expect the traditional decrease in fourth quarter CPGA off from second and third quarter levels.
Our CPU for the quarter was $18.40 as compared to $18.94 in the prior-year second quarter. This year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in retention expense for existing customers, as well as a decrease of long-distance cost and taxes and regulatory fees. These items were partially offset by the increase in costs associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade and roaming expenses associated with Metro USA. During the quarter, we experienced $3.06 in CPU directly related to handset upgrades, compared to $3.73 in the prior-year second quarter, and compared to $7.13 from the first quarter of 2012.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $477 million, an increase of 33% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 41.1%. Over the first half of 2012, we have generated over $739 million in adjusted EBITDA compared to $643 million in the first half of 2011, representing an increase of 15%. With the launch of 4G LTE For All late in the third quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to decrease sequentially as a result from lower subscribers, promotional activities, higher upgrades, which will press for CPU and higher CPGA.
I'd now like to highlight a fewer -- a few items on the income statement and cash flow statement. In the second quarter, our service revenue and cost of service grew 4% and 1%, respectively, to approximately $1.2 billion and $368 million, respectively, over the same quarter from 2011. The increases are primarily due to the growth of our subscriber base over the second quarter of 2011. We generated $320 million in cash from operating activities in the second quarter. We generated $149 million in consolidated net income during the second quarter or $0.41 per share. We incurred capital expenditures of $182 million during the second quarter. Over the first 6 months of 2012, we have spent a total of $326 million in capital expenditures. We reaffirm our full-year 2012 guidance for capital expenditures of $900 million to $1 billion.

The key for us is the service that is expected and handsets that are capable of delivering that, we think will be met with our third quarter beginning -- or late third quarter, as I should say, beginning introduction which we feel will be impacting fourth quarter. So we see parity in terms of handsets. We'll be, I think, and certainly, in the hunt on download speeds well beyond those which we would think necessary for the main services our customers want, which are highly focused towards YouTube and Pandora and applications as such. So we think we have a very substantial service. It's much superior to most 3G services, excluding those that concatenate the frequencies to get the HSPA+. And download speeds, once minimum is reached, I think the service satisfaction is up exponentially. So we hope to have the -- with the handsets being affordable and in the general region what you can buy the 3G phone sets for, that's one element. The other element is we will be building and introducing later this year the, what I mentioned is the RCS platform or our move to IMS, which I think will bring about a very substantial change, which is really, I guess in a phrase, an ability for our customers to share life experiences. They can call and simultaneously send videos or still images, or determine presence on their phonebook or for that matter, enhanced messaging service. So we think we will have the full set of services that have not been present for the no-contract segment."

The good news is that in the last 5 months of the year, we'll be introducing what looks like between 6 and 7 LTE handsets, which would give our consumers much greater choice. And as we mentioned, we'll have some of those handsets between the $99 and $149 range, as we introduce the LTE For All program.

And you've also heard us talk in previous calls about our microwave backhaul initiative, which was really key and very efficient from a cost standpoint. Really looking forward -- as we've talked about in the past, it's dependent on do we really get additional spectrum and the level of subscriber growth. We do plan on returning to our legacy of subscriber growth with really what customers are looking for, which is more high-speed broadband services on which 4G LTE is very well positioned in the prepaid space. But with the lack of spectrum, we will need to continue working on the capacity of our network, and we don't see a catalyst for any significant decreases in CapEx.

And then are there any other sort of opportunities on the spectrum front out there that we're not thinking about?"

I think there's substantial difficulties yet with the 700 block. I think in due course, they will go away. I think it remains a more distant option for us. Clearly, the spectrum is valuable if interference from broadcasters could be eliminated in a predictable way. At this point, the FCC has lifted up to arm's-length agreements and everybody seems to have short arms. So going on to the Clearwire, there is definite spectrum there and as you know, the 2.5 gigahertz is slightly less effective in terms of range. In fact, it's conservatively short on range, still would be very useful for companies like ourselves, which operate principally in the larger markets where we have more dense conditions. The real other side of the issue of course is the time division, which is probably the only practical way of using the spectrum. And TD LTE is still in its experimental phases, and so there's kind of market questions there. But as far as spectrum, all spectrum can be used and we like all spectrum. The problem is at what point in time can it be commercialized. So as far as other spectrum goes, the Verizon transaction and AWS that was announced several weeks ago, made it pretty clear about that. There always are some trading opportunities. Certainly, we'll look forward to that to the extent they exist. But as you mentioned, the Leap offer that leases spectrum from Clearwire, that is -- I think the option that's sitting out there is not the desired option from our standpoint because at the end of the day, I think it's a high-cost option. But nevertheless, that may be an option. Where our focus is on, is what I indicated that we're densifying our networks. We're getting to what we think is an important and critical part of getting the full 10MHz bandwidth be applicable for LTE and use that as a platform for our reforming effort. We think it can be made very efficient. We will be improving the network, making sure that we have -- in some places we'll have quad poles, which gives us a very strong forward and substantial uplink. We'll be converting to MIMO, where we think that makes sense in many of our locations. And probably most importantly, that we have required microwave backhaul spectrum in all of our markets, and we have a major program which is now factored in our 2012 even though we'll go into 2013 first half, the CapEx for significant capacity on backhaul. And that has both the cost implication, cost reduction implication, operating cost that is, as well as capacity implication because you can't get more out of the forward link than you can truck away on the backhaul side. So we think all of those initiatives gives us a very strong opportunity to grow our business, and the game of having spectrum is as you know, a very difficult one. So we'll be very opportunistic."

But right now it's very clear, data is dominating. And we think that the cost, once we have microwave backhaul fully employed in 2013, can have a significant moderation to what we experience today. The question I guess that's raised is when that, shall we say, tipping point where we're actually reducing our CDMA base significantly so that we can get back and really use that spectrum for LTE. That will have an important implication, because the more spectrum we put into the LTE, and the more efficient our operating performance becomes."

And Tom commented that we went from 80% of our footprint to 90% of our footprint. Obviously we're adding more backhaul in interconnect getting ready for 4G LTE For All. If you look at the commentary that we have in our MD&A, there are continued costs related to the network. And we're excited that we have approximately 8% of our customers on the LTE network, but we're still nowhere near the scale on the investment that's there. So we do see a lot of opportunity. I think what's surprising me a little bit is even as cost efficient as we are, we are constantly striving to do things better and to provide more efficiencies in our operations. During the quarter, we in place -- first quarter, we implemented some innovative solutions in our long distance area, both from an international standpoint and domestic standpoint, that drove some costs out of providing long-distance services in the business. We're very, very focused on taxes and regulatory fees because remember, when we went tax regulatory fee inclusive with Wireless For All, those items had a significant impact on us, and through a lot of hard work we were able to provide some efficiencies in that area. So that offsets some of the traditional pressure you would have expected as we increase our footprint on 4G LTE. So that's the way that I'd like at it. And of course, we continue to look at cost control and other ways to drive efficiencies in the business."

So we have, I think, an adequate service. If we can add additional spectrum, of course, that can grow dramatically. On test trials here in Dallas, where we have 20 megahertz where we've tested on, or a 10x10, we've had speeds that are not average. Because I've quoted average speeds, but we've achieved speeds up to 80 megahertz -- megabits. So that there is tremendous speed possibilities available with the proper antenna configuration, and I think the growth here is going to be very important over time. So average speeds would be roughly 2x of that, a bit higher than 2x. So I think the capacity will be here. We'll work -- very focus on is getting our network teed up so that we can go to our reforming without the need of having to have additional spectrum, which I think with the possible exception of 1 or 2 markets, we will achieve by first quarter of next year. LTE roaming, I think part of that is we do have under discussion now with parties in LTE roaming agreements. As you've -- as was noted in the prior discussion, Clearwire is interested in transactions because as they move to an LTE system, assuming that they can accomplish that. So I think we will have LTE partners in the future.

I think the support we now bring within LTE network, we've yet to be able to really bring them the price for LTE handsets that we will at the beginning of the fourth quarter, end of the third. So we think that those 2 things are somewhat bifurcated. Yes, there's going to be more competition in the prepaid segment because that's where some of the growth is going to recur as the economy stays where it is and potential customers look not to have any commitment for 24 months. So we think for the first time ever, we're going to be able to market our products and services in the no-contract segment with premium devices at a value price, with service plans that will be unmatched. And at the same time be able to get our messaging locally and in media all wrapped around one consistent theme, that the network is full 4G LTE and the services that are provided are no-contract, taxes and fees inclusive.

With this focus,",585,"Thank you, Keith. The exciting transition towards 4G LTE is close at hand. As we stated on our first quarter call, during the second and third quarters, we would focus on operating margins and enhancing cash flows over subscriber growth. With this focus, I am pleased to report both the highest quarterly  adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margins in company history. A revolution began at MetroPCS in 2010 with the proliferation of smartphones. Now only 2.5 years later, the revolution continues as 4G LTE is about to transform the wireless experience for the no-contract segment. At the end of the third quarter, affordable 4G LTE handsets will be available and we'll be very near completion of our 4G LTE network build-out with over 97% of all our POPs covered. With these 2 elements of our next generation business complete, we can rapidly accelerate our 4G LTE For All initiatives.
We have been the best deal in town in the voice-centric world, and we are aiming to be the best deal in town in this evolving data-centric world, taxes and regulatory fees included, of course. With our leading position in 4G LTE, we have an advanced network, fully operational, that is more advanced than many others in the wireless industry. Worldwide production, driving the experience curve, is rapidly moving 4G LTE standardization in chipsets and handsets design that will lead to lower unit cost in the future. This should drive lower cost to reduce handsets subsidies and help manage CPGA costs in future years.
Furthermore, we are taking steps in the network to ensure that we can support our business growth with our current spectrum holdings. However, we continue to look at spectrum acquisition opportunities for the most cost-effective approach to meet our capacity requirements. By the end of the year, most of our markets will be 4G LTE ready with a 5x5 megahertz channel bandwidth. We are also an industry leader in deployment of VoLTE cable handsets, since VoLTE service is foundational in our ability to refarm CDMA spectrum for LTE service. During the third quarter, we plan on introducing the first VoLTE-enabled handset. We plan to introduce  additional VoLTE handsets this year to further capitalize on the benefits of this technology and prepare for refarming spectrum.
We also are focused on developing and deploying rich communication services, or RCS, this year, which supports simultaneous voice communication with media -- multimedia messaging as well as other advanced data services. RCS will further differentiate premium 4G LTE services from competitors' 3G data services. Once launched, for the first time, MetroPCS customers with RCS will have a feature set available to them that has previously only been available to postpaid subscribers. We will offer this to our subscribers at an unmatched value. Consequently, RCS enables us to significantly distance ourselves from MVNOs and other service providers, which do not offer such services.
Our objectives are clear. We will capitalize on our 4G LTE For All initiative when it is ready, and move towards VoLTE later in 2012 and 2013. With our move towards VoLTE, we've been able to migrate customers off our CDMA network and on to our more efficient 4G LTE network. This migration, combined with other initiatives such as microwave backhaul, will provide us with capacity needed for plan subscriber growth. With affordable 4G LTE smartphones and an advanced 4G LTE network, we believe we'll be well positioned to drive revenue growth and earnings performance in the future. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Good morning, everyone. I want to focus my comments today on our need to transition the business to 4G LTE services, our second quarter results as well as provide an update on our 4G LTE For All initiatives, our transition from 3G to 4G",695,"Thank you, Roger. Good morning, everyone. I want to focus my comments today on our need to transition the business to 4G LTE services, our second quarter results as well as provide an update on our 4G LTE For All initiatives, our transition from 3G to 4G LTE. The industry continues to be challenging and competitive. With that being said, the global movement towards 4G LTE is clear and it's happening now. The handset ecosystem for 4G LTE continues to develop and during this transition, the best way for MetroPCS to manage the business is to balance growth, retention, ARPU, brand expansion and EBITDA. We believe the company needs to grow its subscriber base over the long term. By focusing on our 4G LTE services, we will be able to differentiate our product offerings and return the company to its legacy of subscriber growth.
While in this current transition period, we are managing the business to generate adjusted EBITDA while preparing for the launch of 4G LTE For All later in the third quarter. Throughout the quarter, we focused on generating EBITDA versus subscriber growth. With lower handset subsidies and moderated marketing spend throughout the second quarter, both upgrades and gross additions declined on a year-over-year and on a sequential basis. In the second quarter, gross additions totaled 781,000, down 38% year-over-year. As expected, upgrade activity also declined in the quarter coming in at 9% of total subscribers, compared to 13% in the second quarter of 2011 and 16% in the first quarter of 2012. As you can see in our supplemental slide deck, upgrade cost this quarter accounted for $3.06 of CPU versus $3.73 in the second quarter of 2011, and $7.13 in the first quarter of 2012.  With lower gross additions, combined with continued investments in our network, we managed churn to 3.4% for the second quarter.
During the quarter, approximately 50% of what we sold was a smartphone. And at the end of the quarter, 47% of all subscribers were on a smartphone plan. At the end of the second quarter, 42% of subscribers were on family plans.
During the quarter, we ran a $25 unlimited talk and text plan. We believe this plan addresses the needs of a specific demographic of customers and have been pleased with the uptake on this promotion. From a network utilization standpoint, the talk and text plan uses up significantly less capacity on our network than a typical data-intensive smartphone customer. Moving into the third quarter, we are continuing the $25 talk and text promotion.
The evolution of 4G LTE. We anticipate that as more affordable 4G LTE smartphones become available to our customers, our 4G LTE network will be ready to handle their data requirements. At the end of the second quarter, we are nearing completion, having built approximately 90% of our total footprint with 4G LTE, up from 80% at the end of the first quarter. We continue to expect additional 4G LTE smartphones to become available throughout the remainder of the year. We are working closely with various OEMs and plan to introduce 4G LTE smartphones in the $99 to $149 price range in late August. We believe that in addition to the various 4G LTE smartphones at the $149 level, we will launch additional smartphones at various price points during the remainder of the year. Importantly, we will also introduce VoLTE-capable smartphones as well as a DTV smartphone later this year.
When we approach the fourth quarter of this year, we plan to have 4G LTE For All in full swing. With a lightning-fast 4G LTE network, we believe it will be an exciting holiday season, with existing 3G Android customers having the ability to upgrade to a 4G LTE service, and we hope to expand our subscriber base by being the only facilities-based no-contract provider selling 4G LTE service in the United States. The combination of a 4G LTE network, full feature yet low-cost devices and service plans that offer unparalleled value, will be the drivers of our 4G LTE For All promotion that will be kicked off later in the third quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Braxton."

Our second quarter results demonstrate the ability of our business to generate significant cash. With lower promotional activity during the second quarter, we generated both the highest adjusted EBITDA in company history and also the highest consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins in company history at 41%. We ended the quarter with approximately 9.3 million total subscribers, an increase of 2% from the second quarter 2011, and up 49% over the past 3 years. Churn for the quarter was 3.4%, down 50 basis points when compared to the second quarter of 2011. This decline in churn was primarily driven by continued investments in our network and lower year-to-date subscriber growth.
Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we have substantial liquidity, with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. We believe this liquidity positions us very well for future strategic opportunities including spectrum acquisitions.
We continue to evaluate various options to enhance our current spectrum holdings. We believe further investment in spectrum will significantly reduce future CapEx, will have a positive impact on free cash flows and further leverage our 4G LTE investment. Our total leverage as of June 30, 2012, was approximately 3.3x, computed in accordance with the indentures governing our senior notes. We believe our maturity schedule is very manageable with our first substantial maturity of approximately $1 billion coming due in 2016. Our weighted average cost of debt for the second quarter was 5.8%. The majority of our debt is fixed by its nature or through interest rate swaps. We believe we are very well positioned from a balance sheet perspective.
Our second quarter 2012 ARPU was $40.62, up $0.13 on a year-over-year basis, and up $0.06 from the first quarter of 2012. The year-over-year increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to the continued demand for our Wireless For All and 4G LTE service plans, offset by promotional service plans and an increase in family plan penetration from 38% of our customer base as of June 30, 2011, to 42% of our customer base as of June 30, 2012. For the second quarter, our CPGA was $191, up $13 over the second quarter of 2011. This increase is primarily driven by lower gross additions, partially offset by decreased promotional activities, as compared to the 3 months ended June 30, 2011. On a sequential basis, CPGA declined $45, primarily due to less promotional handset activity. With the introduction of 4G LTE For All in late third quarter and during the fourth quarter, we do not expect the traditional decrease in fourth quarter CPGA from second and third quarter levels.
Our CPU for the quarter was $18.40 as compared to $18.94 in the prior-year second quarter. This year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in retention expense for existing customers, as well as a decrease in long-distance cost and taxes and regulatory fees. These items were partially offset by an increase in costs associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade and roaming expenses associated with Metro USA. During the quarter, we experienced $3.06 in CPU directly related to handset upgrades, compared to $3.73 in the prior-year second quarter, and compared to $7.13 from the first quarter of 2012.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $477 million, an increase of 33% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 41.1%. Over the first half of 2012, we have generated over $739 million in adjusted EBITDA compared to $643 million in the first half of 2011, representing an increase of 15%. With the launch of 4G LTE For All late in the third quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to decrease sequentially as a result of lower subscribers, promotional activities, higher upgrades which will pressure CPU and higher CPGA.
I'd now like to highlight a fewer -- a few items from the income statement and cash flow statement. In the second quarter, our service revenue and cost of service grew 4% and 1%, respectively, to approximately $1.2 billion and $368 million, respectively, over the same quarter in 2011. The increases are primarily due to the growth of our subscriber base over the second quarter of 2011. We generated $320 million in cash from operating activities in the second quarter. We generated $149 million in consolidated net income during the second quarter or $0.41 per share. We incurred capital expenditures of $182 million during the second quarter. Over the first 6 months of 2012, we have spent a total of $326 million in capital expenditures. We reaffirm our full-year 2012 guidance for capital expenditures of $900 million to $1 billion.

The key for us is the service that is expected and the handsets that are capable of delivering that, we think will be met with our third quarter beginning -- or late third quarter, as I should say, beginning introduction which we feel will be impacting fourth quarter. So we see parity in terms of handsets. We'll be, I think, and certainly, in the hunt on download speeds well beyond those which we would think necessary for the main services our customers want, which are highly focused towards YouTube and Pandora and applications as such. So we think we have a very substantial service. It's much superior to most 3G services, excluding those that concatenate the frequencies to get -- as HSPA+ does. And download speeds, once minimum is reached, I think the service satisfaction goes up exponentially. So we hope to have the -- with the handsets being affordable and in the general region of what you can buy the 3G phone sets for, that's one element. The other element is we will be building and introducing later this year the, what I mentioned is the RCS platform or our move to IMS, which I think will bring about a very substantial change, which is really, I guess in a phrase, an ability for our customers to share life experiences. They can call and simultaneously send videos or still images, or determine presence on their phonebook or for that matter, enhanced messaging service. So we think we will have the full set of services that have not been present for the no-contract segment."

You've got to remember that -- Roger made a statement that almost all of our major metropolitan markets were going to have 5x5 for LTE. So there's a lot of efforts being put into densification to free up additional spectrum to really provide that type of bandwidth. And you've also heard us talk in previous calls about our microwave backhaul initiative, which was really key and very efficient from a cost standpoint. Really looking forward -- as we've talked about in the past, it's dependent on do we really get additional spectrum and the level of subscriber growth. We do plan on returning to our legacy of subscriber growth with really what customers are looking for, which is more high-speed broadband services, of which 4G LTE is very well positioned in the prepaid space. But with the lack of spectrum, we will need to continue working on the capacity of our network, and we don't see a catalyst for any significant decreases in CapEx. Conversely, if we are able to obtain additional spectrum, per our previous commentary, we do expect to see significant savings in CapEx and enhancement of free cash flow."

I'm wondering if you could give us some color on what your thoughts are around 2.5 gigahertz spectrum, and how you see that would be -- how easy it would be to wrap TD LTE spectrum into your existing network build?

I think there's substantial difficulties yet with the 700 block. I think in due course, they will go away. I think it remains a more distant option for us. Clearly, the spectrum is valuable if interference from broadcasters could be eliminated in a predictable way. At this point, the FCC has left it up to arm's-length agreements and everybody seems to have short arms. So going on to the Clearwire, there is definite spectrum there and as you know, the 2.5 gigahertz is slightly less effective in terms of range. In fact, it's considerably short on range, still would be very useful for companies like ourselves, which operate principally in the larger markets where we have more dense conditions. The real other side of the issue of course is the time division, which is probably the only practical way of using the spectrum. And TD LTE is still in its experimental phases, and so there's time to market questions there. But as far as spectrum, all spectrum can be used and we like all spectrum. The problem is at what point in time can it be commercialized. So as far as other spectrum goes, the Verizon transaction on AWS that was announced several weeks ago, made it pretty clear about that. There always are some trading opportunities. Certainly, we'll look forward to that to the extent they exist. But as you mentioned, the Leap offer that leases spectrum from Clearwire, that is -- I think that option is sitting out there is not the desired option from our standpoint because at the end of the day, I think it's a high-cost option. But nevertheless, it may be an option. What our focus is on, is what I indicated that we're densifying our networks. We're getting to what we think is an important and critical part of getting the full 10MHz bandwidth be applicable for LTE and use that as a platform for our refarming effort. We think it can be made very efficient. We will be improving the network, making sure that we have -- in some places we'll have quad poles, which gives us a very strong forward and substantial uplink. We'll be converting to MIMO, where we think that makes sense in many of our locations. And probably most importantly, that we have acquired microwave backhaul spectrum in all of our markets, and we have a major program which is now factored in our 2012 even though we'll go into 2013 first half, the CapEx for significant capacity on backhaul. And that has both the cost implication, cost reduction implication, operating cost that is, as well as capacity implication because you can't get more out of the forward link than you can truck away on the backhaul side. So we think all of those initiatives gives us a very strong opportunity to grow our business, and the game of hunting spectrum is as you know, a very difficult one. So we'll be very opportunistic."

And we're excited that we have approximately 8% of our customers on the LTE network, but we're still nowhere near to scale on the investment that's there. So we do see a lot of opportunity. I think what's surprising me a little bit is even as cost efficient as we are, we are constantly striving to do things better and to provide more efficiencies in our operations. During the quarter, we in place [ph] -- first quarter, we implemented some innovative solutions in our long distance area, both from an international standpoint and domestic standpoint, that drove some costs out of providing long-distance services in the business. We're very, very focused on taxes and regulatory fees because remember, when we went tax and regulatory fee inclusive with Wireless For All, those items had a significant impact on us, and through a lot of hard work we were able to provide some efficiencies in that area.

So we have, I think, an adequate service. If we can add additional spectrum, of course, that can grow dramatically. On test trials here in Dallas, where we have 20 megahertz where we've tested on, or a 10x10, we've had speeds that are not average. Because I've quoted average speeds, but we've achieved speeds up to 80 megahertz -- megabits. So that there is tremendous speed possibilities available with the proper antenna configuration, and I think the growth here is going to be very important over time. So average speeds would be roughly 2x of that, a bit higher than 2x. So I think the capacity will be here. What we're very focus on is getting our network teed up so that we can go to our refarming without the need of having to have additional spectrum, which I think with the possible exception of 1 or 2 markets, we will achieve by first quarter of next year. LTE roaming, I think part of that is we do have under discussion now with parties in LTE roaming agreements. As you've -- as was noted in the prior discussion, Clearwire is interested in transactions because as they move to an LTE system, assuming that they can accomplish that.

One, I think it implies that there is growth in the no-contract segment supported by what they're looking to do. So number two, Roger spoke about the prospect of offering a premium service and possibly seeing some of their plans being cannibalized, that's something they'll have to look at and see if that's the right way to proceed on their side. But what we look at from our customer set is, they've always been attracted just by handset value, by service and then support. I think the support we now bring with an LTE network, we've yet to be able to really bring them the price for LTE handsets that we will at the beginning of the fourth quarter, end of the third. So we think that those 2 things are somewhat bifurcated. Yes, there's going to be more competition in the prepaid segment because that's where some of the growth is going to occur as the economy stays where it is and potential customers look not to have any commitment for 24 months. So we think for the first time ever, we're going to be able to market our products and services in the no-contract segment with premium devices at a value price, with service plans that will be unmatched. And at the same time be able to get our messaging locally and in media all wrapped around one consistent theme, that the network is full 4G LTE and the services that are provided are no-contract, taxes and fees inclusive. So we think we have some separation between the 2, and it might also help the segment grow as more people look into the prepaid side of the house as opposed to possibly contracts."

With this focus,",585,"Thank you, Keith. The exciting transition towards 4G LTE is close at hand. As we stated on our first quarter call, during the second and third quarters, we would focus on operating margins and enhancing cash flows over subscriber growth. With this focus, I am pleased to report both the highest quarterly  adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margins in company history. A revolution began at MetroPCS in 2010 with the proliferation of smartphones. Now only 2.5 years later, the revolution continues as 4G LTE is about to transform the wireless experience for the no-contract segment. At the end of the third quarter, affordable 4G LTE handsets will be available and we'll be very near completion of our 4G LTE network build-out with over 97% of all our POPs covered. With these 2 elements of our next generation business complete, we can rapidly accelerate our 4G LTE For All initiatives.
We have been the best deal in town in the voice-centric world, and we are aiming to be the best deal in town in this evolving data-centric world, taxes and regulatory fees included, of course. With our leading position in 4G LTE, we have an advanced network, fully operational, that is more advanced than many others in the wireless industry. Worldwide production, driving the experience curve, is rapidly moving 4G LTE standardization in chipsets and handsets design that will lead to lower unit cost in the future. This should drive lower cost to reduce handsets subsidies and help manage CPGA costs in future years.
Furthermore, we are taking steps in the network to ensure that we can support our business growth with our current spectrum holdings. However, we continue to look at spectrum acquisition opportunities for the most cost-effective approach to meet our capacity requirements. By the end of the year, most of our markets will be 4G LTE ready with a 5x5 megahertz channel bandwidth. We are also an industry leader in deployment of VoLTE cable handsets, since VoLTE service is foundational in our ability to refarm CDMA spectrum for LTE service. During the third quarter, we plan on introducing the first VoLTE-enabled handset. We plan to introduce  additional VoLTE handsets this year to further capitalize on the benefits of this technology and prepare for refarming spectrum.
We also are focused on developing and deploying rich communication services, or RCS, this year, which supports simultaneous voice communication with media -- multimedia messaging as well as other advanced data services. RCS will further differentiate premium 4G LTE services from competitors' 3G data services. Once launched, for the first time, MetroPCS customers with RCS will have a feature set available to them that has previously only been available to postpaid subscribers. We will offer this to our subscribers at an unmatched value. Consequently, RCS enables us to significantly distance ourselves from MVNOs and other service providers, which do not offer such services.
Our objectives are clear. We will capitalize on our 4G LTE For All initiative when it is ready, and move towards VoLTE later in 2012 and 2013. With our move towards VoLTE, we've been able to migrate customers off our CDMA network and on to our more efficient 4G LTE network. This migration, combined with other initiatives such as microwave backhaul, will provide us with capacity needed for plan subscriber growth. With affordable 4G LTE smartphones and an advanced 4G LTE network, we believe we'll be well positioned to drive revenue growth and earnings performance in the future. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Good morning, everyone. I want to focus my comments today on our need to transition the business to 4G LTE services, our second quarter results as well as provide an update on our 4G LTE For All initiatives, our transition from 3G to 4G",695,"Thank you, Roger. Good morning, everyone. I want to focus my comments today on our need to transition the business to 4G LTE services, our second quarter results as well as provide an update on our 4G LTE For All initiatives, our transition from 3G to 4G LTE. The industry continues to be challenging and competitive. With that being said, the global movement towards 4G LTE is clear and it's happening now. The handset ecosystem for 4G LTE continues to develop and during this transition, the best way for MetroPCS to manage the business is to balance growth, retention, ARPU, brand expansion and EBITDA. We believe the company needs to grow its subscriber base over the long term. By focusing on our 4G LTE services, we will be able to differentiate our product offerings and return the company to its legacy of subscriber growth.
While in this current transition period, we are managing the business to generate adjusted EBITDA while preparing for the launch of 4G LTE For All later in the third quarter. Throughout the quarter, we focused on generating EBITDA versus subscriber growth. With lower handset subsidies and moderated marketing spend throughout the second quarter, both upgrades and gross additions declined on a year-over-year and on a sequential basis. In the second quarter, gross additions totaled 781,000, down 38% year-over-year. As expected, upgrade activity also declined in the quarter coming in at 9% of total subscribers, compared to 13% in the second quarter of 2011 and 16% in the first quarter of 2012. As you can see in our supplemental slide deck, upgrade cost this quarter accounted for $3.06 of CPU versus $3.73 in the second quarter of 2011, and $7.13 in the first quarter of 2012.  With lower gross additions, combined with continued investments in our network, we managed churn to 3.4% for the second quarter.
During the quarter, approximately 50% of what we sold was a smartphone. And at the end of the quarter, 47% of all subscribers were on a smartphone plan. At the end of the second quarter, 42% of subscribers were on family plans.
During the quarter, we ran a $25 unlimited talk and text plan. We believe this plan addresses the needs of a specific demographic of customers and have been pleased with the uptake on this promotion. From a network utilization standpoint, the talk and text plan uses up significantly less capacity on our network than a typical data-intensive smartphone customer. Moving into the third quarter, we are continuing the $25 talk and text promotion.
The evolution of 4G LTE. We anticipate that as more affordable 4G LTE smartphones become available to our customers, our 4G LTE network will be ready to handle their data requirements. At the end of the second quarter, we are nearing completion, having built approximately 90% of our total footprint with 4G LTE, up from 80% at the end of the first quarter. We continue to expect additional 4G LTE smartphones to become available throughout the remainder of the year. We are working closely with various OEMs and plan to introduce 4G LTE smartphones in the $99 to $149 price range in late August. We believe that in addition to the various 4G LTE smartphones at the $149 level, we will launch additional smartphones at various price points during the remainder of the year. Importantly, we will also introduce VoLTE-capable smartphones as well as a DTV smartphone later this year.
When we approach the fourth quarter of this year, we plan to have 4G LTE For All in full swing. With a lightning-fast 4G LTE network, we believe it will be an exciting holiday season, with existing 3G Android customers having the ability to upgrade to a 4G LTE service, and we hope to expand our subscriber base by being the only facilities-based no-contract provider selling 4G LTE service in the United States. The combination of a 4G LTE network, full feature yet low-cost devices and service plans that offer unparalleled value, will be the drivers of our 4G LTE For All promotion that will be kicked off later in the third quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Braxton."

Our second quarter results demonstrate the ability of our business to generate significant cash. With lower promotional activity during the second quarter, we generated both the highest adjusted EBITDA in company history and also the highest consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins in company history at 41%. We ended the quarter with approximately 9.3 million total subscribers, an increase of 2% from the second quarter 2011, and up 49% over the past 3 years. Churn for the quarter was 3.4%, down 50 basis points when compared to the second quarter of 2011. This decline in churn was primarily driven by continued investments in our network and lower year-to-date subscriber growth.
Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we have substantial liquidity, with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. We believe this liquidity positions us very well for future strategic opportunities including spectrum acquisitions.
We continue to evaluate various options to enhance our current spectrum holdings. We believe further investment in spectrum will significantly reduce future CapEx, will have a positive impact on free cash flows and further leverage our 4G LTE investment. Our total leverage as of June 30, 2012, was approximately 3.3x, computed in accordance with the indentures governing our senior notes. We believe our maturity schedule is very manageable with our first substantial maturity of approximately $1 billion coming due in 2016. Our weighted average cost of debt for the second quarter was 5.8%. The majority of our debt is fixed by its nature or through interest rate swaps. We believe we are very well positioned from a balance sheet perspective.
Our second quarter 2012 ARPU was $40.62, up $0.13 on a year-over-year basis, and up $0.06 from the first quarter of 2012. The year-over-year increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to the continued demand for our Wireless For All and 4G LTE service plans, offset by promotional service plans and an increase in family plan penetration from 38% of our customer base as of June 30, 2011, to 42% of our customer base as of June 30, 2012. For the second quarter, our CPGA was $191, up $13 over the second quarter of 2011. This increase is primarily driven by lower gross additions, partially offset by decreased promotional activities, as compared to the 3 months ended June 30, 2011. On a sequential basis, CPGA declined $45, primarily due to less promotional handset activity. With the introduction of 4G LTE For All in late third quarter and during the fourth quarter, we do not expect the traditional decrease in fourth quarter CPGA from second and third quarter levels.
Our CPU for the quarter was $18.40 as compared to $18.94 in the prior-year second quarter. This year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in retention expense for existing customers, as well as a decrease in long-distance cost and taxes and regulatory fees. These items were partially offset by an increase in costs associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade and roaming expenses associated with Metro USA. During the quarter, we experienced $3.06 in CPU directly related to handset upgrades, compared to $3.73 in the prior-year second quarter, and compared to $7.13 from the first quarter of 2012.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $477 million, an increase of 33% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 41.1%. Over the first half of 2012, we have generated over $739 million in adjusted EBITDA compared to $643 million in the first half of 2011, representing an increase of 15%. With the launch of 4G LTE For All late in the third quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to decrease sequentially as a result of lower subscribers, promotional activities, higher upgrades which will pressure CPU and higher CPGA.
I'd now like to highlight a fewer -- a few items from the income statement and cash flow statement. In the second quarter, our service revenue and cost of service grew 4% and 1%, respectively, to approximately $1.2 billion and $368 million, respectively, over the same quarter in 2011. The increases are primarily due to the growth of our subscriber base over the second quarter of 2011. We generated $320 million in cash from operating activities in the second quarter. We generated $149 million in consolidated net income during the second quarter or $0.41 per share. We incurred capital expenditures of $182 million during the second quarter. Over the first 6 months of 2012, we have spent a total of $326 million in capital expenditures. We reaffirm our full-year 2012 guidance for capital expenditures of $900 million to $1 billion.

The key for us is the service that is expected and the handsets that are capable of delivering that, we think will be met with our third quarter beginning -- or late third quarter, as I should say, beginning introduction which we feel will be impacting fourth quarter. So we see parity in terms of handsets. We'll be, I think, and certainly, in the hunt on download speeds well beyond those which we would think necessary for the main services our customers want, which are highly focused towards YouTube and Pandora and applications as such. So we think we have a very substantial service. It's much superior to most 3G services, excluding those that concatenate the frequencies to get -- as HSPA+ does. And download speeds, once minimum is reached, I think the service satisfaction goes up exponentially. So we hope to have the -- with the handsets being affordable and in the general region of what you can buy the 3G phone sets for, that's one element. The other element is we will be building and introducing later this year the, what I mentioned is the RCS platform or our move to IMS, which I think will bring about a very substantial change, which is really, I guess in a phrase, an ability for our customers to share life experiences. They can call and simultaneously send videos or still images, or determine presence on their phonebook or for that matter, enhanced messaging service. So we think we will have the full set of services that have not been present for the no-contract segment."

So the fourth quarter starts a movement, where we'd like to see everybody migrate to our 4G LTE platform. The good news is that in the last 5 months of the year, we'll be introducing what looks like between 6 and 7 LTE handsets, which would give our consumers much greater choice. And as we mentioned, we'll have some of those handsets between the $99 and $149 range, as we introduce the LTE For All program.

We do plan on returning to our legacy of subscriber growth with really what customers are looking for, which is more high-speed broadband services, of which 4G LTE is very well positioned in the prepaid space. But with the lack of spectrum, we will need to continue working on the capacity of our network, and we don't see a catalyst for any significant decreases in CapEx.

I think there's substantial difficulties yet with the 700 block. I think in due course, they will go away. I think it remains a more distant option for us. Clearly, the spectrum is valuable if interference from broadcasters could be eliminated in a predictable way. At this point, the FCC has left it up to arm's-length agreements and everybody seems to have short arms. So going on to the Clearwire, there is definite spectrum there and as you know, the 2.5 gigahertz is slightly less effective in terms of range. In fact, it's considerably short on range, still would be very useful for companies like ourselves, which operate principally in the larger markets where we have more dense conditions. The real other side of the issue of course is the time division, which is probably the only practical way of using the spectrum. And TD LTE is still in its experimental phases, and so there's time to market questions there. But as far as spectrum, all spectrum can be used and we like all spectrum. The problem is at what point in time can it be commercialized. So as far as other spectrum goes, the Verizon transaction on AWS that was announced several weeks ago, made it pretty clear about that. There always are some trading opportunities. Certainly, we'll look forward to that to the extent they exist. But as you mentioned, the Leap offer that leases spectrum from Clearwire, that is -- I think that option is sitting out there is not the desired option from our standpoint because at the end of the day, I think it's a high-cost option. But nevertheless, it may be an option. What our focus is on, is what I indicated that we're densifying our networks. We're getting to what we think is an important and critical part of getting the full 10MHz bandwidth be applicable for LTE and use that as a platform for our refarming effort. We think it can be made very efficient. We will be improving the network, making sure that we have -- in some places we'll have quad poles, which gives us a very strong forward and substantial uplink. We'll be converting to MIMO, where we think that makes sense in many of our locations. And probably most importantly, that we have acquired microwave backhaul spectrum in all of our markets, and we have a major program which is now factored in our 2012 even though we'll go into 2013 first half, the CapEx for significant capacity on backhaul. And that has both the cost implication, cost reduction implication, operating cost that is, as well as capacity implication because you can't get more out of the forward link than you can truck away on the backhaul side. So we think all of those initiatives gives us a very strong opportunity to grow our business, and the game of hunting spectrum is as you know, a very difficult one. So we'll be very opportunistic."

I think what's surprising me a little bit is even as cost efficient as we are, we are constantly striving to do things better and to provide more efficiencies in our operations. During the quarter, we in place [ph] -- first quarter, we implemented some innovative solutions in our long distance area, both from an international standpoint and domestic standpoint, that drove some costs out of providing long-distance services in the business. We're very, very focused on taxes and regulatory fees because remember, when we went tax and regulatory fee inclusive with Wireless For All, those items had a significant impact on us, and through a lot of hard work we were able to provide some efficiencies in that area.

So we have, I think, an adequate service. If we can add additional spectrum, of course, that can grow dramatically. On test trials here in Dallas, where we have 20 megahertz where we've tested on, or a 10x10, we've had speeds that are not average. Because I've quoted average speeds, but we've achieved speeds up to 80 megahertz -- megabits. So that there is tremendous speed possibilities available with the proper antenna configuration, and I think the growth here is going to be very important over time. So average speeds would be roughly 2x of that, a bit higher than 2x. So I think the capacity will be here. What we're very focused on is getting our network teed up so that we can go to our refarming without the need of having to have additional spectrum, which I think with the possible exception of 1 or 2 markets, we will achieve by first quarter of next year. LTE roaming, I think part of that is we do have under discussion now with parties in LTE roaming agreements. As you've -- as was noted in the prior discussion, Clearwire is interested in transactions because as they move to an LTE system, assuming that they can accomplish that. So I think we will have LTE partners in the future. But we've built our business on being much more of a regional, local company and we see that as really the strength that we have and continue to have today."

What we have done this year is really stop chasing growth with our 1xRTT offering. And really are positioning to ramp our growth back up with a really high-speed 4G LTE offering, which quite frankly is what our customers want today. So yes, I look at these dynamics as being positive, positive for our industry and positive for MetroPCS. You saw the impact of being less aggressive both on our profitability, our upgrades and other key drivers. And when we get to 4G LTE where you have a service that customers really expect and demand today, I think they're going to be much happier customers going forward.

One, I think it implies that there is growth in the no-contract segment supported by what they're looking to do. So number two, Roger spoke about the prospect of offering a premium service and possibly seeing some of their plans being cannibalized, that's something they'll have to look at and see if that's the right way to proceed on their side. But what we look at from our customer set is, they've always been attracted just by handset value, by service and then support. I think the support we now bring with an LTE network, we've yet to be able to really bring them the price for LTE handsets that we will at the beginning of the fourth quarter, end of the third. So we think that those 2 things are somewhat bifurcated. Yes, there's going to be more competition in the prepaid segment because that's where some of the growth is going to occur as the economy stays where it is and potential customers look not to have any commitment for 24 months. So we think for the first time ever, we're going to be able to market our products and services in the no-contract segment with premium devices at a value price, with service plans that will be unmatched. And at the same time be able to get our messaging locally and in media all wrapped around one consistent theme, that the network is full 4G LTE and the services that are provided are no-contract, taxes and fees inclusive. So we think we have some separation between the 2, and it might also help the segment grow as more people look into the prepaid side of the house as opposed to possibly contracts."

First, I'd like to say all of you on the call in the Northeast have found a safe place for you and your families, this has been an incredible storm and we wish you the very best. 
I'm very pleased with this quarter's strong adjusted EBITDA and year-over-year decline in churn. The strength of our third quarter earnings highlighted by the highest consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin in company history was primarily driven on our focus on generating adjusted EBITDA and cash flow over subscriber growth.
Late in the third quarter, with new affordable 4G LTE handsets in our portfolio, we launched our 4G LTE for All offerings. This launch, highlighted by a $55 unlimited service plan transformed the wireless experience for no contract offerings. We have recently surpassed the 1.25 million LTE subscriber mark and our leadership in 4G LTE in the no contract service continues.
Demand for high-speed wireless services from with our 4G network and smartphones. We believe we have an opportunity to upgrade our existing customer base and extend our market share. We currently offer a number of 4G LTE smartphones and we recently introduced the Galaxy Samsung SIII. Availability of lower-cost 4G LTE smartphones is in part due to an increasing number of handsets utilizing the QUALCOMM 8960 chipset family. This standardization is a major positive as it will enable decreasing unit costs over time and we believe lower subsidization levels in the feature.
Additionally, we are leading North America in the deployment of 2 technologies that work with our 4G LTE network, Voice over LTE or VoLTE and Rich Communication Services or RCS. We are now working to enable the deployment of VoLTE across our entire network and into our handset lineup. Not only does VoLTE provides superior call quality, it also enables our efficient use of spectrum and reaffirming of CDMA spectrum to 4G LTE overtime.
We are also introducing for the first time in the Americas RCS on our LTE network, which supports social presence, simultaneous voice communication with multimedia messaging, as well as other advanced data services. We plan to launch RCS service tomorrow and we believe that RCS will significantly differentiate our premium 4G LTE service from our competitors' 3G data offerings.
Our technology path is clear as the entire wireless industry is now moving towards 4G LTE, which MetroPCS pioneered in the United States 2 years ago. With 4G LTE for All launch, we are now positioned to focus on reenergizing our subscriber. We will continue to compete aggressively, utilizing our RCS services and compelling 4G LTE for All service plans.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I'd also like to echo your comments about personal safety and steady recovery for those up in the Northeast.
This morning, my comments will focus on our third quarter results, the launch of our 4G LTE for All and our promotional activity heading into the fourth quarter. 
Building on the strategy we executed in the second quarter, our focus on this quarter was generating adjusted EBITDA and cash flow over subscriber acquisition. I'm pleased to report strong adjusted EBITDA and the highest adjusted EBITDA margin in company history of 41.5%.
This financial performance was driven by lower handset subsidies and moderated marketing spend. In the quarter, gross addition activity declined year-over-year and totaled $692,000 for the quarter. 
Churn in the quarter declined significantly on a year-over-year basis, down 80 basis points to 3.7%. We are pleased with the improvement in churn this quarter and we believe that was driven by improved customer experience through investments in our network and lower year-to-date subscriber growth.
During the third quarter, approximately 62% of total handsets sold were smartphones, and approximately 50% of total subscribers were on a smartphone plan at the end of the third quarter.
Family plan penetration at the end of the quarter was 40%.
In late August, we introduced our 4G LTE for All Initiatives. As the marketing and messaging around this initiative ramps, we have already covered approximately 97% of our entire CDMA footprint with 4G LTE base stations. As part of our launch, we also introduced a promotional 4G LTE unlimited talk, text and data plan priced at $55. This plan provides subscribers with an unlimited, unthrottled wireless broadband experience. 
Since launching 4G LTE for All, interest in 4G has increased and approximately 40% of all gross additions in September were 4G subscribers.
Of those gross additions, over 70% were taking the promotional $55 service plan, which is accretive to ARPU.
At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 1.1 million 4G subscribers, which equates to 12% of our subscriber base. We continued to see a churn profile developing on our 4G LTE customers that is approximately 100 basis points better versus our consolidated churn.
Total 4G upgrade activity is strong at 123% in the third quarter with much of that activity coming in September. From August to September, the percentage of upgrades moving to 4G phones nearly doubled into the middle of October, accounted for nearly 70% of total upgrades.
Historically, fourth quarter subscriber activity has been heavily weighted towards the backend. Additionally, with 4G LTE for All promotional activity running through the entire quarter, we expect incremental pressure on both CPGA and CPU, which will impact adjusted EBITDA. 
In early October, we launched the promotional 4G LTE plan, which includes unlimited talk, text and 250 megabytes of 4G data for $30 a month. We believe this promotional $30 4G LTE service plan will generate excitement and increase the opportunity for retail door swings as consumers shop for wireless value, coupled with 4G speeds during this holiday driven quarter.
We are excited about the services and value we offer in the marketplace and we believe our customers are truly experiencing a premium service value at our industry-leading 4G LTE network.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Braxton."

Our third quarter results demonstrate the ability of our business to generate significant cash flows. With lower promotional activity during most of the third quarter, we generated strong adjusted EBITDA of $466 million and the highest adjusted EBITDA margin in company history at 41.5%.
We ended the quarter with approximately 9 million total subscribers.
Churn for the quarter was 3.7%, down 80 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2011. This decline in churn was primarily driven by continued investments in our network and lower year-to-date subscriber growth.
Our balance sheet continues to be strong, and we have substantial liquidity with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter.
Our total leverage as of September 30, 2012, was approximately 3x computed in accordance with indentures governing our senior unsecured notes. We believe our maturity schedule is very manageable with our first substantial maturity of approximately $1 billion coming due in November 2016. Our weighted average cost of debt for the third quarter was approximately 5.8%.
The majority of our debt is by its nature or through its interest rate swaps. We believe we are very well positioned from a balance sheet perspective.
Our third quarter 2012 ARPU was $40.50, down $0.30 on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year decrease in ARPU was primarily attributable to promotional service plans, partially offset by continued demand for our 4G LTE service plans.
For the third quarter, our CPGA was $202, up $8 over the third quarter of 2011. This year-over-year increase is primarily driven by a 47% decrease in gross adds as compared to the 3 months ended September 30, 2011.
With the introduction of 4G LTE for All late in the third quarter, we do not expect the traditional decrease in CPGA during the fourth quarter.
Our CPU for the quarter was $18.38 as compared to $19.52 in the prior-year's third quarter. This year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in retention expense for existing customers, a decrease in long-distance costs, and a decrease in taxes and regulatory fees. These items were partially offset by an increase in costs associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade and the increase in commissions paid to independent retailers for customer reactivations.
During the quarter, we experienced $2.47 in CPU directly related to handset upgrades compared to $3.88 in the prior year's third quarter and compared to $3.06 in the second quarter of 2012.
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $466 million, an increase of 42% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 41.5%.
Over the first 9 months of 2012, we generated over $1.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA compared to approximately $970 million in the first 9 months of 2011, representing an increase of 24%.
On the trailing 12-month basis, we have generated approximately $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA, a record for the company.
With the launch of 4G LTE for All, we expect adjusted EBITDA to decrease sequentially as a result of lower subscribers, promotional activities, and the higher upgrades given our new and improved 4G LTE handset offerings, which will pressure CPU and translate into higher CPGA.
I'd now like to highlight a few items from the income statement and cash flow statement. 
In the third quarter, our service revenue and cost of service decreased 1% and 2%, respectively, to approximately $1.1 billion and $373 million, respectively, over the same quarter in 2011.
We generated $392 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter. We incurred capital expenditures of $262 million during the third quarter. Year-to-date, we spent a total of $588 million in capital expenditures.
Unlevered free cash flow on an LTM basis was $789 million and totaled $204 million for the third quarter of 2012. We generated $193 million in consolidated net income during the third quarter. This amount includes a $53 million gain on settlement related to certain securities that was recognized during the quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the gain on settlement, net income would have been $140 million or $0.38 per common share for the third quarter of 2012 and $69 million or $0.19 per share in the prior year's third quarter, representing year-over-year growth in net income of over 100%.
We reaffirm our full year 2012 guidance for capital expenditures of $900 million to $1 billion.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Roger."

Before we begin the Q&A, I'd now like to talk about some recent events here at MetroPCS. These are exciting times in the wireless industry with our successful introduction of the first commercial 4G LTE service in the U.S., now comprising over 12% of our subscriber base.
With the service launch, our customer experience evolved from voice-centric to a broadband data-centric experience. This focus on high-speed wireless data required a 4G LTE network. With our recently announced combination with T-Mobile, we have the opportunities to provide an unparalleled 4G LTE experience.
I'd want to discuss 4 points about the compelling proposed combination of MetroPCS with T-Mobile USA. First spectrum, we have spent the last couple of years looking to add SpectrumCo to our current holdings. Combining our spectrum with T-Mobile spectrum portfolio is a significant strategic benefit in this transaction. In our current coverage areas, we have an average of 22 megahertz of spectrum. Following this transaction, MetroPCS's major metropolitan areas will have an average of 83 megahertz of spectrum, almost a fourfold improvement.
Importantly, it also provides combined company with the path to offer 4G LTE on the AWS band over a 20x20 megahertz channel in a number of major metropolitan areas including New York City, Los Angeles, Dallas and San Francisco, to name a few. With this enhanced spectrum position combined with MetroPCS's vast coverage in urban areas, network performance and capacity significantly increases. This will enable a true broadband customer experience that will provide for greater in-building coverage.
Nationwide coverage. Currently, MetroPCS service approximately 102 million pops. When customers travel outside that footprint, we pay other curious roaming fees. In combination with T-Mobile, our combined networks will serve more than 280 million POPs. This national platform will be a great value to MetroPCS customers and will enable superior cost metrics.
Market expansion. We launched our last major metropolitan areas in 2009 with New York City and Boston. With the combination, we can bring the MetroPCS model not only to geographical areas that have limited pay in advance no contract wireless offerings, but we can also expand nationally, utilizing the T-Mobile network. This expansion creates a value leader within the fastest-growing part of the wireless industry. At close, we have greatly expanded distribution, we are uniquely positioned to leverage those expansion of our business model.
Synergies. There are estimated to be 5 billion to 6 billion in-network synergies and approximately 1 billion in nonnetwork synergies, which in total provide for a 6 billion to 7 billion in total estimated synergies. Network synergies are driven primarily by the decommissioning of 10,500 macro sites. After closing, by utilizing the T-Mobile network for new MetroPCS brand of customers, there will be a reduced CapEx, as well as roaming expense.
Looking forward, MetroPCS 4G LTE customers will be able to utilize the new combined 4G LTE network. With our historically rapid upgrade rate and organic churn, our subscriber base and quickly migrate to the new code network.
Finally, MetroPCS disruptive business model, coupled with T-Mobile's strategic challenger initiative, provides a tremendous platform for growth. I am excited about this proposed combination, which creates the leading value carrier in the U.S.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator?"

So over the last 2 years, we've been able actually to increase ARPU at an average of $0.81 over the last 24 months. So I think as the handset lineup moves to a more LTE defined network, we're going to see more people utilizing the rate plans that we have. We've put the $30 rate plan out there as promotional, and we believe it really does help door swings, it seen some very nice and enough of that. We obviously want to our customers utilize the network, but remember, it only comes with 250 megabits of 4G data, so once they get there, we think it's actually an opportunity to springboard to higher rate plans once they understand what the device can do and how they benefit from the network. So we think that could be long-term positive, but again, we are just rolling that outcome it's really too early to tell what any impact is. We've certainly seen, we think good traction as Braxton as mentioned before, on the $25 rate plan. It really has good economics and the network come I noted on the feature phone and we think that gives us a really good farm team promotion. And as mentioned, a large percentage of our new recruits on the 4G network are taking the $55 rate plan, which means that there is a great traction around that Our challenge in the fourth quarter as always is to stay relevant and get our message out there you go, so rate plans, I think will lead to stabilized ARPU but it's really difficult to tell you what each individual rate plan will do for us big, it's going to be a mixture."

So that's a piece of it. Now, the second piece of it is a decrease in taxes and regulatory fees. Again, we are very, very focused on obtaining the correct price and fare amounts of taxes and regulatory fees. We a very active on a state and local basis about helping drive legislation, and we've seen some definite improvements in certain large jurisdictions that we do business in that we contribute to that."

This has been an incredible storm, and we wish you the very best.  I'm very pleased with this quarter's strong adjusted EBITDA and year-over-year decline in churn. The strength of our third quarter earnings, highlighted by the highest consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin in company history, was primarily driven on our focus on generating adjusted EBITDA and cash flow over subscriber growth.
Late in the third quarter, with new affordable 4G LTE handsets in our portfolio, we launched our 4G LTE For All offerings. This launch, highlighted by a $55 unlimited service plan, transformed the wireless experience for no contract offerings. We have recently surpassed the 1.25 million LTE subscriber mark, and our leadership in 4G LTE in the no contract service continues.  Demand for high-speed wireless services sprung with our 4G network and smartphones. We believe we have an opportunity to upgrade our existing customer base and extend our market share. We currently offer a number of 4G LTE smartphones, and we recently introduced the GALAXY Samsung S III. Availability of lower-cost 4G LTE smartphones is in part due to an increasing number of handsets utilizing the QUALCOMM 8960 chipset family. This standardization is a major positive, as it will enable decreasing unit costs over time and we believe lower subsidization levels in the feature.  Additionally, we are leading North America in the deployment of 2 technologies that work with our 4G LTE network, Voice over LTE or VoLTE and Rich Communication Services or RCS. We are now working to enable the deployment of VoLTE across our entire network and into our handset line up. Not only does VoLTE provides superior call quality, it also enables our efficient use of spectrum and re-firming of CDMA spectrum to 4G LTE overtime.
We are also introducing for the first time in the Americas RCS on our LTE network, which supports social presence, simultaneous voice communication with multimedia messaging, as well as other advanced data services. We plan to launch RCS service tomorrow, and we believe that RCS will significantly differentiate our premium 4G LTE service from our competitors' 3G data offerings.
Our technology path is clear, as the entire wireless industry is now moving towards 4G LTE, which MetroPCS pioneered in the United States 2 years ago. With 4G LTE For All launch, we are now positioned to focus on reenergizing subscriber growth. We will continue to compete aggressively, utilizing our RCS services and compelling 4G LTE For All service plans.  Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I'd also like to echo your comments about personal safety and wish a swift and steady recovery for those up in the Northeast.  This morning, my comments will focus on our third quarter results, the launch of our 4G LTE For All and our promotional activity heading into the fourth quarter.  Building on the strategy we executed in the second quarter, our focus on this quarter was generating adjusted EBITDA and cash flow over subscriber acquisition. I'm pleased to report strong adjusted EBITDA and the highest adjusted EBITDA margin in company history of 41.5%.  This financial performance was driven by lower handset subsidies and moderated marketing spend. In the quarter, gross addition activity declined year-over-year and totaled $692,000 for the quarter.  Churn in the quarter declined significantly on a year-over-year basis, down 80 basis points to 3.7%. We're pleased with the improvement in churn this quarter, and we believe that was driven by improved customer experience through investments in our network and lower year-to-date subscriber growth.
During the third quarter, approximately 62% of total handsets sold were smartphones, and approximately 50% of total subscribers were on a smartphone plan at the end of the third quarter.  Family plan penetration at the end of the quarter was 40%.  In late August, we introduced our 4G LTE For All initiatives. As the marketing and messaging around this initiative ramps, we have already covered approximately 97% of our entire CDMA footprint, with 4G LTE base stations. As part of our launch, we also introduced a promotional 4G LTE unlimited talk, text and data plan priced at $55. This plan provides subscribers with an unlimited, unthrottled wireless broadband experience.  Since launching 4G LTE For All, interest in 4G has increased, and approximately 40% of all gross additions in September were 4G subscribers.  Of those gross additions, over 70% were taking the promotional $55 service plan, which is accretive to ARPU.
At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 1.1 million 4G subscribers, which equates to 12% of our subscriber base. We continued to see a churn profile developing on our 4G LTE customers that is approximately 100 basis points better versus our consolidated churn.  Total 4G upgrade activity is strong at 123% in the third quarter, with much of that activity coming in September. From August to September, the percentage of upgrades moving to 4G phones nearly doubled and through the middle of October, accounted for nearly 70% of total upgrades.  Historically, fourth quarter subscriber activity has been heavily weighted towards the back end. Additionally, with 4G LTE For All promotional activity running through the entire quarter, we expect incremental pressure on both CPGA and CPU, which will impact adjusted EBITDA. 
In early October, we launched the promotional 4G LTE plan, which includes unlimited talk, text and 250 megabytes of 4G data for $30 a month. We believe this promotional $30 4G LTE service plan will generate excitement and increase the opportunity for retail door swings, as consumers shop for wireless value, coupled with 4G speeds during this holiday-driven quarter.
We are excited about the services and value we offer in the marketplace, and we believe our customers are truly experiencing a premium service value with our industry-leading 4G LTE network.  Now I'll turn the call over to Braxton."

Our third quarter results demonstrate the ability of our business to generate significant cash flows. With lower promotional activity during most of the third quarter, we generated strong adjusted EBITDA of $466 million and the highest adjusted EBITDA margin in company history at 41.5%.  We ended the quarter with approximately 9 million total subscribers.  Churn for the quarter was 3.7%, down 80 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2011. This decline in churn was primarily driven by continued investments in our network and lower year-to-date subscriber growth.  Our balance sheet continues to be strong, and we have substantial liquidity with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter.
Our total leverage as of September 30, 2012, was approximately 3x computed in accordance with the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes. We believe our maturity schedule is very manageable with our first substantial maturity of approximately $1 billion coming due in November 2016. Our weighted average cost of debt for the third quarter was approximately 5.8%.  The majority of our debt is fixed by its nature or through interest rate swaps. We believe we are very well positioned from a balance sheet perspective.
Our third quarter 2012 ARPU was $40.50, down $0.30 on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year decrease in ARPU was primarily attributable to promotional service plans, partially offset by continued demand for our 4G LTE service plans.  For the third quarter, our CPGA was $202, up $8 over the third quarter of 2011. This year-over-year increase is primarily driven by 47% decrease in gross adds as compared to the 3 months ended September 30, 2011.  With the introduction of 4G LTE For All late in the third quarter, we do not expect the traditional decrease in CPGA during the fourth quarter.
Our CPU for the quarter was $18.38 as compared to $19.52 in the prior-year's third quarter. This year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in retention expense for existing customers, a decrease in long-distance costs and a decrease in taxes and regulatory fees. These items were partially offset by an increase in costs associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade and the increase in commissions paid to independent retailers for customer reactivations.
During the quarter, we experienced $2.47 in CPU directly related to handset upgrades compared to $3.88 in the prior year's third quarter and compared to $3.06 in the second quarter of 2012.  Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $466 million, an increase of 42% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 41.5%.  Over the first 9 months of 2012, we generated over $1.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA compared to approximately $970 million in the first 9 months of 2011, representing an increase of 24%.  On the trailing 12-month basis, we have generated approximately $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA, a record for the company.  With the launch of 4G LTE For All, we expect adjusted EBITDA to decrease sequentially as a result of lower subscribers, promotional activities and the higher upgrades given our new and improved 4G LTE handset offerings, which will pressure CPU and translate into higher CPGA.
I'd now like to highlight a few items from the income statement and cash flow statement.  In the third quarter, our service revenue and cost of service decreased 1% and 2%, respectively, to approximately $1.1 billion and $373 million, respectively, over the same quarter in 2011. We generated $392 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter. We incurred capital expenditures of $262 million during the third quarter. Year-to-date, we've spent a total of $588 million in capital expenditures.
Unlevered free cash flow on an LTM basis was $789 million and totaled $204 million for the third quarter of 2012. We generated $193 million in consolidated net income during the third quarter. This amount includes a $53 million gain on settlement related to certain securities that was recognized during the quarter.  On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the gain on settlement, net income would have been $140 million or $0.38 per common share for the third quarter of 2012 and $69 million or $0.19 per share in the prior year's third quarter, representing year-over-year growth in net income of over 100%.  We reaffirm our full year 2012 guidance for capital expenditures of $900 million to $1 billion.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Roger."

Before we begin the Q&A, I want to talk about some recent events here at MetroPCS. These are exciting times in the wireless industry with our successful introduction of the first commercial 4G LTE service in the U.S., now comprising over 12% of our subscriber base.  With the service launch, our customer experience evolved from voice-centric to a broadband data-centric experience. This focus on high-speed wireless data required a 4G LTE network. With our recently announced combination with T-Mobile, we have the opportunity to provide an unparalleled 4G LTE experience.
I want to discuss 4 points about the compelling proposed combination of MetroPCS with T-Mobile USA. First spectrum, we have spent the last couple of years looking to add spectrum to our current holdings. Combining our spectrum with T-Mobile's spectrum portfolio is a significant strategic benefit in this transaction. In our current coverage areas, we have an average of 22 megahertz of spectrum. Following this transaction, MetroPCS' major metropolitan areas will have an average of 83 megahertz of spectrum, almost a four-fold improvement.  Importantly, it also provides combined company with a path to offer 4G LTE on the AWS band over a 20x20 megahertz channel in a number of major metropolitan areas, including New York City, Los Angeles, Dallas and San Francisco, to name a few. With this enhanced spectrum position, combined with MetroPCS's vast coverage in urban areas, network performance and capacity significantly increases. This will enable a true broadband customer experience, and will provide for greater in-building coverage.
Nationwide coverage. Currently, MetroPCS service approximately 102 million POPs. When customers travel outside that footprint, we pay other carrier's roaming fees. In combination with T-Mobile, our combined networks will serve more than 280 million POPs. This national platform will be a great value to MetroPCS customers and will enable superior cost metrics.
Market expansion. We lost -- we launched our last major metropolitan areas in 2009 with New York City and Boston. With the combination, we can bring the MetroPCS model not only to geographical areas that have limited pay-in-advance no contract wireless offerings, but we can also expand nationally, utilizing the T-Mobile network. This expansion creates a value leader within the fastest-growing part of the wireless industry. At close, we have greatly expanded distribution. We are uniquely positioned to leverage this expansion of our business model.
Synergies. There are estimated to be 5 billion to 6 billion in network synergies and approximately 1 billion in non-network synergies, which in total, provide for 6 billion to 7 billion in total estimated synergies. Network synergies are driven primarily by the decommissioning of 10,500 macro sites. After closing, by utilizing the T-Mobile network for new MetroPCS-branded customers, there will be reduced CapEx, as well as roaming expense.  Looking forward, MetroPCS 4G LTE customers will be able to utilize the new combined 4G LTE network. With our historically rapid upgrade rates and organic churn, our subscriber base can quickly migrate to the NewCo network.
Finally, MetroPCS' disruptive business model, coupled with T-Mobile's strategic challenger initiative, provides a tremendous platform for growth. I'm excited about this proposed combination, which creates the leading value carrier in the U.S.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator?"

One thing I noticed, I was going back over some numbers and if we go back to Q3 2010, we were in the 39, 70 range for ARPU.

One thing I noticed, I was going back over some numbers and if we go back to Q3 2010, we were in the 39, 70 range for ARPU. So over the last 2 years, we've been able actually to increase ARPU, on average, about $0.81 over the last 24 months. So I think, as the handset lineup moves to a more LTE-defined network, we're going to see more people utilizing the rate plans that we have. We've put the $30 rate plan out there as promotional, and we believe it really does help door swings. We've seen some very nice trending off of that. We obviously want our customers to utilize the network, but remember, it only comes with 250 megabits of 4G data. So once they get there, we think it's actually an opportunity to springboard to higher rate plans once they understand what the device can do and how they benefit from the network. So we think that could be a long-term positive. But again, we're just rolling that out, it's really too early to tell what any impact is. We've certainly seen, we think, good traction, as Braxton has mentioned before, on the $25 rate plan. It has really good economics on the network. It comes with no data on the feature phone, and we think that gives us a really good farm team  promotion. And as mentioned, a large percentage of our new recruits on the 4G network are taking the $55 rate plan, which means that there's a great traction around that. Our challenge in the fourth quarter, as always, is to stay relevant and get our message out there. So rate plans, I think, will lead to stabilized ARPU, but it's really difficult to tell you what each individual rate plan will do for us. It's going to be a mixture."

One is the fact that the national platform, I think, is an important piece. Today, we have some limitations on roaming, and the data rates that the subscribers have as they go into or off network services. So we can certainly take those limitations away. I think one of the 2 major pieces is that by the time we do have a combination, we'll be well along collectively on the LTE network build. So I think that if we look past the 2013, where we will have the LTE network nationwide, I think there will be a substantial price opportunity reduction for handsets in that time frame, also that we expect that we can put our -- or transpose our business model into areas, which as we mentioned, or I mentioned before today, that either don't have our model or we think are great opportunities to introduce our business model. But I think as far as what network we operate on, which I think is the substance of your question, Craig. The -- I think we have 2 elements. One is the LTE network, but we also have a high-speed 3G network, which we believe corresponds also with some significant cost reduction on the GSM HSPA platform relative to what we've been spending on the CDMA platform.

And as Roger had mentioned, we've been off of our marketing spend in the third quarter, and that's going to ramp up in the fourth quarter as we spoke about. So we think we have some areas to grow organically just on our own markets. The other side of it is we think there's maybe 25 million to 50 million new covered POPs outside of our marketplaces, green fields, if you will. But since we haven't had license covered areas that we can take our distribution, our model in Yuko and use that to grow our brand, while the postpaid side of the house works on stabilization and doing the things that they need to do.

So we're really leveraging a fixed cost to provide, I think, a real ROI opportunity for expansion of this brand in a cost leadership, price leadership way, but I think it's also worth noting that we also believe that NewCo is on the path to reestablish growth in the contractor postpaid area. It certainly have been difficult a couple of years, but with over $4 billion worth of network investments with the challenge or strategy, with a robust handset lineup that continues to improve, we believe that T-Mobile legacy is on the path of stabilization in future quarters of the postpaid part of business, and that will turn to growth once the LTE networks laid out. So it's really a holistic view, and don't forget, we're also going into a new company that has other business lines, other opportunities for growth other than traditional prepaid and postpaid.

Fortunately, we've been able to obtain some very large offsets to that. Notably, among other things, we've had a significant decrease in our long-distance expense. This is something that's a continual quest for our engineering teams to see how we can drive potential costs out of the business, items such as direct connect with wireless peers, and hitting certain volume targets to obtain more and better pricing, really, into what we're doing from a long-distance standpoint. So that's a piece of it. The second piece of it is a decrease in taxes and regulatory fees. Again, we're very, very focused on obtaining the correct, right and fair amount of taxes and regulatory fees. We're very active on a state and local basis about helping drive legislation, and we've seen some definite improvements in certain large jurisdictions that we do business in that help contribute to that offset."

This has been an incredible storm, and we wish you the very best. I'm very pleased with this quarter's strong adjusted EBITDA and year-over-year decline in churn. The strength of our third quarter earnings, highlighted by the highest consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin in company history, was primarily driven by our focus on generating adjusted EBITDA and cash flow over subscriber growth.
Late in the third quarter, with new affordable 4G LTE handsets in our portfolio, we launched our 4G LTE For All offerings. This launch, highlighted by a $55 unlimited service plan, transformed the wireless experience for no contract offerings. We have recently surpassed the 1.25 million LTE subscriber mark, and our leadership in 4G LTE in the no contract service continues. Demand for high-speed wireless service is strong with our 4G network and smartphones. We believe we have an opportunity to upgrade our existing customer base and expand our market share. We currently offer a number of 4G LTE smartphones, and we recently introduced the GALAXY Samsung S III. Availability of lower-cost 4G LTE smartphones is in part due to an increasing number of handsets utilizing the QUALCOMM 8960 chipset family. This standardization is a major positive, as it will enable decreasing unit costs over time and we believe lower subsidization levels in the future.  Additionally, we are leading North America in the deployment of 2 technologies that work with our 4G LTE network, Voice over LTE or VoLTE and Rich Communication Services or RCS. We are now working to enable the deployment of VoLTE across our entire network and into our handset line up. Not only does VoLTE provide superior call quality, it also enables our efficient use of spectrum and re-firming of CDMA spectrum to 4G LTE over time.
We are also introducing for the first time in the Americas RCS on our LTE network, which supports social presence, simultaneous voice communication with multimedia messaging, as well as other advanced data services. We plan to launch RCS service tomorrow, and we believe that RCS will significantly differentiate our premium 4G LTE service from our competitors' 3G data offerings.
Our technology path is clear, as the entire wireless industry is now moving towards 4G LTE, which MetroPCS pioneered in the United States 2 years ago. With 4G LTE For All launch, we are now positioned to focus on reenergizing subscriber growth. We will continue to compete aggressively, utilizing our RCS services and compelling 4G LTE For All service plans. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I'd also like to echo your comments about personal safety and wish a swift and steady recovery for those up in the Northeast. This morning, my comments will focus on our third quarter results, the launch of our 4G LTE For All and our promotional activity heading into the fourth quarter. Building on the strategy we executed in the second quarter, our focus during this quarter was generating adjusted EBITDA and cash flow over subscriber acquisition. I'm pleased to report strong adjusted EBITDA and the highest adjusted EBITDA margin in company history of 41.5%. This financial performance was driven by lower handset subsidies and moderated marketing spend. In the quarter, gross addition activity declined year-over-year and totaled 692,000 for the quarter. Churn in the quarter declined significantly on a year-over-year basis, down 80 basis points to 3.7%. We're pleased with the improvement in churn this quarter, and we believe that was driven by improved customer experience through investments in our network and lower year-to-date subscriber growth.
During the third quarter, approximately 62% of total handsets sold were smartphones, and approximately 50% of total subscribers were on a smartphone plan at the end of the third quarter. Family plan penetration at the end of the quarter was 40%. In late August, we introduced our 4G LTE For All initiatives. As the marketing and messaging around this initiative ramps, we have already covered approximately 97% of our entire CDMA footprint, with 4G LTE base stations. As part of our launch, we also introduced a promotional 4G LTE unlimited talk, text and data plan priced at $55. This plan provides subscribers with an unlimited, unthrottled wireless broadband experience. Since launching 4G LTE For All, interest in 4G has increased, and approximately 40% of all gross additions in September were 4G subscribers. Of those gross additions, over 70% were taking the promotional $55 service plan, which is accretive to ARPU.
At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 1.1 million 4G subscribers, which equates to 12% of our subscriber base. We continued to see a churn profile developing on our 4G LTE customers that is approximately 100 basis points better versus our consolidated churn. Total 4G upgrade activity is strong at 123% in the third quarter, with much of that activity coming in September. From August to September, the percentage of upgrades moving to 4G phones nearly doubled and through the middle of October, accounted for nearly 70% of total upgrades. Historically, fourth quarter subscriber activity has been heavily weighted towards the back end. Additionally, with 4G LTE For All promotional activity running through the entire quarter, we expect incremental pressure on both CPGA and CPU, which will impact adjusted EBITDA. 
In early October, we launched a promotional 4G LTE plan, which includes unlimited talk, text and 250 megabytes of 4G data for $30 a month. We believe this promotional $30 4G LTE service plan will generate excitement and increase the opportunity for retail door swings, as consumers shop for wireless value, coupled with 4G speeds during this holiday-driven quarter.
We are excited about the services and value we offer in the marketplace, and we believe our customers are truly experiencing a premium service value with our industry-leading 4G LTE network.  Now I'll turn the call over to Braxton."

Our third quarter results demonstrate the ability of our business to generate significant cash flows. With lower promotional activity during most of the third quarter, we generated strong adjusted EBITDA of $466 million and the highest adjusted EBITDA margin in company history at 41.5%. We ended the quarter with approximately 9 million total subscribers. Churn for the quarter was 3.7%, down 80 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2011. This decline in churn was primarily driven by continued investments in our network and lower year-to-date subscriber growth. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, and we have substantial liquidity with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter.
Our total leverage as of September 30, 2012, was approximately 3x computed in accordance with the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes. We believe our maturity schedule is very manageable with our first substantial maturity of approximately $1 billion coming due in November 2016. Our weighted average cost of debt for the third quarter was approximately 5.8%. The majority of our debt is fixed by its nature or through interest rate swaps. We believe we are very well positioned from a balance sheet perspective.
Our third quarter 2012 ARPU was $40.50, down $0.30 on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year decrease in ARPU was primarily attributable to promotional service plans, partially offset by continued demand for our 4G LTE service plans. For the third quarter, our CPGA was $202, up $8 over the third quarter of 2011. This year-over-year increase is primarily driven by a 47% decrease in gross adds as compared to the 3 months ended September 30, 2011.  With the introduction of 4G LTE For All late in the third quarter, we do not expect the traditional decrease in CPGA during the fourth quarter.
Our CPU for the quarter was $18.38 as compared to $19.52 in the prior-year's third quarter. This year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in retention expense for existing customers, a decrease in long-distance costs and a decrease in taxes and regulatory fees. These items were partially offset by an increase in costs associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade and the increase in commissions paid to independent retailers for customer reactivations.
During the quarter, we experienced $2.47 in CPU directly related to handset upgrades compared to $3.88 in the prior year's third quarter and compared to $3.06 in the second quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $466 million, an increase of 42% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 41.5%.  Over the first 9 months of 2012, we generated over $1.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA compared to approximately $970 million in the first 9 months of 2011, representing an increase of 24%. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have generated approximately $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA, a record for the company. With the launch of 4G LTE For All, we expect adjusted EBITDA to decrease sequentially as a result of lower subscribers, promotional activities and the higher upgrades given our new and improved 4G LTE handset offerings, which will pressure CPU and translate into higher CPGA.
I'd now like to highlight a few items from the income statement and cash flow statement.  In the third quarter, our service revenue and cost of service decreased 1% and 2%, respectively, to approximately $1.1 billion and $373 million, respectively, over the same quarter in 2011. We generated $392 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter. We incurred capital expenditures of $262 million during the third quarter. Year-to-date, we've spent a total of $588 million in capital expenditures.
Unlevered free cash flow on an LTM basis was $789 million and totaled $204 million for the third quarter of 2012. We generated $193 million in consolidated net income during the third quarter. This amount includes a $53 million gain on settlement related to certain securities that was recognized during the quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the gain on settlement, net income would have been $140 million or $0.38 per common share for the third quarter of 2012 and $69 million or $0.19 per share in the prior year's third quarter, representing year-over-year growth in net income of over 100%. We reaffirm our full year 2012 guidance for capital expenditures of $900 million to $1 billion.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Roger."

Before we begin the Q&A, I want to talk about some recent events here at MetroPCS. These are exciting times in the wireless industry with our successful introduction of the first commercial 4G LTE service in the U.S., now comprising over 12% of our subscriber base. With the service launch, our customer experience evolved from voice-centric to a broadband data-centric experience. This focus on high-speed wireless data required a 4G LTE network. With our recently announced combination with T-Mobile, we have the opportunity to provide an unparalleled 4G LTE experience.
I want to discuss 4 points about the compelling proposed combination of MetroPCS with T-Mobile USA. First spectrum, we have spent the last couple of years looking to add spectrum to our current holdings. Combining our spectrum with T-Mobile's spectrum portfolio is a significant strategic benefit in this transaction. In our current coverage areas, we have an average of 22 megahertz of spectrum. Following this transaction, MetroPCS' major metropolitan areas will have an average of 83 megahertz of spectrum, almost a four-fold improvement. Importantly, it also provides combined company with a path to offer 4G LTE on the AWS band over a 20x20 megahertz channel in a number of major metropolitan areas, including New York City, Los Angeles, Dallas and San Francisco, to name a few. With this enhanced spectrum position, combined with MetroPCS's DAS coverage in urban areas, network performance and capacity significantly increases. This will enable a true broadband customer experience, and will provide for greater in-building coverage.
Nationwide coverage. Currently, MetroPCS serves approximately 102 million POPs. When customers travel outside that footprint, we pay other carriers' roaming fees. In combination with T-Mobile, our combined networks will serve more than 280 million POPs. This national platform will be a great value to MetroPCS customers and will enable superior cost metrics.
Market expansion. We lost -- we launched our last major metropolitan areas in 2009 with New York City and Boston. With the combination, we can bring the MetroPCS model not only to geographical areas that have limited pay-in-advance no contract wireless offerings, but we can also expand nationally, utilizing the T-Mobile network. This expansion creates a value leader within the fastest-growing part of the wireless industry. At close, with greatly expanded distribution, we are uniquely positioned to leverage the expansion of our business model.
Synergies. There are estimated to be 5 billion to 6 billion in network synergies and approximately 1 billion in non-network synergies, which in total, provide for 6 billion to 7 billion in total estimated synergies. Network synergies are driven primarily by the decommissioning of 10,500 macro sites. After closing, by utilizing the T-Mobile network for new MetroPCS-branded customers, there will be reduced CapEx, as well as roaming expense. Looking forward, MetroPCS 4G LTE customers will be able to utilize the new combined 4G LTE network. With our historically rapid upgrade rates and organic churn, our subscriber base can quickly migrate to the NewCo network.
Finally, MetroPCS' disruptive business model, coupled with T-Mobile's strategic challenger initiative, provides a tremendous platform for growth. I'm excited about this proposed combination, which creates the leading value carrier in the U.S.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator?"

One thing I noticed, I was going back over some numbers and if we go back to Q3 2010, we were in the $39.70 range for ARPU.

One thing I noticed, I was going back over some numbers and if we go back to Q3 2010, we were in the $39.70 range for ARPU. So over the last 2 years, we've been able actually to increase ARPU, on average, about $0.81 over the last 24 months. So I think, as the handset lineup moves to a more LTE-defined network, we're going to see more people utilizing the rate plans that we have. We've put the $30 rate plan out there as promotional, and we believe it really does help door swings. We've seen some very nice trending off of that. We obviously want our customers to utilize the network, but remember, it only comes with 250 megabits of 4G data. So once they get there, we think it's actually an opportunity to springboard to higher rate plans once they understand what the device can do and how they benefit from the network. So we think that could be a long-term positive. But again, with just rolling that out, it's really too early to tell what any impact is. We've certainly seen, we think, good traction, as Braxton has mentioned before, on the $25 rate plan. It has really good economics on the network. It comes with no data on the feature phone, and we think that gives us a really good farm team  promotion. And as mentioned, a large percentage of our new recruits on the 4G network are taking the $55 rate plan, which means that there's a great traction around that. Our challenge in the fourth quarter, as always, is to stay relevant and get our message out there. So rate plans, I think, will lead to stabilized ARPU, but it's really difficult to tell you what each individual rate plan will do for us. It's going to be a mixture."

Today, we have some limitations on roaming, and the data rates that subscribers have as they go into or off network services. So we can certainly take those limitations away. I think one of the 2 major pieces is that by the time we do have a combination, we'll be well along collectively on the LTE network build. So I think that if we look past the 2013, where we will have the LTE network nationwide, I think there will be a substantial price opportunity reduction for handsets in that time frame, also that we expect that we can put our -- or transpose our business model into areas, which as we mentioned, or I mentioned before today, that either don't have our model or we think are great opportunities to introduce our business model. But I think as far as what network we operate on, which I think is the substance of your question, Craig. The -- I think we have 2 elements. One is the LTE network, but we also have a high-speed 3G network, which we believe corresponds also with some significant cost reduction on the GSM HSPA platform relative to what we've been spending on the CDMA platform.

And as Roger had mentioned, we've been off of our marketing spend in the third quarter, and that's going to ramp up in the fourth quarter as we spoke about. So we think we have some areas to grow organically just on our own markets. The other side of it is we think there's maybe 25 million to 50 million new covered POPs outside of our marketplaces, green fields, if you will. But since we haven't had license covered areas that we can take our distribution, our model in NewCo and use that to grow our brand, while the postpaid side of the house works on stabilization and doing the things that they need to do.

So we're really leveraging a fixed cost to provide, I think, a real ROI opportunity for expansion of this brand in a cost leadership, price leadership way, but I think it's also worth noting that we also believe that NewCo is on the path to reestablish growth in the contractor postpaid area. It certainly has been difficult a couple of years, but with over $4 billion worth of network investments with the challenge or strategy, with a robust handset lineup that continues to improve, we believe that T-Mobile legacy is on the path of stabilization in future quarters of the postpaid part of business, and that will turn to growth once the LTE network is laid out. So it's really a holistic view, and don't forget, we're also going into a new company that has other business lines, other opportunities for growth other than traditional prepaid and postpaid.

So I think -- I don't get off point here that the Lifeline customers, I think, right now are certainly in the very lowest end of the range, but we will want to provide offerings as we have now promotionally at the $30 range, and then on top of that, provide RCS service, which I think is quite attractive and it provides a new range of utility for the phone. So it gives an opportunity for those individuals who do have the resources to step up into a service, which we think is not that far distance from, shall we say, the nominal Lifeline subscriber."

Fortun",187,"Jennifer, on your cost of service question, we certainly have had increased cost of service related to deploying the LTE network both from a rental expense standpoint for any site enhancements, as well as additional backhaul being layered in place. Fortunately, we've been able to obtain some very large offsets to that. Notably, among other things, we've had a significant decrease in our long-distance expense. This is something that's a continual quest for our engineering teams to see how we can drive potential costs out of the business, items such as direct connect with wireless peers, and hitting certain volume targets to obtain more and better pricing, really, into what we're doing from a long-distance standpoint. So that's a piece of it. The second piece of it is a decrease in taxes and regulatory fees. Again, we're very, very focused on paying the correct, right and fair amount of taxes and regulatory fees. We're very active on a state and local basis about helping drive legislation, and we've seen some definite improvements in certain large jurisdictions that we do business in that help contribute to that offset."

This has been an incredible storm, and we wish you the very best. I'm very pleased with this quarter's strong adjusted EBITDA and year-over-year decline in churn. The strength of our third quarter earnings, highlighted by the highest consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin in company history, was primarily driven by our focus on generating adjusted EBITDA and cash flow over subscriber growth.
Late in the third quarter, with new affordable 4G LTE handsets in our portfolio, we launched our 4G LTE For All offerings. This launch, highlighted by a $55 unlimited service plan, transformed the wireless experience for no contract offerings. We have recently surpassed the 1.25 million LTE subscriber mark, and our leadership in 4G LTE in the no contract service continues. Demand for high-speed wireless service is strong with our 4G network and smartphones. We believe we have an opportunity to upgrade our existing customer base and expand our market share. We currently offer a number of 4G LTE smartphones, and we recently introduced the GALAXY Samsung S III. Availability of lower-cost 4G LTE smartphones is in part due to an increasing number of handsets utilizing the QUALCOMM 8960 chipset family. This standardization is a major positive, as it will enable decreasing unit costs over time and we believe lower subsidization levels in the future. Additionally, we are leading North America in the deployment of 2 technologies that work with our 4G LTE network, Voice over LTE or VoLTE and Rich Communication Services or RCS. We are now working to enable the deployment of VoLTE across our entire network and into our handset line up. Not only does VoLTE provide superior call quality, it also enables our efficient use of spectrum and re-firming of CDMA spectrum to 4G LTE over time.
We are also introducing for the first time in the Americas RCS on our LTE network, which supports social presence, simultaneous voice communication with multimedia messaging, as well as other advanced data services. We plan to launch RCS service tomorrow, and we believe that RCS will significantly differentiate our premium 4G LTE service from our competitors' 3G data offerings.
Our technology path is clear, as the entire wireless industry is now moving towards 4G LTE, which MetroPCS pioneered in the United States 2 years ago. With 4G LTE For All launch, we are now positioned to focus on reenergizing subscriber growth. We will continue to compete aggressively, utilizing our RCS services and compelling 4G LTE For All service plans. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I'd also like to echo your comments about personal safety and wish a swift and steady recovery for those up in the Northeast. This morning, my comments will focus on our third quarter results, the launch of our 4G LTE For All and our promotional activity heading into the fourth quarter. Building on the strategy we executed in the second quarter, our focus during this quarter was generating adjusted EBITDA and cash flow over subscriber acquisition. I'm pleased to report strong adjusted EBITDA and the highest adjusted EBITDA margin in company history of 41.5%. This financial performance was driven by lower handset subsidies and moderated marketing spend. In the quarter, gross addition activity declined year-over-year and totaled 692,000 for the quarter. Churn in the quarter declined significantly on a year-over-year basis, down 80 basis points to 3.7%. We're pleased with the improvement in churn this quarter, and we believe that was driven by improved customer experience through investments in our network and lower year-to-date subscriber growth.
During the third quarter, approximately 62% of total handsets sold were smartphones, and approximately 50% of total subscribers were on a smartphone plan at the end of the third quarter. Family plan penetration at the end of the quarter was 40%. In late August, we introduced our 4G LTE For All initiatives. As the marketing and messaging around this initiative ramps, we have already covered approximately 97% of our entire CDMA footprint, with 4G LTE base stations. As part of our launch, we also introduced a promotional 4G LTE unlimited talk, text and data plan priced at $55. This plan provides subscribers with an unlimited, unthrottled wireless broadband experience. Since launching 4G LTE For All, interest in 4G has increased, and approximately 40% of all gross additions in September were 4G subscribers. Of those gross additions, over 70% were taking the promotional $55 service plan, which is accretive to ARPU.
At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 1.1 million 4G subscribers, which equates to 12% of our subscriber base. We continued to see a churn profile developing on our 4G LTE customers that is approximately 100 basis points better versus our consolidated churn. Total 4G upgrade activity is strong at 123% in the third quarter, with much of that activity coming in September. From August to September, the percentage of upgrades moving to 4G phones nearly doubled and through the middle of October, accounted for nearly 70% of total upgrades. Historically, fourth quarter subscriber activity has been heavily weighted towards the back end. Additionally, with 4G LTE For All promotional activity running through the entire quarter, we expect incremental pressure on both CPGA and CPU, which will impact adjusted EBITDA. 
In early October, we launched a promotional 4G LTE plan, which includes unlimited talk, text and 250 megabytes of 4G data for $30 a month. We believe this promotional $30 4G LTE service plan will generate excitement and increase the opportunity for retail door swings, as consumers shop for wireless value, coupled with 4G speeds during this holiday-driven quarter.
We are excited about the services and value we offer in the marketplace, and we believe our customers are truly experiencing a premium service value with our industry-leading 4G LTE network. Now I'll turn the call over to Braxton."

Our third quarter results demonstrate the ability of our business to generate significant cash flows. With lower promotional activity during most of the third quarter, we generated strong adjusted EBITDA of $466 million and the highest adjusted EBITDA margin in company history at 41.5%. We ended the quarter with approximately 9 million total subscribers. Churn for the quarter was 3.7%, down 80 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2011. This decline in churn was primarily driven by continued investments in our network and lower year-to-date subscriber growth. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, and we have substantial liquidity with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter.
Our total leverage as of September 30, 2012, was approximately 3x computed in accordance with the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes. We believe our maturity schedule is very manageable with our first substantial maturity of approximately $1 billion coming due in November 2016. Our weighted average cost of debt for the third quarter was approximately 5.8%. The majority of our debt is fixed by its nature or through interest rate swaps. We believe we are very well positioned from a balance sheet perspective.

The year-over-year decrease in ARPU was primarily attributable to promotional service plans, partially offset by continued demand for our 4G LTE service plans. For the third quarter, our CPGA was $202, up $8 over the third quarter of 2011. This year-over-year increase is primarily driven by a 47% decrease in gross adds as compared to the 3 months ended September 30, 2011. With the introduction of 4G LTE For All late in the third quarter, we do not expect the traditional decrease in CPGA during the fourth quarter.
Our CPU for the quarter was $18.38 as compared to $19.52 in the prior-year's third quarter. This year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in retention expense for existing customers, a decrease in long-distance costs and a decrease in taxes and regulatory fees. These items were partially offset by an increase in costs associated with our 4G LTE network upgrade and the increase in commissions paid to independent retailers for customer reactivations.
During the quarter, we experienced $2.47 in CPU directly related to handset upgrades compared to $3.88 in the prior year's third quarter and compared to $3.06 in the second quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $466 million, an increase of 42% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 41.5%. Over the first 9 months of 2012, we generated over $1.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA compared to approximately $970 million in the first 9 months of 2011, representing an increase of 24%. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have generated approximately $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA, a record for the company. With the launch of 4G LTE For All, we expect adjusted EBITDA to decrease sequentially as a result of lower subscribers, promotional activities and the higher upgrades given our new and improved 4G LTE handset offerings, which will pressure CPU and translate into higher CPGA.
I'd now like to highlight a few items from the income statement and cash flow statement. In the third quarter, our service revenue and cost of service decreased 1% and 2%, respectively, to approximately $1.1 billion and $373 million, respectively, over the same quarter in 2011. We generated $392 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter. We incurred capital expenditures of $262 million during the third quarter. Year-to-date, we've spent a total of $588 million in capital expenditures.
Unlevered free cash flow on an LTM basis was $789 million and totaled $204 million for the third quarter of 2012. We generated $193 million in consolidated net income during the third quarter. This amount includes a $53 million gain on settlement related to certain securities that was recognized during the quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the gain on settlement, net income would have been $140 million or $0.38 per common share for the third quarter of 2012 and $69 million or $0.19 per share in the prior year's third quarter, representing year-over-year growth in net income of over 100%. We reaffirm our full year 2012 guidance for capital expenditures of $900 million to $1 billion.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Roger."

Before we begin the Q&A, I want to talk about some recent events here at MetroPCS. These are exciting times in the wireless industry with our successful introduction of the first commercial 4G LTE service in the U.S., now comprising over 12% of our subscriber base. With the service launch, our customer experience evolved from voice-centric to a broadband data-centric experience. This focus on high-speed wireless data required a 4G LTE network. With our recently announced combination with T-Mobile, we have the opportunity to provide an unparalleled 4G LTE experience.
I want to discuss 4 points about the compelling proposed combination of MetroPCS with T-Mobile USA. First spectrum, we have spent the last couple of years looking to add spectrum to our current holdings. Combining our spectrum with T-Mobile's spectrum portfolio is a significant strategic benefit in this transaction. In our current coverage areas, we have an average of 22 megahertz of spectrum. Following this transaction, MetroPCS' major metropolitan areas will have an average of 83 megahertz of spectrum, almost a four-fold improvement. Importantly, it also provides combined company with a path to offer 4G LTE on the AWS band over a 20x20 megahertz channel in a number of major metropolitan areas, including New York City, Los Angeles, Dallas and San Francisco, to name a few. With this enhanced spectrum position, combined with MetroPCS's DAS coverage in urban areas, network performance and capacity significantly increases. This will enable a true broadband customer experience, and will provide for greater in-building coverage.
Nationwide coverage. Currently, MetroPCS serves approximately 102 million POPs. When customers travel outside that footprint, we pay other carriers' roaming fees. In combination with T-Mobile, our combined networks will serve more than 280 million POPs. This national platform will be a great value to MetroPCS customers and will enable superior cost metrics.
Market expansion. We lost -- we launched our last major metropolitan areas in 2009 with New York City and Boston. With the combination, we can bring the MetroPCS model not only to geographical areas that have limited pay-in-advance no contract wireless offerings, but we can also expand nationally, utilizing the T-Mobile network. This expansion creates a value leader within the fastest-growing part of the wireless industry. At close, with greatly expanded distribution, we are uniquely positioned to leverage the expansion of our business model.
Synergies. There are estimated to be 5 billion to 6 billion in network synergies and approximately 1 billion in non-network synergies, which in total, provide for 6 billion to 7 billion in total estimated synergies. Network synergies are driven primarily by the decommissioning of 10,500 macro sites. After closing, by utilizing the T-Mobile network for new MetroPCS-branded customers, there will be reduced CapEx, as well as roaming expense. Looking forward, MetroPCS 4G LTE customers will be able to utilize the new combined 4G LTE network. With our historically rapid upgrade rates and organic churn, our subscriber base can quickly migrate to the NewCo network.
Finally, MetroPCS' disruptive business model, coupled with T-Mobile's strategic challenger initiative, provides a tremendous platform for growth. I'm excited about this proposed combination, which creates the leading value carrier in the U.S.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator?"

One thing I noticed, I was going back over some numbers and if we go back to Q3 2010, we were in the $39.70 range for ARPU.

One thing I noticed, I was going back over some numbers and if we go back to Q3 2010, we were in the $39.70 range for ARPU. So over the last 2 years, we've been able actually to increase ARPU, on average, about $0.81 over the last 24 months. So I think, as the handset lineup moves to a more LTE-defined network, we're going to see more people utilizing the rate plans that we have. We've put the $30 rate plan out there as promotional, and we believe it really does help door swings. We've seen some very nice trending off of that. We obviously want our customers to utilize the network, but remember, it only comes with 250 megabits of 4G data. So once they get there, we think it's actually an opportunity to springboard to higher rate plans once they understand what the device can do and how they benefit from the network. So we think that could be a long-term positive. But again, with just rolling that out, it's really too early to tell what any impact is. We've certainly seen, we think, good traction, as Braxton has mentioned before, on the $25 rate plan. It has really good economics on the network. It comes with no data on the feature phone, and we think that gives us a really good farm team promotion. And as mentioned, a large percentage of our new recruits on the 4G network are taking the $55 rate plan, which means that there's a great traction around that. Our challenge in the fourth quarter, as always, is to stay relevant and get our message out there. So rate plans, I think, will lead to stabilized ARPU, but it's really difficult to tell you what each individual rate plan will do for us. It's going to be a mixture."

I think one of the 2 major pieces is that by the time we do have a combination, we'll be well along collectively on the LTE network build. So I think that if we look past the 2013, where we will have the LTE network nationwide, I think there will be a substantial price opportunity reduction for handsets in that time frame, also that we expect that we can put our -- or transpose our business model into areas, which as we mentioned, or I mentioned before today, that either don't have our model or we think are great opportunities to introduce our business model. But I think as far as what network we operate on, which I think is the substance of your question, Craig. The -- I think we have 2 elements. One is the LTE network, but we also have a high-speed 3G network, which we believe corresponds also with some significant cost reduction on the GSM HSPA platform relative to what we've been spending on the CDMA platform.

So we think we have some areas to grow organically just on our own markets. The other side of it is we think there's maybe 25 million to 50 million new covered POPs outside of our marketplaces, green fields, if you will. But since we haven't had license covered areas that we can take our distribution, our model in NewCo and use that to grow our brand, while the postpaid side of the house works on stabilization and doing the things that they need to do.

So we're really leveraging a fixed cost to provide, I think, a real ROI opportunity for expansion of this brand in a cost leadership, price leadership way, but I think it's also worth noting that we also believe that NewCo is on the path to reestablish growth in the contractor postpaid area. It certainly has been difficult a couple of years, but with over $4 billion worth of network investments with the challenge or strategy, with a robust handset lineup that continues to improve, we believe that T-Mobile legacy is on the path of stabilization in future quarters of the postpaid part of business, and that will turn to growth once the LTE network is laid out. So it's really a holistic view, and don't forget, we're also going into a new company that has other business lines, other opportunities for growth other than traditional prepaid and postpaid.

I think there's going to be a number of resets, as you say, because there will be, I think, renewed interest at the FCC as to how they are paying for these customers, and there will be audits, and we would expect there'd be opportunity to fall off of that. I think the crux of what we have said is that I think we see our way through a very cost efficient network design as we go through into '13. And then, certainly, the question about NewCo, with the 20x20 channel for LTE service, that does bring about some significant opportunities for network efficiencies that we have not been able to realize typically on a 5x5 or less frequency. So I think -- I don't get off point here that the Lifeline customers, I think, right now are certainly in the very lowest end of the range, but we will want to provide offerings as we have now promotionally at the $30 range, and then on top of that, provide RCS service, which I think is quite attractive and it provides a new range of utility for the phone. So it gives an opportunity for those individuals who do have the resources to step up into a service, which we think is not that far distance from, shall we say, the nominal Lifeline subscriber."

Fortun",187,"Jennifer, on your cost of service question, we certainly have had increased cost of service related to deploying the LTE network both from a rental expense standpoint for any site enhancements, as well as additional backhaul being layered in place. Fortunately, we've been able to obtain some very large offsets to that. Notably, among other things, we've had a significant decrease in our long-distance expense. This is something that's a continual quest for our engineering teams to see how we can drive potential costs out of the business, items such as direct connect with wireless peers, and hitting certain volume targets to obtain more and better pricing, really, into what we're doing from a long-distance standpoint. So that's a piece of it. The second piece of it is a decrease in taxes and regulatory fees. Again, we're very, very focused on paying the correct, right and fair amount of taxes and regulatory fees. We're very active on a state and local basis about helping drive legislation, and we've seen some definite improvements in certain large jurisdictions that we do business in that help contribute to that offset."

We have top-up ability for our subscribers to increase their data package during the -- anytime during the month or they can upgrade to another plan. On the unlimited plan, the range is pretty much in the 2 to 2.5-gigabyte range. So we know that there's roughly 10x the magnitude of usage if people just were unbridled. So the $30 package is really meant to give the people, give our customers that is, service, and then they can select the package for their habits, individual habits. But we will, and if I can just emphasis that with the introduction of RCS services that we will have on a single handset by tomorrow launch, but on our entire lineup of new handsets, up to 10 handsets by November 15 of this year that we will a platform, whereby, most people have used their PC for Skype for video calling. That is one of the features which we call VoWiFi or voice over WiFi that will be available to these handsets with RCS, with a portable video calling device within the WiFi range.

And then lastly, I think to Jennifer's point, Lifeline, there is a day of reckoning out there, and from what we can tell, there's a little bit of noise on the hill that we need to get this program right. And when that does happen, there could be an opportunity for people to ""right size their service provider"" and move to a platform that gives them what they need, but yet, on a program that might be compliant. So those are the trends, what we see."

We think we're in a place where we can start scaling that investment fairly significantly. And again, assuming growth profiles consistent with the past, we think there's an opportunity to get to the mid-30s from a margin potential with this model. Of course,, if you grew more rapidly, you're going to have more pressure. If you grow a little less rapidly, you'd have higher margins."

When you're looking year-over-year, part of this volume, we did 12% base in the third quarter of '11. This year, we did 9% of the base. But year-over-year, there's also a significant difference in the amount of subsidization that happened on a handset basis. If you remember, earlier on the year, we said that for the second and third quarter, we were going to emphasize cash flows and margins versus growth. So across the board, we raised handset prices and have incurred less subsidy, and that's really a very key driver here. And when you look sequentially, Q2 to Q3, where volumes were fairly equivalent as a percentage of the base, the biggest driver there is overall increases in pricing."

First of all, we go back on tablet space, and I don't know that there's been a device in CE history that had a margin compression any quicker over time outside of the iPad, obviously, everybody trying to come into the tablet space. Our view today is that devices like the Galaxy Note, Galaxy Note II, they're in the 5, 5.3-inch, actually serve that dual purpose. We've just seen the iPad go from 10 down to 7.3. So I think there's a collapsing of tablet size. It actually might lend itself actually to having voice on the tablet. We'd much rather prefer not to just have a tablet that's WiFi, number one. That's just an accessory margin that we don't think fits well on our model. If we ever got to a tablet, we'd have to have a tablet on LTE obviously, and we have yet to see a device that we like in that space.
