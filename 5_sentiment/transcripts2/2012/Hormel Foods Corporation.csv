We announced first quarter earnings this morning of $0.48 per share, down 13% from a year ago. During the quarter, we experienced weak pork operating margins and soft sales in the center of the store. Nonetheless, our current performance represents the second best quarter in our company's history. And terms of the top line, we generated sales increase of 6% with gains in 4 of our 5 business segments. Although total volumes declined 2%, the majority of the decline was due to a planned reduction in our harvest levels at our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment. 
As you may recall from our November conference call, we had anticipated a challenging start to 2012. Though our overall results were not surprising, how we got there wasn't exactly as we had planned. Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment performed than we had expected and International turned into good quarter. While our Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products and Specialty Foods segments did not perform as well as we had anticipated.
I will now take you through each segment. 
For Grocery Products, segment profit decreased 9% on 3% lower sales. These results were prompted by significant input cost inflation and by decreased sales of our core products. We have encountered some sluggishness as consumers adjust to higher prices. Despite these this conditions, we are seeing continued growth of our MegaMex product line. Sales of Don Miguel products and the Wholly Guacamole refrigerated dips registered the biggest growth gain. Sales of our Hormel Compleats declined slightly during the quarter as our new advertising campaign and the new product varieties and packaging have not yet been fully implemented at the store level. 
Our Refrigerated Foods segment reported a 44% decline in operating profit, due primarily to unfavorable pork operating margins. You may recall that pork operating margins were particularly strong during our first quarter a year ago. Higher raw material costs also negatively impacted margins in our Meat Products group during the quarter. 
Sales for our Refrigerated Foods grew 7% in the quarter led on the Retail side by Hormel's Sliced Pepperoni, Hormel Country Crock Side Dishes and Hormel Natural Choice deli meats. Foodservice sales were also higher with solid gains from Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, AUSTIN BLUES barbecue products and Caf√© H ethnic products. 
Operating profit at our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment increased 4% on a sales increase of 4% driven primarily by expanded sales of our retail value added products. Sales of our Jennie-O Turkey Store fresh tray pack items and turkey burgers were particularly strong as we continue to benefit from our Make the Switch advertising campaign late last year. We reduced our harvest volumes during the quarter in order to better balance our turkey meat supplies. Export demand also remains strong supporting dark meat prices during the quarter. 
Our Specialty Foods segment operating profit declined 4% in the quarter as higher raw material and freight cost negatively impact results. Sales by our Specialty Foods segment grew 14% during the quarter led by nutritional products, private label canned meat and gelatin dessert products. 
In our All Other international segment, operating profit grew by 25% on a 17% increase in sales. We enjoyed strong exports of fresh pork and sales growth in our SPAM family of products. We also saw improved results at our Purefoods Hormel joint venture in the Philippines. 
As we stated in our Fourth Quarter Conference Call, we anticipated a more difficult operating environment in 2012 and for comparisons to be more challenging the first half and to become more favorable in the back half. We look for pork operating margins to slowly improve as the year proceeds. Grain cost will remain volatile this year but we expect our team at Jennie-O Turkey Store to continue to do a good job of maintaining margins.
We are optimistic that sales in our Grocery Products segment and our Meat Products group will improve during the remainder of the year as our Hormel and SPAM brand advertising campaigns gear up. We expect our Foodservice Group to build upon their solid start this year as the foodservice industry shows gradual improvement. We are looking for better results from our Specialty Foods segment going forward as sales should continue to grow and the pricing we have implemented takes effect. We also anticipate enhanced operational efficiencies will improve profitability later in the year. We expect continued growth from our International segment, which is benefiting from a positive export environment and from their branding and marketing effort. Taking all these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2012 earnings guidance range of $1.79 to $1.89 per share. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the first quarter."

Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 totaled $128.4 million or $0.48 per share compared to $148.8 million or $0.55 per share a year ago. Dollar sales for the first quarter totaled $2 billion compared to $1.9 billion last year, a 6% increase. Volume for the first quarter was 1.2 billion pounds down 2% from fiscal 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were 7.5% of sales, down slightly from 7.6% of sales last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to be between 7.5% and 8% of sales for the entire year. Interest and investment income was $1.6 million for the first quarter compared to $441,000 last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $6.6 million last year. With lower debt levels and decreased interest rates, we expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2012. 
Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 33.4% versus 34.7% in fiscal 2011. For a total fiscal 2012, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 264 million. The diluted weighted average numbers of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 270 million. We repurchased 380,000 shares of common stock during the first quarter, spending $11.1 million. We have 3 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. 
Total debt at the end of the quarter was $215 million compared to $350 million last year. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31 million, even with last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $115 million in fiscal 2012. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $29 million compared to $15 million last year. For fiscal 2012, we expect capital expenditures to be about $140 million to $150 million. We will be integrating the sales of Don Miguel Foods, part of our MegaMex Foods joint venture beginning with our fiscal third quarter. Our retail sales will take responsibility for representing this expanded Mexican foods portfolio and we will report these sales in our Grocery Products segment. Profits will continue to be accounted for us through equity and earnings in the Grocery Products segment. As a result, added sales from the Don Miguel integration for the second half of 2012 are estimated to be between $75 million and $85 million.

First of all, as many of the companies in the industry have had to push pricing, we certainly could be seeing consumer reaction to the pricing. Typically, over time, these consumers get used to both new shelf price and new feature price, volumes return to a more normalized levels. Secondly, it's really, in our case, there's certainly is a potential of some -- of a weather effect. The areas where we saw the biggest weakness within Grocery Products were our canned good franchises, which for example, in the prior-year the cold winter throughout the country more often we saw quite strong sales and that was where our biggest declines occurred this quarter. Really if you look at some of the other items within Grocery Products, Compleats were down but they were only down 3% on a volume basis. MegaMex was up 1% and that's not counting the Don Miguel sales, which as Jody did mention in the future will start counting within our total sales starting in the second half. And then lastly, we really have seen a mixed bag in terms of trends. There's no question that in terms of our total groceries results, that kind of tonnage that was delivered was a lower than we had hoped. But we had some areas that have very strong tonnage within the retail franchise. Our Natural Choice business did great during the quarter. We had good growth in Pepperoni and Country Crock. Jennie-O had a big double-digit increases in their tray pack and burger numbers. So if you get away from a center aisle areas, we are still seeing very sold volume growth."

We announced first quarter earnings this morning of $0.48 per share, down 13% from a year ago. During the quarter, we experienced weak pork operating margins and soft sales in the center of the store. Nonetheless, our current performance represents the second best quarter in our company's history. In terms of the top line, we generated a sales increase of 6% with gains in 4 of our 5 business segments. Although total volumes declined 2%, the majority of the decline was due to a planned reduction in harvest levels at our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment. 
As you may recall from our November conference call, we had anticipated a challenging start to 2012. Though our overall results were not surprising, how we got there wasn't exactly as we had planned. Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment performed better than we expected and International turned in a good quarter. While our Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products and Specialty Foods segments did not perform as well as we had anticipated.
I will now take you through each segment. 
For Grocery Products, segment profit decreased 9% on 3% lower sales. These results were prompted by significant input cost inflation and by decreased sales of our core products. We have encountered some sluggishness as consumers adjust to higher prices. Despite these conditions, we are seeing continued growth of our MegaMex product lines. Sales of Don Miguel products and the Wholly Guacamole refrigerated dips registered the biggest growth gain. Sales of our Hormel Compleats microwave meals declined slightly during the quarter as our new advertising campaign and the new product varieties and packaging have not yet been fully implemented at the store level. 
Our Refrigerated Foods segment reported a 44% decline in operating profit, due primarily to unfavorable pork operating margins. You may recall that pork operating margins were particularly strong during our first quarter a year ago. Higher raw material costs also negatively impacted margins in our Meat Products group during the quarter. 
Sales for our Refrigerated Foods grew 7% in the quarter led on the Retail side by Hormel's Sliced Pepperoni, Hormel Country Crock Side Dishes and Hormel Natural Choice deli meats. Foodservice sales were also higher with solid gains from Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, AUSTIN BLUES barbecue products and Caf√© H ethnic products. 
Operating profit at our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment increased 4% on a sales increase of 4% driven primarily by expanded sales of our retail value added products. Sales of our Jennie-O Turkey Store fresh tray pack items and turkey burgers were particularly strong as we continue to benefit from our Make the Switch advertising campaign late last year. We reduced our harvest volumes during the quarter in order to better balance our turkey meat supplies. Export demand also remains strong, supporting dark meat prices during the quarter. 
Our Specialty Foods segment operating profit declined 4% in the quarter as higher raw material and freight cost negatively impact results. Sales by our Specialty Foods segment grew 14% during the quarter led by nutritional products, private label canned meat and gelatin dessert products. 
In our All Other international segment, operating profit grew by 25% on a 17% increase in sales. We enjoyed strong exports of fresh pork and sales growth in our SPAM family of products. We also saw improved results at our Purefoods-Hormel joint venture in the Philippines. 
As we stated in our Fourth Quarter Conference Call, we anticipated a more difficult operating environment in 2012 and for comparisons to be more challenging in the first half and to become more favorable in the back half. We look for pork operating margins to slowly improve as the year proceeds. Grain cost will remain volatile this year, but we expect our team at Jennie-O Turkey Store to continue to do a good job of maintaining margins.
We are optimistic that sales in our Grocery Products segment and our Meat Products group will improve during the remainder of the year as our Hormel and SPAM brand advertising campaigns gear up. We expect our Foodservice Group to build upon their solid start this year as the foodservice industry shows gradual improvement. We are looking for better results from our Specialty Foods segment going forward as sales should continue to grow and the pricing we have implemented takes effect. We also anticipate enhanced operational efficiencies will improve profitability later in the year. We expect continued growth from our International segment, which is benefiting from a positive export environment and from their branding and marketing efforts. Taking all these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2012 earnings guidance range of $1.79 to $1.89 per share. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the first quarter."

Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 totaled $128.4 million or $0.48 per share compared to $148.8 million or $0.55 per share a year ago. Dollar sales for the first quarter totaled $2 billion compared to $1.9 billion last year, a 6% increase. Volume for the first quarter was 1.2 billion pounds, down 2% from fiscal 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were 7.5% of sales, down slightly from 7.6% of sales last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to be between 7.5% and 8% of sales for the entire year. Interest and investment income was $1.6 million for the first quarter compared to $441,000 last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $6.6 million last year. With lower debt levels and decreased interest rates, we expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2012. 
Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 33.4% versus 34.7% in fiscal 2011. For total fiscal 2012, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 264 million. The diluted weighted average numbers of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 270 million. We repurchased 380,000 shares of common stock during the first quarter, spending $11.1 million. We have 3 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. 
Total debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million compared to $350 million last year. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31 million, even with last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $115 million in fiscal 2012. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $29 million compared to $15 million last year. For fiscal 2012, we expect capital expenditures to be about $140 million to $150 million. We will be integrating the sales of Don Miguel Foods, part of our MegaMex Foods joint venture beginning with our fiscal third quarter. Our retail sales force will take responsibility for representing this expanded Mexican foods portfolio and we will report these sales in our Grocery Products segment. Profits will continue to be accounted for, a few equity in earnings, in the Grocery Products segment. As a result, added sales from the Don Miguel integration for the second half of 2012 are estimated to be between $75 million and $85 million.

First of all, as many of the companies in the industry have had to push pricing, we certainly could be seeing consumer reaction to the pricing. Typically, over time, these consumers get used to both the new shelf price and new feature price, volumes return to a more normalized levels. Secondly, it's really -- in our case, there's certainly is a potential of some -- of a weather effect. The areas where we saw the biggest weakness within Grocery Products were our canned good franchises, which for example, in the prior-year when there was a cold winter throughout the country and people were eating at home more often, we saw quite strong sales and that was where our biggest declines occurred this quarter. Really, if you look at some of the other items within Grocery Products, Compleats were down, but they were only down 3% on a volume basis. MegaMex was up 1% and that's not counting the Don Miguel sales, which as Jody mentioned, in the future will start counting within our total sales starting in the second half. And then lastly, we really have seen a mixed bag in terms of trends. There's no question that in terms of our total groceries results, that kind of tonnage that was delivered was lower than we had hoped. But we had some areas of very strong tonnage within the retail franchise. Our Natural Choice business did great during the quarter, we had good growth in Pepperoni and Country Crock, Jennie-O had big double-digit increases in their tray pack and burger numbers. So if you get away from some of the center aisle areas, we are still seeing very sold volume growth."

The 2 acquisitions that the joint venture has been subsequently made, Don Miguel and Fresherized Foods, to this date have not been reflected in sales.

We will be selling it through our sales force and running it through our invoicing system and our distribution system.

So we have a high degree of confidence that as we phase out of the Country Crock brand, again, we won't miss a beat and the consumers will understand the product. And in a way, it will actually probably help us in the long run because we're selling it right with our Hormel Entr√©es and so it allows us to promote them with the same brand name. So we're in good shape with that, but we still have the yield price. They'll see the Country Crock on there for at least a little while longer."

We announced first quarter earnings this morning of $0.48 per share, down 13% from a year ago. During the quarter, we experienced weak pork operating margins and soft sales in the center of the store. Nonetheless, our current performance represents the second best quarter in our company's history. And terms of the top line, we generated sales increase of 6% with gains in 4 of our 5 business segments. Although total volumes declined 2%, the majority of the decline was due to a planned reduction in our harvest levels at our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment. 
As you may recall from our November conference call, we had anticipated a challenging start to 2012. Though our overall results were not surprising, how we got there wasn't exactly as we had planned. Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment performed than we had expected and International turned into good quarter. While our Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products and Specialty Foods segments did not perform as well as we had anticipated.
I will now take you through each segment. 
For Grocery Products, segment profit decreased 9% on 3% lower sales. These results were prompted by significant input cost inflation and by decreased sales of our core products. We have encountered some sluggishness as consumers adjust to higher prices. Despite these this conditions, we are seeing continued growth of our MegaMex product line. Sales of Don Miguel products and the Wholly Guacamole refrigerated dips registered the biggest growth gain. Sales of our Hormel Compleats declined slightly during the quarter as our new advertising campaign and the new product varieties and packaging have not yet been fully implemented at the store level. 
Our Refrigerated Foods segment reported a 44% decline in operating profit, due primarily to unfavorable pork operating margins. You may recall that pork operating margins were particularly strong during our first quarter a year ago. Higher raw material costs also negatively impacted margins in our Meat Products group during the quarter. 
Sales for our Refrigerated Foods grew 7% in the quarter led on the Retail side by Hormel's Sliced Pepperoni, Hormel Country Crock Side Dishes and Hormel Natural Choice deli meats. Foodservice sales were also higher with solid gains from Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, AUSTIN BLUES barbecue products and Caf√© H ethnic products. 
Operating profit at our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment increased 4% on a sales increase of 4% driven primarily by expanded sales of our retail value added products. Sales of our Jennie-O Turkey Store fresh tray pack items and turkey burgers were particularly strong as we continue to benefit from our Make the Switch advertising campaign late last year. We reduced our harvest volumes during the quarter in order to better balance our turkey meat supplies. Export demand also remains strong supporting dark meat prices during the quarter. 
Our Specialty Foods segment operating profit declined 4% in the quarter as higher raw material and freight cost negatively impact results. Sales by our Specialty Foods segment grew 14% during the quarter led by nutritional products, private label canned meat and gelatin dessert products. 
In our All Other international segment, operating profit grew by 25% on a 17% increase in sales. We enjoyed strong exports of fresh pork and sales growth in our SPAM family of products. We also saw improved results at our Purefoods Hormel joint venture in the Philippines. 
As we stated in our Fourth Quarter Conference Call, we anticipated a more difficult operating environment in 2012 and for comparisons to be more challenging the first half and to become more favorable in the back half. We look for pork operating margins to slowly improve as the year proceeds. Grain cost will remain volatile this year but we expect our team at Jennie-O Turkey Store to continue to do a good job of maintaining margins.
We are optimistic that sales in our Grocery Products segment and our Meat Products group will improve during the remainder of the year as our Hormel and SPAM brand advertising campaigns gear up. We expect our Foodservice Group to build upon their solid start this year as the foodservice industry shows gradual improvement. We are looking for better results from our Specialty Foods segment going forward as sales should continue to grow and the pricing we have implemented takes effect. We also anticipate enhanced operational efficiencies will improve profitability later in the year. We expect continued growth from our International segment, which is benefiting from a positive export environment and from their branding and marketing effort. Taking all these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2012 earnings guidance range of $1.79 to $1.89 per share. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the first quarter."

Dollar sales for the first quarter totaled $2 billion compared to $1.9 billion last year, a 6% increase. Volume for the first quarter was 1.2 billion pounds down 2% from fiscal 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were 7.5% of sales, down slightly from 7.6% of sales last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to be between 7.5% and 8% of sales for the entire year. Interest and investment income was $1.6 million for the first quarter compared to $441,000 last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $6.6 million last year. With lower debt levels and decreased interest rates, we expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2012. 
Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 33.4% versus 34.7% in fiscal 2011. For a total fiscal 2012, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 264 million. The diluted weighted average numbers of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 270 million. We repurchased 380,000 shares of common stock during the first quarter, spending $11.1 million. We have 3 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. 
Total debt at the end of the quarter was $215 million compared to $350 million last year. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31 million, even with last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $115 million in fiscal 2012. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $29 million compared to $15 million last year. For fiscal 2012, we expect capital expenditures to be about $140 million to $150 million. We will be integrating the sales of Don Miguel Foods, part of our MegaMex Foods joint venture beginning with our fiscal third quarter. Our retail sales will take responsibility for representing this expanded Mexican foods portfolio and we will report these sales in our Grocery Products segment. Profits will continue to be accounted for us through equity and earnings in the Grocery Products segment. As a result, added sales from the Don Miguel integration for the second half of 2012 are estimated to be between $75 million and $85 million.

First of all, as many of the companies in the industry have had to push pricing, we certainly could be seeing consumer reaction to the pricing. Typically, over time, these consumers get used to both new shelf price and new feature price, volumes return to a more normalized levels. Secondly, it's really, in our case, there's certainly is a potential of some -- of a weather effect. The areas where we saw the biggest weakness within Grocery Products were our canned good franchises, which for example, in the prior-year the cold winter throughout the country more often we saw quite strong sales and that was where our biggest declines occurred this quarter. Really if you look at some of the other items within Grocery Products, Compleats were down but they were only down 3% on a volume basis. MegaMex was up 1% and that's not counting the Don Miguel sales, which as Jody did mention in the future will start counting within our total sales starting in the second half. And then lastly, we really have seen a mixed bag in terms of trends. There's no question that in terms of our total groceries results, that kind of tonnage that was delivered was a lower than we had hoped. But we had some areas that have very strong tonnage within the retail franchise. Our Natural Choice business did great during the quarter. We had good growth in Pepperoni and Country Crock. Jennie-O had a big double-digit increases in their tray pack and burger numbers. So if you get away from a center aisle areas, we are still seeing very sold volume growth."

We announced first quarter earnings this morning of $0.48 per share, down 13% from a year ago. During the quarter, we experienced weak pork operating margins and soft sales in the center of the store. Nonetheless, our current performance represents the second best quarter in our company's history. In terms of the top line, we generated a sales increase of 6% with gains in 4 out of our 5 business segments. Although total volumes declined 2%, the majority of the decline was due to a planned reduction in harvest levels at our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment. 
As you may recall from our November conference call, we had anticipated a challenging start to 2012. Though our overall results were not surprising, how we got there wasn't exactly as we had planned. Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment performed better than we expected and International turned in a good quarter, while our Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products and Specialty Foods segments did not perform as well as we had anticipated.
I will now take you through each segment. 
For Grocery Products, segment profit decreased 9% on 3% lower sales. These results were prompted by significant input cost inflation and by decreased sales of our core products. We have encountered some sluggishness as consumers adjust to higher prices. Despite these conditions, we are seeing continued growth of our MegaMex product lines. Sales of Don Miguel products and the Wholly Guacamole refrigerated dips registered the biggest growth gain. Sales of our Hormel Compleats microwave meals declined slightly during the quarter as our new advertising campaign and the new product varieties and packaging have not yet been fully implemented at the store level. 
Our Refrigerated Foods segment reported a 44% decline in operating profit, due primarily to unfavorable pork operating margins. You may recall that pork operating margins were particularly strong during our first quarter a year ago. Higher raw material costs also negatively impacted margins in our Meat Products group during the quarter. 
Sales for our Refrigerated Foods grew 7% in the quarter, led on the Retail side by Hormel's Sliced Pepperoni, Hormel Country Crock Side Dishes and Hormel Natural Choice deli meats. Foodservice sales were also higher with solid gains from Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, AUSTIN BLUES barbecue products and Caf√© H ethnic products. 
Operating profit at our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment increased 4% on a sales increase of 4% driven primarily by expanded sales of our retail value added products. Sales of our Jennie-O Turkey Store fresh tray pack items and turkey burgers were particularly strong as we continue to benefit from our Make the Switch advertising campaign late last year. We reduced our harvest volumes during the quarter in order to better balance our turkey meat supplies. Export demand also remains strong, supporting dark meat prices during the quarter. 
Our Specialty Foods segment operating profit declined 4% in the quarter as higher raw material and freight cost negatively impact results. Sales by our Specialty Foods segment grew 14% during the quarter led by nutritional products, private label canned meats and gelatin dessert products. 
In our All Other international segment, operating profit grew by 25% on a 17% increase in sales. We enjoyed strong exports of fresh pork and sales growth in our SPAM family of products. We also saw improved results at our Purefoods-Hormel joint venture in the Philippines. 
As we stated in our Fourth Quarter Conference Call, we anticipated a more difficult operating environment in 2012 and for comparisons to be more challenging in the first half and to become more favorable in the back half. We look for pork operating margins to slowly improve as the year proceeds. Grain costs will remain volatile this year, but we expect our team at Jennie-O Turkey Store to continue to do a good job of maintaining margins.
We are optimistic that sales in our Grocery Products segment and our Meat Products group will improve during the remainder of the year as our Hormel and SPAM brand advertising campaigns gear up. We expect our Foodservice Group to build upon their solid start this year as the foodservice industry shows gradual improvement. We are looking for better results from our Specialty Foods segment going forward as sales should continue to grow and the pricing we have implemented takes effect. We also anticipate enhanced operational efficiencies will improve profitability later in the year. We expect continued growth from our International segment, which is benefiting from a positive export environment and from their branding and marketing efforts. Taking all these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2012 earnings guidance range of $1.79 to $1.89 per share. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the first quarter."

Dollar sales for the first quarter totaled $2 billion compared to $1.9 billion last year, a 6% increase. Volume for the first quarter was 1.2 billion pounds, down 2% from fiscal 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were 7.5% of sales, down slightly from 7.6% of sales last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to be between 7.5% and 8% of sales for the entire year. Interest and investment income was $1.6 million for the first quarter compared to $441,000 last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $6.6 million last year. With lower debt levels and decreased interest rates, we expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2012. 
Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 33.4% versus 34.7% in fiscal 2011. For total fiscal 2012, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 264 million. The diluted weighted average numbers of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 270 million. We repurchased 380,000 shares of common stock during the first quarter, spending $11.1 million. We have 3 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. 
Total debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million compared to $350 million last year. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31 million, even with last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $115 million in fiscal 2012. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $29 million compared to $15 million last year. For fiscal 2012, we expect capital expenditures to be about $140 million to $150 million. We will be integrating the sales of Don Miguel Foods, part of our MegaMex Foods joint venture beginning with our fiscal third quarter. Our retail sales force will take responsibility for representing this expanded Mexican foods portfolio and we will report these sales in our Grocery Products segment. Profits will continue to be accounted for, through equity and earnings, in the Grocery Products segment. As a result, added sales from the Don Miguel integration for the second half of 2012 are estimated to be between $75 million and $85 million.

First of all, as many of the companies in the industry have had to push pricing, we certainly could be seeing consumer reaction to the pricing. Typically, over time, as consumers get used to both the new shelf price and new feature price, volumes return to a more normalized level. Secondly, it's really -- in our case, there's certainly is a potential of some -- of a weather effect. The areas where we saw the biggest weakness within Grocery Products were our canned good franchises, which for example, in the prior-year when there was a cold winter throughout the country and people were eating at home more often, we saw quite strong sales and that was where our biggest declines occurred this quarter. Really, if you look at some of the other items within Grocery Products, Compleats were down, but they were only down 3% on a volume basis. MegaMex was up 1% and that's not counting the Don Miguel sales, which as Jody mentioned, in the future will start counting within our total sales starting in the second half. And then lastly, we really have seen a mixed bag in terms of trends. There's no question that in terms of our total groceries results, the kind of tonnage that was delivered was lower than we had hoped. But we had some areas of very strong tonnage within the retail franchise. Our Natural Choice business did great during the quarter, we had good growth in Pepperoni and Country Crock, Jennie-O had big double-digit increases in their tray pack and burger numbers. So if you get away from some of the center aisle areas, we are still seeing very sold volume growth."

We announced first quarter earnings this morning of $0.48 per share, down 13% from a year ago. During the quarter, we experienced weak pork operating margins and soft sales in the center of the store. Nonetheless, our current performance represents the second best quarter in our company's history. In terms of the top line, we generated a sales increase of 6% with gains in 4 out of our 5 business segments. Although total volumes declined 2%, the majority of the decline was due to a planned reduction in harvest levels at our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment. 
As you may recall from our November conference call, we had anticipated a challenging start to 2012. Though our overall results were not surprising, how we got there wasn't exactly as we had planned. Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment performed better than we expected and International turned in a good quarter, while our Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products and Specialty Foods segments did not perform as well as we had anticipated.
I will now take you through each segment. 
For Grocery Products, segment profit decreased 9% on 3% lower sales. These results were prompted by significant input cost inflation and by decreased sales of our core products. We have encountered some sluggishness as consumers adjust to higher prices. Despite these conditions, we are seeing continued growth of our MegaMex product lines. Sales of Don Miguel products and the Wholly Guacamole refrigerated dips registered the biggest growth gain. Sales of our Hormel Compleats microwave meals declined slightly during the quarter as our new advertising campaign and the new product varieties and packaging have not yet been fully implemented at the store level. 
Our Refrigerated Foods segment reported a 44% decline in operating profit, due primarily to unfavorable pork operating margins. You may recall that pork operating margins were particularly strong during our first quarter a year ago. Higher raw material costs also negatively impacted margins in our Meat Products group during the quarter. 
Sales for our Refrigerated Foods grew 7% in the quarter, led on the Retail side by Hormel's Sliced Pepperoni, Hormel Country Crock Side Dishes and Hormel Natural Choice deli meats. Foodservice sales were also higher with solid gains from Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, AUSTIN BLUES barbecue products and Caf√© H ethnic products. 
Operating profit at our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment increased 4% on a sales increase of 4% driven primarily by expanded sales of our retail value added products. Sales of our Jennie-O Turkey Store fresh tray pack items and turkey burgers were particularly strong as we continue to benefit from our Make the Switch advertising campaign late last year. We reduced our harvest volumes during the quarter in order to better balance our turkey meat supplies. Export demand also remains strong, supporting dark meat prices during the quarter. 
Our Specialty Foods segment operating profit declined 4% in the quarter as higher raw material and freight cost negatively impact results. Sales by our Specialty Foods segment grew 14% during the quarter led by nutritional products, private label canned meats and gelatin dessert products. 
In our All Other international segment, operating profit grew by 25% on a 17% increase in sales. We enjoyed strong exports of fresh pork and sales growth in our SPAM family of products. We also saw improved results at our Purefoods-Hormel joint venture in the Philippines. 
As we stated in our Fourth Quarter Conference Call, we anticipated a more difficult operating environment in 2012 and for comparisons to be more challenging in the first half and to become more favorable in the back half. We look for pork operating margins to slowly improve as the year proceeds. Grain costs will remain volatile this year, but we expect our team at Jennie-O Turkey Store to continue to do a good job of maintaining margins.
We are optimistic that sales in our Grocery Products segment and our Meat Products group will improve during the remainder of the year as our Hormel and SPAM brand advertising campaigns gear up. We expect our Foodservice Group to build upon their solid start this year as the foodservice industry shows gradual improvement. We are looking for better results from our Specialty Foods segment going forward as sales should continue to grow and the pricing we have implemented takes effect. We also anticipate enhanced operational efficiencies will improve profitability later in the year. We expect continued growth from our International segment, which is benefiting from a positive export environment and from their branding and marketing efforts. Taking all these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2012 earnings guidance range of $1.79 to $1.89 per share. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the first quarter."

With lower debt levels and decreased interest rates, we expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2012. 
Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 33.4% versus 34.7% in fiscal 2011. For total fiscal 2012, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 264 million. The diluted weighted average numbers of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 270 million. We repurchased 380,000 shares of common stock during the first quarter, spending $11.1 million. We have 3 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. 
Total debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million compared to $350 million last year. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31 million, even with last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $115 million in fiscal 2012. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $29 million compared to $15 million last year. For fiscal 2012, we expect capital expenditures to be about $140 million to $150 million. We will be integrating the sales of Don Miguel Foods, part of our MegaMex Foods joint venture beginning with our fiscal third quarter. Our retail sales force will take responsibility for representing this expanded Mexican foods portfolio and we will report these sales in our Grocery Products segment. Profits will continue to be accounted for, through equity and earnings, in the Grocery Products segment. As a result, added sales from the Don Miguel integration for the second half of 2012 are estimated to be between $75 million and $85 million. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion. Operator?"

First of all, as many of the companies in the industry have had to push pricing, we certainly could be seeing consumer reaction to the pricing. Typically, over time, as consumers get used to both the new shelf price and new feature price, volumes return to a more normalized level. Secondly, it's really -- in our case, there's certainly is a potential of some -- of a weather effect. The areas where we saw the biggest weakness within Grocery Products were our canned good franchises, which for example, in the prior-year when there was a cold winter throughout the country and people were eating at home more often, we saw quite strong sales and that was where our biggest declines occurred this quarter. Really, if you look at some of the other items within Grocery Products, Compleats were down, but they were only down 3% on a volume basis. MegaMex was up 1% and that's not counting the Don Miguel sales, which as Jody mentioned, in the future will start counting within our total sales starting in the second half. And then lastly, we really have seen a mixed bag in terms of trends. There's no question that in terms of our total groceries results, the kind of tonnage that was delivered was lower than we had hoped. But we had some areas of very strong tonnage within the retail franchise. Our Natural Choice business did great during the quarter, we had good growth in Pepperoni and Country Crock, Jennie-O had big double-digit increases in their tray pack and burger numbers. So if you get away from some of the center aisle areas, we are still seeing very sold volume growth."

Sales increased",855,"Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to announce a record quarter for both earnings and sales. Earnings for our second quarter were $0.48 per share, up 20% from a year ago, 4 of 5 segments contributed to these results. Sales increased 3% during the quarter and again, we're up in 4 out of 5 segments. Total volume declined 2% though much of the decline was due to reduced sales of commodity needs in both our Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store segments. This quarter once again demonstrates the benefit of our balanced model, as the strong performances by our Jennie-O Turkey Store and All Other International segments and year-over-year gains by Grocery Products and Specialty Foods more than made up by the softer results by our Refrigerated Foods segment. I will now take you through each segment. For Grocery Products, segment profit increased 10% on a 1% sales increase. We again experienced softness in center of the store sales during Q2, but we did see some improvement in comparison with the first quarter. Sales of our SPAM family of products grew during the quarter, aided by our fresh round of advertising, featuring a new animated character, Sir Camelot. It is noteworthy that this product line is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year and is still growing, both in the U.S. and abroad. Sales of our Compleats microwave meals were soft, along with the category. Our new product packaging and several new product varieties have still not been fully reflected in retail stores. We will continue to advertise our Hormel brand, which features this product line, along with HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE deli meat and Hormel pepperoni. We are pleased with the growth of our MegaMex food product line led by Wholly Guacamole refrigerated dip and Wholly Salsa. We've also rolled out the new varieties of our wholly refrigerated salsas. Our Refrigerated Foods segment reported a 25% decline in operating profit due primarily to unfavorable pork operating margins. The company overall did benefit during the quarter from lower pork raw material cost for our value-added products, benefiting foodservice and meat products within Refrigerated Foods.
Sales for our Refrigerated Foods segment declined 1% in the quarter, reflecting lower sales of commodity pork. The team reduced harvest levels during the quarter in order to limit our exposure to the unfavorable pork operating margin. Sales of retail value added products grew, led by HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE deli meats, Hormel party trays, Hormel sliced pepperoni and DILUSSO deli product. Foodservice sales were also higher, with solid gains from HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE deli meats, caf√© H ethnic products and Hormel premium bacon. Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment had another outstanding quarter, with segment profit -- operating profit up 50% on a sales increase of 7%, driven primarily by expanded sales of our retail value added products. Jennie-O Turkey Store's results also demonstrated efficiency gains throughout its farms, plant and supply chain. Sales of our Jennie-O Turkey Store fresh tray pack items and turkey burgers were particularly strong, as we continue to benefit from our Make the Switch advertising campaign late last year. Our Specialty Foods segment operating profit increased 9% in the quarter as pricing actions taken earlier this year offset higher raw material cost. Sales by our Specialty Foods segment grew 12% during the quarter, led by private label canned meat, ingredient sales and bulk and nutritional products. In our All Other International segment, operating profit grew 52% and sales increased 11% due primarily to strong export to fresh pork products and sales growth in our spam family of products. We also saw improved results at our Purefoods-Hormel joint venture in the Philippines.
As we stated in our fourth quarter conference call last year, we anticipated a more difficult operating environment in 2012 and for comparisons to be more challenging in the first half. Our strong performance in Q2 brings us back to even in terms of earnings per share at the halfway point of the year. Heading into the second half of the year, our Grocery Products, Specialty Foods and International segments are positioned well to contribute solid earnings growth. In particular, we expect continued strong performance from our international team, which is benefiting from a positive export environment and from their branding and marketing efforts.
Their run of gains of Jennie-O Turkey Store has lasted longer than I'd originally anticipated and the recent decline in commodity turkey values coupled with higher grain imports may slow these gains going forward. We do plan on running a new advertising campaign later this year to help drive the continued growth in the sales of our value-added turkey products. We look for our Refrigerated Foods segment to improve in the back half of the year through improved margins and sales of our value-added products, even as pork operating margins remain below typical levels. Taking all of these significant factors into account into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2012 earnings guidance range of $1.79 to $1.89 per share. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen, to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter."

Interest expense for the quarter was $3.3 million compared to $7.2 million last year. For the first half of fiscal 2012, interest expense was $6.5 million compared to $13.8 million a year ago. With lower debt levels and decreased interest rates, we expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2012. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 33.5% versus 33.9% in fiscal 2011. The year-to-date effective tax rate is 33.5% compared to 34.4% last year.
For fiscal 2012, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 33.5% and 34.5%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 264 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 269 million. We repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock during the second quarter spending $31 million. We have 1.9 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $29 million compared to $31 million last year. Year-to-date depreciation and amortization totaled $59.7 million compared to $62.3 million a year ago.
We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $115 million in fiscal 2012. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $28 million compared to $19 million last year. For the first half, capital expenditures were $58 million compared to $36 million last year. For fiscal 2012, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million to $130 million.
As we mentioned last quarter, we integrated the sales of Don Miguel Foods, part of our MegaMex food joint ventures starting with our fiscal third quarter. Our retail sales force has responsibility for representing this expanded Mexican foods portfolio, and we will report these sales in our grocery product segment. Profits will continue to be accounted for through equity and earnings in the Grocery Products segment. As a result, added sales from the Don Miguel integration for the second half of 2012 are estimated to be $80 million to $90 million.
At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator."

We would expect net sales to be up somewhat as pricing -- we've had to take pricing in the past and that will continue to roll through in the second half of the year. In terms of earnings, the year, obviously, has done very well thus far this year. They will be facing more pressure in the form of increased grain costs in the second half and the commodity markets have gone down somewhat in terms of the commodity meat sales. So those will pressure their ability to continue to deliver the very large gains that we've seen thus far. But overall, we think that business is positioned well and with the ad campaign we mentioned and continued spending against the value-added line, we still have a positive outlook for Jennie-O for the remainder of the year."

That being said, both the foodservice and deli side of the business have really been holding their own in a challenging environment, where price often has to be pushed but they really done a nice job of maintaining volume there. In terms of efficiencies, there really are kind of across-the-board, that's by far the most vertical part of our business all the way from breeder hatchery operations to the feed mills and owning our own barns and also partnering with family farms in the area in terms of grow out.

Tied in with that would be viewed are seeing some change in terms of promotional behavior and response, where many retailers would do 10 for 10s, 10 cans for some, $10 et cetera. -- those are not receiving the response that they used to. At least that's been our experience. I think you have a cash-strapped consumer they just like the items but they're just not willing to look in the money at that kind of level so that creates year-over-year comps challenges. We definitely feel that there has at least some weather effect, I would see that, that only make sense with items -- in our case, canned chili, that not so great half. This year's winter has been very benign. The year before was very cold. We lost the food trade food service where people ate at home. In terms of what we're doing to, before day-to-day work before through your organization with the retailers but on top of that, advertising is clearly very important.

We are pleased to announce a record quarter for both earnings and sales. Earnings for our second quarter were $0.48 per share, up 20% from a year ago, 4 of 5 segments contributed to these results. Sales increased",857,"Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to announce a record quarter for both earnings and sales. Earnings for our second quarter were $0.48 per share, up 20% from a year ago, 4 of 5 segments contributed to these results. Sales increased 3% during the quarter and again, we're up in 4 out of 5 segments. Total volume declined 2%, though much of the decline was due to reduced sales of commodity needs in both our Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store segments. 
This quarter once again demonstrates the benefit of our balanced model, as the strong performances by our Jennie-O Turkey Store and All Other International segments and year-over-year gains by Grocery Products and Specialty Foods, more than made up for the softer results by our Refrigerated Foods segment. I will now take you through each segment. 
For Grocery Products, segment profit increased 10% on a 1% sales increase. We again experienced softness in center of the store sales during Q2, but we did see some improvement in comparison with the first quarter. Sales of our SPAM family of products grew during the quarter, aided by our fresh round of advertising, featuring a new animated character, Sir Sir Can-A-Lot. It is noteworthy that this product line is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year and is still growing, both in the U.S. and abroad. Sales of our Compleats microwave meals were soft, along with the category. 
Our new product packaging and several new product varieties have still not been fully reflected in retail stores. We will continue to advertise our Hormel brand, which features this product line, along with Hormel Natural Choice deli meat and Hormel pepperoni. We are pleased with the growth of our MegaMex food product line led by Wholly Guacamole refrigerated dip and [indiscernible] Salsa. We have also rolled out some new varieties of our wholly refrigerated salsas. Our Refrigerated Foods segment reported a 25% decline in operating profit due primarily to unfavorable pork operating margins. The company overall did benefit during the quarter from lower pork raw material cost for our value-added products, benefiting foodservice and meat products within Refrigerated Foods.
Sales for our Refrigerated Foods segment declined 1% in the quarter, reflecting lower sales of commodity pork. The team reduced harvest level during the quarter in order to limit our exposure to the unfavorable pork operating margin. Sales of retail value added products grew, led by Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, Hormel party trays, Hormel sliced pepperoni and our Di Lusso deli products. Foodservice sales were also higher, with solid gains from Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, caf√© H ethnic products and Hormel premium bacon. 
Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment had another outstanding quarter, with segment profit -- operating profit up 50% on a sales increase of 7%, driven primarily by expanded sales of our retail value added products. Jennie-O Turkey Store's results also demonstrate efficiency gains throughout its farms, plant and supply chain. Sales of our Jennie-O Turkey Store fresh tray pack items and turkey burgers were particularly strong, as we continue to benefit from our Make the Switch advertising campaign late last year. 
Our Specialty Foods segment operating profit increased 9% in the quarter as pricing actions taken earlier this year offset higher raw material cost. Sales by our Specialty Foods segment grew 12% during the quarter, led by private label canned meat, ingredient sales and bulk and nutritional products. In our All Other International segment, operating profit grew 52% and sales increased 11%, due primarily to strong export to fresh pork products and sales growth in our SPAM family of products. We also saw improved results at our Purefoods-Hormel joint venture in the Philippines.
As we stated in our fourth quarter conference call last year, we anticipated a more difficult operating environment in 2012 and for comparisons to be more challenging in the first half. Our strong performance in Q2 brings us back to even in terms of earnings per share at the halfway point of the year. Heading into the second half of the year, our Grocery Products, Specialty Foods and International segments are positioned well to contribute solid earnings growth. In particular, we expect continued strong performance from our international team, which is benefiting from a positive export environment and from their branding and marketing efforts.
The run of gains at Jennie-O Turkey Store has lasted longer than I originally anticipated and the recent decline in commodity turkey values, coupled with higher grain imports, may slow these gains going forward. We do plan on running a new advertising campaign later this year to help drive the continued growth in the sales of our value-added turkey products. We look for our Refrigerated Foods segment to improve in the back half of the year through improved margins and sales of our value-added products, even as pork operating margins remain below typical levels. Taking all of these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2012 earnings guidance range of $1.79 to $1.89 per share. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen, to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter."

Dollar sales for the second quarter totaled $2.01 billion compared to $1.96 billion last year, a 3% increase. For the first half, dollar sales increased 4% to $4.05 billion. Volume for the second quarter was 1.2 billion pounds, down 2% from fiscal 2011. Year-to-date, volume was 2.41 billion pounds, down 2% compared to last year. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 7.4% of sales, down from 8.2% last year. Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 7.4% compared to 7.9% last year. SG&A expenses are expected to be around 7.5% of sales for the remainder of the year. Interest and investment income was $2.3 million for the second quarter compared to $2 million last year. Year-to-date, interest in investment income was $3.9 million compared to $2.9 million a year ago.
Interest expense for the quarter was $3.3 million compared to $7.2 million last year. For the first half of fiscal 2012, interest expense was $6.5 million compared to $13.8 million a year ago. With lower debt levels and decreased interest rates, we expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2012. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 33.5% versus 33.9% in fiscal 2011. The year-to-date effective tax rate is 33.5% compared to 34.4% last year.
For fiscal 2012, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 33.5% and 34.5%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 264 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 269 million. We repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock during the second quarter, spending $31 million. We have 1.9 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year. 
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $29 million compared to $31 million last year. Year-to-date depreciation and amortization totaled $59.7 million compared to $62.3 million a year ago. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $115 million in fiscal 2012. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $28 million compared to $19 million last year. For the first half, capital expenditures were $58 million compared to $36 million last year. For fiscal 2012, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million to $130 million.
As we mentioned last quarter, we integrated the sales of Don Miguel Foods, part of our MegaMex Foods joint ventures starting with our fiscal third quarter. Our retail sales force has responsibility for representing this expanded Mexican foods portfolio, and we will report these sales in our Grocery Product segment. Profits will continue to be accounted for through equity and earnings in the Grocery Products segment.  As a result, added sales from the Don Miguel integration for the second half of 2012 are estimated to be $80 million to $90 million.

In terms of earnings, the unit, obviously, has done very well thus far this year. They will be facing more pressure in the form of increased grain costs in the second half and the commodity markets have gone down somewhat in terms of the commodity meat sales. So those will pressure their ability to continue to deliver the very large gains that we've seen thus far.

We probably did a little bit better in the second quarter than I originally anticipated and a little bit worse in the first quarter, with refrigerated experiencing a lot more significant challenges with the processing margin. You identified a couple of things that are certainly watch outs going forward in terms of the pork operating margins are still poor right now. The center store volumes, although improving sequentially, are still not to where we'd like them to be. But we feel we can more than offset those with the positive momentum going on in specialty with our other grocery items, with our Foodservice and meat products, with Jennie-O's branded items.

In terms of efficiencies, there really are kind of across-the-board, that's by far the most vertical part of our business all the way from breeder hatchery operations, to feed mills, to owning our own barns, in many case.

We certainly believe there has been some effect related to pricing, that a lot of manufacturers have been confronted with feeds increases and raw materials that in those types of products that go in the center of the store. And therefore, had to push pricing. And we're no exception to that. So at some point, if you take a couple of rounds of price increases if there's at least some short-term resistance to those level, those could be being reflected. Tied in with that would be, we are seeing a change in terms of promotional behavior and response, where kind of deals that many retailers would do 10 for 10s, 10 cans they're selling for $10, et cetera. But those are just not receiving the response they used to, at least, that's been our experience. I think when you have a cash-strapped consumer, they still like the items, but they're just not willing to load in the pantry at that kind of a level, so that creates year-over-year comp challenges. We definitely feel there has at least some weather effect, I would -- can see that, that only make sense with items that seems to be more general -- like in our case, canned chili, that had a not-so-great half. This year's winter has been very benign. The year before was very cold. A lot of weekend loss to the Foodservice trade where people ate at home. In terms of what we're doing to combat it, a lot of it is just that day-to-day work you do through your sales organization with the retailers. But on top of that, advertising is clearly very important. We're going to be advertising a really wide array of our products during the second half of the year. So on the Hormel side it's -- Compleats will continue to have a campaign, as well as Natural Choice. We'll be advertising SPAM, and SPAM seems to be responding well to it. We even saw that during the second quarter. Jennie-O Turkey Store will have a new campaign and then our MegaMex venture has 3 brands that they advertise.

So that definitely provides some added value in the system where you're still -- a lot of the dark meat is going outside of the United States. So that's a positive. The more years that go by, its from acquisition, I know it's not now been 10, but there's times that you find opportunities to consolidate your facilities, to utilize your raw materials better, to purchase better and so forth. And those have been kind of rolling forward as well through their system."

We are pleased to announce a record quarter for both earnings and sales. Earnings for our second quarter were $0.48 per share, up 20% from a year ago, 4 of 5 segments contributed to these results. Sales increased",855,"Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to announce a record quarter for both earnings and sales. Earnings for our second quarter were $0.48 per share, up 20% from a year ago, 4 of 5 segments contributed to these results. Sales increased 3% during the quarter and again, we're up in 4 out of 5 segments. Total volume declined 2%, though much of the decline was due to reduced sales of commodity meat in both our Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store segments. 
This quarter once again demonstrates the benefit of our balanced model, as the strong performances by our Jennie-O Turkey Store and All Other International segment and year-over-year gains by Grocery Products and Specialty Foods, more than made up for the softer results by our Refrigerated Foods segment. I will now take you through each segment. 
For Grocery Products, segment profit increased 10% on a 1% sales increase. We again experienced softness in center of the store sales during Q2, but we did see some improvement in comparison with the first quarter. Sales of our SPAM family of products grew during the quarter, aided by our fresh round of advertising, featuring a new animated character, Sir Can-A-Lot. It is noteworthy that this product line is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year and is still growing, both in the U.S. and abroad. Sales of our Compleats microwave meals were soft, along with the category. 
Our new product packaging and several new product varieties have still not been fully reflected in retail stores. We will continue to advertise our Hormel brand, which features this product line, along with Hormel Natural Choice deli meat and Hormel pepperoni. We are pleased with the growth of our MegaMex food product line led by Wholly Guacamole refrigerated dip and [indiscernible] Salsa. We have also rolled out some new varieties of our Wholly refrigerated salsas. Our Refrigerated Foods segment reported a 25% decline in operating profit due primarily to unfavorable pork operating margins. The company overall did benefit during the quarter from lower pork raw material cost for our value-added products, benefiting foodservice and meat products within Refrigerated Foods.
Sales for our Refrigerated Foods segment declined 1% in the quarter, reflecting lower sales of commodity pork. The team reduced harvest level during the quarter in order to limit our exposure to the unfavorable pork operating margin. Sales of retail value-added products grew, led by Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, Hormel party trays, Hormel sliced pepperoni and our Di Lusso Deli products. Foodservice sales were also higher, with solid gains from Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, Caf√© H ethnic products and Hormel premium bacon. 
Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment had another outstanding quarter, with segment profit -- operating profit up 50% on a sales increase of 7%, driven primarily by expanded sales of our retail value added products. Jennie-O Turkey Store's results also demonstrate efficiency gains throughout its farms, plant and supply chain. Sales of our Jennie-O Turkey Store fresh tray pack items and turkey burgers were particularly strong, as we continue to benefit from our Make the Switch advertising campaign late last year. 
Our Specialty Foods segment operating profit increased 9% in the quarter as pricing actions taken earlier this year offset higher raw material cost. Sales by our Specialty Foods segment grew 12% during the quarter, led by private label canned meat, ingredient sales and bulk and nutritional products. In our All Other International segment, operating profit grew 52% and sales increased 11%, due primarily to strong exports of fresh pork product and sales growth in our SPAM family of products. We also saw improved results at our Purefoods-Hormel joint venture in the Philippines.
As we stated in our fourth quarter conference call last year, we anticipated a more difficult operating environment in 2012 and for comparisons to be more challenging in the first half. Our strong performance in Q2 brings us back to even in terms of earnings per share at the halfway point of the year. Heading into the second half of the year, our Grocery Products, Specialty Foods and International segments are positioned well to contribute solid earnings growth. In particular, we expect continued strong performance from our international team, which is benefiting from a positive export environment and from their branding and marketing efforts.
The run of gains at Jennie-O Turkey Store has lasted longer than I originally anticipated and the recent decline in commodity turkey values, coupled with higher grain inputs, may slow these gains going forward. We do plan on running a new advertising campaign later this year to help drive the continued growth in the sales of our value-added turkey products. We look for our Refrigerated Foods segment to improve in the back half of the year through improved margins and sales of our value-added products, even as pork operating margins remain below typical levels. Taking all of these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2012 earnings guidance range of $1.79 to $1.89 per share. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen, to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter."

Volume for the second quarter was 1.2 billion pounds, down 2% from fiscal 2011. Year-to-date, volume was 2.41 billion pounds, down 2% compared to last year. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 7.4% of sales, down from 8.2% last year. Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 7.4% compared to 7.9% last year. SG&A expenses are expected to be around 7.5% of sales for the remainder of the year. Interest and investment income was $2.3 million for the second quarter compared to $2 million last year. Year-to-date, interest in investment income was $3.9 million compared to $2.9 million a year ago.
Interest expense for the quarter was $3.3 million compared to $7.2 million last year. For the first half of fiscal 2012, interest expense was $6.5 million compared to $13.8 million a year ago. With lower debt levels and decreased interest rates, we expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2012. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 33.5% versus 33.9% in fiscal 2011. The year-to-date effective tax rate is 33.5% compared to 34.4% last year.
For fiscal 2012, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 33.5% and 34.5%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 264 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 269 million. We repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock during the second quarter, spending $31 million. We have 1.9 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year. 
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $29 million compared to $31 million last year. Year-to-date depreciation and amortization totaled $59.7 million compared to $62.3 million a year ago. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $115 million in fiscal 2012. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $28 million compared to $19 million last year. For the first half, capital expenditures were $58 million compared to $36 million last year. For fiscal 2012, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million to $130 million.
As we mentioned last quarter, we integrated the sales of Don Miguel Foods, part of our MegaMex Foods joint ventures starting with our fiscal third quarter. Our retail sales force has responsibility for representing this expanded Mexican foods portfolio, and we will report these sales in our Grocery Product segment. Profits will continue to be accounted for through equity and earnings in the Grocery Products segment. As a result, added sales from the Don Miguel integration for the second half of 2012 are estimated to be $80 million to $90 million.

Even with that, our numbers year-over-year for the quarter were pretty favorable or down slightly in Korea. We more than made up for that with the rest of the Asian markets and when it comes to fresh pork. And then in terms of some of our partnerships, you correctly referenced the San Miguel Philippine partnership as being very favorable for the quarter. We continue to improve our results in China, albeit it's still not a large contributor to the bottom line, but it's heading in the right direction. So we're comfortable with our Asia focus and it's a combination of pork items, both fresh and processed. And then SPAM is a very important product in the Philippines and Korea or Okinawa.

Yes, I mean, everyone kind of has theories on it. We certainly believe there has been some effect related to pricing, that a lot of manufacturers have been confronted with steep increases in raw materials in the types of products that go center of the store. And that have therefore had to push pricing. And we're no exception to that. So at some point, if you take a couple of rounds of price increases if there's at least some short-term resistance to those levels, those could be being reflected. Tied in with that would be, we are seeing a change in terms of promotional behavior and response, where, say, the kind of deals that many retailers would do 10 for 10s, 10 cans of something for $10, et cetera, that those just are not receiving the response they used to. At least, that's been our experience. I think when you do have a cash-strapped consumer, they still like the items, but they're just not willing to load in the pantry at that kind of a level, so that creates year-over-year comp challenges.

But on top of that, advertising is clearly very important. We're going to be advertising a really wide array of our products during the second half of the year. So on the Hormel side it's -- Compleats will continue to have a campaign, as well as Natural Choice. We'll be advertising SPAM, and SPAM seems to be responding well to it. We even saw that during the second quarter. Jennie-O Turkey Store will have a new campaign and then our MegaMex venture has 3 different brands that they advertise. And MegaMex is still generating positive volume even in this environment."

So I mean we'd love to have the kind of budget where we'd be on all year. And someday maybe we'll work our way up to that, but I'm using it in a prudent fashion.

On the turkey side, internally, our expectation has to be a little bit higher in terms of returns to that business because of the verticality. I mean, we have a lot more capital invested at Jennie-O, and that's what you're hopefully getting for that investment is better overall returns. But clearly, at least for now, we seem to have hit on a good formula of driving efficiencies in the operation, most of which I don't expect to just vanish. I mean these are systemic changes that they have made that should be positive going forward. And then supporting branded differentiated items through advertising and other programs with the retailer that should continue to allow those franchisees to grow. After these couple of years, I mean, I think as we head into 2013, we'll probably assess, okay, is there a new guidance level range for where we would expect Jennie-O to be? But we're still kind of in the middle of this year now and so I don't really have that for you yet."

We are pleased to announce a record quarter for both earnings and sales. Earnings for our second quarter were $0.48 per share, up 20% from a year ago, 4 of 5 segments contributed to these results. Sales increased",855,"Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to announce a record quarter for both earnings and sales. Earnings for our second quarter were $0.48 per share, up 20% from a year ago, 4 of 5 segments contributed to these results. Sales increased 3% during the quarter and again, we're up in 4 out of 5 segments. Total volume declined 2%, though much of the decline was due to reduced sales of commodity meat in both our Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store segments. 
This quarter once again demonstrates the benefit of our balanced model, as the strong performances by our Jennie-O Turkey Store and All Other International segment and year-over-year gains by Grocery Products and Specialty Foods, more than made up for the softer results by our Refrigerated Foods segment. I will now take you through each segment. 
For Grocery Products, segment profit increased 10% on a 1% sales increase. We again experienced softness in center of the store sales during Q2, but we did see some improvement in comparison with the first quarter. Sales of our SPAM family of products grew during the quarter, aided by our fresh round of advertising, featuring a new animated character, Sir Can-A-Lot. It is noteworthy that this product line is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year and is still growing, both in the U.S. and abroad. Sales of our Compleats microwave meals were soft, along with the category. 
Our new product packaging and several new product varieties have still not been fully reflected in retail stores. We will continue to advertise our Hormel brand, which features this product line, along with Hormel Natural Choice deli meat and Hormel pepperoni. We are pleased with the growth of our MegaMex food product line led by Wholly Guacamole refrigerated dip and [indiscernible] Salsa. We have also rolled out some new varieties of our Wholly refrigerated salsas. Our Refrigerated Foods segment reported a 25% decline in operating profit due primarily to unfavorable pork operating margins. The company overall did benefit during the quarter from lower pork raw material cost for our value-added products, benefiting foodservice and meat products within Refrigerated Foods.
Sales for our Refrigerated Foods segment declined 1% in the quarter, reflecting lower sales of commodity pork. The team reduced harvest level during the quarter in order to limit our exposure to the unfavorable pork operating margin. Sales of retail value-added products grew, led by Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, Hormel party trays, Hormel sliced pepperoni and our Di Lusso Deli products. Foodservice sales were also higher, with solid gains from Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, Caf√© H ethnic products and Hormel premium bacon. 
Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment had another outstanding quarter, with segment profit -- operating profit up 50% on a sales increase of 7%, driven primarily by expanded sales of our retail value added products. Jennie-O Turkey Store's results also demonstrate efficiency gains throughout its farms, plant and supply chain. Sales of our Jennie-O Turkey Store fresh tray pack items and turkey burgers were particularly strong, as we continue to benefit from our Make the Switch advertising campaign late last year. 
Our Specialty Foods segment operating profit increased 9% in the quarter as pricing actions taken earlier this year offset higher raw material cost. Sales by our Specialty Foods segment grew 12% during the quarter, led by private label canned meat, ingredient sales and bulk and nutritional products. In our All Other International segment, operating profit grew 52% and sales increased 11%, due primarily to strong exports of fresh pork product and sales growth in our SPAM family of products. We also saw improved results at our Purefoods-Hormel joint venture in the Philippines.
As we stated in our fourth quarter conference call last year, we anticipated a more difficult operating environment in 2012 and for comparisons to be more challenging in the first half. Our strong performance in Q2 brings us back to even in terms of earnings per share at the halfway point of the year. Heading into the second half of the year, our Grocery Products, Specialty Foods and International segments are positioned well to contribute solid earnings growth. In particular, we expect continued strong performance from our international team, which is benefiting from a positive export environment and from their branding and marketing efforts.
The run of gains at Jennie-O Turkey Store has lasted longer than I originally anticipated and the recent decline in commodity turkey values, coupled with higher grain inputs, may slow these gains going forward. We do plan on running a new advertising campaign later this year to help drive the continued growth in the sales of our value-added turkey products. We look for our Refrigerated Foods segment to improve in the back half of the year through improved margins and sales of our value-added products, even as pork operating margins remain below typical levels. Taking all of these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2012 earnings guidance range of $1.79 to $1.89 per share. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen, to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter."

For the first half, capital expenditures were $58 million compared to $36 million last year. For fiscal 2012, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million to $130 million.
As we mentioned last quarter, we integrated the sales of Don Miguel Foods, part of our MegaMex Foods joint ventures starting with our fiscal third quarter. Our retail sales force has responsibility for representing this expanded Mexican foods portfolio, and we will report these sales in our Grocery Product segment. Profits will continue to be accounted for through equity and earnings in the Grocery Products segment. As a result, added sales from the Don Miguel integration for the second half of 2012 are estimated to be $80 million to $90 million.
At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator."

In terms of earnings, the unit, obviously, has done very well thus far this year. They will be facing more pressure in the form of increased grain costs in the second half and the commodity markets have gone down somewhat in terms of the commodity meat sales. So those will pressure their ability to continue to deliver the very large gains that we've seen thus far.

And then for the price of hogs, I'm still mystified as why they continue to drive up in this type of an environment."

Yes, I mean, everyone kind of has theories on it. We certainly believe there has been some effect related to pricing, that a lot of manufacturers have been confronted with steep increases in raw materials in the types of products that go center of the store. And that have therefore had to push pricing. And we're no exception to that. So at some point, if you take a couple of rounds of price increases if there's at least some short-term resistance to those levels, those could be being reflected. Tied in with that would be, we are seeing a change in terms of promotional behavior and response, where, say, the kind of deals that many retailers would do 10 for 10s, 10 cans of something for $10, et cetera, that those just are not receiving the response they used to. At least, that's been our experience. I think when you do have a cash-strapped consumer, they still like the items, but they're just not willing to load in the pantry at that kind of a level, so that creates year-over-year comp challenges. We definitely feel there has at least been some weather effect, I would concede that, that only make sense with items that seem to be more -- like in our case, canned chili, that had a not-so-great half. This year's winter has been very benign. The year before was very cold. A lot of weekends lost to the Foodservice trade where people ate at home. In terms of what we're doing to combat it, a lot of it is just that day-to-day work you do through your sales organization with the retailers. But on top of that, advertising is clearly very important. We're going to be advertising a really wide array of our products during the second half of the year. So on the Hormel side it's -- Compleats will continue to have a campaign, as well as Natural Choice. We'll be advertising SPAM, and SPAM seems to be responding well to it. We even saw that during the second quarter. Jennie-O Turkey Store will have a new campaign and then our MegaMex venture has 3 different brands that they advertise. And MegaMex is still generating positive volume even in this environment."

Natural Choice, for example, is the third Hormel brand that we're advertising. That's sandwich meats mostly, and that's more of a summer item.

On the turkey side, internally, our expectation has to be a little bit higher in terms of returns to that business because of the verticality. I mean, we have a lot more capital invested at Jennie-O, and that's what you're hopefully getting for that investment is better overall returns. But clearly, at least for now, we seem to have hit on a good formula of driving efficiencies in the operation, most of which I don't expect to just vanish. I mean these are systemic changes that they have made that should be positive going forward. And then supporting branded differentiated items through advertising and other programs with the retailer that should continue to allow those franchisees to grow. After these couple of years, I mean, I think as we head into 2013, we'll probably assess, okay, is there a new guidance level range for where we would expect Jennie-O to be?

Among the contributors to sales growth in this segment where our SPAM family of products, HORMEL COMPLEATS microwave meals and our MegaMex portfolio. For the SPAM family of products, our advertising campaign featuring Sir Can-A-Lot, and the publicity around the 75th anniversary has contributed to the nice sales increase. We're pleased to see growth by our HORMEL COMPLEATS microwave meals in Q3. We are in the process of introducing additional new Compleats meals that feature cheesy pasta. We also introduced some other new microwavable items in the quarter, including SPAM meals and Hormel sandwich makers. These new items have performed well in limited market so far. Sales of our Mexican food products continue to grow, led by Wholly Guacamole DIP and by salsas and torteas under the and CHI-CHI'S brands. Segment operating profits for our Refrigerated Foods group increased by 7%, with higher sales of our value-added products were able to offset lower pork operating margins. Sales were flat overall with value-added sales continue to grow.
On the retail side, we enjoyed strong sales of HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE deli meats, HORMEL party trays, HORMEL bacon and HORMEL pepperoni. Foodservice sales were also higher, led by sales of branded products such as Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, Hormel premium hands and premium bacon. The Jennie-O Turkey Store segment had another solid quarter, with segment operating profit up 12% and sales up 7%. Continued growth in sales of value-added products and an improved product mix more than offset higher grain prices and lower commodity meat prices during Q3.
Sales of our Jennie-O Turkey Store retail tray pack fresh turkey and our turkey burgers are still on the rise. We will be building up on last year's highly successful Make the Switch advertising campaign with the new TV commercial this fall. This time featuring turkey bacon and sausage. Longer sales of whole, also aided results this quarter for Jennie-O.
Our Specialty Foods segment had a very good quarter, achieving 18% growth in operating profits on a net sales increase of 11%. Segment profit gains were driven by higher sales of nutritional products, private label canned meats and ingredients.
Our All Other International segment delivered another strong quarter, with segment operating profit of 55% while sales increased 2%. Higher exports of our SPAM family of products and fresh pork were the primary drivers for this segment.
Moving into the fourth quarter, we do anticipate seasonally lower hog costs as we get into fall. Pork operating margins have thankfully, returned to positive territory lately and we expect these margins to remain positive though lower than a year ago during the fourth quarter.
Jennie-O Turkey Store's Q4 margins will be impacted as we cycle in higher grain costs. Our team at Jennie-O will continue to push for value-added sales growth and efficiency improvements in order to mitigate the impact of grain inflation. We also expect strong contributions to our earnings growth from our Grocery Products and International teams based on their solid momentum from the third quarter.
Taking all of these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2012 guidance range of $1.79 to $1.89 per share. The strength of our balanced business model and the vibrancy of our branded value-added portfolio should support continued sales and earnings growth as we close out fiscal 2012. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the third quarter."

We do have to spend money to add onto our plants and buy new technology to support growth as well, as I mentioned in our Jennie-O facility. So I think we've mentioned on past calls, I mean, at some point we're sitting and our cash position is mounting to $1 billion and it's just not going anywhere, then maybe we'll have to make a different assessment as to how we handled our cash management practices. But we're not ready to push that button at this time."

Earnings for the quarter were $0.41 per share, up 14% from earnings of $0.36 a share a year ago. All 5 segments registered gains in segment profit. Total dollar sales topped $2 billion, an increase of 5% over a year ago on solid volume growth of 4%. I will now take you through each segment.
Our Grocery Products team delivered an operating profit increase of 32% and a dollar sales increase of 21% for the third quarter. You may recall that we began including Don Miguel sales in our Grocery Product segment results this past quarter. Sales for Grocery Products grew 3% excluding Don Miguel in the quarter. Among the contributors to sales growth in this segment were our SPAM family of products, Hormel Compleats microwave meals and our MegaMex portfolio. 
For the SPAM family of products, our advertising campaign featuring Sir Can-A-Lot and the publicity around the 75th anniversary has contributed to the nice sales increase. We were pleased to see growth by our Hormel Compleats microwave meals in Q3. We are in the process of introducing additional new Compleats meals that feature cheesy pasta. We also introduced some other new microwavable items in the quarter, including SPAM meals and Hormel sandwich makers. These new items have performed well in limited markets so far. 
Sales of our Mexican food products continue to grow, led by Wholly Guacamole Dip and by salsas and tortillas under both the Herdez and CHI-CHI'S brands. 
Segment operating profit for our Refrigerated Foods group increased by 7%, with higher sales of our value-added products were able to offset lower pork operating margins. Sales were flat overall, but value-added sales continue to grow.
On the retail side, we enjoyed strong sales of Hormel Natural Choice Deli Meats, Hormel party trays, Hormel bacon and Hormel Pepperoni. Foodservice sales were also higher, led by sales of branded products such as Hormel Natural Choice Deli Meats, Hormel premium hams and premium bacon. 
The Jennie-O Turkey Store segment had another solid quarter, with segment operating profit up 12% and sales up 7%. Continued growth in sales of value-added products and an improved product mix more than offset higher grain prices and lower commodity meat prices during Q3. Sales of our Jennie-O Turkey Store retail tray pack fresh turkey and our turkey burgers are still on the rise. We will be building up on last year's highly successful Make The Switch advertising campaign with a new TV commercial this fall, this time featuring turkey bacon and sausage. Stronger sales of whole birds also aided results this quarter for Jennie-O.
Our Specialty Foods segment had a very good quarter, achieving 18% growth in operating profit on a net sales increase of 11%. Segment profit gains were driven by higher sales of nutritional products, private label canned meats and ingredients.
Our All Other international segment delivered another strong quarter, with segment operating profit of 55% while sales increased 2%. Higher exports of our SPAM family of products and fresh pork were the primary drivers for this segment.
Moving into the fourth quarter, we do anticipate seasonally lower hog costs as we get into fall. Pork operating margins have thankfully returned to positive territory lately, and we expect these margins to remain positive though lower than a year ago during the fourth quarter.
Jennie-O Turkey Store's Q4 margins will be impacted as we cycle in higher grain costs. Our team at Jennie-O will continue to push for value-added sales growth and efficiency improvements in order to mitigate the impact of grain inflation. We also expect strong contributions to our earnings growth from our Grocery Products and International teams based on their solid momentum from the third quarter.
Taking all of these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2012 guidance range of $1.79 to $1.89 per share. The strength of our balanced business model and the vibrancy of our branded value-added portfolio should support continued sales and earnings growth as we close out fiscal 2012. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the third quarter."

Volume for the third quarter was 1.2 billion pounds, a 4% increase over fiscal 2011. Year-to-date, volume was 3.6 billion pounds even with last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were 7.2% of sales compared to 8.2% last year.
Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 7.4% compared to 8% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 7.5% of sales for the full year. Interest and investment income was $844,000 for the third quarter compared to $139,000 last year. Year-to-date, interest and investment income was $4.8 million compared to $2.6 million a year ago.
Interest expense for the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $5.6 million last year due to lower debt levels and lower interest rate. Year-to-date, interest expense was $9.7 million compared to $19.4 million last year. We expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2012.
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 33.7% versus 29.3% in fiscal 2011. Last year's tax rate for the third quarter was favorably impacted by the resolution of tax matters with various federal and state tax jurisdictions. Year-to-date, our effective tax rate was 33.5% compared to 33% last year. For fiscal 2012, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 33.5% and 34.5%.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 263 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 269 million shares. We repurchased 302,000 shares of common stock during the third quarter, spending $8.6 million. We have 1.6 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $28.9 million, down from $30.6 million last year. For the 9 months, depreciation and amortization was $88.6 million compared to $92.9 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $115 million for fiscal 2012. Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $36 million compared to $20 million last year. For the 9 months, capital expenditures totaled $94 million compared to $63 million last year.
For fiscal 2012, we expect capital expenditures to be $120 million to $130 million.

We've been able to grow the brand significantly through the advertising campaign. One of the hallmark franchises that is supported by that campaign and has leading position in the marketplace would be our Fresh Product line. Because of the strength of that, we've added on a new line in our Pelican Rapids facility, that's one of the capital investments that Jody was referencing in her earlier comments. And so clearly, we wouldn't have added that line if we didn't think we have significant new business to be able to support that line. On top of that, the team has just done a very good job all across-the-board in terms of driving efficiency gains, whether it's at the farm level, bringing the product into the plant or in through the supply chain.

It doesn't -- at least for our portfolio, it doesn't split neatly into value consumers versus more affluent consumers because we've seen great strength of items that you might consider value items, such as SPAM or initially Hormel chili. But we also have had excellent results from our party trays and Natural Choice items, which are probably aimed at a little bit more premium consumer. Compleats is kind of in the middle in that regard. It's not -- I don't know if it's regarded as an ultra value item nor as a premium item. What we have found is the packaged meal kind of subsegment has been a little bit more of a struggle since the recession began. We've seen that both in Hormel Compleats and in our Hormel Refrigerated Entrees. So the effort then becomes, okay, how do you gain more households and how do you connect more with those items? And so it's a -- for Compleats, it's been a multifaceted approach of new advertising, new package designs, kind of segmenting the line into the red, blue and green varieties, new flavor varieties that some that are already in the market and the others that we're coming out with, such as our new cheesy pasta items. So it's -- the mission is just to keep growing that franchise, and we really don't see any reason why that can't happen. I mean, it still has very low household penetration. It's a convenience item in a convenience world. With our balanced model of being able to deliver both protein and packaged food, we're the ones delivering that simple, one-step product that has the protein component and other components in it. And so we're still very high on the line in the long run, and we're very pleased with the Q3 results."

Just tonight, in fact, we're going to be celebrating the retirement of Bill Burke. We bought the Burke operation 5 years ago. That's been an outstanding addition to our Refrigerated Foods portfolio. We've created our MegaMex venture and made 2 other acquisitions there, the Don Miguel and Wholly Guacamole lines. We added Country Crock to our portfolio of Refrigerated items, and those have all been really great additions. And we -- we're always active in looking in multiple areas for potential things that could fit the growth model of Hormel Foods. But acquisitions, at least from our experience, by their nature, they don't just kind of come when you want them. They can -- tend to come in spurts, you put a lot of feelers out there and up to whether there's a meeting of the minds as to timing and price and a lot of things. So we intend to continue to pursue various ways to grow our business. The acquisitions is one of them, new product innovation is another and we continue to have success there. We do have to spend money to add onto our plants and buy new technology to support growth as well, as I mentioned at our Jennie-O facility. So I think we've mentioned on past calls, I mean, if at some point we're sitting and our cash position is mounting to $1 billion and we're -- and it's just not going anywhere, then maybe we'll have to make a different assessment as to how we've handled our cash management practices.

Earnings for the quarter were $0.41 per share, up 14% from earnings of $0.36 a share a year ago. All 5 segments registered gains in segment profit. Total dollar sales topped $2 billion, an increase of 5% over a year ago on solid volume growth of 4%. I will now take you through each segment.
Our Grocery Products team delivered an operating profit increase of 32% and a dollar sales increase of 21% for the third quarter. You may recall that we began including Don Miguel sales in our Grocery Product segment results this past quarter. Sales for Grocery Products grew 3% excluding Don Miguel in the quarter. Among the contributors to sales growth in this segment were our SPAM family of products, Hormel Compleats microwave meals and our MegaMex portfolio. 
For the SPAM family of products, our advertising campaign featuring Sir Can-A-Lot and the publicity around the 75th anniversary has contributed to the nice sales increase. We were pleased to see growth by our Hormel Compleats microwave meals in Q3. We are in the process of introducing additional new Compleats meals that feature cheesy pasta. We also introduced some other new microwavable items in the quarter, including SPAM meals and Hormel sandwich makers. These new items have performed well in limited markets so far. 
Sales of our Mexican food products continue to grow, led by Wholly Guacamole Dip and by salsas and tortillas under both the Herdez and CHI-CHI'S brands. 
Segment operating profit for our Refrigerated Foods group increased by 7%, with higher sales of our value-added products were able to offset lower pork operating margins. Sales were flat overall, but value-added sales continued to grow.
On the retail side, we enjoyed strong sales of Hormel Natural Choice Deli Meats, Hormel party trays, Hormel bacon and Hormel Pepperoni. Foodservice sales were also higher, led by sales of branded products such as Hormel Natural Choice Deli Meats, Hormel premium hams and premium bacon. 
The Jennie-O Turkey Store segment had another solid quarter, with segment operating profit up 12% and sales up 7%. Continued growth in sales of value-added products and an improved product mix more than offset higher grain prices and lower commodity meat prices during Q3. Sales of our Jennie-O Turkey Store retail tray pack fresh turkey and our turkey burgers are still on the rise. We will be building up on last year's highly successful Make The Switch advertising campaign with a new TV commercial this fall, this time featuring turkey bacon and sausage. Stronger sales of whole birds also aided results this quarter for Jennie-O.
Our Specialty Foods segment had a very good quarter, achieving 18% growth in operating profit on a net sales increase of 11%. Segment profit gains were driven by higher sales of nutritional products, private label canned meats and ingredients.
Our All Other international segment delivered another strong quarter, with segment operating profit up 55% while sales increased 2%. Higher exports of our SPAM family of products and fresh pork were the primary drivers for this segment.
Moving into the fourth quarter, we do anticipate seasonally lower hog costs as we get into fall. Pork operating margins have thankfully returned to positive territory lately, and we expect these margins to remain positive though lower than a year ago during the fourth quarter.
Jennie-O Turkey Store's Q4 margins will be impacted as we cycle in higher grain costs. Our team at Jennie-O will continue to push for value-added sales growth and efficiency improvements in order to mitigate the impact of grain inflation. We also expect strong contributions to our earnings growth from our Grocery Products and International teams based on their solid momentum from the third quarter.
Taking all of these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2012 guidance range of $1.79 to $1.89 per share. The strength of our balanced business model and the vibrancy of our branded value-added portfolio should support continued sales and earnings growth as we close out fiscal 2012. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the third quarter."

Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 7.4% compared to 8% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 7.5% of sales for the full year.

Interest expense for the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $5.6 million last year due to lower debt levels and lower interest rate. Year-to-date, interest expense was $9.7 million compared to $19.4 million last year. We expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2012.
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 33.7% versus 29.3% in fiscal 2011. Last year's tax rate for the third quarter was favorably impacted by the resolution of tax matters with various federal and state tax jurisdictions. Year-to-date, our effective tax rate was 33.5% compared to 33% last year. For fiscal 2012, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 33.5% and 34.5%.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 263 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 269 million shares. We repurchased 302,000 shares of common stock during the third quarter, spending $8.6 million. We have 1.6 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $28.9 million, down from $30.6 million last year. For the 9 months, depreciation and amortization was $88.6 million compared to $92.9 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $115 million for fiscal 2012. Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $36 million compared to $20 million last year. For the 9 months, capital expenditures totaled $94 million compared to $63 million last year.
For fiscal 2012, we expect capital expenditures to be $120 million to $130 million.

They do have excellent momentum in terms of their value-added products, and we expect Q4 to be more similar to Q3 in terms of their operating results."

It doesn't -- at least for our portfolio, it doesn't split neatly into value consumers versus more affluent consumers because we've seen great strength of items that you might consider value items, such as SPAM or initially Hormel chili. But we also have had excellent results from our party trays and Natural Choice items, which are probably aimed at a little bit more premium consumer. Compleats is kind of in the middle in that regard. It's not -- I don't know if it's regarded as an ultra value item nor as a premium item. What we have found is the packaged meal kind of sub-segment has been a little bit more of a struggle since the recession began. We've seen that both in Hormel Compleats and in our Hormel Refrigerated Entrees. So the effort then becomes, okay, how do you gain more households and how do you connect more with those items? And so it's a -- for Compleats, it's been a multifaceted approach of new advertising, new package designs, kind of segmenting the line into the red, blue and green varieties, new flavor varieties that some that are already in the market and the others that we're coming out with, such as our new cheesy pasta items. So it's -- the mission is just to keep growing that franchise, and we really don't see any reason why that can't happen. I mean, it still has very low household penetration. It's a convenience item in a convenience world. With our balanced model of being able to deliver both protein and packaged food, we're the ones delivering the simple, one-step product that has the protein component and other components in it.

One example you probably -- that's been talked about in the marketplace has been a little level -- some level of liquidation on the beef side. So I mean, in the short run, the cost inputs on beef may not be up at all. And so that we wouldn't obviously be then walking in and looking for price increases related to those items until it was needed to be reflecting the cost.

Earnings per share were $0.49, up 14% from a year ago on sales of $2.2 billion, a 3% increase. As another example of our balanced business model and action, we generated segment profit and sales increases in 4 out 5 segments.
For the full year, the company earned $1.86 per share, representing a 7% increase. We provided earnings guidance a year ago on this call where in we said we would earn between $1.79 and $1.89 per share for the year, and I am pleased to report we finished in the upper half of that range. We also exceeded $8 billion in sales for the first time in company history, ultimately reaching $8.2 billion for the full year, up 4%.
I'm also glad to announce that our team was successful in achieving the goal of $2 billion in sales of new products by 2012. All 5 of our segments made significant contributions to reaching this goal.
I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products group contributed significantly to our solid Q4 results with segment profit of 22% and sales up 21%. You may recall that we began including sales of Don Miguel products in our Grocery Products results beginning in the third quarter of this year. Sales for Grocery Products in the quarter grew 3% excluding Don Miguel products.
For the year, segment operating profit was up 12% and sales were up 10%. Excluding the Don Miguel sales, sales were up 1% for the year.
Contributing to our sales growth in the quarter were our MegaMex Food joint venture, our SPAM family of products, Hormel chili and the Hormel bacon toppings. Strong sales of our SPAM family of products were propelled by our advertising campaign featuring Sir Can-A-Lot and the publicity around the 75th anniversary of this product.
In our MegaMex food business, sales gains were led by sauces and foods, Wholly Guacamole refrigerated dips and Don Miguel frozen and refrigerated products.
Sales of our Hormel Compleats microwave meals were somewhat soft in the quarter reflecting a shifted promotional timing. We remain confident that sales will resume going in 2013 as we continue to rollout new products and support them with marketing efforts.
Our Refrigerated Foods segment profit declined 12% with sales down 3%. For the full year, operating profit in this segment was down 22% and sales increased 1%. Sales of our value-added products were not able to fully offset lower pork operating margins in the quarter, grain prices adversely impacted our costs for hogs sourced internally and those contracted under grain-based rollout arrangements. Sales declined on flat volume due to lower commodity meet prices in the quarter.
Nonetheless, our Meat Products group has some solid sales performers in their product portfolio led by Hormel Pepperoni and party trays and Hormel curity one premium hams. We were also pleased to see sales growth of our Hormel refrigerated entr√©es in the quarter.
Our Foodservice Group enjoyed nice contributions from its value-added products led by sales of Hormel Natural Choice Deli Meat, Hormel Always Tender Prepared Pork and premium bacon.
The Jennie-O Turkey Store segment completed a very strong year with a solid quarter. Both segment profit and sales were up 5% during the quarter. For the full year, segment profit was up 16% and sales increased 6%. Results of Jennie-O in Q4 were driven by continued growth in value-added sales and an improved product mix. These more than made up for higher feed costs and lower commodity meat prices during the quarter. Sales increase for Jennie-O in both retail and Foodservice value-added products, led by Jennie-O Turkey Store retail tray pack, turkey bacon and turkey burgers. Our third Make The Switch advertising campaign focused on our new turkey bacon and breakfast sausage.
Our Specialty Food segment had another solid quarter with a segment profit increase of 8% and a sales increase of 7%. Higher sales of canned meats, sauces and broths were the primary drivers of the positive results during the quarter. Full year results for Specialty Foods showed operating profit of 8% on 11% higher sales, with improved year-over-year results for 3 consecutive quarters.
Our international, our All Other segment, capped off an excellent year by posting another good quarter with segment profit up 24% and sales up 1%. Strong export sales to Canada and lower cost for our SPAM family of products drove the positive results. Our China operations also continued to improve. For the full year, operating profit was up 38% and sales were up 7% for our international team.
Moving in to fiscal 2013. We intend to again grow both sales and earnings. We expect our Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products, Specialty Foods and international segments to contribute to the earnings growth. We expect our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment to register an earnings decline due to higher grain costs and tougher comparisons.
Headwinds to our outlook for 2013 include higher grain costs and volatile protein costs and processing margins. We plan on reducing our high risk levels in both our Jennie-O Turkey Store and Refrigerated Food segments by 1% to 2% in order to mitigate our exposure to these higher commodity costs. We will also continue to take strategic and modest price increases where we need them.
On the positive side, we continued to enjoy solid top line momentum with a significant number of our important value-added franchises. For example, we continued strong sales growth of our Jennie-O Turkey Store fresh tray pack, turkey burgers and now turkey bacon should continue in 2013 fueled by our Make The Switch ad campaign and the trend toward eating more nutritious products.
Our Mexican food portfolio has begun to lever to scale and our full range of product offerings in this fast growing category. Our SPAM family of products has great momentum in both the U.S. and abroad. We look for continued strong contributions from Hormel Pepperoni and Hormel party trays as snacking occasions continue to be a big part of the consumer eating landscape.
Hormel Compleats microwave meals should benefit from new products and refreshed advertising. These are just a few of the growth platforms that we believe will contribute to our success in 2013.
We believe our balanced model will continue to smooth out volatility in our earnings stream as evidenced by our track record of increased earnings in 27 of the last 30 years. We feel our innovation and strong brand in niche categories put us in a position to deliver strong results for years to come.
After taking into account all of these significant factors, we have established our fiscal 2013 earnings guidance range at $1.90 to $2 per share.
On previous calls I said I would provide some added color with respect to operating margins in our Jennie-O Turkey start and Grocery Products segments. For Jennie-O, we believe that our range of 11% to 15% can now be considered a normal range. For Grocery Products, given that we are including an increased level of sales by our MegaMex joint venture and recognizing only half of the profits, we believe that a range of 14% to 16% is now reasonable.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012."

Volumes for the fourth quarter was 1.3 billion pounds, up 2% from fiscal 2011. Year-to-date, volume was 4.8 billion pounds flat to last year.
As Jeff mentioned, a portion of our hog costs were directly impacted by rapidly escalating grain costs during the quarter. These include hogs sourced from our Arizona, Colorado and Wyoming sole operations and represent less than 20% of our total hog harvest.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were 7.4% of sales, even with last year.

Year-to-date, interest expense was $12.9 million, down from $22.9 million last year due to lower debt levels and lower interest rates. We expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for 2013. 
Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 33.1% versus 34.3% in fiscal 2011. The year-to-date effective tax rate was 33.4% compared to 33.3% last year. For fiscal 2013, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 33.5% and 34.5%.

Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $30.9 million compared to $31.2 million last year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization was $119 million compared to $124 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $120 million in fiscal 2013.

They've taken pricing where they had to but it's been an environment where that's been a nonstop effort for the last couple of years and we'll continue into 2013.

The team has done a number of things to improve their overall sustainable cost position. We recognized that when you invest in a vertical system I mean you're putting a lot of capital out there and that puts the burden on you to deliver that. But they've done a wonderful job whether it's the hatchery levels, the feed mills, the farm, the basic processing facilities. That's one of the advantages of that acquisition that keeps playing, although we recognize the acquisition itself was a number of years ago, but you continue to find benefits as time goes on. And so we do feel we've lowered our systemic cost per pound, cost per employee. We did an Investor Day presentation a year ago, I know the head of operation showed the year-over-year kind of sale -- employee count decline versus an increase in sales. So that's again something that we do believe is sustainable. And then the key part has been on a value-added sales side. We made major investments in advertising, took a little bit of a gamble than in a category where no one else is advertising and it's driven just big-time double-digit increases in key franchises that our margin accretive to the overall averages of the company. And we now have just really nice outposts for those key products out in the Grocery Store. And as I just mentioned the most recent quarter again they were all up double digits in a lot of key franchises. And we think that momentum is sustainable as well. So those are the 2 major components. And we also talked about our production cut again this year that's a top of our production cut a year before. We've been very disciplined about making sure that we're only creating needs is going to support our value-added items. We're not looking to be a big player in the commodity meat side.

On your second question, well, let me finish in the first question because it kind of ties in terms of pricing. So the Jennie-O teams since its vertically integrated operation already has those costs coming at them. So they've announced price increases on many of their portfolio items and Foodservice, deli and retail already to the trade. In terms of the Hormel side of the equation, so more of the beef and pork based items, we're seeing the same thing you are. There's certainly a possibility of cost increases in the second half of the year. They're not here yet, but we're not announcing current pricing actions of those items or we're going to watch them closely.

And we clearly have moved out a lot of the franchise into higher-level products. So we're in fewer categories and we're relying less in the categories where there's 7 or 8 different competitors, and the products are relatively non-differentiated and instead we're pushing it into innovative items. Items where our brand really plays a major role and so that has been the bigger upgrade at Jennie-O. In terms of Refrigerated, I think the general theme of your question I would agree with. I mean, it clearly is a work in process in that regard. Their operating margins are more in the 5% to 7% range today. They have in the basic pork business, a lot of the commodity elements that pull that down somewhat, some of the more market based products such as fresh pork or raw bacon are also not a huge margin contributors. But we do believe that team over time as they continue to develop and move themselves up that valued add there and the Foodservice and need products area ought to be able to migrate those margins upward.

We provided earnings guidance a year ago on this call wherein we said we would earn between $1.79 and $1.89 per share for the year, and I am pleased to report we finished in the upper half of that range. We also exceeded $8 billion in sales for the first time in company history, ultimately reaching $8.2 billion for the full year, up 4%.
I'm also glad to announce that our team was successful in achieving the goal of $2 billion in sales of new products by 2012. All 5 of our segments made significant contributions to reaching this goal.
I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products group contributed significantly to our solid Q4 results, with segment profit of 22% and sales up 21%. You may recall that we began including sales of Don Miguel products in our Grocery Products results beginning in the third quarter of this year. Sales for Grocery Products in the quarter grew 3% excluding Don Miguel products.
For the year, segment operating profit was up 12% and sales were up 10%. Excluding the Don Miguel sales, sales were up 1% for the year.
Contributing to our sales growth in the quarter were our MegaMex Foods joint venture, our SPAM family of products, Hormel chili and Hormel bacon toppings. Strong sales of our SPAM family of products were propelled by our advertising campaign featuring Sir Can-A-Lot and the publicity around the 75th anniversary of this product.
In our MegaMex Foods business, sales gains were led by Herdez sauces and foods, Wholly Guacamole refrigerated dips and Don Miguel frozen and refrigerated products.
Sales of our Hormel Compleats microwave meals were somewhat soft in the quarter reflecting a shift in promotional timing. We remain confident that sales will resume growing in 2013 as we continue to rollout new products and support them with marketing efforts.
Our Refrigerated Foods segment profit declined 12%, with sales down 3%. For the full year, operating profit in this segment was down 22% and sales increased 1%. Sales of our value-added products were not able to fully offset lower pork operating margins in the quarter. Spike in grain prices adversely impacted our costs for hogs sourced internally and those contracted under grain-based grow-out arrangements. Sales declined on flat volume due to lower commodity meat prices in the quarter.
Nonetheless, our Meat Products group had some solid sales performers in their product portfolio led by Hormel pepperoni and party trays and Hormel Cure 81 premium hams. We were also pleased to see sales growth of our Hormel refrigerated entr√©es in the quarter.
Our Foodservice group enjoyed nice contributions from its value-added products led by sales of Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, Hormel Always Tender prepared pork and premium bacon.
The Jennie-O Turkey Store segment completed a very strong year with a solid quarter. Both segment profit and sales were up 5% during the quarter. For the full year, segment profit was up 16% and sales increased 6%. Results of Jennie-O in Q4 were driven by continued growth in value-added sales and an improved product mix. These more than made up for higher feed costs and lower commodity meat prices during the quarter. Sales increased for Jennie-O in both retail and Foodservice value-added products, led by Jennie-O Turkey Store retail tray pack, turkey bacon and turkey burgers. Our third Make The Switch advertising campaign focused on our new turkey bacon and breakfast sausage.
Our Specialty Foods segment had another solid quarter, with a segment profit increase of 8% and a sales increase of 7%. Higher sales of canned meats, sauces and broths were the primary drivers of the positive results during the quarter. Full year results for Specialty Foods showed operating profit of 8% on 11% higher sales, with improved year-over-year results for 3 consecutive quarters.
Our International or All Other segment capped off an excellent year by posting another good quarter, with segment profit up 24% and sales up 1%. Strong export sales to Canada and lower cost for our SPAM family of products drove the positive results. Our China operations also continued to improve. For the full year, operating profit was up 38% and sales were up 7% for our international team.
Moving in to fiscal 2013. We intend to again grow both sales and earnings. We expect our Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products, Specialty Foods and International segments to contribute to the earnings growth. We expect our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment to register an earnings decline due to higher grain costs and tougher comparisons.
Headwinds to our outlook for 2013 include higher grain costs and volatile protein costs and processing margins. We plan on reducing our high risk levels in both our Jennie-O Turkey Store and Refrigerated Food segments by 1% to 2% in order to mitigate our exposure to these higher commodity costs. We will also continue to take strategic and modest price increases where we need them.
On the positive side, we continue to enjoy solid top line momentum with a significant number of our important value-added franchises. For example, the continued strong sales growth of our Jennie-O Turkey Store fresh tray pack, turkey burgers and now turkey bacon should continue in 2013 fueled by our Make The Switch ad campaign and the trend toward eating more nutritious products.
Our Mexican food portfolio has begun to leverage its scale in our full range of product offerings in this fast growing category. Our SPAM family of products has great momentum in both the U.S. and abroad. We look for continued strong contributions from Hormel pepperoni and Hormel party trays as snacking occasions continue to be a big part of the consumer eating landscape.
Hormel Compleats microwave meals should benefit from new products and refreshed advertising. These are just a few of the growth platforms that we believe will contribute to our success in 2013.
We believe our balanced model will continue to smooth out volatility in our earnings stream as evidenced by our track record of increased earnings in 27 of the last 30 years. We feel our innovation and strong brand in niche categories put us in a position to deliver strong results for years to come.
After taking into account all of these significant factors, we have established our fiscal 2013 earnings guidance range at $1.90 to $2 per share.
On previous calls, I said I would provide some added color with respect to operating margins in our Jennie-O Turkey Store and Grocery Products segments. For Jennie-O, we believe that a range of 11% to 15% can now be considered a normal range. For Grocery Products, given that we are including an increased level of sales by our MegaMex joint venture and recognizing only half of the profits, we believe that a range of 14% to 16% is now reasonable.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012."

Volume for the fourth quarter was 1.3 billion pounds, up 2% from fiscal 2011. Year-to-date, volume was 4.8 billion pounds, flat to last year.
As Jeff mentioned, a portion of our hog costs were directly impacted by rapidly escalating grain costs during the quarter. These include hogs sourced from our Arizona, Colorado and Wyoming sow operations and represent less than 20% of our total hog harvest.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were 7.4% of sales, even with last year. Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 7.4% of sales compared to 7.8% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be between 7% and 7.5% of sales for next year.
Interest and investment income was $1.7 million for the fourth quarter compared to a loss of $3.3 million last year. Year-to-date, interest and investment income was $6.5 million compared to a loss of $786,000 a year ago. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $3.3 million last year. Year-to-date, interest expense was $12.9 million, down from $22.9 million last year due to lower debt levels and lower interest rates. We expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for 2013.
Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 33.1% versus 34.3% in fiscal 2011. The year-to-date effective tax rate was 33.4% compared to 33.3% last year. For fiscal 2013, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 33.5% and 34.5%.
Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 262.9 million and 263.5 million shares, respectively. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 268.1 million and 268.9 million shares respectively. We repurchased 382,000 shares of common stock during the fourth quarter, spending $10.7 million.
For the full year, we spent $61.4 million purchasing 2.1 million shares. We have 1.2 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place.
We announced an $0.08 per share increase to the annual dividend, making the new dividend $0.68. This represents a 13% increase on top of an 18% increase last year and marks the 47th consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend rate.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $30.9 million compared to $31.2 million last year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization was $119 million compared to $124 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $120 million in fiscal 2013. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, the same as last year.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $38 million compared to $41 million last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $132 million compared with $97 million last year. For fiscal 2013, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $130 million to $140 million.

They've taken pricing where they had to, but it's been an environment where that's kind of been a nonstop effort for the last couple of years and will continue into 2013.

The team has done a number of things to improve their overall sustainable cost position. We recognize that when you invest in a vertical system, I mean you're putting a lot of capital out there and that puts the burden on you to deliver that. But they've done a wonderful job, whether it's the hatchery levels, the feed mills, the farms, the basic processing facilities. That's one of the advantages of that acquisition that keeps playing out, although we recognize the acquisition itself was a number of years ago but you continue to find benefits as time goes on. And so we do feel we've lowered our systemic cost per pound, cost per employee. We did an Investor Day presentation a year ago. I know the head of operations showed the year-over-year kind of sale -- the employee count decline versus an increase in sales. So that's again something that we do believe is sustainable. And then the key part has been on the value-added sales side. We made major investments in advertising, took a little bit of a gamble on that, in a category where no one else is advertising. And it's driven just big-time double-digit increases in key franchises that are margin accretive to the overall average of the company. And we now have just really nice outposts for those key products in retailers throughout the grocery store. And as I just mentioned, the can I mean, the most recent quarter again they were all up double digits, a lot of those key franchises. So we think that momentum is sustainable as well. And so those are the 2 major components. And then we also talked about our production cut again this year that's on top of our production cut a year before. We've been very disciplined about making sure that we're only creating needs that's going to support our value-added items. We're not looking to be a big player in the commodity meat side.

But clearly, when you look at what the core grains have gone up post drought, I mean, it's certainly a significant amount of money. On your second question -- well, let me finish on the first question because it kind of ties in terms of pricing. So the Jennie-O team, since it's a vertically integrated operation, already has those costs coming at them. So they've announced price increases on many of their portfolio items in Foodservice deli and retail already to the trade. In terms of the Hormel side of the equation, so more of the beef- and pork-based items, we're seeing the same thing you are which is there's certainly a possibility of cost increases in the second half of the year. They're not here yet. But we're not announcing current pricing actions on those items, we're going to watch them closely. And so that may well be something that the team has to have as part of their reactions during the second half of the year.

We've been on a dollar sales basis in that kind of mid to high 70% range for a time. But we always talk about the value ladder in the different steps. And we clearly have moved up a lot of the franchise into higher-level products. So we're in fewer categories and are relying less on the categories where there's 7 or 8 different competitors and the products are relatively non-differentiated. And instead, we're pushing it into innovative items, items where our brand really plays a major role. And so that has been the bigger upgrade at Jennie-O. In terms of Refrigerated, I think the general theme of your question I would agree with. I mean, it clearly is a work in process in that regard. Their operating margins are more on the 5% to 7% range today. They have in the basic pork business, although there's a lot of the commodity elements that pull that down somewhat, some of the more market-based products such as fresh pork or raw bacon are also not huge margin contributors. But we do believe that team over time, as they continue to develop and move themselves up that value ladder in the Foodservice and meat products area ought to be able to migrate those margins upward.

And then the International teams had some as well. So it's going to be a key driver for us going forward. In terms of Compleats specifically, absolutely, we rolled out at Investor Day about 1.5 years ago the new color scheme and the fact that we're going to have more Cafe Creations blue line of Compleats and a relaunch of the green line, the more health-oriented items within the line. This fall has now seen the introduction of what we're calling our cheesy pasta type items. So mac and cheese and then other items that utilize the new technology that we put in place in our Dubuque, Iowa plant to really upgrade the quality of those items. They will be a feature of our advertising campaign in 2013 for the Hormel Compleats brand. And so our early read on the sales results is quite strong.

Earnings per share were $0.49, up 14% from a year ago, on sales of $2.2 billion, a 3% increase. As another example of our balanced business model in action, we generated segment profit and sales increases in 4 out of 5 segments.
For the full year, the company earned $1.86 per share, representing a 7% increase. We provided earnings guidance a year ago on this call wherein we said we would earn between $1.79 and $1.89 per share for the year, and I am pleased to report we finished in the upper half of that range. We also exceeded $8 billion in sales for the first time in company history, ultimately reaching $8.2 billion for the full year, up 4%.
I am also glad to announce that our team was successful in achieving the goal of $2 billion in sales of new products by 2012. All 5 of our segments made significant contributions to reaching this goal.
I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products group contributed significantly to our solid Q4 results, with segment profit up 22% and sales up 21%. You may recall that we began including sales of Don Miguel products in our Grocery Products results beginning in the third quarter of this year. Sales for Grocery Products in the quarter grew 3% excluding Don Miguel products.
For the year, segment operating profit was up 12% and sales were up 10%. Excluding the Don Miguel sales, sales were up 1% for the year.
Contributing to our sales growth in the quarter were our MegaMex Foods joint venture, our SPAM family of products, Hormel chili and Hormel bacon toppings. Strong sales of our SPAM family of products were propelled by our advertising campaign featuring Sir Can-A-Lot and the publicity around the 75th anniversary of this product.
In our MegaMex Foods business, sales gains were led by Herdez sauces and foods, Wholly Guacamole refrigerated dips and Don Miguel frozen and refrigerated products.
Sales of our Hormel Compleats microwave meals were somewhat soft in the quarter reflecting a shift in promotional timing. We remain confident that sales will resume growing in 2013 as we continue to rollout new products and support them with marketing efforts.
Our Refrigerated Foods segment profit declined 12%, with sales down 3%. For the full year, operating profit in this segment was down 22% and sales increased 1%. Sales of our value-added products were not able to fully offset lower pork operating margins in the quarter. Spiking grain prices adversely impacted our costs for hogs sourced internally and those contracted under grain-based grow-out arrangements. Sales declined on flat volume due to lower commodity meat prices in the quarter.
Nonetheless, our Meat Products group had some solid sales performers in their product portfolio, led by Hormel pepperoni and party trays and Hormel Cure 81 premium hams. We were also pleased to see sales growth of our Hormel refrigerated entr√©es in the quarter.
Our Foodservice group enjoyed nice contributions from its value-added products, led by sales of Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, Hormel Always Tender prepared pork and premium bacon.
Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment completed a very strong year with a solid quarter. Both segment profit and sales were up 5% during the quarter. For the full year, segment profit was up 16% and sales increased 6%. Results of Jennie-O in Q4 were driven by continued growth in value-added sales and an improved product mix. These more than made up for higher feed costs and lower commodity meat prices during the quarter. Sales increased for Jennie-O in both retail and Foodservice value-added products, led by Jennie-O Turkey Store retail tray pack, turkey bacon and turkey burgers. Our third Make The Switch advertising campaign focused on our new turkey bacon and breakfast sausage.
Our Specialty Foods segment had another solid quarter, with a segment profit increase of 8% and a sales increase of 7%. Higher sales of canned meats, sauces and broths were the primary drivers of the positive results during the quarter. Full year results for Specialty Foods showed operating profit up 8% on 11% higher sales, with improved year-over-year results for 3 consecutive quarters.
Our International or All Other segment capped off an excellent year by posting another good quarter, with segment profit up 24% and sales up 1%. Strong export sales to Canada and lower costs for our SPAM family of products drove the positive results. Our China operations also continued to improve. For the full year, operating profit was up 38% and sales were up 7% for our international team.
Moving into fiscal 2013, we intend to again grow both sales and earnings. We expect our Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products, Specialty Foods and International segments to contribute to the earnings growth. We expect our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment to register an earnings decline due to higher grain costs and tougher comparisons.
Headwinds to our outlook for 2013 include higher grain costs and volatile protein costs and processing margins. We plan on reducing our harvest levels in both our Jennie-O Turkey Store and Refrigerated Food segments by 1% to 2% in order to mitigate our exposure to these higher commodity costs. We will also continue to take strategic and modest price increases where we need them.
On the positive side, we continue to enjoy solid top line momentum, with a significant number of our important value-added franchises. For example, the continued strong sales growth of our Jennie-O Turkey Store fresh tray pack, turkey burgers and now turkey bacon should continue in 2013, fueled by our Make The Switch ad campaign and the trend toward eating more nutritious products.
Our Mexican food portfolio has begun to leverage its scale and our full range of product offerings in this fast-growing category. Our SPAM family of products has great momentum in both the U.S. and abroad. We look for continued strong contributions from Hormel pepperoni and Hormel party trays as snacking occasions continue to be a big part of the consumer eating landscape.
Hormel Compleats microwave meals should benefit from new products and refreshed advertising. These are just a few of the growth platforms that we believe will contribute to our success in 2013.
We believe our balanced model will continue to smooth out volatility in our earnings stream as evidenced by our track record of increased earnings in 27 of the last 30 years. We feel our innovation and strong brands in niche categories put us in a position to deliver strong results for years to come.
After taking into account all of these significant factors, we have established our fiscal 2013 earnings guidance range at $1.90 to $2 per share.
On previous calls, I said I would provide some added color with respect to operating margins in our Jennie-O Turkey Store and Grocery Products segments. For Jennie-O, we believe that a range of 11% to 15% can now be considered a normal range. For Grocery Products, given that we are including an increased level of sales by our MegaMex joint venture and recognizing only 1/2 of the profits, we believe that a range of 14% to 16% is now reasonable.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012."

Net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 totaled $132.6 million or $0.49 per share compared to $117.3 million or $0.43 a share a year ago. Net earnings for the full year totaled $500.1 million or $1.86 per share compared to net earnings of $474.2 million or $1.74 per share a year ago.
Dollar sales for the fourth quarter totaled $2.2 billion compared to $2.1 billion last year, a 3% increase. For the full year, dollar sales were $8.2 billion, a 4% increase from last year.
Volume for the fourth quarter was 1.3 billion pounds, up 2% from fiscal 2011. Year-to-date, volume was 4.8 billion pounds, flat to last year.
As Jeff mentioned, a portion of our hog costs were directly impacted by rapidly escalating grain costs during the quarter. These include hogs sourced from our Arizona, Colorado and Wyoming sow operations and represent less than 20% of our total hog harvest.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were 7.4% of sales, even with last year. Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 7.4% of sales compared to 7.8% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be between 7% and 7.5% of sales for next year.
Interest and investment income was $1.7 million for the fourth quarter compared to a loss of $3.3 million last year. Year-to-date, interest and investment income was $6.5 million compared to a loss of $786,000 a year ago. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $3.3 million last year. Year-to-date, interest expense was $12.9 million, down from $22.9 million last year due to lower debt levels and lower interest rates. We expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for 2013.
Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 33.1% versus 34.3% in fiscal 2011. The year-to-date effective tax rate was 33.4% compared to 33.3% last year. For fiscal 2013, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 33.5% and 34.5%.
Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 262.9 million and 263.5 million shares, respectively. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 268.1 million and 268.9 million shares respectively. We repurchased 382,000 shares of common stock during the fourth quarter, spending $10.7 million.
For the full year, we spent $61.4 million purchasing 2.1 million shares. We have 1.2 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place.
We announced an $0.08 per share increase to the annual dividend, making the new dividend $0.68. This represents a 13% increase on top of an 18% increase last year and marks the 47th consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend rate.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $30.9 million compared to $31.2 million last year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization was $119 million compared to $124 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $120 million in fiscal 2013. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, the same as last year.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $38 million compared to $41 million last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $132 million compared with $97 million last year. For fiscal 2013, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $130 million to $140 million.

And to us really, a lot of it really does relate back to the grain and the input costs. We've -- our team's done a good job at mitigating a lot of those costs. They've taken pricing where they've had to, but it's been an environment where that's kind of been a nonstop effort for the last couple of years and will continue into 2013. The underlying health of the franchises, though, to me is very robust. And so I'm quite optimistic that our long-term goals remain very reachable, even at the current size we are as a company, having now reached $8 billion."

The Mexican portfolio is doing very well across the board, a 5% increase not counting Don Miguel, not counting the Wholly franchise, and those are both growing as well. Our Foodservice group is having good luck. They've had their most successful new product launch in their history with one of their new premium bacon items, and they continue to also grow within their ethnic items, such as Caf√© H and their Natural Choice-based items. Jennie-O had solid double-digit growth in fresh tray pack and burgers and in bacon, the latter supported by their ad campaign. So we're really excited, and that's not counting International either which has delivered 2 terrific years in a row.

So one on the cost side; the team has done a number of things to improve their overall sustainable cost position. We recognize that when you invest in a vertical system, I mean you're putting a lot of capital out there and that puts the burden on you to deliver that. But they've done a wonderful job, whether it's the hatchery levels, the feed mills, the farms, the basic processing facilities. That's one of the advantages of that acquisition that keeps playing out, although we recognize the acquisition itself was a number of years ago, but you continue to find benefits as time goes on. And so we do feel we've lowered our systemic kind of cost per pound, cost per employee. We did an Investor Day presentation a year ago. I know the head of operations showed the year-over-year kind of sale -- the employee count decline versus an increase in sales. So that's again something that we do believe is sustainable. And then on -- the key part has been on the value-added sales side. We made major investments in advertising, took a little bit of a gamble on that, in a category where no one else was advertising. And it's driven just big-time double-digit increases in key franchises that are margin accretive to the overall average of the company. And we now have just really nice outposts for those key products in retailers throughout the grocery store. And as I just mentioned, again, I mean, the most recent quarter, again they were all up double digits, a lot of those key franchises. So we think that momentum is sustainable as well. And so those are the 2 major components. And then we also talked about our production cut again this year; that's on top of our production cut the year before. We've been very disciplined about making sure that we're only creating meat that's going to support our value-added items. We're not looking to be a big player in the commodity meat side.

But clearly, when you look at what the core grains have gone up post drought, I mean, it's certainly a significant amount of money. On your second question -- well, I mean, let me finish on the first question because it kind of ties in terms of pricing. So the Jennie-O team, since it's a vertically integrated operation, already has those costs coming at them. And so they've announced price increases on many of their portfolio items in Foodservice deli and retail already to the trade. In terms of the Hormel side of the equation, so more of the beef- and pork-based items, we're seeing the same thing you are, which is that there's certainly a possibility of cost increases in the second half of the year. They're not here yet, so we're not announcing current pricing actions on those items. But we're going to watch them closely. And so that may well be something that the team has to have as part of their reactions during the second half of the year.

And we clearly have moved up a lot of the franchise into higher-level products. So we're in fewer categories and are relying less on the categories where there's 7 or 8 different competitors and the products are relatively non-differentiated. And instead, we're pushing it into innovative items, items where our brand really plays a major role. And so that has been the bigger upgrade at Jennie-O. In terms of Refrigerated, I think the general theme of your question I would agree with. I mean, it clearly is a work in process in that regard. Their operating margins are more on the 5% to 7% range today. They have -- in the basic pork business, although there's a lot of the commodity elements that pull that down somewhat, some of the more market-based products such as fresh pork or raw bacon are also not huge margin contributors. But we do believe that team over time, as they continue to develop and move themselves up that value ladder in the Foodservice and meat products area ought to be able to migrate those margins upward.

And so that holds your volume down, but ultimately, is the right thing to do with that franchise. But I cited a number of the brand-by-brand examples to one of the earlier questions.

Earnings per share were $0.49, up 14% from a year ago, on sales of $2.2 billion, a 3% increase. As another example of our balanced business model in action, we generated segment profit and sales increases in 4 out of 5 segments.
For the full year, the company earned $1.86 per share, representing a 7% increase. We provided earnings guidance a year ago on this call wherein we said we would earn between $1.79 and $1.89 per share for the year, and I am pleased to report we finished in the upper half of that range. We also exceeded $8 billion in sales for the first time in company history, ultimately reaching $8.2 billion for the full year, up 4%.
I am also glad to announce that our team was successful in achieving the goal of $2 billion in sales of new products by 2012. All 5 of our segments made significant contributions to reaching this goal.
I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products group contributed significantly to our solid Q4 results, with segment profit up 22% and sales up 21%. You may recall that we began including sales of Don Miguel products in our Grocery Products results beginning in the third quarter of this year. Sales for Grocery Products in the quarter grew 3% excluding Don Miguel products.
For the year, segment operating profit was up 12% and sales were up 10%. Excluding the Don Miguel sales, sales were up 1% for the year.
Contributing to our sales growth in the quarter were our MegaMex Foods joint venture, our SPAM family of products, Hormel chili and Hormel bacon toppings. Strong sales of our SPAM family of products were propelled by our advertising campaign featuring Sir Can-A-Lot and the publicity around the 75th anniversary of this product.
In our MegaMex Foods business, sales gains were led by Herdez sauces and foods, Wholly Guacamole refrigerated dips and Don Miguel frozen and refrigerated products.
Sales of our Hormel Compleats microwave meals were somewhat soft in the quarter reflecting a shift in promotional timing. We remain confident that sales will resume growing in 2013 as we continue to rollout new products and support them with marketing efforts.
Our Refrigerated Foods segment profit declined 12%, with sales down 3%. For the full year, operating profit in this segment was down 22% and sales increased 1%. Sales of our value-added products were not able to fully offset lower pork operating margins in the quarter. Spiking grain prices adversely impacted our costs for hogs sourced internally and those contracted under grain-based grow-out arrangements. Sales declined on flat volume due to lower commodity meat prices in the quarter.
Nonetheless, our Meat Products group had some solid sales performers in their product portfolio, led by Hormel pepperoni and party trays and Hormel Cure 81 premium hams. We were also pleased to see sales growth of our Hormel refrigerated entr√©es in the quarter.
Our Foodservice group enjoyed nice contributions from its value-added products, led by sales of Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, Hormel Always Tender prepared pork and premium bacon.
Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment completed a very strong year with a solid quarter. Both segment profit and sales were up 5% during the quarter. For the full year, segment profit was up 16% and sales increased 6%. Results of Jennie-O in Q4 were driven by continued growth in value-added sales and an improved product mix. These more than made up for higher feed costs and lower commodity meat prices during the quarter. Sales increased for Jennie-O in both retail and Foodservice value-added products, led by Jennie-O Turkey Store retail tray pack, turkey bacon and turkey burgers. Our third Make The Switch advertising campaign focused on our new turkey bacon and breakfast sausage.
Our Specialty Foods segment had another solid quarter, with a segment profit increase of 8% and a sales increase of 7%. Higher sales of canned meats, sauces and broths were the primary drivers of the positive results during the quarter. Full year results for Specialty Foods showed operating profit up 8% on 11% higher sales, with improved year-over-year results for 3 consecutive quarters.
Our International or All Other segment capped off an excellent year by posting another good quarter, with segment profit up 24% and sales up 1%. Strong export sales to Canada and lower costs for our SPAM family of products drove the positive results. Our China operations also continued to improve. For the full year, operating profit was up 38% and sales were up 7% for our international team.
Moving into fiscal 2013, we intend to again grow both sales and earnings. We expect our Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products, Specialty Foods and International segments to contribute to the earnings growth. We expect our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment to register an earnings decline due to higher grain costs and tougher comparisons.
Headwinds to our outlook for 2013 include higher grain costs and volatile protein costs and processing margins. We plan on reducing our harvest levels in both our Jennie-O Turkey Store and Refrigerated Food segments by 1% to 2% in order to mitigate our exposure to these higher commodity costs. We will also continue to take strategic and modest price increases where we need them.
On the positive side, we continue to enjoy solid top line momentum, with a significant number of our important value-added franchises. For example, the continued strong sales growth of our Jennie-O Turkey Store fresh tray pack, turkey burgers and now turkey bacon should continue in 2013, fueled by our Make The Switch ad campaign and the trend toward eating more nutritious products.
Our Mexican food portfolio has begun to leverage its scale and our full range of product offerings in this fast-growing category. Our SPAM family of products has great momentum in both the U.S. and abroad. We look for continued strong contributions from Hormel pepperoni and Hormel party trays as snacking occasions continue to be a big part of the consumer eating landscape.
Hormel Compleats microwave meals should benefit from new products and refreshed advertising. These are just a few of the growth platforms that we believe will contribute to our success in 2013.
We believe our balanced model will continue to smooth out volatility in our earnings stream as evidenced by our track record of increased earnings in 27 of the last 30 years. We feel our innovation and strong brands in niche categories put us in a position to deliver strong results for years to come.
After taking into account all of these significant factors, we have established our fiscal 2013 earnings guidance range at $1.90 to $2 per share.
On previous calls, I said I would provide some added color with respect to operating margins in our Jennie-O Turkey Store and Grocery Products segments. For Jennie-O, we believe that a range of 11% to 15% can now be considered a normal range. For Grocery Products, given that we are including an increased level of sales by our MegaMex joint venture and recognizing only half of the profits, we believe that a range of 14% to 16% is now reasonable.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012."

Net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 totaled $132.6 million or $0.49 per share compared to $117.3 million or $0.43 a share a year ago. Net earnings for the full year totaled $500.1 million or $1.86 per share compared to net earnings of $474.2 million or $1.74 per share a year ago.
Dollar sales for the fourth quarter totaled $2.2 billion compared to $2.1 billion last year, a 3% increase. For the full year, dollar sales were $8.2 billion, a 4% increase from last year.
Volume for the fourth quarter was 1.3 billion pounds, up 2% from fiscal 2011. Year-to-date, volume was 4.8 billion pounds, flat to last year.
As Jeff mentioned, a portion of our hog costs were directly impacted by rapidly escalating grain costs during the quarter. These include hogs sourced from our Arizona, Colorado and Wyoming sow operations and represent less than 20% of our total hog harvest.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were 7.4% of sales, even with last year. Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 7.4% of sales compared to 7.8% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be between 7% and 7.5% of sales for next year.
Interest and investment income was $1.7 million for the fourth quarter compared to a loss of $3.3 million last year. Year-to-date, interest and investment income was $6.5 million compared to a loss of $786,000 a year ago. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $3.3 million last year. Year-to-date, interest expense was $12.9 million, down from $22.9 million last year due to lower debt levels and lower interest rates. We expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for 2013.
Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 33.1% versus 34.3% in fiscal 2011. The year-to-date effective tax rate was 33.4% compared to 33.3% last year. For fiscal 2013, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 33.5% and 34.5%.
Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 262.9 million and 263.5 million shares, respectively. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 268.1 million and 268.9 million shares respectively. We repurchased 382,000 shares of common stock during the fourth quarter, spending $10.7 million.
For the full year, we spent $61.4 million purchasing 2.1 million shares. We have 1.2 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place.
We announced an $0.08 per share increase to the annual dividend, making the new dividend $0.68. This represents a 13% increase on top of an 18% increase last year and marks the 47th consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend rate.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $30.9 million compared to $31.2 million last year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization was $119 million compared to $124 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $120 million in fiscal 2013. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, the same as last year.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $38 million compared to $41 million last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $132 million compared with $97 million last year. For fiscal 2013, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $130 million to $140 million.

And to us really, a lot of it really does relate back to the grain and the input costs. We've -- our team's done a good job at mitigating a lot of those costs. They've taken pricing where they've had to, but it's been an environment where that's kind of been a nonstop effort for the last couple of years and will continue into 2013. The underlying health of the franchises, though, to me is very robust. And so I'm quite optimistic that our long-term goals remain very reachable, even at the current size we are as a company, having now reached $8 billion."

The Mexican portfolio is doing very well across the board, a 5% increase not counting Don Miguel, not counting the Wholly franchise, and those are both growing as well. Our Foodservice group is having good luck. They've had their most successful new product launch in their history with one of their new premium bacon items, and they continue to also grow within their ethnic items, such as Caf√© H and their Natural Choice-based items. Jennie-O had solid double-digit growth in fresh tray pack and burgers and in bacon, the latter supported by their ad campaign. So we're really excited, and that's not counting International either which has delivered 2 terrific years in a row.

So one on the cost side; the team has done a number of things to improve their overall sustainable cost position. We recognize that when you invest in a vertical system, I mean you're putting a lot of capital out there and that puts the burden on you to deliver that. But they've done a wonderful job, whether it's the hatchery levels, the feed mills, the farms, the basic processing facilities. That's one of the advantages of that acquisition that keeps playing out, although we recognize the acquisition itself was a number of years ago, but you continue to find benefits as time goes on. And so we do feel we've lowered our systemic kind of cost per pound, cost per employee. We did an Investor Day presentation a year ago. I know the head of operations showed the year-over-year kind of sale -- the employee count decline versus an increase in sales. So that's again something that we do believe is sustainable. And then on -- the key part has been on the value-added sales side. We made major investments in advertising, took a little bit of a gamble on that, in a category where no one else was advertising. And it's driven just big-time double-digit increases in key franchises that are margin accretive to the overall average of the company. And we now have just really nice outposts for those key products in retailers throughout the grocery store. And as I just mentioned, again, I mean, the most recent quarter, again they were all up double digits, a lot of those key franchises. So we think that momentum is sustainable as well. And so those are the 2 major components. And then we also talked about our production cut again this year; that's on top of our production cut the year before. We've been very disciplined about making sure that we're only creating meat that's going to support our value-added items. We're not looking to be a big player in the commodity meat side.

But clearly, when you look at what the core grains have gone up post drought, I mean, it's certainly a significant amount of money. On your second question -- well, I mean, let me finish on the first question because it kind of ties in terms of pricing. So the Jennie-O team, since it's a vertically integrated operation, already has those costs coming at them. And so they've announced price increases on many of their portfolio items in Foodservice deli and retail already to the trade. In terms of the Hormel side of the equation, so more of the beef- and pork-based items, we're seeing the same thing you are, which is that there's certainly a possibility of cost increases in the second half of the year. They're not here yet, so we're not announcing current pricing actions on those items. But we're going to watch them closely. And so that may well be something that the team has to have as part of their reactions during the second half of the year.

We've been on a dollar sales basis in that kind of mid to high 70% range for a time. But we always talk about the value ladder and the different steps. And we clearly have moved up a lot of the franchise into higher-level products. So we're in fewer categories and are relying less on the categories where there's 7 or 8 different competitors and the products are relatively non-differentiated. And instead, we're pushing it into innovative items, items where our brand really plays a major role. And so that has been the bigger upgrade at Jennie-O. In terms of Refrigerated, I think the general theme of your question I would agree with. I mean, it clearly is a work in process in that regard. Their operating margins are more on the 5% to 7% range today. They have -- in the basic pork business, although there's a lot of the commodity elements that pull that down somewhat, some of the more market-based products such as fresh pork or raw bacon are also not huge margin contributors. But we do believe that team over time, as they continue to develop and move themselves up that value ladder in the Foodservice and meat products area ought to be able to migrate those margins upward.

And so that holds your volume down, but ultimately, is the right thing to do with that franchise. But I cited a number of the brand-by-brand examples to one of the earlier questions.
